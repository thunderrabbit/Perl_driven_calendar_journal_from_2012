<h3>prophecies regarding meditation</h3>

<p>Revealed in a vision of the future, Rob the Faithful was given this message during a brief mental
insight inspired directly by the epp.</p>

<pre>And ye, let it be known, the creator will find great and greater good in daily meditation, and
will increase the daily requirements for the good of the mind who does obey.</pre>

<p>Some minutes later, a poetic version giving indication that an hour of meditation may be required.</p>

<pre>
on meditation each morning
let this be a warning
ten minutes is good
one hour you should
know newer rules are forming
</pre>
