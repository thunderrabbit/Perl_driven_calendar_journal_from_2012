<h1><span alt="Rob's Own Brand Of Traditions"><a href="index.shtml">R.O.B.O.T.</a> Mythology</span></h1>

<p>In the beginning, there was no beginning, for all that will ever be already is, and all that has
ever been continues to be.  There is only the ever present present.  The ever present present refers
neither to itself nor to itsnot, for any utterance from ever present present pervades all that
appears to exist, and all that seems to not.</p>

<p>But within Third Density the ever present present is perceived differently.  We participants in
Third Density see ourselves as separate from the ever present present.  We see ourselves as myriad
individuals scattered within an incomprehensibly vast nothingness.</p>

<p>For example, many humans on what we call Earth perceive themselves as nothing more than ants
crawling on this speck of a planet, tiny compared to the area in which they live.</p>

<p>Due to the apparent size differences of an Earth-bound human and Earth, Earth and its solar
system, the solar system and what we call the Milky Way galaxy, the Milky Way and its place in the
universe, the human mind concedes we are obviously utterly indescribably minuscule when compared to
the Universe, with lives lasting for an equally indescribably short period of time.</p>

<p>We therefore believe we can't realistically be compared to the ever present present.</p>

<p>However, we believe we can comprehend its nature, and in doing so, create a symbol for it in our
minds, and to this symbol, attach a sound, and for this sound, a visual representation: epp.</p>

<p>In third density, small parts of epp appear before us in discrete portions, being arranged
spacially such that we can detect a quantity which would be represented in any but the finest of
measurements as exactly zero.  (In other words, we see what's around us.)  These bits of epp become
apparent to us temporally as well, with the next bit never precisely known, and the most recent
never precisely recalled.  (In other words, we see what's around us right <em>now</em>.)
Fortunately, neither for the future nor for the past are we liable.  Only for the infinitesimally
small local present need we concern ourselves.</p>

<p>Human lives on earth have one essential purpose: to live with awareness of our individual portion
of the epp, or ipote.  Each human body is designed simply to experience its ipote.  After that, we
may do anything we choose.  Free Will is a term describing our ability to choose our own actions,
preferably with awareness of how our actions affect our ipote.</p>

<h2>memory</h2>

<p>Our actions and experiences of our ipote are recorded in memory.  Because our natural surroundings
usually change slowly, it became useful to access this recorded information.  So our brains have
developed ways of recalling those memories: &quot;My cave is here; the river is there; tigers live
in that tree.&quot;</p>

<p>This recollection of memories brings our historical ipote to our current ipote, slightly
affecting the way we perceive our ipote.</p>

<h2>language</h2>

<p>Through the progress of natural history, humans developed techniques for communicating their
ipote experiences with other humans.  This can be quite useful for communicating things like,
&quot;there's a tiger [in my ipote].&quot; With refinement of technique we can distinguish important
details: &quot;there's a deceased edible tiger [in my ipote],&quot; and &quot;there's a living angry
tiger [in my ipote].&quot;</p>

<p>Due to the apparent similarities of ipote that exist between adjacent individuals, the phrase
&quot;in my ipote,&quot; has fallen into disuse, or more likely, was never developed as part of
natural history.  It only becomes necessary when talking to (quantum) physicists.</p>

<p>Through this communication between individual humans, each individual believed he could gain
awareness of a greater portion of epp, and therefore have a higher chance of continuing his
experience of the epp (i.e. remain alive).  However, the individual's own experience of epp was
slightly distracted by this communication, especially because &quot;in my ipote&quot; was not
explicitly considered a factor in the communication.</p>

<h2>travel</h2>

<p>During natural history, modes of travel developed, allowing people to quickly traverse portions
of epp, and increasing the speed with which their local experience of epp changed.  If I walk from
here to the river, it takes three hours and I have a great chance to see every detail along the way.
If I run, I get there in only 1.5 hours, but my chances of seeing details is diminished.  If I ride
a horse, I get there faster.  If I use a teleporter (*), I am already there, but with zero chance to
see what was in between.</p>

<p>(*) teleporters don't exist (on earth (?)) yet as far as I'm aware.</p>

<p>An example of a problem caused by fast transportation and beliefs based on communication of
memories of a past ipote:</p>

<pre>
A scout rides a horse to the river, comes back and reports all is clear.

The rest of the group walks to the river (horses are expensive) and are attacked by angry bears.
</pre>

<p>At the time of the scout's ride, the bears were not part of the scout's ipote.  Perhaps he
was traveling too quickly to see them, or they were too far away to be seen.</p>

<p>The simple solution of course: remain aware of one's own ipote even though the scout reported a
safe experience in his ipote.</p>

<h2>writing</h2>

<p>Communication of historical ipote took a dramatic leap from memory and oral transfer of memory
with the development of writing.  Memory of an ipote could be communicated between individuals
across space and time.</p>

<p>This information about a temporally/spacially distinct ipote was understood to have fewer
similarities than communication of ipote between temporally and spacially adjacent individuals.
Depending on the context, the information may be useful or may be discarded as unimportant.</p>

<p>The point being, humans then had the option of being distracted with unimportant information
about a different ipote.  Sometimes these other ipotes seemed interesting, and could be shared by
interested individuals, distracting themselves from their current real experience of epp.</p>

<h2>information technology</h2>

<p>As opposed to technology that simply <em>does</em> (e.g. make fire, cut wood, manufacture PVC tubing),
information technology attempts to <em>explain</em>.  In this definition, chisels &amp; rocks, pen
&amp; paper, printing presses, copy machines, radio, TCP/IP, fiber optics, and braille are all
examples of information technology.  They mean to transmit information about one's ipote to
another, or to many others, or too many others.</p>

<p>When used in moderation, information technology can provide valuable information about another
individual's ipote by being presented at the appropriate time in the receiving individual's ipote.
However, great care must be taken to ensure that the information coming via information technology
of a different individual's ipote does not take precedence over the receiving individual's
ipote.  In other words, stop reading this.</p>

<p>Now!  Look around you.  Feel your body.  <em>Those</em> sensations are your ipote.  Don't let
these bits of text distract you from your job here on earth: experience your ipote.</p>

<h2>now</h2>

<p>In my ipote, I perceive many people ignoring their unique ipote in favor of information
technologically transmitted ipote.  People do too much TV, too much internet, too much work, too
much gossip, and not enough quiet ipote.</p>

<p>So, right now, turn off your TV, turn off your radio, turn off your computer, or at least turn
away, and turn your attention to your body.  To your breathing.  To your connection with life.</p>

<p>I'll do the same before I continue writing.  It's 6:15pm right now.  Okay.  Now it's 6:32pm.</p>

<p>In the past month or so (3 November 2007 now), I have tried to bring my awareness to my self
frequently during the day.  Walking mindfully.  Eating mindfully.  Sitting mindfully.  And, as I am
not (yet?) a spiritual master: getting mindfully angry, worrying mindfully, getting mindfully stuck
online.</p>

<p>We are becoming masters of technology and slaves of information technology.  Not saying robots
will take over the world, but that people seem to be robotic in their lives, obeying the TV and
the desires of their workplace, ignoring their own sovereign connection with their own ipote.</p>

<p>There is talk about The Singularity coming within the next 75 years.  This is an idea that the
advancement of technology is increasing exponentially.  For now it's predictable, but the rate with
which paradigm shifting technologies sweep across the globe is increasing.  200 years ago,
electricity didn't exist.  Just over 100 years ago, planes didn't exist.  50 years ago computers
didn't exist.  24 years ago the internet started.  15 years ago, the web.  10 years ago, Google
started.  5 years ago, social networking services.</p>

<p>At this rate, 2.5 years from now (May 2009), plus 1.25 years (Aug 2010), plus 8 months (March 2011), plus 4 months (July 2011), plus 2 months
(September 2011), plus 1 month (October 2011), plus 15 days (18 October 2011), plus a week (25 October 2011), plus 4 days (29 October 2011), plus 2
days (31 October 2011), plus 1 day (1 November 2011), plus 12 hours (2 November 2011), plus 6 hours ... means in "exactly" 4 years, we'll be
experiencing revolution after revolution faster than humans can possibly keep up.</p>

<p>What will our ipotes be like then?  I have no idea.</p>

<p>What will *my* ipote by like then.  I still have no idea.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>If humans survive The Singularity (if it ever happens), or at minimum survive the progression of
technology, individuals and as a species, we may come to be completely disconnected from our
individual ipotes.</p>

<p>We may travel the universe in blinks of eyes, control planets with profound ease, bring our
advanced technology to other planets, disrupting their natural histories and becoming their gods.</p>

<p>Actually, that's just what happened to humans on earth.</p>

<p>Religions which worship sun-based gods started when technologically advanced beings visited our
planet back in the day.  Suddenly, earth based pagan religions didn't seem so interesting.</p>

<p>Humans began to look outside themselves for information, instead of their own ipote where
communication from the epp comes directly into our bodies in the form of physical sensations and
emotional energy.</p>

<p>Books claiming to be The Truth That Must Be Followed range from deliberate attempts to misguide
us to inadvertent distractions.  The Truth comes to each of us in the form of our own ipote.</p>

<p>Mindfully experience your own ipote.  That's why you are here.</p>
