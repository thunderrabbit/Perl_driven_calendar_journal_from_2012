         WebSearch 2.11 by Darryl C. Burgdorf (burgdorf@awsd.com)

              ===========================================

WebSearch allows users to search for key words in documents located on
your Web site.  It searches the basic text of the documents, as well
as ALT text and any information contained in META "keywords" and
"description" tags.  The script scores the match URLs based upon the
frequency with which the requested key terms appear in the documents,
and also lists the date on which each file was last modified. You can
easily configure the number of matches which will be displayed on
each results page.

              ===========================================

GENERAL NOTES:

Depending upon how you configure it, WebSearch will either construct
a "search index" which it will reference when searches are conducted,
or it will actually open and read all the relevant files to find keyword
matches.

Using a search index, of course, offers a tremendous advantage in terms
of speed and efficiency.  However, the rather simple nature of the index
*does* impose a few limits on the search options available to your
visitors: they won't be able to perform case-sensitive searches, and the
listing of results will include no "relevance" information, but will be
arranged simply by the documents' "last modified" dates.  ("Live"
searches score the match URLs based upon the frequency with which
the requested keywords appear in the documents.)

Conducting "live" searches of your files means that the search results
will always be "up-to-the-minute" accurate.  However, of course, it
also means that the searches are less efficient.  As a result, this
option should only be used if you're working with relatively small file
set.

WebSearch searches the basic text of your documents, as well as ALT
text and any information contained in META "keywords" and "description"
tags.  It does *not* search HTML tags or comments, so, for example, a
search for "HTML" won't key on every "A HREF" tag.

Once you've configured the script, you should call it directly (either
by referencing its URL directly in your browser, or from the telnet
command line).  Doing so will accomplish three things.

First, the script will display for you a list of the directories it's
been set to search, all the files from those directories which will
be included in its searches, and all the (text, not graphics!) files
from those directories which will be specifically *excluded* from its
searches.  This allows you to easily confirm that the searches will
include all the files you want included, and that they *won't* include
any files you *don't* want included.

Second, if you've opted to utilize a search index, calling the script
directly will *create* (or recreate) that index for you.

Third, in addition to the list of files, the script will also provide
you with a sample search form, and with HTML code to copy to your 
pages to allow you to add search forms to your site.

The script, of course, must be called from a search form on a Web page.
The exact structure of the form is not too important, so you're welcome
to modify the code provided to suit your own purposes, so long as the
correct fields and options exist.  If you leave out the "boolean" and
"case" fields, the script will default to a case-insensitive boolean
"OR" ("any terms") search.  If you leave out the "hits" field, the
script will default to showing 25 matches per output page.  The "terms"
field, of course, is essential, since it's in that field that your
visitors will input their keywords!

(It's also possible to create "pre-defined" searches, by linking to
the script with certain information in the QUERY_STRING of the links.
Linking, for example, to "websearch.pl?terms=mexico+city&boolean=all"
will return a results page just as if a visitor had conduced an
"all of the terms" search for "mexico city"; similarly, linking to
"websearch.pl?terms=nebraska+iowa" will return a results page
just as if a visitor had searched for "nebraska iowa" and specified
that results pages should contain any, but not necessarily all, of
the terms.)

              ===========================================

SCRIPT CONFIGURATION:

A variety of variables need to be defined.  They are as follows.

@dirs:  This variable should be defined with a list of the full
  (absolute) paths to the directories you wish the script to search.
  (The absolute path of any directory can be found by issuing the UNIX
  "pwd" command while "sitting" in that directory.  Paths are also shown
  in most FTP programs.)  By default, only HTML files in the specific
  directories you specify will be searched.  If you wish to search *all*
  text files in a given directory, instead of just HTML files, append a
  "/+" to the directory name.  If you want to search files in the listed
  directory *and* in all of its subdirectories, append a "/*" to the
  directory name.  If you want to search *all* text files in the
  directory *and* in all of its subdirectories, append a "/*+" to
  the directory name.

%webbbs4_dirs:  If you want to include the messages from any WebBBS
  4.XX forums in your searches, you should define the relevant data
  directories and corresponding URLs here.  (If you want to search
  the messages from pre-4.00 versions of WebBBS, use the %otherurls
  variable, described below.)  WebSearch will directly access the 
  database and search index files of any of your WebBBS forums, and
  will include any matching messages in its search results listing.
  
  (Note that including WebBBS 4.XX forums in your searches enforces
  the same restrictions as utilizing WebSearch's own search index, in
  terms of case sensitivity and inability to actually rank relevance
  of search results.  The WebBBS 4.XX search indexes, like WebSearch's
  own index, don't record how many times any given term appears in a
  message, nor do they record independently upper- and lower-case
  occurrences of the terms.)

  The variable should be defined as shown in the example below.
  
    %webbbs4_dirs = (
      '/usr/foo/forum1','http://foo.com/forum1/index.cgi',
      '/usr/foo/forum2','http://foo.com/forum2/index.cgi'
      );

$ListExcludedFiles:  If this variable is set to 1, then all files
  within the directories defined in @dirs, but *NOT* incuded in
  searches, will be listed along with other info when you run the
  script without parameters.  (For example, when you're creating or
  updating your search database, as explained above.)  This can be
  handy when setting things up, so you can be sure nothing is being
  excluded that you don't want excluded.  However, for normal
  operation, you should define this variable to 0.  That will
  prevent anyone else from running the script directly and obtaining
  a complete list of the files on your server.

$DBMType:  This variable should be defined just as it is in your
  WebBBS 4.XX configuration files.  In most cases, that means it
  should remain set to 0.  Of course, if you're not including any
  WebBBS 4.XX forums in your searches, then it really doesn't matter
  *how* $DBMType is set.  ;)

$searchindex:  If you want to utilize a search index, define this
  variable with the full path and name of the file.  You don't need
  to create it manually -- and in fact doing so would be of no benefit
  at all -- but you *do* need to make sure that the script is able to
  write to the directory in which it is to be located.

$avoid:  If there are particular files you *don't* want included in the
  search, define them here.  You need only include enough of the file
  or directory names to distinguish them from other files.  For example,
  if you want to exclude all ".txt" files from the search, you can
  simply include "\.txt" as part of $avoid.  (The backslash is used to
  tell the script to regard the period as a literal character rather
  than a "wildcard.")

$cgiurl:  Define this variable with the URL of the WebSearch script
  itself.

$basepath & $baseurl:  Define these variables with the absolute path
  and corresponding URL for a "base" directory under which the various
  directories to be searched all lie.  These variables are used to
  convert the paths to URLs for the results page.

%otherurls:  If you wish to be able to specify several other possible
  URLs -- if, for example, some of the files you wish to search fall
  under a different virtual domain or have to be referenced "through"
  a shopping cart or other CGI program -- then you can define this
  variable with the desired path/URL pairs.  Note that the script will
  check this variable for matches to convert paths to URLs *before* it
  checks the $basepath and $baseurl variables.

  Please also note that this variable, like the $basepath and $baseurl
  variables above, is *only* used for purposes of converting paths to
  URLs.  It does *not* determine what files or directories are searched.
  All directories to be searched *must* be included in the @dirs
  variable (except, of course, for any WebBBS 4.XX directories)!

$AllowDateSearch:  If this variable is set to 1, visitors will have
  the ability to specify dates when searching your site, so that, for 
  example, their results listing can include only files updated during
  the month of September.  If you want all searches to automatically
  search the entire file set, just set $AllowDateSearch to 0.

$DisplayByDate:  As noted above, WebSearch will, by default, display
  search results in order by the number of keyword matches on the page,
  if "live" searches are conducted.  If, instead, you'd like the
  results displayed in order by date, with the most recently-modified
  files listed first, then set the $DisplayByDate variable to any
  value greater than 0!  Of course, if you're using a search index
  and/or including WebBBS 4.XX message sets in your searches, then
  this variable will automatically be set to 1, since relevancy 
  rankings aren't available.

%extrachars:  By default, WebSearch will allow search terms to
  include any alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9), as well as
  dashes, underscores, apostrophes and periods.  If there are other
  characters you'd like to allow in search terms, such as "foreign"
  characters or particular symbols, define them in this variable,
  along with any relevant HTML "encoding" that may be used to
  display them, as in the following example.

    %extrachars = (
      '&Aring;','Å',
      '&aring;','å',
      '+','+'
      );

$NoMETAs:  WebSearch will, by default, search META tag information and
  display the contents of any META "description" tags as a description
  of the page.  If you don't want this done -- if for example, all your
  pages contain the *same* META information -- then set $NoMETAs to 1.

$METAsOnly:  This is essentially the reverse of the above variable.  If
  this variable is set to 1, then WebSearch will look only at a page's
  title and at the content of its "description" and "keywords" META tags
  (if any) when searching the page's content.

$UseDescs:  If for some reason you don't want *any* descriptions shown
  for the pages in the results list, set $UseDescs to 0.

$DescsLength:  If you want "descriptions" of your pages included in
  the results listings, but aren't using META tags, then WebSearch will
  take the first X characters of text and display it as a description.
  X is defined in this variable.  ;)

$SplitNames:  If your files use internal location tags (<A NAME="x">
  tags), and you want the "pieces" of the files to show separately in the
  results listing, you can set $SplitNames to 1.  If you set it to 0,
  such internal tags will be ignored, and all documents will be viewed
  by the script as single entities.

$bodyspec:  This variable should be defined as illustrated with any
  attributes (BACKGROUND, BGCOLOR, TEXT, etc.) which you want to have
  assigned to the <BODY> tag on pages created by the script.

$meta_file:  The path to a text file containing any HTML code (META tags,
  etc.) to be inserted within the <HEAD> section of the pages produced
  by the script.  (This file, of course, is optional.)
  
$header_file and $footer_file:  These should be defined with the
  full paths to text files (optional) containing HTML code to be placed
  at the top and/or bottom of the pages.  This allows you to include
  certain "standard" information on all of them.

$keyword_log_file:  You can, if you like, define this variable with the
  full path of a text file in which WebSearch will store the keywords
  searched for by those visiting your site.

$PrintNewForm:  By default, WebSearch will include at the bottom of all
  search results pages, a new search form.  If you don't want it to do
  so -- if, for example, you have a search form in one frame with the
  results appearing in another -- then set this variable to 0.

$FormExplanation:  This variable should be defined with any short
  "explanatory" text that you'd like included in your search forms, to
  assist your visitors in using them.
  
$HourOffset:  If you are in one time zone and your Web host is in
  another, you can use this variable to adjust the "last modified"
  (and/or "posted") times shown in your search results listings.  For
  example,if your server is located in the Eastern time zone, but
  you're in the Pacific time zone, set it to "-3".

              ===========================================

LIMITING YOUR SEARCHES:

At the most basic level, all you need to do is define in @dirs the
directories containing the files you want searched; WebSearch will
search all the text in all the files in those directories.  You can
refine things with the $avoid variable, defining certain files within
those directories that won't actually be searched, after all.  And
for most users, this is probably sufficient.

However, in some cases, you may find that you want only *part* of a
particular page's content to be searched.  This may be the case, for
example, if you have certain "navigation" information on all of your
pages.  There are several ways in which you can limit WebSearch to
looking only at certain portions of a page.

At a "bulk" level, you could set the $METAsOnly configuration
variable, instructing WebSearch to look only at any given page's
title, META "description" tag and META "keywords" tag.  If you've
actually included descriptions and unique keywords lists on each of
your pages, this might even be desirable.  But if you've done so,
you're also a bit unusual.  So this solution clearly isn't for
everyone.

A more practical solution for most users will be to insert "comment"
tags on your pages, to specify certain portions which should (or
should not) be indexed by WebSearch.

WebSearch supports the "robots" comment tags originally developed
for FDSE (the Fluid Dynamics Search Engine).  These tags allow you
to specify that certain portions of a page's text should *not* be
indexed.  You simply enclose the text in question with the tags, as
follows:

<!--robots content="noindex"-->WebSearch won't read this!<!--/robots-->

You can find out more about the "robots" comment tags and their
capabilities at <http://www.xav.com/scripts/search/help/1048.html>.

WebSearch also supports its own proprietary "websearch" comment tag,
which allows you to specify the specific portion of a page which you
*do* want indexed.  (Note that WebSearch *will* still read a page's
title, even if the "websearch" tags don't enclose it!)  Simply enclose
the text you want searched within the tags, as follows:

<!--websearch-->WebSearch will read *only* this!<!--/websearch-->

              ===========================================

REGISTERING WEBSEARCH:

WebSearch is distributed as shareware.  While you are free to modify
and use it as you see fit, any usage should be registered.  The
registration fee is just $25 (US).  Payment should be sent via check
or money order to Darryl C. Burgdorf, Affordable Web Space Design,
3524 Pacific Street, Omaha NE 68105.

(If you happen to live in a country other than the United States, you
can write a check in your local currency for the equivalent of $32.50.
That will cover the $25 registration fee and the $7.50 service fee
which my bank charges.  Please do not write me a check in US funds
drawn on a non-US bank; the service charge for those can be anywhere
from $10 to $25!)

Thank you for your support!
