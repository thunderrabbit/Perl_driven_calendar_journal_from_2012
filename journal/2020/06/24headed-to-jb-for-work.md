Strangely, I feel unsettled today without having fully written a TODO
list in my little todo list book.  I started it, but didn't finish it,
so today I have been just doing things that I think are reasonable
instead of referring back to what younger me suggested I do.

A younger me might have just written "I" instead of "younger me."  I
am intrigued with the concept of time and having two best friends, a
past self (younger) that did things for me, and a future self (older)
for whom I do things.

Seems that one version of younger me slacked on writing a TODO list,
so maybe I will do that now.  Oh wow; I don't have the book with me
now.  Dang younger me!

It appears that younger me *did* mail Ma's birthday card as I have a
receipt in my wallet that was created at the time of the transaction.

Younger me also made some fixes to the Folio Gallery code, allowing me
to
[navigate to subdirectories](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/folio-gallery/issues/7)
(but not yet back up).  Oh, and he also
[removed `thumbs/` from the subdirectory list](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/folio-gallery/issues/9).
Nice work, younger me!

How long do *I* last in this setup?  I was just about to look for
links to the Issues to link them above and then a browser tab reminded
me that Younger Me was looking at [Hey](https://www.hey.com/), a new
UI for email, by 37 Signals team.  It's only been a couple of days,
and I sorta kinda can see how I feel *relaxed* with a cool inbox zero
feeling that I was never quite able to achieve with the Read/Unread
paradigm.
