Lin found a house in Nagano that she really likes. If everything were
up to her, we would simply sell this place and move there.

I am not ready to uproot myself from Tokyo, where I have built my
men's circle for several years, plus myriad friends via Meetup.

Using Tora as a litmus test, I know some relationships can survive
such a move, but I am still not ready.

I am still sore from the anonymous person who apparently knew me and
e-yelled at me for encouraging Lin to follow her dream to move to
Thailand, so I feel some fear in writing that I encourage Lin to
follow her dream and move to Nagano.

She wants to have goats and chickens.

The house has some cool qualities, including being built 150 years
ago, and partially remodeled 10 years ago.

Frogs dominated the conversation at night.  I photographed one in the
morning.

We walked around the area and saw cool stuff.

Yay outdoor sink to wash my feet and nice breakfast including homemade
jam.

It's apparently a 4 hour, 10,000 yen commute by train to JB, so it
wouldn't really be worthwhile to continue working there.
