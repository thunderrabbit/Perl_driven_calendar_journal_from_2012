After watching this video *once*

I decided that looked like something I could do!

I bought some wire (wrong gauge) and bent it into the shape of the
track I wanted.  Also clipped some track ties to keep it the right width.

I also bent the wire into a holder for the soldering iron.

The shop did not have a soldering iron, so the next week, I bought
that along with some more wire (thinner gauge)

Wonderfully, the iron fit perfectly into my holder.

But I could see the handle was too heavy to not have its own holder.

I tried to solder the holder together and it was pretty bad.

I watched this video and immediately upped my soldering skills.

So then I soldered a little bit of track.

Totally beyond my skills to solder this shape for now.

For funsies, I made a new soldering iron holder with cage
