Today was the longest daylight hours of 2020 in northern half of ye
olde earthe.

Lin and I woke up early and had a conversation to wrap up and make up
after our fight yesterday or so.

Today I worked on Japanese, finishing KUMON Part D.

I worked on my image website, tweaking
[Folio Gallery](https://www.foliopages.com/php-jquery-ajax-photo-gallery-no-database)
to work on my site.  e.g. an old album of called
[cats](https://b.robnugen.com/folio-gallery/index.php?album=cats)  As
of this writing, I have gotten the gallery to

1. [display albums in a sibling directory](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/folio-gallery/issues/1)
2. [filter out non directory files when showing directories](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/folio-gallery/issues/2)
3. [filter out non-image image files when showing images](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/folio-gallery/issues/3)

Next plan is to make it [show both albums and images on the same page](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/folio-gallery/issues/4)


I also called Mark Wild and we got caught up on each other's latest news and
updates.

I went to Machida to meet my KUMON Japanese teacher. 1.5 hours of correcting Part C errors and taking the Part D test.
