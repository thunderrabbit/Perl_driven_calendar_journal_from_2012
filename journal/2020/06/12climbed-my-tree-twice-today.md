I didn't go for a walk this morning, but I climbed my tree twice today
and even brought some snips to remove thorny vines from the area below
the tree.

I've just been questioning how to follow my heart and allow for
abundance in my life.  I have an abundance of trees, bamboo, leaves,
mosquitos, bird song, fresh air, and tummy rubbing options with our
cat Jennie.  So grateful for all of those!

I also have an abundance of time on my schedule Mondays and Fridays.
I offer a free session to anyone who wants to *talk* about something.
Anything you need to get off your chest.  I am not a counselor or
doctor of any variety.  I have years of experience listening to people
who need to talk.

First session is free!  I guarantee in just thirty minutes you will
feel lighter, happier, readier to go about your day.
