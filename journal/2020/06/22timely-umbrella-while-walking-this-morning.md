This morning just as I started walking, it started to sprinkle.  While
walking, I focused on having plastic to keep my daily notes Book One
from getting wet.  Soon enough, after making several different turns
on streets I had not walked before, I found an umbrella in a recycle
bin by the side of the road.  Perfect timing as it was starting to
rain.
