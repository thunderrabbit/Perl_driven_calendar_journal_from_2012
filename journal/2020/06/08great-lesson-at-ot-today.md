Today's lesson at OT was great today.  Nine students (which used to be
hella difficult for me) all seemed quite happy throughout the lesson.
I was quite proud that I smoothly mix-n-matched some of the language
from their homework into the practice section when it proved to be too
easy for them to fill the allotted time.  Both Maino and Yoko saw me
out of the room and we all waved as the elevator doors closed between
us.  "See you in two weeks!"
