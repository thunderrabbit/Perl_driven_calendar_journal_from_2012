This morning I walked along another new route.  Amazing how many there
are, all so close to our house!  I walked up the hill and along the
ridge toward the right, then after the road split into one-way each
way, I went down some stairs into the valley, wound my way around in
there, and found myself all the way at the train tracks beyond the
train station near our house.  Walked away from the tracks and
basically back up the other side of the valley and back home.

This is the walk during which I stole (?) a piece of rubble from a
construction site that could possibly work as a flat surface on which
I solder wire marble track tracks.  I got home and started to wash and
shape it up but it broke (it was already the minimum size that could
work) and now I'm like hmmm maybe I won't use it.

Pics coming soon?
