I am headed to work in Akihabara now for 2 hours of teaching,
scheduled for every other week.  OT students are funny and friendly,
and OMG I just realized I forgot my notebook.  Too late now to go back
and get it.  I was just thinking I need to have it to recall their
names.  I think I can do it... just about.  It's been two weeks since
I saw them last.

Everything turned out just fine.  I bought a notebook, got the list of
names from an email, and was able to piece it all together.  Yay!
Great times!
