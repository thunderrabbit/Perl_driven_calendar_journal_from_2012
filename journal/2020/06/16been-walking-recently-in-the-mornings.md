Yesterday while walking, I found a gravestone facing an intersection.

Today I found a shop that sells piano wire, and then walked down a set
of stairs that feed into a bamboo carpet walkway and mini bamboo grove
below a park.  It's basically behind the rabbit-logo baby clothes
store near our house.

I didn't take a picture there, but I took some pics of greenery
