I opened my email to write a note about walking to Yomiuriland and
then found out my friend Prentiss died which sounds a lot like
bullshit because I just saw him a few days ago on messenger.  I am at
the stage of Denial / Disbelief.

I did tests twice on the way home to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  I
wasn't.  (Well, not moreso than I am now as I type.)

The second to last time I talked to him, he was worried about his mom
dying.  Surprise!  She's alive (as far as I know) and you died.

I love that I can joke about everything with Prentiss, including his
own death.  Life goes on until it doesn't.
