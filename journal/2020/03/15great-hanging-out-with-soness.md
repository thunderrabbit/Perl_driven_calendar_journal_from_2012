Super fun to hang out with Soness making lunch and laughing our
proverbial butts off about funny ways of looking at the world.

We made veggie and gourdy yumyums and even had some frozen banana
blended with macademia nuts using her Braun hand blender.

Laughing and listening to her comedy routines and recording some more
for future use.  Super great day and love hanging out again!
