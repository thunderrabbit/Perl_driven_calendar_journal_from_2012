<p class="dream">On the way to work, I heard two girls behind me
laughing so I reached my arms backwards and one of them jumped on my
back for piggy back ride.  We got to the building and talked for a bit
as someone came *out* of the building asking if there was a restroom
in the area because there was not one inside and then I realized I
didn't know which floor I was supposed to go to for work.</p>

In a different dream,

<p class="dream">Fred and I were going to drive somewhere and he
wanted to drive the entire way because he was practicing for a long
drive.  We talked about which way to go and then I realized I had to
go to work but was late because I could not drive if Fred was going to
drive.</p>
