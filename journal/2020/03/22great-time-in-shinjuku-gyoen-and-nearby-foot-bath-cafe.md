I was surprised to see Shinjuku Gyoen was free to the public.  I still
need to come three more times to make my annual pass worthwhile haha.

Shinobu and Deneys each came ahead of time; Nathan and his friend Hai
came exactly at 1pm.  The crowds were amazing and we found ourselves
in a shaded space on a slight hill.

You can see a bit behind me how crowded it was in the park, despite
covid-19 shutting down other countries.

Special thanks to Bu for taking photos and video during the
meditation ("wasting time", she calls it! haha).

We did not do a walking meditation as it was too crowded to even think
of about walking mindfully.

During the meditation, I was facing away from the group because I was
at the bottom of the hill, having arrived there first and making room
for everyone, and not being able to sit meditatively facing uphill.

I should have made sure everyone could hear me, but it seemed to work
out okay.

After a while, we headed out, seeing lots of sakura in the place.

On the way out of the park, I remembered to take a picture of our group.

Thanks to Bu for taking the photo!

I don't remember if that was before or after Nathan and Hai practiced
jiu jitsu.  We clapped afterward.
