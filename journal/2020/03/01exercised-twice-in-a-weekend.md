Yesterday Lin and I joined Jason, Luis, Satomi, and a guy whose name I
forgot and his son Kota climbing Mt Takao.  We were on route 1, which
is paved pretty much the entire way up so I was able to go barefoot
the entire time.

Today I went to SOGO and was like *erg* because my energy was low.
Today was the day I did core 3 times in a row, led by Emi and Hide.
