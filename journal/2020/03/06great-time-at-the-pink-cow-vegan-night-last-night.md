Great to see Traci and them at The Pink Cow at their new cool location
in Akasaka!  Last night was vegan night and the food was amazing!
Traci made vegan flan somehow magically and a new white bean vegan
chili.  And chocolate chip vegan cookies that were easy to eat and
eat!  She called them crack cookies haha cause they're so addictive!

Met Shawn, Tessa, Takako, Yutaro, and one more I cannot recall now.
Also got to talk with Rohini and Gail!
