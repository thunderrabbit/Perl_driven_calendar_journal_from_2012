I hear things are stricter in other countries, so I am just capturing
this as a datapoint; I got this in an email from U.S. Embassy Tokyo

    Japan’s Enhanced Screening and Quarantine Measures for Travelers
    from the United States: The Government of Japan has implemented
    enhanced screening and quarantine measures to reduce the spread of
    COVID-19.  Effective March 26, all travelers arriving from the
    United States, including Japanese citizens, will be required to
    self-quarantine for a period of 14 days at a designated facility,
    and to avoid using any public transportation, including taxis,
    trains, and buses, until after the 14-day period.  Transiting on a
    domestic flight within Japan is also considered public
    transportation, so you will not be allowed to fly to your onward
    destination in Japan until completing the 14-day self-quarantine.
    The self-quarantine location may be your residence if you live in
    Japan or a hotel, but the Japanese government reserves the right
    to “designate” the location of your self-quarantine.  Travelers
    should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect
    with little or no advance notice.
