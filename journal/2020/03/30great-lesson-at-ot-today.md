Today was the first time for me to teach in the main room of OT's
office.  We had a makeshift setup around 3 tables with 12 students
altogether.

Everyone was genki and happy by the end of the lesson.  Super grateful
to JB for putting together the lesson material.  We actually did not
quite finish everything because I went a little off script for a bit
on number pronunciation.

Zooming home now to do a workshop on Zoom.
