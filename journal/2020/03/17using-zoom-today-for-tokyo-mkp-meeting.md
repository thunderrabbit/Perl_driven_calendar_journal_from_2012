Watching Japanese news this morning I was not surprised to see somber
silent reporting of European countries that are shutting things down
and encouraging testing as the best way to prevent spread.

Then the music kicked in as a giant Olympics logo filled the screen
"but everything is fine for the Olympics!"

I wrote the above to our LINE group for [Tokyo Men's Circle](https://www.mkpjapan.org/)

One man replied to the group


    good morning men, I've been thinking about this for a while and I
    lacked the courage to propose it. Thank you Rob for voicing it
    out. The Japanese goverment (and specificaly Abe) doesn't care
    about corona virus because it simply won't help him get reelected
    and certainly doesnt want his name attached to this topic. [1] The
    people in the goverment are there because they belong to ruling
    families, none of them had to commute in a busy, smelly rush hour
    train nor live in a smaller than a prison cell apartments. Abe
    spent 12 minutes on average during 13 meetings with the so called
    corona virus unit. We spend more time talking in the elevator
    after our weekly meetings. Anyway thats a long rant. For the
    proposal, I judge if we move to Zoom we would be playing our duty
    in controling the spread of corona virus. Shinjuku is the busiest
    station in the world and the probability of getting in contact
    with someone infected is high. to put it in perspective. it may be
    the highest probability among all the stations in the world. Japan
    is lying about the number of cases. they are not testing enough
    people and if anyone shows with mild symptoms he is sent home to
    self quarantine. Our meeting is important and i attended online
    MKP group and I found it as useful as the circle we have.


He said it better than I could.  We are going to meet online tonight.

Another man has offered up his Zoom room because he has a Pro
account.  I feel grateful for the community chipping in to make us all
a bit safer.
