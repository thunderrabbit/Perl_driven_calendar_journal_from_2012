Today I got to work an extra two hours at SCC.  One hour was to check
a new exhibit, which is behind schedule and over budget enough to make
the manager mad.  It may be a while yet before it goes into
production; there are some fundamental issues with it.

Another hour was to check Miyako's English for a new application they
are developing.  I don't think it will be an iPhone or Android app,
but some kind of in-house thing.

Yasu did great homework a usual; he even made a brochure with the new
language that I checked last time.  Above and beyond!
