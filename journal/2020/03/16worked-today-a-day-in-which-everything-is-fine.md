Today I worked in Akihabara at OT.  First of 10 every-other-week 2
hour lessons from now to July.

The Internet says the world is in pandemic pandemonium, but everything
looks normal here as far as I can see.  Am I just seeing the shallow
side of the hockey stick curve?

None of my lessons have been cancelled.  For that I am grateful.

Today's lesson was fine; I sorta got everyone's name by the end.  12
students.. let's see:

1. Masa
1. Takuro
1. Kazuo
1. Hiroshi
1. Maino
1. Yoko
1. Katsuhiro
1. Daisuke
1. Taka
1. Ma
1. Keiji
1. Takuya

Bingo, that is twelve.  Good job, brain!
