Last night we had a great meeting I called Grand New Adventure.  Men
from my Tokyo men's circle joined (though it was open to all (though
only advertised with 12 hours advanced notice)).

* grounding
* check-in
* round and round and round with gratitudes (for 30 minutes with 6
  people), "What are you grateful for?"
* (in breakout rooms) what is best case, bad case, worst case scenario for you
  personally, + what will you do if worst case happens?
* Who else are you?  As things change, who else are you?  what
  other talents do you have to offer?
* check out
