1. I noticed the sound of today's date (March Fourth) is a command
   (March Forth)
2. I'm still in the middle of updating AB's backend site according to
   MLAPHP.  It has helped enormously with my confidence in making
   updates to the site.  Like OMG the book has paid for itself
   countless times.
3. Recently I got phan/phan installed on a local virtual machine and
   have been doing static code analysis as well.  It found hundreds(?)
   of critical errors, all of which I have fixed, some of which were
   long-lasting bugs that simply hadn't been triggered.
4. I've kinda stalled in moving Bold Life Brotherhood Tokyo forward.
   Sometimes I am just not sure what to do.  Well I mean I know I need
   to post stuff and such, but I don't know what to post that seems
   meaningful.
10. One thing to do would be stop playing Best Fiends.  It's a dang
    good game in terms of gameplay and dopamine hits, and wow what a
    time sink.  I am up to level 165.
5. I am on track for 36 workshops in 2020.  I have done 6 so far in 2
   months.  Two more are scheduled in March (walking meditation in
   Shinjujku Park and Your Art Matters); I need to schedule something
   for the end of March.
6. I just wrote to Giselle and Yuna to see if they wanna do another
   workshop together.
7. Weird I just spoke Japanese with a western-looking woman working at
   the convenience store.  She didn't switch to English so I didn't
   either.  Not sure if it's just me, but if we had switched to
   English, it would have felt like a wall had been lowered.  I don't
   think it is just because my Japanese ain't all that great.
8. Recently Lin has been wanting to buy a 2015 Forester.  I prefer to
   save money and pay cash for it but she wants to get it sooner and
   use credit.
9. I spoke with Clio from AirBnB who gave me some great ideas for
   getting my AirBnB Experience started, including lowering the price
   at first, adding more pictures, and adding more dates.  I started
   thinking about it though, and it's like I don't really want to do
   this; nevermind.  I am tempted to just delete the whole thing.
11. Dang my computer just dropped from like 40% battery to 0%.  I was
    not watching carefully but it just went to sleep and woke up with
    0% after I plugged it in.
12. That reminds me, I am in the market for a new computer.  I am
    thinking of getting a desktop to be my primary machine and clear
    this one of non-critical stuff.
13. All schools have closed in Japan for what I am calling Virus
    Month.  I hope it does not last for a month more but apparently
    there may be an announcement made by Prime Minister Abe next week
    that everything is gonna be shut down.
14. Our cat Jennie is apparently 8 years old.  Lin has relaxed a bit
    about her being outside after dark.
15. I am continuing this on 11 March 2020
16. I do not have any plans to travel this year.  Now that the
    coronavirus has been nearly described as a pandemic, with Italy
    locked down and masks unavailable everywhere, I am kinda glad I
    have no plans to get messed up, but for real I think this pandemic
    is being overhyped.  It's just a flu bug and has far fewer deaths
    than tuberculosis (but more deaths than terrorism, so that's
    something).  It has been challenging for me to keep from blabbing
    to all my students how it's a coverup of some variety but I just
    don't know what yet.
17. I mean, take a look at this beautiful
    [Information is Beautiful page on COVID-19](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/).
    It ain't shit compared to lots of deadlier things.  Just like
    "terror" was hyped on the media we are seeing the same thing in
    media this time.  Why?
18. We had a great walking meditation on March 7th, and I was telling
    my students about it today.  Chinatsu looked up full bloom this
    year and it's apparently scheduled for March 22nd.  So I will
    schedule another walking meditation on 21 March.  That can be my
    third workshop in March!
19. I am up to level 188 in Best Fiends.  Man eff this neverending
    addictive game.
20. I am up to page 70 or so in my Japanese study via KUMON.  Oh, I
    forgot to mention that I signed up for KUMON in 渋沢 because Sanae
    who we met in 直島 teaches there and is able to teach Japanese.
    Fair enough; sounds fun!
21. AB is going pretty well; I have gotten rid of all the
    SEVERITY_CRITICAL errors in the backend thanks to phan/phan. Just
    today I installed phan/phan on the frontend as well because I had
    to do a fix to the site and might as well get started with static
    analysis.  Last night is the night I was late for MKP men's circle
    (which is fine because "we have all the king we need") because we
    *got a bounce* from an email we sent.  Turns out some yahoo used a
    fake email address and it bounced.  I hardcoded a fix to keep that
    address from being used and today I firmed it up by creating a
    table and a class to read it.  Anyway that was all on the frontend.
22. I have also been using Codeception to run acceptance tests on the
    website itself.  I have 178 tests with 869 assertions on the
    backend.  On the frontend are 13 tests with 42 assertions.  This
    is all thanks to Paul Jones MLAPHP book.  It has helped me so much
    get this code sorted out.  I definitely feel more confident making
    changes and updates.
23. OMG but that reminds me, just before starting 6 hours of work at
    JB today, I pushed a code change without doing the associated DB
    change because all the DB updates are done manually.  Thank
    goodness I tested and noticed before anyone else.  Gotta deploy DB
    updates automagically eventually.
24. Jennie has not used the bridge I made for her from the balcony to
    Lin's window.  I wonder if she ever will.
25. Yesterday while working on Marble Track 3, I installed two
    "maglevs" which are steel rods from our old "Shoot The Moon" game
    which I got from Dad a couple years ago.  The rods are perfect for
    sliding magnets along which allows smooth lifting of characters
    over the set to let them fly various places.  It's great having
    the maglevs firmly placed *and* able to rotate like arms on
    turntables. Super happy with this improvement in the MT3 set.
26. Noborito next and just ran out of things to write.  Nice timing.
27. Oh, during the walking meditation I noted how often I am mindful
    during normal life.  Not having to sit down to meditate, but
    trying to be mindful as often as possible has helped a lot.
