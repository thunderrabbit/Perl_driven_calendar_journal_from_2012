<p class="dream">
Cleaning my room, I found some dangerous chemicals like phosphorous
from my days as an anarchist.  Some of the phosphorous had spilled and
I wondered how to clean it up.  If only I had paid attention in
chemistry, it would be easy with maybe some lemon juice or other
household acids.

<p class="dream">
My alarm went off and I realized I was late for school!  I ran into
the other room while stripping off my pajamas to take a shower and
then realized I would have to use the same undies again because I
couldn't go streaking through the house after my shower and I didn't
know where my clean clothes were.

<p class="dream">
I couldn't remember what class I was in first, nor what time it
started.  Was 9:45 late?  Why would my alarm have been set so as to
make me late?  Lin and her mom heard me from the other room and looked
over to see what I was doing.  I feigned sleep/death (^)
and she came over to see if I was okay (^) "Babychan! Babychan!" and
then I leaped up to life and woke up.

(^) as per our irl joke
