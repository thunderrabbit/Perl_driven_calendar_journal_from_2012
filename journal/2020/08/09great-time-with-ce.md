It's past midnight as I write this.  CE have been showing us a great time here in their town.  We saw cool waterfalls and even got to meet CJ who captured snapshot and video footage from their drones.

We ate at a nice restaurant; gyoza, salad, charcoaled shrimp, charcoaled beef with miso.  I resisted getting ice cream at the end.

C filled my empty ice cream stomach with tasty beverages as she bartended for us at a lakeside resort.  We met CM with whom E exchanged business cards in a smooth way. I'm glad my pen could support that!

Speaking of my pen, my to-do book got a bit wet today near the waterfalls when I slipped while trying to hurry back.

Great fun bouncing on the suspension bridges.
