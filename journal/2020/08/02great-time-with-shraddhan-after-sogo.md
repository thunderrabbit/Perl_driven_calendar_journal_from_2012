Shraddhan met me after SOGO and I really enjoyed getting to walk
around with him, taking in the sights of ever-changing Harajuku.  I
took him to [Harry's Sandwich
Co](https://www.facebook.com/harryssandwichco) where I tried the
Kamau, with mushrooms instead of onions, and really liked it!  We hung
out there for a bit then wandered toward Omotesando, near which
Shraddhan showed me [Design Festa
Gallery](https://designfestagallery.com/), which I had never seen
before.

I feel asleep during a little live show there and then Shraddhan showed me some of the small exhibits.

Walked up to the other end of Omotesando and stopped by Raizin R 番地
and got three free energy drinks in exchange for reading a simple
description of them.  I conceded that it was worth it, and gave
Shraddhan "1 point".

We headed to Nogizaka by way of a couple of detours to look at
architecture and other interesting bits. ("some of these windows are
curved in while some are curved out", "do you think they built this
wall from the low end first or the high end first?", "how do these
shops survive with no customers?", and "this building apparently was
someone's house")

In the park near Nogizaka Station I saw a pretty decent sized snake!
