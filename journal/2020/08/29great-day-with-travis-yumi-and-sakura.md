At the end of this day I'm describing today as great, but during the day, when it was scorching hot, I was pretty unimpressed with the lack of planning that had gone into it.

Super crowded riverfront and due to my schedule we couldn't leave at a reasonable time to get there, and when we arrived they said the place was full but Lin and Yumi were able to talk our way in and we found a little teeny spot in the scorching sun.

Super glad to Travis for saying "it is what it is so we should simply make the best of it." Even though I wholeheartedly believe this, today I couldn't come up with it myself, so I'm glad to have it reflected back toward me when necessary.

Thanks to Yumi for figuring out a way to use the hatch on the back of Lin's truck to hold a tent cover and use it kind of like a tarp.  I forgot to take a picture of our setup but it was reasonable by the end.

The river water was chilly and the sun was scorching.  Once the sun went down below the mountain it was neat to feel the latent heat in the rocks near the river, but not in rocks at the level of the river.

Today is the day that my cousin Charlie said hi to me during my first live stream announcing my plan to walk to Niigata. We chatted a bit and I sent him pictures today.

At the river location, day campers had to leave by 5:30 p.m. so we packed up and were out by 6:15 or so. 

After the river we went to Travis and Yumi's house for snacks, pizza for me, and ice cream for most.  I was again impressed with Travis who did not eat, as I should not have because of my rule to not eat after 6 p.m.  Not much of a rule I guess.

Thanks to Travis as well for giving me the idea while programming of having my classes be immutable unless they need to be mutable.
