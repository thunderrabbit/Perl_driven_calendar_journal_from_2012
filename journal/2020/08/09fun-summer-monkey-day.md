We are just cooling down after sitting in the onsen at hotel nearish the snow monkey area.

No snow now in August, but we got to see lots of baby monkeys, which I described as fuzzy gymnasts, tumbling wrestling climbing falling all over the place and each other.

One cool thing was getting to see the staff throwing apples all over the place as the monkeys chased the apples which split upon impact against the rocks because they had been cut halfway in half.

They apparently feed apples to the monkeys in this way at the same time once each day at the very end of the time the park is open.

I asked the guy who why the monkeys didn't just run away and he said it was calculated that this area was so far away that they wouldn't move the entire group to a new area.  Thanks to C for translating.
