I worked for three hours at SCC today.  Liliko and Naoko were not there so Yasu and Azusa took lessons.  I also got to meet Mirika for the first time.  She joined the team after COVID-19 reduced the need for her previous travel related job.

As usual, I could see the preparation Yasu had done before the lesson.  Nice job!  Somewhat surprisingly, I could see my other student had prepared as well!  Nice job!  Meeting Mirika wasn't for a lesson, but just a casual chat.  She was in elementary school when I arrived in Japan. Haha

Mirika said she had trouble with the finer points of grammar, having learned English via conversation, so I recommended KUMON to her (and Azusa as well).

On my way out, we passed a woman who said Hi and I recognized her English skill then realized who she was. I had forgotten her name though, so Yasu told me the first letter was T.  Oh yes, Tomoe!
