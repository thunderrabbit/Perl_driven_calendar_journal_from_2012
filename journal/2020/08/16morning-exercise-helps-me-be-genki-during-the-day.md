After having walked several mornings in a row, I took a break and then had trouble getting back getting back to walking early in the morning again.  I chalked it up to recovery, but then by four or five days later, I realized that the walking had actually helped me be genki in the morning.

I went for a short walk this morning and I'm now standing near a worm that might be able to recover.  It looks like he's beginning to move again after I put some of my water on him.

as a result of realizing that I feel better after exercising in the morning, I wondered about the possibility of getting an animal that would require walking in the morning.  such an animal would also require walking in the evening probably and maybe during the noon, so it's not necessarily that easy of a question.
