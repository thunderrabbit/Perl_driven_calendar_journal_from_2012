<p class='dream'>Addressing attendees at a convention about future transportation, I was writing my presentation as I went up to the stage to speak. </p>

<p class='dream'>In the future, this will not be a question anymore. And will be ubiquitous that no one has to solve the pesky problem of deciding whether to walk on the left or right of any particular obstacle.</p>

<p class='dream'>This was meant to get the audience thinking about how we should handle transportation on the proverbial last mile.</p>

<p class='dream'>I planned to continue my introductory speech saying this man has courageously been fighting to bring this ubiquitous future to us today.</p>
