Today was a great productive day, including talking to Fred's friend David about the (non) necessity / pros and cons of setting Fred up as an *attorney in fact* for me.

Today, roughly in chronological order, I:

1. Went for a walk and pic pictures of the cut down trees.
2. Got a message from AB saying that a CSV report was not running properly.
3. Determined a likely culprit and got the query running with fewer SELECT fields.
4. Lad my Design Your Day workshop with regular attendees Shraddhan, Shinobu, Yuri, and Dai in attendance
5. Played C&C Music Factory's "Everybody Dance Now" as our dance break at the end of the meeting.
6. Co-facilitated Mankind Project's new meeting introducing new men to the idea of sitting in circles (online).
7. Sat with Mai for about 20 minutes as she prepared to get on the bus to get on the train to fly overseas.
8. walked with her to the bus and then got a call from Lin's mom
9. Took the overgrown weedy shortcut back to pick up two shirts that Mai had forgotten.
10. discovered that a metal panel by the bus stop was so hot that it would easily give first degree burns if I stood on it too long.
11. Gave Mai a hug and waved as her bus pulled away
12. Had a 90-minute in conversation with Fred discussing our recent projects and all of that, plus the possibility of him being an attorney-in-fact for me.
13. learned that I don't really need to worry about it after his friend David checked out the fine print.
14. Decided I might still worry about it if I want to put money into my IRA.
15. took a very short micro nap for 20 minutes before heading to JB.
16. gave Lin a kiss on my way out the door as she came home as I left the house.
17. was a little bit later and tireder than I wanted to be so I took the bus from Kawasaki station to JB.
18. Chatted a bit with Keit outside the school talking about our latest projects
19. Tried unsuccessfully to startle Aoi as she came in the building.
20. Played a game in Aoi and Mai's lesson, asking what different animals would buy in a drug store in order to practice the past tense of buy and vocabulary words "drugstore" and items in a drugstore.
21. Played hangman to reinforce sentence structures with Rin and Ayane as Rin was on Zoom for concerns about Corona.
22. Ate some rice pilaf and figured out exactly what was wrong with the SQL query for AB.
23. fixed the class that was causing the problem but was not able to save it to the dev server for some annoying reason.
24. chatted with Hide about various things including the marble track 3 and Rick and Morty.
25. Chatted with Kyoko, Misato, and Chinatsu how about various things including TV shows to practice English, Chinatsu's dog's school for socializing with other dogs, and other stuff
26. Read a kids' book to them which offered several different vocabulary phrases like coast to coast, glitz and glamour, electrician, join the police,  and some others I don't remember now.
27. Walked to Kawasaki station from JB, enjoying the texture of the new sidewalk next to all the pachinko parlors
28. Took the train home to my station
29. Discovered it's raining cats and dogs at my station when I got here.
30. Sat and wrote this journal entry
31. Got a call from my lovely beautiful wife Lin offering to drive me home.
32. turned down her offer as I correctly guessed the rain would quit pretty soon. "I'm very familiar with this kind of weather so it will stop soon"

I miss Houston weather.  I'm grateful to get to experience bigger storms in Tokyo now that we're getting some global warming up in here.
