Lin and I are headed to CE's cabin in Nagano today.  our start was somewhat delayed because I forgot to load one of Lin's bags into the car. but the good news is that I got to go see Yomiuriland three times today.

Speaking of Three, I looked for playing cards in the rest area and they had some.. but for 750 yen, I was like, nope!  The rest area was as crowded as I imagine it would be on a normal summer day. There was not any particular effort made to do social distancing, and about 20% of the people were not wearing masks.
