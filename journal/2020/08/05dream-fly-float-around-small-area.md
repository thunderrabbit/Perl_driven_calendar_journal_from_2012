<p class='dream'>The concept of telling a story that we told repeatedly over many years to see how the story would change over time was being tested in a long study that I didn't really want to manage. I wondered how I could keep track of how much the story (didn't) change but I didn't know what story I was supposed to tell, or how to record the stories.</p>

<p class='dream'>In one story we were trying to understand how wastewater was treated and what characters were involved with that.  There was a scene of a dirty toilet that was being cleaned by something in the water.  I wondered how the toilet had gotten so dirty so quickly.</p>

<p class='dream'>Going shopping in a large down there were checkpoints that we had to pass and only had to pay one time. I was standing in line behind one person and we were inside like a big phone booth with glass panels around the whole thing. The guard woman said "go ahead Rob" because I had already gone through the previous day and I realized I now understood a little bit more about this town.</p>

<p class='dream'>There was a small road going through a supermarket and going through a tunnel at the same time. as I went through the tunnel my body was floating just a few inches above the ground as I could pull myself forward with my fingers and then just like skate or slide or float forward.</p>

<p class='dream'>The song "Plittin' on the Ritz" was on repeat in my mind as I floated slowly through the shopping center on this road, then once I got past all of the aisles I was outside and able to fly + float very quickly down the street.</p>
