Last night I used Quill to write the journal entry with my phone while sitting at my station while the rain subsided.

This morning I used Quill to write the dream entry.  I wrote the song first because I knew I would forget it if I wrote the first part of the dream first.

last night was a long day for me so this morning I have not taken a walk before starting my Design Your Day workshop in 25 minutes.

Also today I need to finish at least one new pink sheet before my accountability meeting with Anna and then hopefully be able to finish the report fix for AB before going to work at SCC.

Just for the record, with my Quill / Micropub setup, it still doesn't actually post to my live website. I have to manually add them to the git repo and push the entries up then pull them down and kick off the deployment from my local computer.
