I walked over 10 kilometers this morning, from our house to our main station ShinYurigaoka, to Yomiuriland, then (for the first time) down the back stairs under the gondola lines all the way to Keio Yomiuriland Mae station.

It took less than three hours, and I could easily imagine walking that twice in one day. Therefore walking 400 kilometers to Niigata could be done in three weeks.

I got home just in time to rest a bit and then do Design Your Day workshop.
