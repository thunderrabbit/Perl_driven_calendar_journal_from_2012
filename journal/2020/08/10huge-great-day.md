Lin and I joined CE for Italian food next to a lake and then wondered about a building with a second floor entrance for boats.

Went to buy some snacks that Lin's sister wants but they weren't available.  Lin headed home and I started with CE as we went to see summer monkeys (snow monkeys in the summer).

Bought some small apple trees and then had dinner at their favorite local restaurant, featuring four cheese pizza and teriyaki chicken pizza.

Back at their place for drinking and music: NIN broken, then The Downward Spiral, then Pig Sinsation.

1:01am and bedtime.
