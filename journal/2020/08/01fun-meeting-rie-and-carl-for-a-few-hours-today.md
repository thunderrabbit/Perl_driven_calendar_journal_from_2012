Rie and Carl came to our station to hang out after our first plan to
do so was scuttled by Covid-19.  We went to Kona Coffee (コロナコーヒー?
haha) and gorged slightly while chatting.  I had two banana smoothies
and avocado loco moco.  Pretty good, but one banana smoothie was
enough.

Interesting to hear about Carl's work doing video editing.  He and I
also talked about video games and men's circle stuff a bit.  He and
Lin talked about their favorite horror movies (!).  Great to see Rie
and Lin super happy to hang out together.
