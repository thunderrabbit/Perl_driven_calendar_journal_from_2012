<p class='dream'>Christina Branum-Martin and I were outside class standing out in the playground until the classroom was opened. She said she forgot to do the homework and wondered what it was.  I used a piece of paper to pick the lock on the door and went inside the classroom to check the homework assignment which was written on the board.  I was very relieved to see the assignment was "design a mascot for the class".  My mascot was already designed. I just hadn't brought him..  Fran√ßois!</p>

<p class='dream'>On the way back outside to tell Christina, I woke up.
