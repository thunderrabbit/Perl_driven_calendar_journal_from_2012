I walked to Yomiuriland today and noticed they have bushes shaped like
よみるいぁんど in hiragana.

While walking home from Yomiuriland today I stopped my left foot
twice.  I was distracted each time so it's pretty much my
fault. Fortunately neither of the injuries bled.  This second one will
probably end up being a bruise, but certainly walkable.
