Today was pretty hot at SOGO Bootcamp (outdoor body weight workout) and I sought the shade as often as possible.

Emi looked a bit sunburned at the end so she and Chris got Pocari Sweat and water afterward.

We talked to Sakura, back from her 3 month trip to Thailand, Bali, and India.  I asked her what she learned from her trip and she said 「物いらない」which I'd translate as "we don't need things"

She said she stayed in places with no water and no electricity, and it was still fun.
