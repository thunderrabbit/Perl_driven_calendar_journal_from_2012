I woke up around 4 a.m. with the dream I wrote about having blood in my mucous as I coughed. My throat felt scratchy at that point but now feels pretty much fine.  I chose not to go for a walk at 4 a.m. and went back to sleep.

Part of me is wondering if / how I will be able to walk each day going to Niigata.  In any case it will be an awesome adventure.
