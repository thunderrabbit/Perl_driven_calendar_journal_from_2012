<p class='dream'>On a crowded bus, looking at the number of people with and without masks on. my friend was there without a mask and I smiled at her.  I like being able to see the human face and connect more with a smile.  She held out her hand and I helped her get up and she sat down in the seat behind me on the bus and we started talking.  She asked me what I was addicted to.  I started with sugar and, and then settled on talking about YRUU and advising, saying one of the greatest things is to have youth be inspired to become an advisor.</p>
