After moving to Tokyo, I fell in love with the trains.  No flat tires, no maintenance, no insurance / inspection / oil change / tire change / expensive leaky gaskets allll outsourced to professionals.

So I didn't worry when my driver's license expired.

Lin loves to drive.  Right now we are stopped in a rest area where she is sleeping for a quick power nap.  If I had my license, we could be still on our way as I take some of the cognitive load off Lin's shoulders.

But dang, 350,000 yen is steep.
