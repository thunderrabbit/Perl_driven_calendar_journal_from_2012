<p class='dream'>I was in a classroom setting and I had a problem with my computer in that I couldn't turn it off.  I didn't want to disrupt the class so I closed the computer and then it started to broadcast a video onto a whiteboard near my seat.</p>

<p class='dream'>The video was something I didn't remember but clearly showed me laughing and talking with one of my friends and almost giving kisses and then licking his cheek. I tried to turn off the computer but it wasn't responding to any commands like quit or escape.</p>

<p class='dream'>I opened my computer again and the video switched to my local monitor and turned off on the whiteboard. So far so good.</p>

<p class='dream'>Then a young girl near my seat started seeing the video and asking questions.  I told her she should not watch and turned the monitor away from her so she went up to tell the teacher something was amiss.</p>

<p class='dream'>the video changed to some footage of some kind of race using oxen running down a hill and then dune buggies and stuff chasing after them. The oxen got to the bottom of the hill and the guys with them set up an elaborate storefront using poles and tarp that the oxen had been carrying.</p>

<p class='dream'>continuing to try turning my computer off before the teacher got back to where we were, I started to feel worried and then realized it was a dream and woke up.</p>
