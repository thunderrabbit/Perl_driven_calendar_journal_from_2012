title: 'dream missing pickle'
---

<p class='dream'>I had logged every ingredient of every hamburger I had eaten over the past year and at one point I noticed that there was not a pickle in the hamburger.  at the time I didn't do anything about it because it's just one pickle and I didn't care, but I wondered from the management point of view would they want to know that someone hadn't added a pickle to the hamburger?</p>

<p class='dream'>I got the chance to talk to management on time and it had only been a couple of weeks since the missing pickle incident, and I went back through my papers to show them the documentation but for some reason even after going through my papers wanted a time I couldn't find the particular one that had the missing1.5 grams.</p>

<p class='dream'>After a while, giving up on finding that particular piece of paper, I told them what had happened and posed my question "is it better to ignore it or better to let them know that there's a pickle missing?"</p>

<p class='dream'>The manager said I certainly deserved to receive what I paid for oh, so I could certainly ask to get a new pickle.</p>
