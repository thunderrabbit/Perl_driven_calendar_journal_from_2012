I sent this to Lin:

    I'm on the train now in Kawasaki.  I'll be home about 25 minutes later than usual.

I just stood for apparently that long watching guys lay new sidewalk
"tiles" on newly laid sand on a rough concrete surface created before
I started working again after COVID had me working from home.

On each side of the sidewalk they had a string pulled taught at the
same level as the top surface of the tiles.  I wondered how they had
the string fixed on the far end so I went down there to find it
attached to a tile on a mound of sand.  "How do they know it's the
right height??" I wondered, but then realized a simple hanging level
could answer that for them.

Back at the end with all the action, four men were rolling pallets of
tiles about 5x5 by ten high.  I didn't think to take a picture of
those pallets.

One crew laid sand down and smoothed it out at the right height to let
the next crew place those tiles on top and gently tap them into a flat
grid with rubber mallets.  Three types of tiles were used: red ones to
mark the bicycle lane, gray tiles to mark the walking lane, and yellow
ones with raised lines to guide blind walkers in the middle of the
walking lane.

Gosh, now I wish I had taken more pictures!
