<p class='dream'>Soness brought a stage with her while hiking and set it up in front of some party goers at the beach. She was wearing just bikini and earrings as I helped her mentally prepare for her freestyle set.  I gave her hugs and a kiss and welcomed her on stage, starting the round of applause before she started with an art project description which ended with a pun about eons vs freon or something. </p>

<p class='dream'>
After her set was finished I sang a song for Lin:</p>

<p class='dream'>"When over population surprises <br>and civilization demises<br> you know I'll still love you.</p>

<p class='dream'>When the pyramids are gone<br> and there are no more songs<br> just know I'll still love you. </p>

<p class='dream'>When you just don't care <br>because there is no air, <br>you know I'll still love you</p>

<p class='dream'>so sit right there <br> in that chair<br>  because I still love you"</p>

<p class='dream'>Lin was crying happy tears to hear it as I sang this song on stage and woke up.</p>
