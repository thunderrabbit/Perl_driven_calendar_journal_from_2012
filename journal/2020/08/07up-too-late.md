I am up too late for no particularly good reason; I was thinking I
would work on AB or at least on ConSwi, but just ended up watching
Fool Us and then some breakdown videos where Penn broke down magic
scenes in movies and then a marine broke down some scenes in marine
movies.

Oh, one good thing I got to chat with a man from our Tuesday night MKP circle.
