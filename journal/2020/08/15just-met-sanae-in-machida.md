Sanae and I met for our near-monthly Japanese check and English chat.  Today I turned in all the remaining pages from Part E and got Part F to work on at home.

KUMON teaches various topics via reading and writing pages.  I've heard of students studying arithmetic, English, and other languages. I'm studying Japanese, each page of which takes me between 2 minutes and 10 minutes, unless I'm like "ugh" and give up for the day.

The grammar is beginning to get into stuff I'm not super comfortable with in daily conversation.  Since the first page of Part A introducing 川、口、日、I've definitely enjoyed the slow ramp up and helpfully repetitive nature of the pages.

Ignoring the annoying pronunciation of kanji in Japanese, the only annoyance is that the kanji are written so small it's hard for my old man eyes to see them very well on the paper.

But other than that, I can recommend KUMON for studying things.
