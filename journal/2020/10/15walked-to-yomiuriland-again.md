Today is probably like the 10th time I have walked to yomiuri land in the past few months.  I wonder if I am diluting myself that these little walks can add up to walking 300km to Niigata in April.

Lin suggested that I do a short walk to like Gunma or something, so maybe I'll plan that over the next couple of months I don't know.

A long time ago, Travis suggested that I walk to prepare for the trip.

It's funny how my current self can't be bothered to prepare, and I've placed everything on my future self to be able to do the walk.
