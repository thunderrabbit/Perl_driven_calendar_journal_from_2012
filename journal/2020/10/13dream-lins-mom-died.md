<p class='dream'>I woke up from a dream that was continued from previous dream maybe within the same dream that Lin's mom had died.  I was having a dream about her and then woke up and in the reality her mom had died and I came to that sudden realization again and I started to cry again as I talked to Lin all like your mom is dead, as if she didn't know but just kind of to reinforce it that I realized it.  I had been having a continuation of a dream from before where she was alive and so is really surprising to realize again.</p>
