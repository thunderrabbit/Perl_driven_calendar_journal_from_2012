As I write the blog entry I see how cool Michael's website looks and
realize I want mine to look like that.   I am beginning to understand
what I offer to the world, and though I have some level of HTML
ability, I don't have UX training and should outsource the building to
someone who knows what is up with all that.

Anyway, I listen.  I think that is one of my superpowers.  I listen to
my clients; I listen inside myself for appropriate responses, and
offer them as appropriate.
