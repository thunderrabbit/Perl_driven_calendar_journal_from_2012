<p class='dream'>We were walking by a trampoline and it had some paint on it that indicated where people could jump and indicated anybody could jump on it.  Ma got on and she did some flips and then she got off doing a flip and landed on her face on some concrete and I was scared at first but realized it was a dream so I protected her and made sure she was okay so it woke me up to a degree but I recognize I was dreaming during the dream and I helped her be okay.</p>
