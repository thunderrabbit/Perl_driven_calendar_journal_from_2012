Today Shraddhan came to Yoyogi Park so we could catch up over lunch
and walking around.  I wish now that I had taken more pictures (esp of
us together).

Near the Awesome place (that closed in August), I found a strip of astroturf

We ate at Harry's sandwich shop.  Yum!

Then we walked to Shibuya along the Yamanote Line

Shraddhan showed me some cameras at Labi, but they are out of my price range.

We hung out for a bit on top of the building.

Then walked to Yoyogi Uehara station.  Along the way, we found a plant shop with what seemed to be inexpensive plants. It was closed or I might have bought some

We walked by a lot.  Well yes, we walked by a lot of things, but I mean we walked by an empty *lot*.

I created a calendar event for Oct 26th, 2025:

While walking to Yoyogi Uehara from Shibuya, near coordinates
35.663164,139.6841022, we found a small lot covered in plastic.  I
think it will be apartments.  Shraddhan thinks the area is too small.
I said, "we can check again in ten years," but I think 5 years will be
sufficient for the lot to be developed, hence this reminder, set for
~5 years later.



Here are the pics of the location I took on 25 October 2020 https://photos.app.goo.gl/2QtXJVZeoKGt3o876

I wonder if this link will be updated with new imagery or if the date is encoded in there somehow.

Oh, and here is the current Google Maps photo
