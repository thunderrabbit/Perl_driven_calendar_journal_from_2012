<p class='dream'>Looking at different kinds of music and different formats of a track and cassette and CD I saw a CD of compilation sounds love summer and the top look like David Bowie I showed it to the guy next to me and said who is that expecting them to say David Bowie and then I realized he looked just like the CD artist and I said "it's you" he was being used and couldn't really say I was wrong because it looked a lot like him.</p>
