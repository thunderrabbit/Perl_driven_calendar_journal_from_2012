enjoy getting out into nature and get in touch with yourself during our walking meditation walkshop Saturday October 24th.

We will meet in Shinjuku Gyoen, Shinjuku Gate at noon, enter the park and find a nice place to mindfully walk in the grass.

The gardens are beautifully manicured and the grass is really nice for walking barefoot, so feel free to take off your shoes and enjoy being in touch with Mother Earth.

I will need us through some mindfulness exercises as we move, slowly experiencing what it's like to walk.

Cost: 500 yen to enter the park.
