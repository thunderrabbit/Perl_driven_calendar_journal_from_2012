<p class='dream'>While the young adult community of men was back in town, I realized it would be a chance to play Silent Football and that they had probably played last night though I had gone to bed and missed it.  Discovering there was no automatic laundry service, I started hanging my laundry from under my bed to above my bed with push pins to pin it to the ceiling.  The pins suck in sheet metal as well as sheetrock.  I hung a towel and a sheet and thought about inviting everyone to play.</p>
