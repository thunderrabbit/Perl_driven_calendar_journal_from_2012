After watching The Big Lebowski, I was just about to get to work when Tomoko asked if I planned to join badminton. 

My reply:

    TodaYYYYY????
     I did not know about it!
    OMG

I flipped a coin which suggested I go, so I went!  Great fun as always though this time we had only one net worth of court to play on.  I'm not sure why were in the large room with bleachers instead of the large room with hoops.

The bleachers were closed so I climbed them a little.  I didn't go all the way up over the fence though.

Chatted with Tomoko and her friend Mari who recognized me from before.  I didn't recognize her because she had been wearing a mask then.

I told them about my plan to walk to Niigata in April and Mari said "exciting!" Most of the others were like wtf??
