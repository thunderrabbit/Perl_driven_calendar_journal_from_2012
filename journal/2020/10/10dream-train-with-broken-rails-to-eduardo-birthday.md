title: 'dream train with broken rails to Eduardo birthday'
---

<p class='dream'>Lin and I were looking out the window, wondering if the morning train would go by.  There had been a big storm so there was some concern if the trains would run.  I saw two maintenance trucks go by on the train tracks and then I realized that we were on the train and I could look down and see the rails ahead of us.</p>

<p class='dream'>The rail stopped after a while and the train continued along the path it should go, guided by the time honored direction of the tracks.  Then there were new anti-tracks that have been put into place which allowed the train to get back onto the tracks. </p>

<p class='dream'>The new tracks looked like steel plating and started in the middle of the tracks causing the wheels to be forced in the right direction by straddling the metal. It wasn't clear to me how it could work but it seemed to work okay and we arrived at our destination.</p>

<p class='dream'>I jumped off the train all happily asking the first guy I saw if I could help.  He was preparing some food and said I could help by wishing happy birthday to hey man named Romano inside.  He corrected the name to Eduardo and then I went inside to find him.</p>

<p class='dream'>There were a few people and I knew some of them, so I deduced that this other guy must be the right person. I was like hey happy birthday Romano, and he was like thanks but my name's not Romano.  "Oh sorry I mean Eduardo," I corrected myself.  His face lit up and he was so surprised that the message had gotten to him.  He thanked me profusely and I said it was just a small thing and the least I could do.</p>

<p class='dream'>Then we got into a discussion of whether it's good to make a big deal out of people's birthdays and how to really know if that's what they want or not.  Even if we ask them they might say one thing and really mean another.
