Tonight I went to CE's house to hang out, watch videos, eat pizza.  We talked about the music and the artists and I introduced Numbers in Houston which has several playlists on youtube.

Other topics included ETs, movies, 9/11, Jews, covid-19, abusive nuns, and lucid dreaming.

I also learned that a bar must have a certain minimum set of ingredients to be a bar.
