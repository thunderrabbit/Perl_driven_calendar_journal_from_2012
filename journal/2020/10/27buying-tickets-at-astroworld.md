title: 'Dream buying tickets at Astroworld'
---

<p class='dream'>Trying to get a season pass at Astroworld, I thought I had a season pass but I had only bought a ticket the previous time. the woman said she remembered but she couldn't help me out.  I went to the next guy in line and I could barely understand the guy's questions as he was trying to do a sales pitch. I misspoke an answer and everyone who was watching laughed.</p>
