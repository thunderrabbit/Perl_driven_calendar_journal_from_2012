Socializing (routine time with regular members) is good, especially
during this pandemic.

Completing achievable and essential matter for everyday helps me to
carry on other daily tasks that I do not mention in the group.
Seeing dynamics in the group is interesting. 
I feel that this group is like having an accountability partner.
I really appreciate the guidance received from Rob.

I also appreciate everyone else's insight. I learn a lot every day. 
The consistency, the camaraderie and positivity and sharing of ideas
amongst the family.
