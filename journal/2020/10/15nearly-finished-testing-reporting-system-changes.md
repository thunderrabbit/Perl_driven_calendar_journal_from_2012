Actually I should say I nearly *started* testing changes to reporting system..  I'm 99% sure everything is fine as far as the data goes, .. I just need to confirm it produces the same output as the current live system does.

Part of my stall has been that AB has not gotten back with me for a time to look at the changes that are there already, and they can determination on how to finish up some final questions.  There are some undefined points in the specification, so I need to do some

*puts on sunglasses*

A/B testing.
