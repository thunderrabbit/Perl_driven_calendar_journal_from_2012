<p class='dream'>I've just about completed some work on AB website.  They have some reports that were crashing by timing out PHP, so I've rewritten the thing so PHP can do one month at a time.  Now reports are kicked off with JavaScript that simply says "run the next month" for this run_id, and PHP decides what the next month is and lets JavaScript know the progress which is then reflected on the UI.</p>
