I just got on the train headed to Shinjuku on my way to Shinjuku Gyoen for today's walking meditation.

Thanks to Amaru for asking about sitting on the ground, so I brought ground tarps. And thanks to Lin for knowing where they were in the --house-- car!

Seven people said they will attend. Exciting!
