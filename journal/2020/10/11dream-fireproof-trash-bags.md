<p class='dream'>I saw a commercial on TV of a trash bag that could hold fire and put it out because it blocked the intake of oxygen, and the bag itself wouldn't burn.</p>

<p class='dream'>They had some dramatic scenes of people happily placing burning items inside the bag which were soon extinguished.</p>

<p class='dream'>It culminated with a sexy flight attendant saying they couldn't get this helicopter to work so they were placing a helicopter full of burnable foam and igniting the whole thing.</p>
