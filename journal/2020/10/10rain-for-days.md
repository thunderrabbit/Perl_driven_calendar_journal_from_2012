For the past few years I realized rainy season in Japan just merges smoothly with typhoon season so we just get rain for 6 (?) months or so.

A few weeks ago I had scheduled a walking meditation event for this weekend. A few days ago I postponed it for 2 weeks because we're expecting to get rain all weekend.

I'm glad I made a choice to postpone the event a few days ago and let everybody know about the new date instead of the old version of me waiting until the last minute hoping the rain would go away and then panic canceling or confusingly not canceling for people who like rain and it would just be really weird.
