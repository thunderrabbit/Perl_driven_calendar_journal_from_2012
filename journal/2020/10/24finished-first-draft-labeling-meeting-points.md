Excited about my planned walk, I stayed up and labeled the rough draft meeting points of the entire walk.

This was relatively easy using Plot A Route to join together all 50+ routes. One at a time I added a route then added an Annotation near its endpoint.  The resulting map allows people to zoom and scroll over my entire planned route.

Hopefully this will allow for my friends (and new friends) to join portions of the walk!
