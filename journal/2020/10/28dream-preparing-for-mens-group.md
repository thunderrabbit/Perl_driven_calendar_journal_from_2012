<p class='dream'>I came back to the men's group with a man from somewhere upstairs and we had to go downstairs to room 503. I went down a couple of levels until he entered the stairway and I told him where to go. I went down to level five and open the door but it was level eight on the inside and had to go down three flights of stairs to get down to level 5.</p>

<p class='dream'>
I recognized our room and I noticed the large space above the stairs and thought I remembered it. I turned left down to a little hallway to get to our room and there were many more people in there than had been when I left. I was about 5 minutes late which was surprising because I thought I was only one minute late and there were people not ready and trying to sit in one little corner of the room instead of using the whole space.</p>

<p class='dream'>I invited people to create one larger Circle and then a man commented about my grammar of using the word circle versus Japanese pronunciation of circle especially when referring to two different circles, I agreed it was funny and continued trying to get the group together into one Circle.</p>
