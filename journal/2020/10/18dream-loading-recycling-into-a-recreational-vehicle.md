<p class='dream'>Loading large bags of recycling into the back of a truck, I climbed into the back of the truck and began throwing then into the truck in certain spots.  1-A for aluminum cans in the driver's seat.  1-C for tin cans in the front passenger seat.</p>

<p class='dream'>Then came a series of sets of lids that were tied together with string.  Then some sets of keys tired together.  Some were new. Very strange to recycle new material I thought.  </p>

<p class='dream'>After we had everything, we started driving in the vehicle, which was a very large recreational vehicle, that was amazed to think it was someone's home.</p>

<p class='dream'>It was 3 stories high and we were on the top level in the kitchen area. I wondered how the vehicle didn't tip over and could still fit in a traffic lane.</p>
