For some reason I don't write journal entries as much during this
covid faux lockdown.  I think it's because I am always on my computer
with no downtime per se.  It's like everything is just a long slow
blur of sameness as I go through my days.  I have been doing
meditations in the morning but then it's just either on computer
blahhh.

That reminds me I hadn't finished my task for this morning to write
the things that block me from receiving materially or in any aspects
of abundance.

* perfectionism.
* fear of letting people down
* fear of angering others
* unfounded fear of dying alone
* laziness?

Great news: I got a pretty big changeset done on AB, and it went over
with only one mistake which I was able to fix pretty quickly (because
I had fixed similar issues (and should have fixed before moving stuff
online (because I had fixed similar issues))).

The change basically encapsulated all but one of the occurrences of
($_SESSION) with the class \Mlaphp\Request from [Paul Jones book
MLAPHP](https://leanpub.com/mlaphp), which has helped me a whole lot in getting this project up to
modern standards.  MLAPHP and Phan/Phan which has helped catch a lot
of static errors.

Go get the book if you have a big PHP project to wrangle into clarity.
