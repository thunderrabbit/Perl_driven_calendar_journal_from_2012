I took this picture on April 7th after one of the Connection Circles.
I love magnets!   The colorful ones are from Magination.  Aww sad
their website doesn't work anymore.  maginationgame.com

A couple days later, I took this picture of Jennie licking the inside
of a clean plastic bag.  For some reason she loves licking plastic bags!
