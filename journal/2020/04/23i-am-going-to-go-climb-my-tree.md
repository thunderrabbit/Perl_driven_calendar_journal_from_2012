I am going to go climb a tree in the park near our house.  It's not my
tree, but it's my favorite semi-easily-climbable tree near me!

I took pics and emailed Paul.

The other day I had a chakra healing designed to help me recognize my inner inate value.  One suggestion was to get in touch with my physical body and nature.

This is me doing that today:

This was my view from that point:

It's a good climbing tree, about 1 minute walk from my house.

In other news, I have used this time to study Japanese, and am making reasonable steady progress.
