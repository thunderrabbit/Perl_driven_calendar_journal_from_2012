We had seen Sanae last night, eating alone at dinner.  She came up to
me while I was drawing on 30 A4s.  We talked and boom turns out she
lives at the next express station from Lin and I.  Nice!  I look
forward to hanging out with her more once we get back home.

We had seen Elena as well; she and her peeps are in from Spain.  I was
able to say *encantado* to her as I gave her my card.  Elena and her
peeps are on the same ferry as us as we leave Naoshima.

The picture I plan to put here is not of Naoshima, but an adjacent
island.

Yowza what an exciting phone call I got from Sanae, just hours after
meeting her.  She found Francois on the ferry; I had apparently left
him there!!

Magically delicious synchronicity to have him in safe hands.  We will
meet in Machida sooner than later where I will buy lunch for Sanae and
talk with her about eye gazing and art workshops.
