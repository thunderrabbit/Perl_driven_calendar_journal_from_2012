I'm on the train now headed to nihombashi to meet Yuna for our first coffee and chat event.

Giselle from SOGO asked if I wanted to do some event with her Coffee+English group on Meetup.  (I posted two eye gazing events and got a few responses.)

Posting a coffee related event and got us four responses, at least twice as many!

Really proud of Yuna for stepping through her fear and proud of myself for mentoring her.

Today while meeting with Robert Golden, he reminded me I have a huge heart.
