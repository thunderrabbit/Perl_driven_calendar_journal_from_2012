Great time walking with Ma and Madeleine through the 日本民家戦
today.  Madeleine loves taking pictures; "I have to take pictures of
all the flowers" she says.  A lot of the staff asked about me being
barefoot there.  The sky was beautiful blue nice crisp day, so we got
nice photos of the trees as well as houses.

We met a guide who spoke Spanish as well as English.  He used "y"
instead of "and" as he was speaking.  Madeleine spoke to him in
Spanish a bit.  He apparently spent four years in Puerto Rico.

So cool to hear the reasons for the architecture above the fire
pit. It allows smoke to pass vertically through, encourages heat to
pass horizontally to other rooms, and prevents catastrophic damage by
falling into the fire pit in case it catches fire.

Neat to see lots of New Year's decorations in the houses, including
lots of origami rats.

Oh, and they've closed a section of path for refurbishing; it was
exactly where I took a picture before as I noticed roots visible due
to soil erosion.

I am glad they are taking care of the place so thoughtfully.

We also got to do the indigo tie-dye workshop

And went to the nearby museum!
