Akiko and I have met maybe 15 times for language exchange over the
past several months or year(?).  Tonight we met in 白金台 at
Jonathan's for chat over their drink bar which had Japanese which I
did not understand until she explained it.

ドリンクバーには、もったいない
コーヒーが生まれました。

Literally, "Coffee wasted at the drink bar has been born."

I might creatively translate it as "Try our new coffee that's too good
for the drink bar."

Akiko also explained 爪の垢 that I heard at はなもも today.  It
reminded me of K from down under who I miss dearly if I think about it
too much.
