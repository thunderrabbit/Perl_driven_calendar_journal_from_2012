Hanamomo is like a mini community center, basically a house with some
nice staff who do events for locals, often the elderly.  Today I
attended their 男性ランチ during which we made curry from raw
ingredients (if we count the rue as a raw ingredient).  I cut carrots,
peeled potatoes, cooked onions, and stirred while the 先生 added meat,
water, rue, potatoes (some of which I peeled), and carrots (some of
which I cut).

Altogether something like 8 men cooked and 14 people ate.  One of the
women who attended recognized me; she seemed to remember my name
(though I had a name tag)..  I certainly did not remember her or her
name, but I figured out later where I had met her.  She lives near me,
and I talked to her at the bus stop nearest her house.

I felt a bit uncomfortable in the Japanese language environment when I
didn't understand questions they asked me or explanations that went
over my head.  I could understand several of the surrounding words,
but not the important key words.

I should have remembered to whip out my notebook and take notes; they
would have been happy to help.
