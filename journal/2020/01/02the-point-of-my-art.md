One of the photographers whose work is here wants to point out that
every sea horizon looks the same around the world.

A different artist showed that most of the soldiers forced to cheer
about going to war were not actually happy about it.

Another piece showed that we are all connected and all our cultures
together make art.

Well, 8 years ago I lost my art mojo because one guy was like, "if you
don't know what your art expresses, you will never be successful."  or
some crap like that.  Well, I just figured out what my art expresses,
and it is in line with the work I do in personal growth through
emotional awareness.

*Every individual sees things differently*

This is a fundamental truth because individual means separate from the
whole, and if one is separate, one is distinct, different, and away from the
whole.  If one is separate, one is elsewhere, and has a different
perspective, a different history, a different belief system, a
different point of view, a different personal story, a different fear,
a different joy, a different sadness, a different way of perceiving
things.

*Everyone is unique.*

From there, it is a tiny leap to realize everyone is precious; every
one has their gift or offering to the world around them. Everyone has
their own unique connection to the source of life.  I here I ought not
talk about god and spirit here but that is the point.  God is one and
each individual is an expression of god in his or her own way.

*God dwells in me as me.*
