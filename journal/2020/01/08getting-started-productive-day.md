Today one task is to write the benefits and objections to barefoot
walking.

Foot freedom after all week confined in shoes. Getting back to nature,
traveling while connecting with the earth and self.  Learn from
barefoot Rob, (as seen on TV), With 17 years experience barefooting in
Houston and Tokyo.  Learn how to experience the simple art walking in
a new way.  Begin your transition to this growing and healthy trend.
Make like-minded friends.  Get a new look in Japan, Recall childhood
pleasure freedom and walking around freely. Receive natural shiatsu on
the soles of your feet.

Instagram opportunities with interesting things to see along the way!


For eye gazing, we take some time to sit quietly To help ground the
numbers of the Circle,Talk a little bit about how simple process is.
No need to worry about left eye or right eye. Then Each person finds
the partner and sits facing one another in a comfortable way.  As
the leader, I will set a timer for three minutes and we simply sit and
look into the eyes of our partners.  After the three minutes is up, say
thank you to your partners and share what came up for you during the
three minutes.

We've been change partners and do the process again, each time lengthening the
time to sit by a minute or two up until we get to eight minutes or so.

By then it is time for a break and we can share in a big group what we
noticed.  Then do a couple more long sits with partners and a closing
round check out.
