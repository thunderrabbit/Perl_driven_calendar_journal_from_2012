It's not sticking to the ground, but it's definitely snowing today in
Tokyo.  That reminds me:

### Ice Barefoot Challenge

Are you ready for the ice bucket challenge of barefooting?  Saturday
February 1st our walk from Hikarie will have a new fantastic ending at
a foot bath in Dogenzaka.

〒150-0043 東京都渋谷区道玄坂２丁目２８−３ 道玄坂クラトスビル８階

I am planning to preview the foot bath this coming Tuesday, January
21st, in the afternoon.

We will meet in Hikarie and walk to the foot bath, with a route
optimized for the temperature..  possibly inside all the way to 109.
