We had a great time today at
[Byron Bay in Nihobashi](https://www.meetup.com/English-coffee-more/events/267921145/)!
3 people cancelled at the last minute, so we were 4 people all
together.

We had a great time talking, drinking, snacking, and enjoyed beef pie
and lemon bars!

I forgot to take pictures.  D'oh!  But I have the memories and look
forward to future events, hopefully with Giselle, who started the
whole
[English&amp;Coffee + More](https://www.meetup.com/English-coffee-more)
group!
