1. Happy New Year 2020!
2. This year my resolution is to lead 24+ workshops.  At the current
   rate I am on track to do 36.  1/10th of the way through the year,
   but.
3. Last night I
   [made](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/38)
   [good](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/39)
   [progress](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/41)
   [solving](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/42)
   [issues](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/43) on
   [ConSwi](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/), some issues of
   which I created and immediately fixed.
4. I still have not solved the issue regarding
   [ending the level if it cannot be won](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/6),
   but I have at least simplified it by splitting into a new issue the
   need to
   [add a Swipe detection algorithm](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/40)
5. I miss getting to see Lin very much; she has been working a lot
   recently and our schedules have only slight overlap.  We had a nice
   synchronicity getting on the same train on the way home on Thursday
   night.  We texted each other on the way home and were just one car
   apart.
6. I started a newsletter in which I plan to talk about
   [the process of leading 24+ workshops this year](https://tinyletter.com/barefootrob).
   The next mailing will likely start with "...procrastination is an
   issue with managing our emotions, not our time."
7. My workshops may seem varied but they are all designed to inspire
   self awareness in the participants, and ultimately encourage people
   to stay in line with their purpose or mission in life.
8. I was recently invited to speak at a workshop for women's
   empowerment.  Yesterday I talked with my friend and [speaker coach Soness](https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/)
   about preparing for the presentation, so I have homework to do
   before I speak with her again this coming Friday.
9. This coming Saturday February 1st is my next ~~workshop~~ walkshop:
   [Ice Barefoot Challenge and foot bath](https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Sol-barefoot-more/events/268007806/).
   I went to the foot bath spa a couple weeks ago to confirm we could
   go.  We've got a reservation at 2:30pm.  For now just me and Anuj.
   I hope more people join!
10. Ah that reminds me I have slacked at inviting people to workshops,
    and I need to write up the different workshop offerings for my
    website. To that end, Michael from men's circle has been looking
    for an accountability partner for me in this venture.
11. I studied Japanese with a new teacher, まなみ先生。 She seemed
    really intrigued with
    [Marble Track 3](http://mt3s.marbletrack3.com/) which reminds me I
    need to get [Marble Track 3](https://www.marbletrack3.com/)
    website looking cooler.  I wonder about hiring the guy who quoted
    $4000 to make it awesome and maintainable.  Using Airtable, but I
    am hesitant to use a 3rd party like that.  Still not sold on the
    idea.
12. Next coming Saturday February 8th Shinobu and I will do our first
    [Your Art Matters](https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Sol-barefoot-more/events/267844657/) event, where artists get to share their art
    in an intimate setting.  We will offer feedback and/or
    encouragement, as each person desires.  Adding accountability if
    people want to work on art during the month and show off their
    skills on the next Second Saturday of the month, March 7th.
13. I just remembered recently that 2020 is a leap year!
14. I made a bridge for Jennie to walk from our balcony to Lin's room
    window.  She has not used it yet, but hopefully in the Spring she
    will be willing to do so.
15. I am in the middle of revamping my site again, augmenting it with
    pages for About, FAQ, Services, etc.  Super thanks to Deneys and
    Erik both for helping with that endeavor.
16. In MT3 news, I just finished the Caret Splitter Rudder Flutter.
    Marbles arriving at the
    [Caret Splitter](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret-splitter/)
    are sorted with the
    [Caret Splitter Rudder](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret-splitter-rudder/),
    which is attached to the
    [Caret Splitter Rudder Lever Spinner](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret-splitter-rudder-lever-spinner/),
    atop of which will be the
    [Caret Splitter Lever](https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret-splitter-lever/).
