Today Yasu guided us for 40 minutes at Toshiba Science Museum, and
then kindly used his free time to show us the automatic ticket gate.

Pictures coming soon!

Great to see Miyuki, Yuki, and Rie at the front desk, and the director
and someone else came to greet Ma and Madeleine.  So thankful to
everyone for the nice welcome!
