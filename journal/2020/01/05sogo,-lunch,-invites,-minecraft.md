SOGO Bootcamp welcome to the new decade with crystal clear sky and
great community of people.  I met Jason, new to SOGO, but been in
Japan (Tokyo?) for 4 years.

After SOGO, Ma, Madeleiene and I met Lin near her workout place and
ate lunch at the local grocery store which has an eat-in space.

I invited him and several other peeps on FB to the next Barefoot
Walkshop this coming Saturday, my first of the new year!
