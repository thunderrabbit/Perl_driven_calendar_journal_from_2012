Lin and I are on the shinkansen headed home as Ma and Madeleiene have
an extra night in Hiroshima.  It seems we didn't plan things too
smartly; they barely have time tomorrow to do anything, but we had a
big full day today going to Miyajima and the Peace Memorial Museum.

I hadn't been to Miyajima before, though janette and I had intended to
go when we were here some 15 years ago.  Our schedule got delayed so
we decided to skip it and travel around the city a bit more.  Great
fun times!

Anyway, this time, the big red gate thing is under renovation so we
enjoyed the deer and chilled in a bengal cat cafe.

I bought a ticket for myself to go into the Peace Museum, but bounced
out after the first room.  All those feels are more than I wanted to
feel so I was like "peace out!"

I joined Lin on a park bench overlooking the river.
