Headed to Akihabara now for my second trial lesson with OT.  After the
first lesson, I had no doubt they would sign up for a full course.
Today I have a bit of a headache so I am looking forward to a nice nap
before the lesson starts at 3pm It's only 9:22 now.  I'll get to
Akihabara by 9:45 and hopefully be in an internet cafe to sleep by 10.
