Yuna and I were planning to do a workshop, something like bring a
bunch of book lovers together to talk about favorite books or parts of
books or something.

We got bogged down in those details so today decided to simplify and
just meet in a coffee shop and chat in English.

In addition to the above not-yet-planned workshop, I have 3 workshops
scheduled.

January 11th, Saturday: Barefoot walkshop (Shibuya)
January 13th, Monday: Past Life Memories (Dogenzaka)
February 23rd, Sunday: Eye gazing (Jiyugaoka)

Now kinda planned

January 25th, Saturday: English chat and coffee (TBD)
