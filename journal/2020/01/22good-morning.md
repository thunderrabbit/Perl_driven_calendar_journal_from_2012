'sabit chilly today walking barefoot to Solid Square from Kawasaki
station.  I did not really notice the cold while riding TJ Bike from
home (once I got started).

Bag heavier than normal today because of aforementioned
non-productivity and too many dang projects, plus our game in Godot,
which I just remembered I am supposed to get something done by Friday.

And I brought a clock as a Christmas gift to JB; it listens to the
radio signal and keeps "perfect" time.  So curious that I am so
fascinated with time.

I am at S in Solid Square, now 4 minutes into the lesson with no
students yet.  I'm glad because it makes the actual work time shorter
(I still leave on time) and I get to write in my journal or whatever I like.
