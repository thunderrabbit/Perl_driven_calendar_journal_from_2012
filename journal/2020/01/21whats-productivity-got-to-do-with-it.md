Though I did my Big 3 today (write eye gazing description for Joanna,
Livestream MT3 construction, and attend MKP circle), I didn't do my
morning routine so today felt off.

I didn't get any of the other things done like AB or write an SOML or
invite people to my next eye gazing workshop, or contact Lughn to get
her Japanese write-up and confirm with her that we can do it in her
place.

Beautifully, Joanna connected me with an organizer who has invited me
to speak at their event!

And after the men's circle, Michael invited me to write a list of the
stuff I need to do, but have trouble doing.  He's going to see if he
can match me with a business partner.
