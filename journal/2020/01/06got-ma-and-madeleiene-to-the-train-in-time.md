We left 15 minutes later than planned due to ママ attempting to make
things easier by calling a taxi.  We ended up taking a bus because
taxis were too busy.

I am glad we left when we did; we had plenty of time and leisurely
walked to the bus, then leisurely to 小田急線 train.  Leisurely to the
ticket gates in 新宿駅, and then a teeny bit less
leisurely to the 中央線 and fortunately *just* made the train at
11:37am in 新宿。

Plenty of time arrival in Tokyo but then I realized I had very limited
experience getting on bullet trains in Tokyo station.  I scurried down
the escalator and found which way to head toward the bullet trains.
Got to the area and asked a guy who pointed us in the right direction
for the green signs, not the blue signs.  (I do not yet know the
difference.)

Got to the green sign area and I snuck in the gate as the station guy
helped them figure out which tickets to use.  I found platform 22 and
hauled my backpack and Madeleiene's suitcase up the stairs.  No time
to look for an escalator!

Got to the platform and the train was there.  Fortunately, unlike the
のぞみ trains we were on toward 広島, this train spent a few minutes
at the station.  We were 6 minutes ahead of the departure by the time
they got on the train.

Oh nice plenty of time.  Super appreciate the grace and guidance
getting them to their train.

Snuck my way back out of the ticket gates as the guy was busy with
other travelers.  I judge it was not worth their busy time to help me
buy a 150 yen entry ticket.  I plan to buy the correct ticket next
time.
