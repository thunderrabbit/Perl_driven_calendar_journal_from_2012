After Mark challenged my thinking that I "have to" work on my website,
I left my computer for greener pastures, specifically, the indigo
tie-dye place near 民家園!

The staff were really friendly, and showed me some things they had
worked on today.  I was surprised to find out they were not staff at
all, but customers!  C and R showed me their dyed scarf and socks,
respectively.

Another neat coincidence, they used marbles to make patterns in the
cloth!  I had a marble and was thrilled when they wanted to see my [marble
track video](https://mt3s.marbletrack3.com).  High fives were
exchanged and we went to a nearby museum!  tbh, I kinda invited
myself, not knowing what would happen.

The museum was great!  We saw art that got cooler and cooler with each
room, arriving at a room with electrified pieces including a foot tall
train engine with a light on top which illuminated houses on stills
that made great shadows on the walls!

I had to bounce earlier than C and R, so gave them hugs and hope to
see them again sometime.
