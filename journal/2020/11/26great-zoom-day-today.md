Several Zoom meetings today including with a new man who will join the
MKP group this Tuesday, Laurens who wrote my
[favorite dream journal](https://oneironotes.com/), and soon with two
people joining me for [Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/).

WWOOWWWW  SO GREAT!!!  I am super happy with the session tonight.

We explored three points in our Life Timeline and discovered our
deepest desires.
