<p class='dream'>Sitting with Meg C during the test, we were supposed to write answers for about 100 prompts, but I couldn't read them clearly the second time.  I just saw that she was writing and I couldn't remember what to write.</p>

<p class='dream'>Time passed and it started raining so we packed up our stuff and I put mine in a woven purple plastic basket.  I looked for a safe place to put my basket and ended up tucking it in between some cabinets and the wall near a door.</p>

<p class='dream'>Going through that door, I saw a 3D art project on the wall, which was a bust of the hair of the artists, Phat Pat and Padre Donut.</p>
