Today at noon I got to see last night's 7:00 pm Flapper's Comedy show live!  Nice how timezones work out!

Thanks to Soness for inviting me; her set was great!  Her set has developed nicely and she smoothly covered a wide range of topics, pulling them together from lived experience.

Dana also had me rolling; I loved her use of the word "boo" as a verb, and how accurately she described natural death during the pandemic.
