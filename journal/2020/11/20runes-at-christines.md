Hanging out with Christine today, I chose two runes from a set which she got from Norway.

I had stated the topic is **my offering in terms of my livelihood like workshops and such that I'm doing**.

I first chose Raido and then chose Tyr Reversed.

In Christine's notes they mean rhythm and victory.

This lends itself nicely to what Rin and I were talking about today: needing to consistently promote our workshops before they come.

In [my copy of Ralph H Blum Book of Runes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312007299/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3) they are Raido and Teiwaz Reversed.

#### Raido

<span class="rune raido" />

    This rune is concerned with communication, with the attunement of
    something that has two sides, two elements, and with the ultimate
    union that comes at the end of the journey, when what is above and
    what is below are united and of one mind.

    Inner worth mounts here, and at such a time you are not intended to
    rely entirely on your own power. Instead, ask what constitutes right
    action. Ask through prayer or meditation, through addressing the
    Witness Self, the Teacher Within. Not intent on movement, be content
    to wait; while you wait, keep on removing resistances. As the
    obstructions give way, all remorse arising from trying to make things
    happen disappears.

    The journey is toward self-healing, self-change and union. You are
    concerned here with nothing less than unobstructed, perfect union. But
    the union of Heaven and Earth cannot be forced. ...

    Another of the Cycle Runes, Raido carries within its form the Rune of
    Joy, for now the end is in sight. You are no longer burdened by what
    you've left behind. Heaven above you and Earth below you unite within
    you to support you on your way.

<span class="rune teiwaz reversed" />

    The danger is that through hasty or ill-timed action, life force
    leaks out or is spilled away. If an association is short-lived, do
    not grieve; know that it has fulfilled its span.  Matters of trust
    and confidence are at issue here, and with them the authenticity
    of your way of being in the world.

    Reversed, Teiwaz calls for examining your motives carefully.  Is
    it self-conquest with which you are concerned, or are you trying
    to dominate another? Are you lusting after outcomes, or are you
    focused on the task for its own sake?

    You will find the answers within yourself, not in outside advice.
    When you consult the Runes, you are consulting the Self, an action
    appropriate to the Spiritual Warrior.
