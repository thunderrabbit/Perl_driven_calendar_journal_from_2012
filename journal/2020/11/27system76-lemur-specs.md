Super excited about getting my new computer soon.  A new System76
Lemur.  I went for their Pop! OS because why not, and they said it's
better than Ubuntu, and I can probably just overwrite the OS if I
don't like it.

It has 1.5TB storage across two SSD drives, 40GB RAM, etc:


    United States Keyboard
    WiFi 6 + Bluetooth
    14.1" Matte 1080p FHD Display
    Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics
    Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS (64-bit) with full disk-encryption
    4.7 GHz i7-1165G7 (12MB Cache – 4 Cores – 8 Threads) +$199
    40 GB DDR4 at 3200MHz (8GB+32GB) +$235
    500 GB PCIe Gen4 Seq Read: 6,900 MB/s, Seq Write: 5,000 MB/s +$129
    1 TB PCIe Gen3 Seq Read: 3,500 MB/s, Seq Write: 3,300 MB/s +$255
    External USB DVD-RW Drive +$55

Total is ~$2500 including tax and shipping to Japan.  Less than my
MacBook Pro in 2012.

Same price as our IBM PC in 1981!

    CPU 	Intel 8088 @ 4.77 MHz
    RAM 	16kB or 64kB (expandable to 256kB)
    Video 	IBM four color Color Graphics Adapter
    Input 	IBM Model F 83-key keyboard with five-pin connector
    Sound 	Single programmable-frequency square wave with built-in speaker
    Storage Up to two 5.25", 160K/320K (single/double sided) floppy disk drives
    Optional hard disk drive
