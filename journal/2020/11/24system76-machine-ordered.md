    System76 creates a unique 5-alphanumeric code located within the
    company description field associated with the amount charged to
    your credit/debit card. To locate this code, please login to your
    online statement (or call your card issuer) to retrieve the
    requested code and reply to this email to verify your order.


I called my CC company but they say they don't have the information
yet, and either cannot ever give it to me, or cannot give it to me
now.  (I didn't understand the Japanese exactly.)

So I wrote to System76:

    Hi System76 team

    Just to let you know I am having trouble getting this number. It
    will apparently be on my statement that I will receive in late
    December 2020, so fully a month away.

    If there is any other way to validate the order in a shorter
    timeframe, I'd certainly be open to trying!

    Have a great day.

Writing this journal entry is my attempt at confirming its a
legitimate order.  Credit card name matches the website name and email
address.
