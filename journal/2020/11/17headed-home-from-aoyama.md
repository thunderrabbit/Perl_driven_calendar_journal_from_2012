Lesson in Aoyama was good today. We played a game but I must say I can probably do something more aligned with my heart in the 3.5 good it takes me to commute and do the lesson.

I'm super frustrated with the trains today because it seems like took the wrong train going home.  Semi-Express apparently means slow af.

Note to future me: take the Rapid Express from Omotesando, even if it leaves 7 minutes later than the Semi Express.
