title: 'Dream welcome to SOGO in floating tram'

<p class='dream'>Walking outside with Lin along some sculpted hills with fences on top, I saw a guy washing the concrete with a hose and he was wearing a fancy rubber mask with filter. I reflexively pulled my bandana up a bit for appearances and then Lin and I went to a building with elevator where a guy was talking to the elevator passengers, welcoming them to SOGO.  I took notice as we walked up the stairs to one of the tram cars floating across the field.</p>

<p class='dream'>Seated next to a young woman I was shy to talk to her until we each heard the announcement like it was our chance to relax and chat with friends.  I smiled and we talked a bit as the tram floated over the field with people playing soccer below.</p>
