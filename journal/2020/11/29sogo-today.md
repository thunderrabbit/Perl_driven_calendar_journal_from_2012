Beautiful weather for SOGO today.  Over 100 people in attendance,
nearly all with masks.  I met Saki who said she and her sister were
entertained by my crazy dancing last week.

Today is the day I ran toward the middle of the big grass field
instead of to the rocky area around the tree.  My bare feet chose not
to bear the rocks today!
