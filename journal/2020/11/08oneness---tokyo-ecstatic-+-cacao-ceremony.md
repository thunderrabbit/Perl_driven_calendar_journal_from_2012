<br/>What is Ecstatic Dance?
<br/>ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
<br/>Ecstatic Dance is where you explore yourself in a safe space to dance without talking, drinking and the nightclub vibe.
<br/>This is a space where you give yourself permission to be YOU and explore YOUR OWN movement.
<br/>
<br/>This is NOT a space for you to
<br/>❌"look cool"
<br/>❌"get girls / guy"
<br/>❌"feel not enough"
<br/>❌"feel I have to be superior than others"
<br/>❌ This is NOT a space for you to compare yourself with others.
<br/>
<br/>This is a space where you GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION to
<br/>🤗 explore who you are
<br/>🤗 explore what movement feels good for you
<br/>🤗 reconnect with you body
<br/>🤗 love your body
<br/>🤗 celebrate your spirit

I had a super great time at Rin's Ecstatic Dance and Cacao Ceremony.
She has a way of creating a great vibe for people to relax and support
each other in being authentic to themselves.

Great to reconnect with Rin, Hiro, Raveen, Miyako.   Great to meet
Mieko (great eye contact and hugs!), Anna, Aya, and 4-year-old Mihana
who got the precocious award.

Super fun to "dance" with Mihana, which often consisted of running
sideways with her as we dodged and weaved between other ecstatic
dancers.  It was such a moment of *flow* as I felt completely focused
on her **and** on the ever-changing boundaries of bodies around us as
we danced.
