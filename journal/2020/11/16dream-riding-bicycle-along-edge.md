title: 'dream riding bicycle along edge'

<p class='dream'>Riding my bicycle along the sidewalk and then up some stairs there were three steps at a time and then after a while going to the right there had been people near the places with three steps I was able to ride up and then I'm going to the right a Panera ledge and a set kept getting thinner and then it stopped at someone's apartment balcony.</p>

<p class='dream'>Another guy on a bicycle was more ambitious and exploring to where he could ride his bicycle even past the balcony to go up into the apartment roof and I decided to ride back down because what he was doing was too dangerous to do so I wanted to go back down but I was impressed with his enthusiasm to keep going.</p>

<p class='dream'>He got off his bicycle and jumped up onto the railing to peer over the top of the place to see if there was anything to see and how far he could go.</p>

<p class='dream'>On my way back down the edge was so narrow that I couldn't go down safely and I was afraid of falling.  I couldn't figure out how I had gotten up there along the same edge but it looked like it had not changed and I remembered some of the same places.</p>

<p class='dream'>Looking down at the edge of the wood I could see how someone had tried to cut the wood so that there was literally no edge to ride on but a couple of places had broken so there was no edge and I was able to ride across those on the way up apparently.  There was just no way to keep my balance with bicycle on such a narrow edge and the wall on the left hand side on my way down.</p>

<p class='dream'>Looking down at the floor where I would land if I fell I saw a woman do a front handspring and was impressed with her strength and ability to do the stunt.  Then I realized it was possible to add some handholds so I did that and was able to get down without incident.</p>

<p class='dream'>I went to talk to the woman doing gymnastics and complimented her on her front handspring so she did it once again and then showed me how to do it so I did the same and it was okay.  then she showed me how she was able to do it without fear and did a backflip faceplant and was uninjured because the blue bouncy floor was so gentle.</p>
