I walked by some guys who were putting in a new street lamp like for
pedestrian lighting and then I saw they had some traffic lights in the
back of their truck.

On the way back, I watched the guy put finishing touches on this new
crosswalk installation.

Interesting to see how he strapped his ladder to the pole before
climbing it.  Once he climbed, he strapped himself to the pole before
doing any work.

He opened the wingnut-locks on the left to open the face of the signal
to pull taught the cable which goes into the lower arm supporting the
signal.  I did not see him secure the taughtness of the cable, so I
wonder if someone could pull the cable under the arm to make it sag
again.

Once this signal was placed, three guys went to different parts of the
intersection to test the buttons and watch the signals change.  Once
they saw them working, everyone came back and then two guys with
different uniforms had the signal guy sign some paper and then
everyone was on their way.

Nearby, this cloud looked kinda like Godzilla.

No houses yet where they cut down all the trees.
