Today I glued the csferlrp into place.

Overall, the prices went well, but there is a continuity error and I had to delete 7 frames to keep the error from being worse.

Just before I glued the piece, I turned reversible guy around and hit the caret splitter switch rotator thing.  I forgot to fix it back and didn't notice for like 10 frames.  I couldn't wipe all the frames because the piece was glued by the time I noticed.

Mr Greene got the large green marble under ell with help from CM.  Now he's inspecting ellg to see what needs to be done there.

That's one of the things I have to figure out sooner than later.
