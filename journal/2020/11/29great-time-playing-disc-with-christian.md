I'm headed early (9:15) to SOGO to meet a man who contacted me after
hearing about MKP Japan.  He also mentioned being interested in Wim
Hof's work so perhaps we'll talk about that as well.

Gratitude in advance as well for my fingers catching the disc properly
in this cold weather!

##### 12:01

Christian and I met at 9:15 and threw his 160 gram disc for about an
hour total.  Anuj and Kono each joined us when they arrived before
SOGO started.

We played right up until Emi shouted "good morning" to the SOGO group today.

'twas quite clear that Christian has better accuracy and more variety of throws than I do.

My fingers did pretty well, with only minor bruising on the tips of my
middle finger and ring finger on my right hand.
