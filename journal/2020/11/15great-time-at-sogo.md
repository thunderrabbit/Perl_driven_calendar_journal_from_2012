The weather was beautiful and we had a great turnout at SOGO today.

With Emi's great music
([Endor "Pump it up"](https://youtu.be/Ux6TEz4LoqQ)) during the squat
portion of her group, I was dancing and enjoying the stretch and burn
of the squats.  I was surprised because it was the last group of the
day, but the music was so bumpin' I couldn't help but dance.

Alex (Sach) and I walked to IKEA to grab food from their food court
area on 2F then brought it back to the park to eat with other SOGO
peeps, Kino, Sean, Hide, and a woman whose name I don't know.

During the running section, Haruna and I talked a little bit.  She
asked me questions about going barefoot and I answered the best I
could. She asked questions I haven't really thought about like how
thick The soles of my feet are. One of my answers was basically that
there's a sort of maximum amount of injury that my feet get in Tokyo
so they don't need to be tougher than that.

This is the day that Lin was working in the area so I walked over to
near the snake cafe and she drove us home from there.
