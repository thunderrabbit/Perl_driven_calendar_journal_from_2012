I'm chilling near the SCC in a new building with a public lounge of sorts.  They recommend gurgling [sic] to prevent infection.

I'm pretty sorta kinda ready for the livestream tonight. I've got a strong sense of the overview and will fill in more after work today.

Regain Control of Your Life tonight at 7pm!
