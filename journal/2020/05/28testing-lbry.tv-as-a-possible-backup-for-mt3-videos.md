I just found out about lbry.tv (after someone apparently got their YT
account hacked due to some bogus copyright infringement shite.)  I
have had bogus copyright strikes before, and since YT has like 400
hours of video uploaded per minute, I can understand they don't have
enough humans to check all that content.  Fair enough.

I already pay YT to get rid of ads and be able to play audio only with
my phone closed.

Anyway, apparently this lbry.tv site has a reward system and I can get
a taste of the content if I prove I am a human.  I wrote to their
humanity-checking bot

and the bot replied something like

https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2020/2020_may_28_lbry.tv_rewards_proof_2.png

and I took a screenshot and tagged it to prove it's mine.

For some reason that rhymes with rocrastination, I have decided to do
all this instead of just point them to my FB profile at https://www.facebook.com/thunderrabbit
