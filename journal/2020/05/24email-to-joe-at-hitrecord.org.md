    Hi Joe
    
    Thank you for creating hitrecord.org. I think it's a pretty neat
    idea. I've been creating a project for the last 3 1/2 years.. It's a
    stop motion animation project. At this point I've spent 450+ hours on
    it and at least 1000 thousand more hours to go.
    
    Because I am a newbie on hitrecord.org, it will take me a minute
    before I am comfortable with posting my content there. You can see
    what I have so far http://mt3s.marbletrack3.com/
    
    I'm interested in finding people who can create sound effects and
    change the blue background to be a grassy field with the tree.
    
    How well can I keep directive control while outsourcing some of the
    bits to hitrecord community?
    
    best regards
    Rob Nugen
