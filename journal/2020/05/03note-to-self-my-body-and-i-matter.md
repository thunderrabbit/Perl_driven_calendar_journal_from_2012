(written Monday 18 May 2020 JST)

On April 30th, I was able to process some anger in my men's circle.  I
ended up denting my desk in the process, and came up with the
affirmation "I fucking matter!"

I wrote the affirmation around the dent so I could remember it.

[![i fucking matter](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2020/2020_apr_30_my_body_and_i_fucking_matter/thumbs/i_fucking_matter.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2020/2020_apr_30_my_body_and_i_fucking_matter/i_fucking_matter.jpg)

I added the date because I like to do that kind of thing, especially
for relatively permanent things like dents in wood and ink drawn into it.

Then came the deeper level of work.  I grounded myself in my body to
let the anger have a voice and found it was *my body* that was feeling
angry at being cooped up in front of the fucking computer all the
time.  I need to go outside and play!

So I added **that** to the message.  Now it is a reminder,
affirmation, and stretch all at the same time.
