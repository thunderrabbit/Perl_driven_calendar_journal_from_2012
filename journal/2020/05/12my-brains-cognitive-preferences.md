I am Associative preferent.

My competitive advantage is for rapid, integrative thinking. I respond effectively to predictable randomness: the things life sends to each of us, we just canâ€™t be sure when. I let my experience and training take the lead when making decisions under pressure.

### Asset ###

* Managing predictable randomness
* Integrating context with experience
* Recognizing patterns
* Understanding big picture

### Hazard ###

* Keeping track of time
* Screening out distractions
* Holding convergent focus and attention
* Respecting rules and processes

### Developing my attention ###

Much of life requires us to focus on one thing at a time in order to see it through to completion.

* Take a deep breath
* Center on the task in front of you
* Close out any distraction I can: email pop ups, message alerts, phone sounds
* Create a signal for colleagues that I am concentrating so they avoid interrupting
* Acknowledge and accept the slow pace
* Stop when I lose focus and am struggling to get it back
* Step away from the task
* Repeat the above after an interval
