Last night after the Weekly Alignment, I went through the audio to
clear out parts not of general interest, and decided to try a
transcription service instead of going through https://otter.ai

Looking through the list at
https://www.techradar.com/best/best-transcription-services I tried the
first two, but they want payment through credit card, even if I go
through PayPal.

https://www.rev.com/ was more expensive but allowed me to pay with my
PayPal balance so I went for that option.  $17 to transcribe
[Weekly Alignment - Releasing old
energy](/blog/2020/12/24/weekly-alignment-releasing-old-energy/).

The output format had a standard cadence of a paragraph break every 3
minutes. The output did not match the natural pauses in the
meditation.  There were some comma splices and missing question marks
terminating questions.

I also sent the same audio to https://www.temi.com/ which apparently
ran it through an AI (Otter?) and pooped out a version which more
correctly matched the natural pauses in my speech.

I think next time I will go with Temi.  So far it's a tossup between
them and Otter.
