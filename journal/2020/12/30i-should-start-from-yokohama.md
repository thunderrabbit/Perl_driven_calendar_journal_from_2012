Looking at [the map of my
walk](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/hadashiusagi/ckja1jhvm3g781amsnxq7w2n3.html?fresh=true&title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaGFkYXNoaXVzYWdpIiwiYSI6ImNramExOW51bjBvY2wyeW4wdnV4OTYwZzcifQ.Yfa2ZHD9hY1JCuKJm7V-Xw),
I just realized I should start from Yokohama, which adds just 5
additional walking hours, and allows me to say I walked from one side
of the island to the other.   It is apparently just an hour from Niigata station to the coast, or we can simply change the final destination...

I can start walking from Yokohama's Rinko Park On Monday April 12th,
then keep all the other dates the same.
