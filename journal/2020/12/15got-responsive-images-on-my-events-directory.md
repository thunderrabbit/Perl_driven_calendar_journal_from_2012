Hey Hide (and Travis, too)!  Thanks to your inspiration for NOT using
Facebook, I have created an /events directory which now shows
[my upcoming events](/events/)!

For [Weekly Alignments](/weekly-alignments/), it is not clear to me if
I should put them in /weekly-alignments or /events because they are
both types, and Google apparently encourages having a canonical URL for
identical content.
