I am on the edge of outsourcing some of the edits I made to my repo.
I have added PS to the commit message for two commits

I want to hire someone who can add links to convert "upcoming" Weekly Alignments 
to "past" weekly Alignments with links to my blog entries with the
content from the alignment.

I almost guess the above could be done with some clever scripting but
there are language tweaks as well so not sure.

It's easier to describe this change: I am looking for someone to clean
up the transcript here with nice linebreaks, and correct punctuation
and spelling.
