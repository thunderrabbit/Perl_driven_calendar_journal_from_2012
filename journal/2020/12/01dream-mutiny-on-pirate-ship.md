title: 'dream mutiny on pirate ship'

<p class='dream'>Sailing on a pirate ship, l was in some kind of mutiny and we were going to take over the ship. we deployed some life rafts and then made a mistake regarding life rafts and then sounded an alarm and all of the life rafts were automatically deployed so the sailors on the ship found themselves in life rafts as they woke up from the alarm. we were therefore able to keep them from getting onto the ship as we got into the ship.  There was a fight for the ropes hanging down at the bow, and we got to it first and were trying to lift it up but they kept getting onto it so we had to lift it and drop it and shake them off and try to keep them from climbing up the rope.  My leg was hanging down over the edge of the boat as I was fighting and I realized my leg was at risk because if they started to attack my leg I would pull back and lose the position of being able to control the height of the rope.  That started me thinking about safety of myself and the sailors and wondered if they had any kind of program to keep them safe or keep them insured.</p>

<p class='dream'>Switched to a scene  inside where one of them filed a complaint with their employer saying that they were having to fight too much at risk of their own personal safety because according to their contracts they wouldn't have to have a long-term fight. The person listening to the complaint was trying to weigh the best options when I woke up.</p>
