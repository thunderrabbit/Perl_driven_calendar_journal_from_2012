Last night, my Japanese teacher Sanae and I went to Yomiuriland to see
the illumination.  She refused to ride roller coasters, but the lights
were nice and the car construction ride in Good Job Attractions now
features VR goggles and is fantastic.  We rode it twice in a row,
wanting to see both VR stories.
