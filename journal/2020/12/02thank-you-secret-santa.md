I have been taking
[Dmitri Belgere's The Inspiration Process](https://www.dmitrib.com/story-course)
and got an anonymized compliment!

    Rob is a truly phenomenal group member... Every time he brings so
    much support and positivity to the group meetings and plays an
    active role in driving conversations and helping everyone learn
    and develop. His openness and honesty helps to create a safe and
    engaging environment allowing others to share and open up more. He
    helps the entire group build better connections and grow by
    sharing and requesting suggestions and insights. Many members of
    the group bring so much but Rob stands as an example to us all of
    the impact that one person can have. Rob has been a big influence
    on what the group has become since our group first formed, I would
    like him to thank him for this.
