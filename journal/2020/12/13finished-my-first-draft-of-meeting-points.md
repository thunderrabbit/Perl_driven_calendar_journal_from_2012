I manually transferred to Google Earth the meeting points that I created on plotaroute.com for my walk to Niigata.

This idea came from Yuri, and it's better than my idea of having straight line segments that were misrepresentative of most of the trip.

Now I'm going to send the points to with friends and ask people to share it and offer ideas on some tweaks where I couldn't find a place to eat or sleep.

One big next step is to be able to update my website so I really need to get Micropub sorted out so I can do that.

I am posting this entry to my test website via micropub but I'm not yet able to update entries.
