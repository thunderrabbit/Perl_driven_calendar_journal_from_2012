Before I walk to Niigata, I want to be able to update my site via Micropub.  That includes

1. Save images to my image server
2. Be able to trigger builds on my web server (default behavior, but I've turned it off during testing)
3. Be able to [*not* trigger builds on my web server](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/micropub/issues/5)

Hopefully:

1. Allow me to name photos manually
2. Easily embed photos where I want in the written entries
