Thanks to Fred for helping me easily post audio onto my site, I
uploaded the fourth meditation today: *[Meditation for Mindfully Cleaning Your Physical Space](/blog/2020/12/05/meditation-for-mindfully-cleaning-your-physical-space/)*
which helped me clean my room while listening to it.

I just fed it through [Otter](https://otter.ai) now to help make a transcription.
