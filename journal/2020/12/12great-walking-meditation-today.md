Afterward, our
[12 noon Dec 12th walking meditation](/blog/2020/12/12/great-walking-meditation-today-dec-12th-at-12-noon/)
we three walked through the art store Seikaido, and I found a
hardcover blank book to act as the N+1st volume of my handwritten
diaries!  The new book will replace the soft cover one I found a few
days ago, because its pages are too thin and its cover too soft.
