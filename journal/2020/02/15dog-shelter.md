Stinky after going to a dog shelter place.  I was ready to leave after
30 minutes.  It was cool to see dogs, but it was gross as they were in
a too small area and outside all the time.  No grass to speak of, just
wet dirt.  I tried to be as chill as possible with them and love them
as best I could, but do not plan to go back.
