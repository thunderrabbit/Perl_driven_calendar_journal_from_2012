I just went to the bicycle parking lot and (unfortunately griped about
my tire being flat and un-inflatable last night) and when we tried
inflating it again to prove my point, it inflated fine.  I musta been
tired last night and not had the nozzle seated properly; I recall it
was just spewing air out.

Yay I am glad the tire is okay, and hope the guy I talked to doesn't
think I am too off my rocker. haha

Now Lin's bike is there as well, so I gotta bring two bikes back
tonight.  Looking forward to them having a total of four inflated
tires when I get back to the bicycle parking lot tonight.
