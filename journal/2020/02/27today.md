* BLB leaders meeting
* join Mohamed on Cyberknights
* work on Conswi (get win screen fixed)
* (x) TJ Bike tire repair
* SCC
* BP
* (no Akiko meeting)
* go home
* work on AB (some)

I chose to attend the online I-group because Mo said he'd be on.  That
means future me will have to get TJ Bike's tire fixed instead of past
me doing it for me already.
