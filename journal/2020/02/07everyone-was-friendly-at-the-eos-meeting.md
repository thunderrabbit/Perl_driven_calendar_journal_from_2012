At least 200 people at the EOS seminar today; everyone was nice and
somehow I am a bit famous due to being barefoot all the time.  I had
to leave before getting a chance to speak to anyone fluent in English
and in the business.  Still curious as to how involved I will be.  I
mean, primarily it could be a great way to practice Japanese...
