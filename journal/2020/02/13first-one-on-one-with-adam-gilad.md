Today I met Adam Gilad for our first one on one phone meeting.  He
shared about his history and answered questions to my satisfaction.
We had just 30 minutes for the call before a meeting with other
leaders who are taking his course.  The program is expanding as it
seems he just started it this year.

Bold Life Mastery Brotherhood something something and I am excited
about growing and learning and teaching.

I do not know exactly what it will look like, but my leading 36
workshops in 2020 seems to be right in line with leading workshops and
events for men to step into their heart mission.  I look forward to
taking bold steps forward!
