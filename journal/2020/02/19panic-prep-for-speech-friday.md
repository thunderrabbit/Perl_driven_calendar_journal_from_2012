My speech is in a couple days, and I am essentially ready.

* ~~Meet with Soness a few times to write the speech~~
* ~~Begin drawing line art to help me memorize it~~
* ~~Buy a phone holder for my tripod~~ (done today!)

Future me has a few things to do:

* Finish line drawings of all the chunks to augment memorization
* Finish creating a worksheet to augment audience understanding
* Ask organizers how many people are likely to attend
* Print the worksheet that many times
* Bring Francois
* Go and have a great time
* Set up camera before my speech
