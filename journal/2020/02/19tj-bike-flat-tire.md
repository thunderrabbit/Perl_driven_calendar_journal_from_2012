TJ Bike has a flat tire.  He was fine this morning and now the back
tire is completely flat.  Not just flat, but air gushes out of it when
I try to inflate it.

This happened about 2 or 3 months ago, and my cynical side assumes
someone is fucking with me.  To solve things, I am going to get
punctureless tires on TJ Bike.  Plus I have already wanted to have
punctureless tires for the convenience.

I am sitting at the bus stop now after leaving TJ Bike at the bicycle
parking lot.  I will address the flat tire with the staff tomorrow
(like I have time for that :-/ (I mean I do, but I'd rather be able to
focus on speech preparation)) Most of the staff know me as the genki
barefoot guy, so I hope to at least be understood / taken seriously.
