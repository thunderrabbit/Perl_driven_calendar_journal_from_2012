Happy Valentine's day!

I have been lazier than I expected.  Two Japanese lessons all fine and
dandy, plus going over my speech with Soness hooray, but also watching
3 episodes of Southpark with PC Principal story getting interesting.

Then I took a nap and now I am like dammit how did it get to be 9pm?
