I am just making a little note here to say I am still personally not
worried about *the coronavirus*.  Reactions to the outbreak are
beginning to affect me:

We don't have kids, so Lin and I are not directly affected by *all* public
schools closing in Japan. [1][2]

SCC will close for 2 weeks in March.  (They take holidays sometimes so
this is not unprecedented, but) I usually teach there once a week, so
it affects my income a bit.

Tariq and I were going to meet in Tokyo, but we are going to meet
online instead.

According to one of my students who works at Costco, they sell out of
masks in ten minutes every day they get masks in stock.

According to lin's sister, the stores are running out of toilet paper
because the virus apparently causes diarrhea.

The World Health Organization has a banner on their top page for it.[3]
