I am on the Louis CK mailing list ever since Feb 2016 when I bought
his show "[Live at Madison Square Garden](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/08/pay-what-you-want-for-louis-cks-new-live-album.html)" and his movie "[Tomorrow
Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_Night_(film))"

Tonight I happily read his email, hoping against hope he would mention
a show in Tokyo.

    New shows added to Louis CK tour
    
    Hello and a pleasant Wednesday to you. I am writing to tell you with
    my words that I have added some shows to my stand-up comedy "some of
    the world tour." Click on a linked city name to buy tickets to that
    show now.
    
    For instance, I added a late show in Philadelphia, a second show in
    Kiev, another in Bucharest, and I am coming to Binghamton and Syracuse
    New York and Berlin, which is in Germany.
    
    As for the rest of the tour, A bunch of the shows have sold out but
    there are still tickets to the shows in Tucson, Knoxville, and
    Copenhagen (three places that are wildly different from one another).
    
    I hope you can make it to a show.  Because I am in love with you.
    
    Oh fuck I almost forgot.  I’m also coming to Boston (which is in
    Massachusetts) Where I will be at the Orpheum theater on April 3 and
    4, Friday and Saturday, one show per night. Both shows are at 9 PM.
    
    Also always go to my website for updates on your information. Because
    I don’t want to bug you by email more than I have to. So sometimes
    there’s stuff there it doesn’t show up here.
    
    Ok.  That’s it.  I’m done.  With this email.  I still have other stuff
    to do.  For instance I am marinating some meat because tonight is taco
    night.  And I have to walk the dog.  And I’m reading a book in Spanish
    right now about a dead baby.  And I have a piano lesson today.  And at
    some point I’ll need to get some sleep.  Tomorrow I’m going to Denver.
    And then Phoenix.  Oh also I think there are still tickets to the
    Sunday show in Phoenix. (Friday and Saturday are sold out).  I’m
    excited to get back on the road.  I really enjoy performing standup
    comedy very much.
    
    Ok bye. See you. 
    
    Louis CK 
    
    PS I might be coming to South America to do shows in July.  Nothing
    certain yet.  Write to me here if you live there and want to come to a
    show and I’ll let you know if it happens.

My reply:

    Does Japan count as South America?
    
    Hello Mr CK
    
    I made eye contact with your words and got the sense that you are
    considering performing stand up comedy in the Americas of the South.
    
    I have been to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and even Alabama, but that
    was in the past, and your shows are presumably in the future.
    
    I live South of Tokyo, Japan, so if that counts as South America,
    please add it to your list. Actually, please just add it to your
    list and I look forward to laughing with you here.
    
      Thank you for being apparently real
      Rob
