1. I have nearly gotten Composer working comfortably in the ABB
   project.  Not yet on ABF.  This allows PHP static code analyzer
   phan/phan to run and find all the classes using PSR-0(?) rules.
2. phan/phan was still unable to find Codeception classes so I
   included Codeception with Composer, thereby "solving" 761 errors
   thrown by phan/phan.
5. Having phan/phan look for errors has kinda rekindled my ability to
   work on AB.  I enjoy this experience of having a huge TODO list
   where each item is clearly defined.
7. As of this writing, I am down to 60 SEVERITY_CRITICAL errors, down
   from about 90, not counting the 760 due to phan/phan not finding
   Codeception classes.
3. Nice.
4. I recently drew / scribbled with marker a line on TJ Bike's rain
   cover which allows me to more easily cover TJ Bike late at night
   when there isn't enough light for me to see the seams sewn in the
   cover.
6. Tonight my presentation class will be primarily covered by Japanese-fluent
   Eriko, but I will still get paid for the time.  She is going to
   talk shop about L-R and all the myriad vowel sounds in English
   which do not exist in Japanese.
8. I am on the second piece of tape which holds my bent computer
   closed.  I first used the first piece of tape on November
   21st 2019.  This one has the date on the bottom of my computer and
   seems more likely to last longer.  It started on 5 February 2020.
9. So the first one lasted ~ 10 + 31 + 31 + 5 days = 77 days.  That
   many days from February 5th is... 24 + 31 + 30 ... late April I
   think.
10. Lin and I live in Asao-ku in our first house we bought 3 years
    ago.  We have Jennie the cat and no kids.  Alex the plant's
    progeny have been repotted in four square pots, all of which are
    inside right now because it's supposed to freeze tomorrow or
    tonight.
11. I started a newsletter on tinyletter.
    https://tinyletter.com/barefootrob Michael asked what was the
    point, and I don't really know besides to follow the ups and downs
    of leading 24-make-that-36 workshops and "if I can do it you can
    do it"
12. Soness has been helping me prepare for a speech I will give on 21
    February at an event Riza invited me to.
13. Arriving in Kawasaki in a few minutes to teach at SCC, Liliko and
    them.
14. My website still ain't cool yet, but all I gotta do is just make
    my own todo list and start doing it.  Starting with posting the
    different things Erik wrote the a couple weeks ago.  He keeps
    delaying "checking what I wrote" because he is busy.  That is
    exactly why Menya said he hired peeps to do it instead of asking
    friends for handouts.
15. Tomorrow I am scheduled to go to an EOS event, which I am still
    not sold on.  I will be able to speak with some English speakers
    who are apparently sold on it to see if I can get some questions
    answered.  I keep overlaying Amway on it but I don't know if that
    accurately represents EOS.
16. I've been telling people I am fifty.  How weird to think omg that
    is old when I saw the "Lordy Lordy John is Forty" sign outside our
    neighbor's house, and now I have blown through that number like
    meh.
