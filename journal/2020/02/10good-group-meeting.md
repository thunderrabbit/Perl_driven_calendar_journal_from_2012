Today E facilitated me in my Monday night peer counseling circle.  My
work was actually about adjusting how I approach the circle.  In the
same time that the Tuesday circle has grown, the Monday circle has
remained the same size overall.

I am thinking as I get started with Adam's program, I may end up using
Monday nights for one of my new weekly sessions.
