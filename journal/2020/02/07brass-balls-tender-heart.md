I really like the presentation Adam did; the presentation spoke to me
in many ways.  Mainly that masculinity comes in all forms and does not
need to attack nor collapse in shame.  He addressed the #metoo and
related hashtags in a way that resonates with me.  I do not apologize
on behalf of men; I take responsibility for my own actions and model
respectful communication and behavior.

I ~~had to~~ **chose to** leave 30 minutes into the call so I could
attend the EOS group.  I could have stayed longer on the call I
realize now because 11:30 was just the meeting time, not the *meeting*
time, haha.  Anyway, I look forward to watching the replay and take
the next steps.

I emailed him at 12:50pm

    Hey Adam
    
    Thank you for putting together the presentation, and the entire
    program.  The first half hour was quite perfectly in line with
    what I'd like to get involved with.
    
    I look forward to watching the rest of your presentation and
    taking the next steps.
    
    Lots of fear come up for me around self worth especially when
    hearing no when reaching out to men.
    
    The MKP circle in Tokyo has grown steadily for four years.  I am
    beginning to mentor men in leading the circle. I look forward to
    continuing my growth in this process.
    
    Blessings

He replied just 7 minutes later.

    Great to hear from you!
    
    You already have the experience in leading!
    
    Now you just need the structure to turn that into the revenue you
    deserve.
    
    I'll have the replay up tmw - you will see how many ways you can monetize.
    1. Intro Nights.
    2. One off nights
    3. 1 Day Deep Dives 
    4. Weekend Workshops
    5. The ongoing circles
    6. Convert participants into coaching clients if you wish.
    
    As for "rejection" - we can talk about that. In my experience, the
    JOY that men feel doing these circles and the GRATITUDE
    obliterates the feelings around someone not wanting to play.
    Anyway, I don't believe in the concept of rejection.  That's a
    story built around two independent agents in the world.  Been
    teaching THAT around dating for years.
    
    I look forward to speaking with you and planting a flag in Japan.
    How exciting.
    
    Warmly,
    
    Adam

Excellent.  I am looking forward to the replay.
