Last night I played Werewolf in Japanese.  Very difficult for me to
follow the discussion but I learned some and know how to play better
next time.  I got some tips from some of the more talkative players,
one of whom had a huge win after being the only werewolf after the
other two werewolves were ousted in the first two rounds.
