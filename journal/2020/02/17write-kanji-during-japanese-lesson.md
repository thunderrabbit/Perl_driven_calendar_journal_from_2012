Today two (2) new students came to our table and I forgot to bring my
handouts from last time, so we were short on handouts for a bit.  To
save making another copy, I copied the Japanese by hand in my
notebook.

On the way out of C-Hall, I saw Hazel, one of the two new students.
(She's actually only in town for a minute so only planned to come two
weeks.  But next week there is no lesson so today was her first and
last day.)  I could not talk long, but we talked for a bit and I gave
her my MKP Japan card.

During my 1-on-1 lesson with Manami, she apparently read what I wrote
and did not suggest any fixes so I guess I wrote it well enough.
