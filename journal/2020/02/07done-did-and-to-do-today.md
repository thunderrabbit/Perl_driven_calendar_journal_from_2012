This morning I fixed a few more errors in AB, thanks to phan/phan.
Most of them are edge caes or code that is not longer (or never has
been) used, partially from not following YNGNI.

I have just freewritten text while on the train to Omotesando, and now
on Chiyoda line there.

Headed to EOS meeting to see if I can figure out if I want to quit or
continue or what.

Oh but before that I have an online thing with Adam regarding men's
circles.  He's prmoting the idea of leading men's circles as a way to
make money.  I have definitely put some time into leading circles so I
have enough experience.. I am just not yet well versed on the business
side of things.

After EOS I will meet Soness online to prepare for my speech on 21
February.  (The free writing was fodder for that.)

This evening I will head to 高田馬場 for a PB meeting with GET.  Let's
see how that goes!  Long time no see for all of them.  And Ayse will
be there too.
