One great thing about banks in Japan is that they update my bank book
for me.  No need to balance a checkbook here!  Well, there are no
checks here, but that is a separate issue.  Anyway, my bank book ran
out of pages so I went to the bank to get a new one.  I got in just in
time before 3pm when they shut the door while I was waiting.  Bingo
bango done and on the train by 3:08pm.
