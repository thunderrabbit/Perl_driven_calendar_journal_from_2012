Thanks to invitation via Joanna, I was one of about 8 speakers at
"[Beauty Boosting and Empowerment](https://www.facebook.com/events/454456011904316/)"
tonight in Shinagawa.

The organizers want to do something different than "just another
networking event."  To this end, the speeches were on an array of
topics, and at the very end, we all chose a date to meet for dinner.
I praised Riza for the idea and courage to get us all together
again. I have never seen that happen at a different networking event
(though tbh I have not been to very many).

Afterward, four of us went to a non smoking restaurant in Shinagawa
and chatted until about 11:30pm.  We all shared what brought us to
Japan and how it has been for us here.  Lots of conversation about
relationships and encouraging the youngest of us to travel before
focusing on relationships.

I scheduled a coaching call with Freya who coaches people how to open
their business.  Perfect timing for me.  Looks like I will get it done
this year!

Neat to hear us both grateful to have met the other; she had some
questions about dealing with emotions.
