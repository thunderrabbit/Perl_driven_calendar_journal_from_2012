Not Safe For Lunch:

Lin fell asleep and did not see it, but woke up as she heard me crying
after watching in horrifying slow motion multiple elephant seals
falling to their deaths after climbing up steep rocky slopes due to
not enough sea ice to chillax.

Netflix and cry my eyes out is more like it.
