This past Sunday was the first time for me to lead a workshop with an
interpreter.

I learned a lot.  The main thing that I did not realize was that
people wanted to sit with me.  I am just a personal like anyone else,
but because I am leading the circle, that somehow makes it different
to sit with me.

Smaller things include dealing with reciepts as far as possible before
the event so we can just write people's names on them.
