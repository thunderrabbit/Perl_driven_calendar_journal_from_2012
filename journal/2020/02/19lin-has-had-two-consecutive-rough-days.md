I have scheduled this 2021-02-19T22:48:30+09:00 so it will not be
immediately visible in my journal.  I want it to be buried and not
show up on the front page at that time, but anyway

She had a tough day yesterday with a client saying She betrayed her.
Now I know She better than the client and am quite certain She did not
intentionally do anything to betray this client.  She did admit She
has been overly busy at work so could have done something better, but
she basically works her ass off every day.  I know that.  I see that
all the time.

Then today she got a crazy email from her aunt.  WTF should this be
happening?

I am worried about She, and cannot chat with her right now as I am
writing because my phone is dead (because I played too much fucking
Best Fiends today and did not charge my phone).  Today is also the day
that TJ Bike got his second surprise flat tire in 2 or 3 months so I
am on the bus headed home.

I just replace-stringed She with She in this document.
