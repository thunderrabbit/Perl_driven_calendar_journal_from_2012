We had been in a restaurant and the staff didn't see us pay before we
went out so I went back to show the receipt which side table 11 on it
but the staff person didn't even look at the receipt.  I saw some
shirts for sale and since I was on vacation I wanted to buy a shirt so
I got a shirt and then continued up the stairs to go outside.

I apparently bought a silk top hat and as well because as I exited the
stairs and got up to the street and saw a friend of mine who was
shocked to see I had a hat that says burma on it and I ripped off them
Burma tag and said I didn't see the tag on the hat when I bought it
and I don't know anything about it and didn't know what happened there
she said there were political rights violations using dogs as
political weapons.
