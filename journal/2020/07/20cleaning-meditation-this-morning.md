This morning I attended the
[3rd Happy Days Meditation: cleaning](https://www.meetup.com/Consciousness-Hacking-Tokyo/events/271847249/),
hosted by Tanner and Yuuki, my first time to meet either of them.  I
got two (2) cubby holes in my shelf entirely cleared out, and another
section of shelf cleared out as well.  Super great progress for me!
