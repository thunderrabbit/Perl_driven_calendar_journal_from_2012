Today I facilitated a Mankind Project sanctioned protocol for an introductory men's circle.  This was our first one and it went well.  Most credit goes to those who wrote the protocol, who I imagine give credit to the team who wrote the virtual circle protocol, inspired in part by my first online integration group, Cyber Knights, started by three or four men, ~~one~~ two of whom have passed!
