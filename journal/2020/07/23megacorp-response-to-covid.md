SCC's reaction to covid includes putting two small (25cm x 50cm)
plastic shields between me and my students so the shield was about
50cm by 50cm with a gap in the middle.  We were asked to sit on
opposite sides of that.

Customers have to make reservations in advance, and *may not ask
questions* while inside.  They have to write their questions afterward
via email.  Staff may not face the customers, especially while speaking.

I almost want to quit; I certainly want to scream at the inanity.
