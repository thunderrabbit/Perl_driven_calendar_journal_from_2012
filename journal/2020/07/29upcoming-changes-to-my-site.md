Hmm I just noticed the CSS for dreams is broken.  I woulda thought that woulda been something I woulda thought of when I updated to the repo barefoot_rob.

I created an issue, 

https://github.com/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/issues/1

but I don't check those tickets so unsure when I'll remember to fix it.

I'm writing now via Quill, which will post to my Micropub server, which is working well enough to post entries that I plan to move robnugen.com from Netlify back to Dreamhost.

https://github.com/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/issues/2

later...  fixed!
