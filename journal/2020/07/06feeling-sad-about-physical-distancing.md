I have my doubts about the veracity of the reporting on the effects of COVID-19.

I wore a mask inside the bank today, and will wear it when I get to work. It's the same mask they gave me last week.  It's been chilling in the back pocket of my slacks since then, and may even have been washed while chilling in that back pocket.

I wore a mask but dang I hate it.  I hate seeing the security-theater plastic draping at every customer service interface.  It reminds me of the post 9/11 airport "security" dogshit they sold us which kept janette from hugging me at the gate on my way out of DFW in 2003.

I can basically understand sneeze shields at salad bars, but at a bank? It's such a waste.
