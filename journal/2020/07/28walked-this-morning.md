It's interesting to walk past things from different directions and
then be like "oh I've been here before!"

Today was the day I found an unused, folded, crushed-by-car-tires
plastic bag in the parking lot of a convenience store.  I opened it
and allowed it to dry out over a 15 or 20 minute period while I
walked.  Near いなげや in 南生田２丁目 I wrapped my todo notebook
"one" in the bag to keep it dry in case it started raining again on my
way back.

Also walked past Our City's 50 Trees to mourn their loss.
