Sent to Backblaze:

    I am on a relatively old MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) and kindof old OS X 10.12.6. I have been using Backblaze for two days now.
    
    * My keyboard mapping (https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) randomly stopped working for a while yesterday though I haven't had that problem for months.
    
    * I have had to powercycle my machine twice in two days since I started using Backblaze. I normally don't have problems that require powering off my computer.
    
    * Most recently, after my computer went to sleep, the password kept failing though I *know* I typed it correctly. (I tried both potential keyboard layouts.) I powercycled and logged in fine.
    
    * A couple of times I have seen problems appear like "too many filehandles open" (maybe just during initial backup).
    
    These are just little anecdotes, but could it be caused by Backblaze? How do I confirm it is *not* Backblaze?
    
    I am happy to send logs or use command line or the like if that helps debugging.
    
    best regards
