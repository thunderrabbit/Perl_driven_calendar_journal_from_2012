I'm headed to Machida to meet my KUMON Japanese teacher.

I have finished 50 of 200 pages she gave me last time (Unit E, I
think).  Today we are meeting sooner than normal because we couldn't
find a workable time ~20 days from our last meeting.  It's also a
chance for her to bring the kanji practice pages that I had previously
requested.

The only downside of KUMON for me is that the writing is so dang
small. I cannot fully see the details of complex kanji. I bought a
Grampa Lamp with light and magnifying glass, but it's still a bit of a
clumsy setup."

PS: This is the first entry I wrote with Quill, which wrote it
directly to my repo via my test server.  It was written to the data/
directory, but it's a start.
