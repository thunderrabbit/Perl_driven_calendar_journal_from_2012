I didn't bounce out of bed at 4:30am today, and my feet were more sore
walking this morning than starting out yesterday.  I did walk this
morning a bit and found the new construction crew has more effectively
blocked off all the entrances (including the pedestrian stairs in the
back) as they transition from tearing the old house to building a new
one.
