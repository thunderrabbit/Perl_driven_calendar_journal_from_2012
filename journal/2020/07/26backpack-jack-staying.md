From https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/2020/july/backpack-jack-staying/

Today I livestreamed for about 90 minutes, the last portion of which
Jimmy joined via the chat.  Most interesting today was deciding to
(probably) do a new weird thing with [Backpack Jack](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/backpack_jack/), who has arrived with a pair
of chopsticks in his backpack.  I locked the chopsticks in place with
a big clamp, and *might* have him slide off sideways to unload himself
from the chopsticks.

### Pros:

* I will be able to use the chopsticks sooner
* It's kinda funny / strange
* I get to expand the universe a bit

### Cons:

* There is no precedent for it.
* It's kinda funny / strange
* I have to think of a reason it was possible

In either case, for now, I can rest assured that he will neither fall
over, nor easily move, so he should stay rock solid in place until
it's time to move him again.

[G Choppy](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/g_choppy/) has just arrived on the misplaced piece, from where he will
cut the chopstick [Reversible Guy](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/reversible/) has brought in to be the base for the second
bridge.  [Little Brother](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/lil_brother/) has been spinning around and just got surprised to see [G Choppy](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/g_choppy/)
there; he will probably *not* do a backflip off the set, and instead
simply spin his way down the [Triple Splitter Small Feeder](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/triple-splitter-small-feeder/).

[Pinky](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/pinky/) is watching the small orange marble roll its way down [Lower Zig Zag](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/lower_zig_zag/) and
[Big Brother](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/big_brother/) is trying to place the [Triple Splitter Medium Catcher Ridge](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/triple-splitter-medium-catcher-ridge/), which [Mr McGlue](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/mr_mcglue/) will glue soon.  Now that
he has confirmed the small marble on the [Lower Zig Zag](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/lower_zig_zag/) can roll past the large
marble at the end of the [Triple Splitter](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/triple_splitter/), [Mr Greene](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/mr_greene/) will soon release the large marble to
roll down around the [Snake Plate U Turn](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/snake_plate_u_turn/) and then lift [el Lifty Lever](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/el-lifty-lever/) for the first time on
camera.

Hopefully I can work it out so the stage will rotate such that the
camera has a side view of [el Lifty Lever Guider](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/el-lifty-lever-guider/) while it is being lifted.  It's not
critical though because [Lower Zig Zag](//www.marbletrack3.com/parts/lower_zig_zag/) blocks the view and some other characters
may well be blocking the view ([Big Brother](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/big_brother/), [Little Brother](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/lil_brother/), and [Pinky](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/pinky/))

Oh, [Doctor Sugar](//www.marbletrack3.com/workers/dr_sugar/) has just turned on the stage to its normal speed (one unit of rotation per frame).

Here are the frames from today.
