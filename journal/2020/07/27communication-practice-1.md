I just made this page to replace a much-too-hard page suggested by the textbook.


Step 1

### Make plans to do together with your partner.  You can suggest some of your ideas from Pair Work 1

A. Shall we go to lunch on Monday?

B. I am sorry.  I will be busy on Monday.  How about Tuesday?

A. Sounds great!  Let's go to lunch together on Tuesday.

B. Where shall we go?  ...

Step 2

### Write "going to" sentences for five things you will do together.

On Tuesday, we are going to lunch together in Shinjuku.
