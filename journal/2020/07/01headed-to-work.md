On the way to work, I bought clips for holding stainless steel wire

[![2020 july 2 clips for holding steel wire](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2020/thumbs/2020_july_2_clips_for_holding_steel_wire.jpg)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2020/2020_july_2_clips_for_holding_steel_wire.jpg)

and a drill but haven't taken a pic yet.
