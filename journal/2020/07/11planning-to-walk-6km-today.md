After Design Your Day and my lesson at 8am with Yuna, I will walk to
和泉多摩川駅, 6ish kilometers from my house, then take the train to
新宿御苑 for a walking meditation starting at noon.

I wonder who will join!

Yuna joined!

I forgot to take pictures, but we had a good time mindfully walking in
Shinjuku Gyoen.
