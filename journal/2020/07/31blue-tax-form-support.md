Lin and I went to some hopefully not fly-by-night accounting place
offering support on the blue tax form for sole proprietors.

Jacob said:

    It's for an individual proprietors that I mentioned you should set
    up.  You can get the 650,000 tax break on that, however you will
    require an accountant to prepare your monthly transactions and
    then do your taxes at the end of the year.  So you should ask how
    much you are going to be charged for the accountanting services
    for the overall services required and turning in the taxes foms at
    the end of the year.

We saw some ducks on the way out of the office.
