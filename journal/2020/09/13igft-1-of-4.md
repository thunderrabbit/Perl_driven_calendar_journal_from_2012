So far so good on a busy schedule today.  IGFT online training 1 of 4 was last night from midnight to 5am.

I got a couple of gems, including ways to mindfully interrupt in a non-shaming way.

Great to see Stephen who I met in Japan several years ago.  Also got to meet Melton, a man Prentiss spoke highly of many times.

Good to see Dennis who I think I met in Perth at a Staff Training event.

Same schedule planned for tonight so I'll sleep after SOGO
