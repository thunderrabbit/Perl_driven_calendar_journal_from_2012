I've been studying Japanese and Latin via DuoLingo. I hope the title of this entry means "I do not study in the city but I study at home" in Latin.

I discovered something interesting about studying.. if I study Duolingo or KUMON separately, they get annoying pretty quickly.  But studying them at the same time(*) makes them both more tolerable.

(*) Study one for 2-3 minutes then swap to the other; repeat.

I just now spent about an hour and a half studying with the mix and match technique.  But if I do them separately I make it about 15 minutes before I get tired and quit.
