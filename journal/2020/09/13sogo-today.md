#### 10:10am

I'm headed to SOGO now, later than I hoped but pretty much sort of kind of on time.  Train is now arriving in Yoyogi Uehara.

Dang it, just missed the Chiyoda Line train here by a few seconds.

SOGO was a lot of fun today.  Not too hot, not too cold; not raining and not sunny.

I joined the intermediate group today, as I have done for the past year or so.  During The core workout, my favorite Emi encouraged me to try correct my form which made an exercise a bit harder and I said "you're so mean," and I must say here that I ducking hate that part of myself who reacts that way. I don't know where that comes from.

Later for the final group exercise, we played a SOGO version of the Japanese version of red light green light.  I thanked Emi for introducing the game, and apologized for having said she was mean, but even then I said her score was balanced now.  WTF does that even mean?

Connor did the core workout all three times.  Smart going for him!  

Menya was there with Daiki during the workout.  Menya and I held the SOGO banner for the photo at the end.

The genki stick was awarded to Vimmy after it was discovered the original nominee had left.

#### 12:34pm

Now at the Mexican place with everyone, including Yukiko, Jezelle, Jesse, Alex, Niko and three others I don't know.

One of the three I don't know does train announcements for JR on the trains and such. We rolled with laughter to hear her train voice versus her natural speaking voice.  Super funny when she ad libbed an announcement that the (cast iron) plates were hot when we received them from the kitchen.

#### 14:05

I'm in 明治神宮前駅 now headed back home.
