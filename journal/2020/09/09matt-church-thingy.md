precision - become more precise
humility - with conviction to put it out and humility to allow growth.  Allow imperfection and publish anyway.  "Here is something that might be of help"
inquiry - make the thesis as small as possible so it is testable.  I hypothosize this market will buy this message in this method."  then test!

social media invites outrage

Thought Leaders are in the experience business.  Don't get caught up in copyright
Delivery is the business and technique and the experience


Internalize the affirmation  "Am I okay??" answer must come from within.

Externalize transformation (ways to move / change)   "what do you think of this direction?"

THREE META TOOLS

People
Tasks
Decisions

## People Tool

set up a series of choices for people: prospect, meeting, customer

150 to 1500 names..  pick a channel (e.g. LinkedIN) and connect from public to more personal interactions.

Commit to the commtted.  Funnel mindset helps move people from unknown to known to interested to committed

CRM, Infusionsoft, etc to move people along the flow

## Tasks

Matrix for projects:  7, plus or minus 2.
What are 9 things I need to get this book done?
* 12 chapters 3 - 5 bullet points and 100 words per chapter.

* chapter 13 is weird little crazy chapter that either instructs the other chapters or becomes a now book

((THINK page 115 = magical pink sheets))

Asana collaboration board

Slice and dice projects into no more than 9 pieces and do them in any order.


## Decisions

Compass

What is my big decision?   Do I focus on A or B?

I am here.   I think I want A.  (North)
exact opposite of that is -A.   (South)

(likely) Rational outcome   is West
(creative) Out of box outcome is East

NOW create combinations to at least 8, and then live

Rubberducking on the compass 

--------------

* brainstorm how to ___ daily morning to something
