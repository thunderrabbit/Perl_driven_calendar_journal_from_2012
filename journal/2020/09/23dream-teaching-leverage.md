<p class='dream'>Looking into a construction site there was water in one corner and I could see a car was being slowly swamped as the water was getting deeper.  The driver had parked near the water and then the car was now halfway submerged at an angle with the engine and driver seat now in the water.</p>

<p class='dream'>The driver had called a black pickup truck to help pull him out and the surface was all slippery clay so the pickup truck was having trouble finding a place to get good grip to get the car out.</p>

<p class='dream'>So we instead set up a simple device which converted lateral motion of a rope into downward pulling motion and made it very easy to pull the car out.  There was a round shape full of very fine fiber that we could pull straight down and it would both stay locked in place and easily pull the car up.</p>

<p class='dream'>I asked someone else if you wanted to try and he kept pulling the rope and strange directions not straight down even though I had clearly told him and showed him to pull it straight down.  Pulling in the wrong direction made the rope difficult to pull down through the device that kept it in place and I had to quickly rethread the rope through the device.</p>

<p class='dream'>He kept doing it in a bad way and I kept wondering why he was doing that.  I thought it was so clear and easy to understand how to do it properly.
