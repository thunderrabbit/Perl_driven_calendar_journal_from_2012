<p class='dream'>Fred and I were reaching across an arch bridge b by climbing over the arch but by doing so from the inside as I climbed it got steeper and steeper until the very top when my it went to being steep the other way so I turned around and climbed backwards then I realized there was no reason to stay on the steep part so I let myself down from the arch into the flat part of the bridge which was longer but flat so I didn't have to worry about changes in gravity direction. The cotton of the bridge was flat though each slat was angled and bent down with each step like running across venitian blinds. We ended up finishing right at the same time so we declared it a tie.</p>

<p class='dream'>I was so grateful to Fred for inviting me to play.</p>
