Lin and I walked to Yomiuriland last night after she offered to walk with me in the morning.  I doubted that she would be able to wake up at 5:00 a.m., and I didn't want to leave her behind if the timing made me late for my online stuff starting at 7:00 a.m.

Anyway, so I suggested that we walk at night, and she agreed.  We took just over 2 hours to get there and back including a break sitting on the benches in front of the park, from which we watched some people I can characterize as noisy teenagers with loud motorcycles at the convenience store across the bus rotary and street from us.

It was nice to just hold hands on the bench and enjoy the night.  She commented that the hill up had not been too difficult, so I offered that we go down the ~400 stairs to Keio Yomiuriland Mae Station.  "Maybe next time."

Two police cars turned up at the convenience store, and after an apparently friendly conversation the bikers moved on to another location.

This was on a Friday night (right around 24 hours ago as this is being transcribed) and while it seemed new to me in that area, I wondered if it was a regular occurrence on Friday nights.

Anyway anyway, Lin and I had a great time and a great walk.  On the way back, we stopped at a convenience store to get a 'reward' for her (banana smoothie), which ended up being too sweet for her tastes so I drank it.

On the way back up the hill she got a bit tired and ワガママ haha but the hill was worth it once we got to talk to a friendly cat near our end of the street with a tiny parking space and an abandoned house.

Her feet were tender from her shoes being too tight/loose, and mine were a bit tender for having walked an extra few kilometers that day.

I estimate I walked 15 km yesterday if I include my morning walk and the evening walk with Lin.
