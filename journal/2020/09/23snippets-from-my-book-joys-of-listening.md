Listening to your heart
Listening to your loved ones
Listening to friends
Listening to strangers
Everyone needs to tell their story
Everyone needs an empathetic ear
Listening within is the key to creativity as the spirit of God flows through you

Listening to the silence is the key to enlightenment
Witnessing this moment
Like at the end of course of miracles there's no reason for words

"And then my cat got sick and I think she may have had a problem with a fight and then I went to the doctor and he didn't know what to do so I gave her some medicine and then she was feeling better then I accidentally forgot to give her the medicine and she got sick again and I don't know if I should get for some more medicine but the doctor said it would be okay I'm thinking about going to another doctor because this doctor doesn't realize and you may be too busy so the other one was thinking that I should do something else...."

  Hear the meaning behind the story as you just let the words slide by.  Your presence is what's important here.

In this case our speaker is sad because she may lose her cat.

Just be present.  There's nothing to do. Nothing to change.  Nowhere to go..

Once there's a pause in the story, wait a few seconds, maybe a few more seconds, then summarize: "you love your cat."

That's enough.  Your person will know they are heard.  Your words bring them back to this present moment and this simple truth.

Our minds are busy. Busy creating a reality for themselves, based in the past based on the future based on everything except this present moment.  Sometimes these stories need a place to land before thinker can become the witnesser of this present moment.

You can be the place for these stories to land without getting caught up in them yourself.

You can bring healing to the world by offering the place for the stories to land.
