I woke up at 3:45 a.m. to let Jenny outside and then I thought it would be cool to finally have three full hours to walk before starting my day.  

Then, remembering that my day is long on Wednesdays went back to sleep 2 recover, and then I was like nope I'm going to go walk because that's what I want to do.  

I'm writing this via voice transcription. I'm about to do a Facebook live to explain the situation as well.
