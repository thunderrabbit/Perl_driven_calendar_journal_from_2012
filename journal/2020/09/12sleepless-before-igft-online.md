The Integration Group Facilitator Training did not exist before I moved to Japan.  I've always wanted to take it and now, possibly accelerated due to covid-19, it's being offered online so I'm jumping at the chance to do it.

It runs four days across four two weekends, from 11:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, so it's from midnight to 5:30 a.m. Tokyo time.  

Hmm ðŸ¤”

Well, nothing to do but take a nap.  I'm curious to know how my schedule reacts tomorrow.
