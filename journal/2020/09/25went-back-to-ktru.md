<p class='dream'>I went back to KTRU to do a late shift.  Meg was like HI Rob! when I opened the door.  I put my skateboard down and it got a guys shoe, so I reached down to move the skateboard off his for and apologize to him and he moved his foot quickly away as if to get out of my way.  I was like "no no you can stay there" but he had already moved and a girl looked up at me to introduce herself and asked if I wanted to go get a smoke and I was like sorry I don't smoke but I'll go stand outside with you so long as it's upwind.  I couldn't help but think everyone looked super stressed, and they asked me how I was so can.  Well, I walk around barefoot all the time so I'm grounded. Maybe that has something to do with it.  They were all like wow really?</p>
