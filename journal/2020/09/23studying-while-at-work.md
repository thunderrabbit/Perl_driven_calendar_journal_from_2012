I'm at JB School and just finished seven pages of Japanese KUMON during my break, along with studying some Latin and Japanese on Duolingo.

Hide is still absent due to an injury.  I wonder if Akiko will join.  She usually arrives about ten minutes late.

The kids classes were fun today; they are beginning to use the language more creatively. Having a variety of tangible props helps a lot.  Today they choose three animals and ranked their ability to run/walk/sing.

Studying Latin is great.  Words like dormitory, sorority, fraternity, paternity, maternity pop right out like oh wow!
