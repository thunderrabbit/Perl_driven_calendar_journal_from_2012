After hearing from Matt Church that the idea of a newsletter can be done as a live stream, I'm doing a 30-day challenge to myself of leading the Design Your Day morning sessions as live streams on Facebook.

so far, not many takers, but I think that's in part due to the fact that I don't have good text copy written and people don't happen to be watching the time that I'm streaming.

Rin has much better copy for her live streams so I'm going to use her technique of writing that and see how it goes.
