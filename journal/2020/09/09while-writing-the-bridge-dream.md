While writing the bridge dream, I realized that in the dream gravity was backwards like as if it was 90 degrees rotated so the descriptions of flat vs tilted or backwards as if it had been bridge with a hyperbola though instead of a are cherry on top. I guess the directions would make sense if and we're a suspension bridge like the Golden gate bridge, but in my mind visually it was and Arch bridge oh, so that was interesting to do realized what I wrote the dream.

I just wrote all the above text via voice transcription while I'm walking at just after 4 a.m..
