I'm headed home after finishing my lesson at SCC.  Liliko, Naoko, and Yasu each had lessons for an hour.  Liliko and I talked about fluorescent lights used in restorative work back in the 1940s.  Pretty interesting stuff. Naoko and I talked about superconductivity and magnets. Yasu and I talked about lots of different stuff.
