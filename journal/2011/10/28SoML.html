<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Lin and I are married!  We got married in early July but saved it from the bulk of her
family so they don't think it was to get a visa or something.</p></li>

<li><p>We live in Kawasaki, in Tinkerbell House.  We're about to move to a bigger apartment near
the river.</p></li>

<li><p>I work at sbstrm, making the Android app 絵Phone箱, which is what had me so busy that I
had no free time, came home some nights and cried, and totally got out of the habit of writing
journal entries</p></li>

<li><p>I was out of debt until putting our plane tickets on my credit card.  We're going to Austin
at the end of December!!  yay!</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is getting a bit old; it's my white MacBook.</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone is nearly as old; it's a 3G while the world is now on 4S.  I'll get a new one as
soon as the queue is gone.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access at this apartment is sporadic at times.  We're supposed to be getting fiber
at the new place.  Whooo</p></li>

<li><p>I've been meditating each morning, using Insight Timer as my assistant.</p></li>

<li><p>Programming in Android now, therefore Java, and all its memory inefficient quirks that were
pretty challenging to solve on small memory devices.</p></li>

<li><p>I will be working on my marble track in the new apartment, but it's put away for now.</p></li>

<li><p>I fall more in more in love with Lin every day.  I love barking with her!  Today she cracked
me up by scooping some bit of chicken up with her broccoli.  Hilarious!  (the chicken was presented
to her with my tongue)</p></li>

<li><p>I'm really looking forward to seeing Fred.</p></li>

<li><p>The latest on the app: they want English now.  I was researching today ways to make it
happen.  The genius thing is that they bought a font just for this app, but, though they said they
want Chinese eventually, the font doesn't have Chinese characters in it.  Awesome!</p></li>

<li><p>'twas great to see Jon and Simon at CPC this week.  I was not selected for the trial, but it
was really nice to come home to see Lin.  I stacked up all the shoe boxes as a little prank.
Awesome fun.  Robert saw it.</p></li>
