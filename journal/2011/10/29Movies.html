<p>Lin and I watched Biohazard tonight.  Well Lin fell asleep after 10 minutes (as she is prone to
do if we turn on a movie in the evening).  After finishing it, I watached a bit of the movie with
the audio set to commentary.  I enjoyed hearing Milla say her last name (my first time for a
definitive answer!) and enjoyed noting that they had a drinking party on one evening of filming.</p>

<p>We also rented Biohazard II and Double Lady Mission because I was optimistic as to what it would
show, but on a quick scan through it, I just saw T and A.</p>
