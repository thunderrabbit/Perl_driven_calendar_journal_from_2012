<p>The Tokaido Line is stopped; it's 30 minutes late at the moment.  Lin just dropped me off here in
Yokohama.  It's 11:12pm, and I'm sitting on the 10:40 train for Hiratsuka.  I think the guy just
said we'd leave after 11:30pm.  Dang.</p>

<p>Some people are leaving the train after that announcement.  One consolation; we have control
over the individual doors, so we can keep them closed to keep the warmth inside.</p>

<p>Man, and I have to peeee cause I just drank 2 liters including 1.5 liters of milk tea.</p>

<p>Leaving now.  Yay!!  1 hour and 15 minutes late; awwww yeah..</p>

<p>Still have to pee, but at least I know how much longer I have to hold it hahahahaha</p>
