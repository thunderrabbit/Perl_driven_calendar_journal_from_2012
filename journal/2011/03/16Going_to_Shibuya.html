<p>My big debate today was how to pack for a trip to Shibuya.  I wasn't sure if the trains were
running, so I packed a bit of extra food + water bottle + clean clothes in case I had to ride 40
miles to The Pink Cow.</p>

<p>But the trains are running so I'm sitting comfortably on the on-time train, with plenty of other
people.  It looks 100% like normal; on the train there's no way I'd be able to tell anything had
happened.  In the station, the only sign was a sign saying that some lines were not running and
others were running at 50%, 70%, 80%, and important lines were running at 100%,...</p>

<p><em>and</em> that the convenience store in the station wasn't fully stocked, but they still had
milk tea and plenty of chocolates for me to get Lin for White Day (yesterday).</p>
