<p>I joined the Tokyo group of the Self Realization Fellowship in meditation this morning in
Oimachi.  We meditated for 30 + minutes and then talked for 1 hour about the wisdom of having their
scheduled retreat in June, given the possibly unsafe conditions of the reactor, etc.</p>

<p>Apparently, in January, peeps from SRF were like, &quot;yo we'd like to have a retreat in Japan in
June,&quot; and the group was like &quot;cool!&quot; but then the earthquake happened and people
were like, &quot;oh snap; should we still have it?&quot; arguing possibly that it wasn't polite to
invite yogis into a dangerous zone.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;they're wise; they can decide for themselves,&quot; and, during the overflow
discussion at lunch, that's basically what the group decided.  We'll still have the meeting and the
peeps from SRF can come if they like, but we won't specifically request their attendance.  I doubt
my input had much to do with the decision.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mayu for translating for me during the meeting.  She's going to Seattle in two days,
possibly to stay.</p>
