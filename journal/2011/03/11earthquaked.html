<p>Today has been relatively relaxed for me; I skyped with Fred for 1.75 hours and told him I was
fine, though he was unaware of the earthquake.  Lots of people have asked about me via FB or T, so
that's been nice. Thank you all; I'm A-okay!</p>

<p>After phone service came back, Lin called me to say the streets were packed with people trying to
go home with no trains running.</p>

<p>Later, Soness called me in quite more of a panic than I would expect.  She asked about the cat
and everything.  I guess she didn't get my text messages that I'm fine.</p>
