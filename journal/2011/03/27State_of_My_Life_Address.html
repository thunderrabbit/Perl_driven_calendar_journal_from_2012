<li><p>I don't know how long it's been since I've written one of these, but I know the last was
before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">2011 Tohoku
earthquake and tsunami</a></p></li>

<li><p>Basically Tokyo is back to normal, save for people having run away in fear, and the news
saying drinking water may not be safe to drink, and that radiation levels are 20 TIMES HIGHER than
normal.  Aw come on people; 20 times higher than N * 20 times below the safe limit is still way below
the safe limit.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have been dating for 6 months now.</p></li>

<li><p>I went to Kriya Yoga meditation for the first time today, though I've not been initiated into
the technique.</p></li>

<li><p>I heard from Emma that Tati has gone back to Boston.  I wonder if it was due to the
EQ.</p></li>

<li><p>Soness will be back tomorrow after being gone for over 2 weeks (?) due to the earthquake.
She went to NZ to be safe and hang with Yuji.  She bought some kinda ceramic ball to make the
drinking water safe to drink.  I assured her I would not be changing my drinking habits.</p>

<p>She suggested filling the jug and leaving them out for 8 days before drinking.  I don't think
she realizes that basically entails having multiple jugs sitting in various spots in the house, all
with dates on them.  Too much trouble for me; I'll just turn on the tap and drink as per usual.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been in touch with my dad recently over the past 2 weeks or so; hadn't really chatted
with him in several months.  I've been spending a lot of time online and seen him online during his
morning / evening jaunts online.</p></li>

<li><p>I paid $97 to get Kate Buck Jr's Let's Get Social package.  It's been well worth $97,
especially if I can make some money with the shtuffs I've been learning.  I
bought <a href="http://www.csrrabbit.com/">www.csrrabbit.com</a> and have been playing on its
related twitter account, but not much yet on the facebook account.  Need to pay for hootsuite
professional soon, probably.  But man it's hard with not much income coming in.</p></li>

<li><p>Tomorrow's plan includes more work on csrrabbit.com and @csrrabbit on twitter, promote the
Charity Art Auction on April 1, the charity thing at which I'll be giving massages on April 10th,
look for JOBs, and clean up Chez Soness.</p></li>

<li><p>I've vaguely considered rewriting in Python on
Django <a href="http://ctbriefs.net/">ctbriefs.net</a>, but that won't likely happen anytime
soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I went through 9 months of comments on Marble Track 2 on youtube while I had email
notification turned off.  It's back on again, and Lin is interested in having such a marble track.
I think I'll make a small one, but with 100% accuracy, and possibly better building techniques (so
curves are smooth, etc).  Need to get better stick cutting tool than just pliars; we'll see how it
goes.</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has an extra Dremel.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't done any reading nor any homework for Artist's Way in the two weeks we've been
down for the earthquake, and not for the week or two before that, either.</p>

<p>But I have been drawing and promoting my art a bit.</p></li>
