<p><b>Update after earthquake</b></p>

<pre>Hello world!

Friday morning Japan time, northern Japan experienced a pretty big earthquake
(largest recorded in 300 years), and an impressive tsunami.  Lots of people died
and lots are homeless.

Here in Tokyo, the damage was much less, but most trains were stopped for the day,
making for the hugest gridlock ever for people going home on Friday night.

Right now I'm safe and fine in Kawasaki at my girlfriend Lin's house.  I plan to go
back to Chigasaki tomorrow as life eases its way back to normality here.

Soness is out of town for work this weekend and also plans to be home in Chigasaki
on Sunday night.

However, I've just learned that there was another earthquake today (Saturday) and
the trains are stopped *again*, and there's a rumor that the nuclear power plants
might be shut down for testing/repairs.

In Chigasaki, Nibbles Kitty (the cat) has plenty of water and food for two days. 
There's also a bathtub full of clean water for drinking in case someone needs it.

Here in Kawasaki we have food for several days, and an equally full bathtub of
clean water.  Lin's mom is cooking in the kitchen, and I'm writing to you.

Love and blessings to all those affected.  Thanks to those who have asked after my
well being.

    Happily
    - Rob!
