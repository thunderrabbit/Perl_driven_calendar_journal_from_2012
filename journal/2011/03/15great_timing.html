<p>I got my Rob Update out basically just in time for the power outage.  I sent it out to my Rob
Updates list at 3:55pm or so, after an announcement at 3:50pm on the loudspeakers in the
neighborhood, of which I could understand this: &quot;this is Chigasaki ______, at 4pm _______ _____
_______.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;hmmmmmm I bet they just said the power will go off at 4pm.&quot;</p>

<p>I was right; yay!!!</p>

<p>Now time to read and meditate and sleep.</p>

<p>ps: for the record, despite plans on 13 March to turn off the power twice yesterday, this is the
first power outage we (in Chigasaki) have had since the earthquake on 11 March 2011 in Sendai.</p>

<p>It *could* mean that the power plant situation is getting worse, but I am okay with that.</p>

<p>(( the only bad timing was that I hadn't *quite* finished fixing on my website the character
encoding errors in the text I quoted from Lin's email to me. ))</p>
