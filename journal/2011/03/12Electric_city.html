<p>Here in Kawasaki, after being woken up from a nice nap by her sister's phone call, Lin is a bit
panicked that we might not have electric power nor any food/water/fuel/internets because there might
have been some damage done to the nuclear power plant(s).  She went to buy supplies, and I filled
the bathtub with clean water, as I did in Chigasaki before I left, assuming it would be used for a
nice bath and laundry, not drinking.</p>

<p>I assume the water here will be used for a nice bath and laundry as well, and that I'll be
sleeping in Chigasaki tomorrow night.  I would prefer to trust that everything is sweet and yummy
than sour and prickly.</p>
