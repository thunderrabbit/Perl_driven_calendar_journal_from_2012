<p>I went &quot;spelunking&quot; at the beach today, basically crawling down into a space under the
tetrapods which I bet gets very few human visitors.  It was a bit scary (&quot;what if they happen
to fall *right now* after not falling for years and not even shifting since the last huge typhoon
over a year ago????&quot;), but it was such a relief when I did it.</p>
