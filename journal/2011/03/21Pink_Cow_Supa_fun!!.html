<p>Great night with Divi at The Pink Cow tonight!  While people generously donated goods for Tohoku,
Divi and I were both live painting; each on our own canvii and then both on a dragon that she
sketched out.  Super fun!!  The whole while, we had live musical performances on stage, between
which we each tried to get the other to take the role of MC because we each didn't really want to be
on stage! hahhahaah! We both MCed together, she being the natural, and me just faking it, but we had
a good time and even got better as the evening progressed.</p>

<p>Roy of Fudworks came as well, and I gave him a posterboard on which he painted a bust of a
feminine action hero.  Great use of paints and whiteboard!  On the bottom, he outlined in pink</p>

<p>and then his Fudworks logo/signature</p>

<p>We were going to auction off the paintings in The Pink Cow, but upon running out of time (and
people), decided to have the auction online!  So I'm looking for free open source online auction
software.  Could also do it via Twitter, giving each piece a unique number and the auction a
hashtag.  I think it could work!  Only trick would be to get the money from the winner; hmmmmmm.</p>

<p>So anyway, Divi and I taped the paintings to the wall, and then nailed to the wall the big one
that tape couldn't hold.  Success!!  The paintings for sale include the ones that Matt Muirhead and
I painted in 2005 on PB's 52nd voyage.</p>
