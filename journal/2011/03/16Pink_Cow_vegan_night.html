<p>After chillin' in Shibuya at Royal Garden Cafe, I went to The Pink Cow for vegan buffet night!
Lin emailed that she wanted to join so I went to Donki- to walk back with her.  We enjoyed a feast
with the company of Earl, Keleigh, Dob, Bruce, Antonio, and Robin, Daniel, etc at the other table.
Talk was about the earthquake and people's varied experience of it.  Keleigh said she walked 5 hours
home from Odaiba to Ikebukuro.  Wow.  Also, quite cool that she did that!</p>

<p>Special thanks to Traci, Andy and Pink Cow staff for encouraging normality, the only way we'll
get back to normal.</p>
