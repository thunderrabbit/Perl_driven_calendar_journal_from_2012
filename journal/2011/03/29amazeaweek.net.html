<p>I registered <a href="http://twitter.com/amazeaweek">@amazeaweek</a> on Twitter,
bought <a href="http://www.amazeaweek.net/">amazeaweek.net</a> and set up Wordpress with Wordtwit
and published my first maze (which was actually already published on my wiki) and tweet.</p>

<p>Lin supports my hobby with &quot;it would be good if it could make money,&quot; and I was like,
&quot;it will be good advertising for my maze book!&quot;</p>
