<p>Today I finished the installation of Omeka on airplaneday.com.  I even made it the root/only app
available on the domain.  Only thing I don't like about that is creaing some 404s, but I really
don't know how much traffic the site was getting before.  (I guess I could check the logs.)</p>

<p>I've created a few 404s already; I guess I could repair them with my .htaccess file, if there's
been enough traffic on the site to care.</p>
