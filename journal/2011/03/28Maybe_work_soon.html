<p>Got a call from Alfonzo a couple days ago (Monday night) saying they will have a meeting with
their new big client on Friday and then be more certain about start time for the project and having
me back working full time.  Nice.</p>

<p>On that day, I had basically been learning CSR Rabbit type stuff, and tweaking Omeka install on airplaneday.com</p>
