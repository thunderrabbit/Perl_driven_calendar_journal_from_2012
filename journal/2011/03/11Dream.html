<p class="dream">flying with a kite strapped to me or attached to some wigs of some kid, I was
supposed to stay in the local area, but I was at the whim of the wind, and started to go u a
mountain and knew that the sea was just on the other side of the montain.  I was afraid of falling
into the sea so I made my kits sink and I basically stopped by hitting trees on the mountain.</p>

<p class="dream">at the beach, seven of us wee with Mr Van, and three of them got into the van and
treid to drive away, leaving for of us behind!  At first we were like &quot;wtf&quot; or &quot;haha
funny joke,&quot; but then he drove further away, and I didn't know Mr Van's license plate number,
but the guy was swerving around and flipped over sideways.  I got out my iPhone and called 911 and
the recording in Japanese was like, &quot;aight leave a message,&quot; and then I wanted to take a
picture of the van to get the license plate, but the phot app wasn't working as I remembered, and
the van license plate was fuzzy anyway.</p>

<p>(but for some reason none of these triggered my brain that I was dreaming)</p>
