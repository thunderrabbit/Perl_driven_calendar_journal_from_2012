<p><b>Howdy from Tokyo! </b></p>

<pre>Though the latest news is that our tap water is unsafe for infants, I'm still
happily in Tokyo, still drinking the water, and helping Divy organize an art
auction fundraiser at The Pink Cow on April 1st!  Invite all your friends who live
in Tokyo!  (maybe that's only me hahah)

In Tokyo, the only remnants of March 11's earthquake + tsunami (besides small daily
aftershocks) are rolling power outages.  Contrary to my claim last time, there *is*
a schedule of blackouts available: <a href="http://www.tepco.co.jp/images/week_schedule.pdf">http://www.tepco.co.jp/images/week_schedule.pdf</a>
Thanks very much to Travis for pointing this out!!

Other than that, Tokyo is back to normal, as soon as we can get everyone back into
the city.  Soness will be arriving on Sunday morning and at work on Monday.

Northeast coastal Japan, on the other hand, is still in need of support.  I was
recently informed of a site that compiles lots of information, including how to
donate <a href="http://disasterjapan.wordpress.com/">http://disasterjapan.wordpress.com/</a>

Looking forward, I have recently set up CSR Rabbit as a hat under which I can help
people and businesses expand their online presence.  Just getting started, so you
can be my first paying client!  <a href="http://csrrabbit.com/">http://csrrabbit.com/</a>  <a href="http://twitter.com/csrrabbit">http://twitter.com/csrrabbit</a>
