<p>Last night Lin and I finally made good on our plan to watch some movies while we had time off
together during the earthquake lengthened weekend.  We watched her &quot;favorite movie&quot;
_Dragonheart_, which, though being a tad inconsistent and unrealistic in several parts, was cute
overall.</p>

<p>I selected _Flight Plan_ next, for the picture of the bright blue eyed cutie from Silence of the
Lambs and Contact (what's her name, dang!) on the front cover.  Started watching, though, and I
decided I didn't want to watch a movie about kids being napped, so turned it off around the time
they reached the airport.</p>

<p>Then watched the <del>intellectually dizzying</del> <ins>vacuous</ins> _Nacho Libre_, which was
just the entertainment I needed to stay awake and the just the lack of entertainment Lin needed to
fall asleep.</p>
