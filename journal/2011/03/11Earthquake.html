<p>That was the most awesome earthquake I've ever felt.  Ironically my iPhone app hasn't reported it,
but that was the most awesome earthquake EVAR.  It lasted like 45 seconds at least.</p>

<p>The neighbors all came outside.  I was like "just enjoy it; there's nothing we can do" when Kana
was going "scarryyy."</p>

<p>Oooooh it just registered on my phone.  7.9 magnitude.  awesome!  my biggest ever for sure!
I wonder if we'll get a tsunami; I should go to the beach hmmmmm.</p>

<p>It was up near Sendai, not near Tokyo.  I hope peope there are safe.</p>

me: we just now got another aftershock
Bob: When did the first one hapen?
me: about 15 mins ago
15:10 
Bob: Was the shaking severe enough to damage much where you were?
 
me: it's neat; the whole house is like gently shaking as in a big thunderstorm
  
nah
  
it was just super long; with side to side shaking
 
Bob: Or a train going by.
 
me: no vertical shaking that I noticed
15:11 
yeah, like a train rumbling the windows
  
It was long enough that I was able to go outside and feel the street wobbling back and forth
 
Bob: Interesting!

me: I want to go to the beach, but I doubt there will be a tsunami
