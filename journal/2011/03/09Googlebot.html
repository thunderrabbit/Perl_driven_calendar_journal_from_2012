<p>Hmm!  Two (or more) of my domains have been hacked in that if *I* view them they look fine, but
if Googlebot views them, they look like spam.  Poor, poor Googlebot, always being picked on by
nasty spammers.</p>

<p>how do I debug this?  I've gotten as far as viewing the page in Firefox using User Agent add-on
to masquerade as Googlebot and seeing the spam, but I don't know what's triggering the spam.  My
.htaccess files look fine.  I didn't notice anything in other files that looked bad.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>The *good* news is that one of the sites that's been spammed is pretty small, and entirely
available through git, so I should be able to pretty quickly find what changed on the site.</p>
