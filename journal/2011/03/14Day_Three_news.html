<p>Train lines are largely stopped in Tokyo; rolling power outages have been temporarily canceled
because electricity consumption was lower than expected.  Some people are leaving Tokyo (including
my housemate Soness, if she can get a ride to the airport.  Yesterday she got a ticket to New
Zealand to see her boyfriend for a week.)</p>

<p>I think the news just said all Shinkansen (bullet trains) are stopped in Tokyo and north of
Tokyo.  Some cities up north have been destroyed by tsunami.</p>

<p>This is being called a 1000 year earthquake.  The tsunami came inland farther than any in 1100
years.  Nice record keeping, Japan!</p>

<p>Apparently, looking at the series of earthquakes along the fault, they are coming closer to Tokyo.  Some people are predicting a 7.0 earthquake close to Tokyo within 3 days (I heard last night, so 2.5 days.. ?)</p>

<p>Listening to my angels, I get the &quot;all clear&quot; signal, so I'm staying.  I'll stay in
touch.</p>
