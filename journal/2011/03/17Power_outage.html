<p>Have had a great day in Kawasaki.  The weather is beautiful; the stores are largely stocked
(save for rice), and everything is fine if we don't watch TV.  Power is about to go out in a
minute.</p>

<p>Now going to eat dinner in the dark!</p>

<p class="date">9:45pm JST</p>

<p>Power is back on.  Lin and I had been eating eating super-yummy curry for 10 minutes when the
power went off.  Her mom arrived home and said Kawasaki station was utterly packed with people
trying to get on the trains, so after eating, Lin and I went to check it out.  Things had changed
in the preceding time and there was no line, and not really many people at all.</p>

<p>We hung out in the dark in Lazona's big atrium and then headed back.</p>

<p>Stopped in the hotel to say HI to the guy who's always nice to us, and see what it was like in
there with no lights.  He was like, &quot;are you going to stay?&quot; and we go, &quot;no; just
saying HI,&quot; and he assured us the rooms were utterly dark with no lights, save for little
AA-battery flashlights provided by the hotel.</p>

<p>Stopped in 7-11 that was still open despite the dark just to see what that would be like.  I
imagine these power outages will get old after a while, but we can play with them while they're
new.</p>
