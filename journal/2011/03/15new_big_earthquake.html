<p>We just had another significant earthquake that I felt here in Chigasaki.  It had a single
vertical bump in the middle of a lot of side to side shaking.  I didn't hear anything fall in the
house.  First reports from Shasta says it was magnitude 6 in Shizuoka.</p>

<p>Later report from EQ trackers say it was 6.2.  Its reported latitude and longitude each have
three zeros in them!!  lat 35.3000, long 138.7000 = wow!!</p>
