<p>_Joysticks_ came out in 1983, when I was 13, and wanting to see some boobies.  I finally
downloaded it last night and watched it today.  It's not exactly a boobie-fest, but it's got more
than _Airplane!_, and would have been plenty had I seen it at age 13.</p>

<p>At age 41, I was vaguely entertained by its characters, which were maxed out to the max.  I
enjoyed Patsy's accent, but don't tell anyone.</p>
