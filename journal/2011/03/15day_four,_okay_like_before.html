<p><b>day four, okay like before</b></p>

<pre>Hello world!!

Today has been even more relaxing for me than yesterday; I slept early last night
after meditating, and slept in late today.  Ate some brunch and after taking some
pictures of the local stores (and uploaded to FB).  There was a long line at the
grocery store (so I didn't go inside), and low stock and low lights at the
convenience store.  It wasn't crowded, so I got food and ate at home.

Went to the beach for more meditation on peace and recovery for people in northern
Japan.  I see lots of &amp;quot;pray for Japan&amp;quot; messages on social networks, and
then some naysayers &amp;quot;1 person working does more than 1000 praying&amp;quot; or
something.  I personally *do* believe in the creative, manifestive (*) power of
human consciousness (* see I just created a new word!), so that's the way I'm
helping for now.

Lin, in what might be called downtown Tokyo, wrote about her day today:

&#34;I just came back from my appointment, and there was only ______ sitting at her
desk, trying to save some energy, with only small light and no music (BGM). 
_______ couldn't make it today because of the train situation, she rather stayed at
home because it took her 2 hours to go back home yesterday.  The entire city is
really quiet, only few cars were running, nearly no food in the convenience store,
just like a movie.  I never have seen Tokyo like this in my life.  I'm trying not to
worry too much and I believe that everything is going to be fine.&#34;

Soness successfully left the country yesterday; she'll be in New Zealand for a week
(or more?)

I send thanks to everyone who has expressed concern for me.  I'm in a safe area,
and believe there will be no anarchy or looting etc, even as days move on.  And,
even if there is, I've wanted to experience something like this, so it's pretty
much a dream come true for me.

I'll keep living the dream, and letting you know how it goes.

   blessings
    - Rob!

ps: there might be a power outage starting in 5 mins, so I'll try to upload quickly
and then meditate some more.
