<p>I just went to the store and though packed with people, everyone was orderly, and, most
interestingly, almost all the lights were off in the store.  I only needed to buy cat food, but I
bought a bag of kitten food for me, in case I really want a good story!  I've got lots of people
food already, and still have a tub full of clean water.</p>

<p>I remembered I needed to buy some chocolate for the woman who works at the cleaners (not where they clean clothes, but just like an intake shop from where they send clothes off to be cleaned). I picked up my suit on Valentine's Day and <a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2011/02/14#Chocolate">she gave me chocolate</a>.</p>

<p>There wasn't a great selection at the conveni, but I got her some and presented it today.  She seemed surprised and happy.  :-)</p>
