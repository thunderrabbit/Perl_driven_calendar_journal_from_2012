<p>Despite news of possible nuclear disasters, rolling blackouts, and 7.0 aftershocks, today Lin and
I had a relaxing day at her house, with the most productive time (except for meal preparation) being
cleaning the ventilation fan in the shower.  She said she had always shied away from doing it
because she knew it would be a mess, but once it was clean, she was really happy!</p>

<p>We walked to Lazona to find it closed (for building inspection on Day Two after the big
earthquake east of north Japan) and then saw a whole herd of fire trucks arrive at a location at
which we could see no apparent smoke, but they ran a hose from the truck so I guess something needed
water.  The coolest part was the cart used to run the hose; it was a self propelled four wheeled
cart with a steering wheel and one guy driving.  He looked a lot like he was driving a four wheeled
Segway.</p>

<p>Went to Yodobashi Camera to find the place packed with people, and no D-cell batteries in sight.
We got a 3 meter lan cable so Lin and I can both use her internet connection at the same time.  She
got ink for her printer and a card to send pics of us to her uncle.</p>

<p>Got back home, said HI to Mama, shared the internet connection, ate a lovely dinner, and then I
had to head out to respect her mom's request that I don't stay more than one night before having a
formal committment.</p>
