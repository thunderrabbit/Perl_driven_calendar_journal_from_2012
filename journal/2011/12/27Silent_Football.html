<p>So happy; such a great silent football party!</p>

_The man with shades_, Fred as _The doctor_, Lauren as _Stinkin' Thinkin'_, Daniel as I'm Randy
Butternubs, Katy B-H as Miss Scratch-n-Sniff, Robert as Mr East, Calder as Quadriple (later changed
to Speaks out of turn a lot pants), and Lin as Miss Tiger, though she was mostly just watching.</p>
