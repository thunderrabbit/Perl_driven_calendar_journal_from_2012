<p>Jason Fricke left straight from work to the wedding.  His coworker's go, "aren't you going to
dress up first?"</p>

<p>"Nah; I bet you twenty bucks the groom won't be wearing shoes..."</p>

<p>He was right!!!</p>

<p>I am so lucky that Christina and I have such common backgrounds that I could outsource the
entire wedding service to her!  She read some great readings and then we lit some candles in honor
of Lin's parents who could not be present, and in honor of our commitment.</p>

<p>Christina read this letter, written by Lin and I, to me and Lin.</p>

<pre>
I choose you to be my beloved spouse and partner of my life.

I appreciate I can speak my truth to you, 
and that you encourage me to do so especially when itâ€™s challenging.

I will help you see your golden spirit, especially when you do not.

I love climbing Mt Fuji together each year and appreciate having a strong partner to navigate other
challenges we encounter.

I love our happy barking conversations and our goats and bears surrounding our cabin on the lake.

I love you when you are near and when you are far, more than fifty million billion rabbits eating
ice cream in a sunny field full of cookies and pizza.
</pre>

<p>When she got to the end, everyone put on bunny ears!!!</p>

<p>Bryan, Amy, and Huck Leyenbeck were there, plus Jackie Purdy, plus Jason Fricke, so they were my
YRUU peeps.  So great to see them!!</p>

<p>Katy and Josh came and went; I didn't get to hang out with them too much so that was a bit sad.
Seemed like they were busy going to their next event.</p>

<p>Marcel and Kayse brought their kids</p>
