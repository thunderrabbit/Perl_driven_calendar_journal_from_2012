<p>Great timing; I got the &quot;wrong&quot; ticket machine for waiting in line purposes, and was
called before I woulda been called otherwise.  The girl was like &quot;oh, you need to get a
different ticket,..  well it's okay this time..&quot;</p>

<p>SWEET.</p>

<p>This was for marriage license affidavit (I hereby swear I've never been married before).</p>
