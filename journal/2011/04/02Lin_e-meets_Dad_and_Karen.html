<p>Yesterday, Lin and Karen joined me and Dad's video chat, by sitting beside each of us.  After
their expected hellos, I learned that the Japanese government has asked people to *not* celebrate
hanami (drinking parties under canopies of cherry blossoms).  We looked up flight prices to IAH and
found $700 per person each way in early December.</p>
