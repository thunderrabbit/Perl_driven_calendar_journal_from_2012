<p>Last night I went to a small presentation by 4 of the 20 organizers of Quakebook, a compilation
of a buncha stories of people's perspective of the earthquake in March.</p>

<p>Amazing: it was organized via Twitter, and basically created by people who didn't know each other
(and most still have not met), and was accepted by Amazon for sale on their Kindle reader (or Kindle
for yer smartphone).  All $9.99 goes to Japan Red Cross.</p>

<p>All within 3 weeks!  Wow!!!  <a href="http://amzn.to/quakebook">http://amzn.to/quakebook</a></p>
