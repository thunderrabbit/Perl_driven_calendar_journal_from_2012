<p>After the filming, Mark's friend Masae came by and we chatted for about an hour.  It seems she
might have chronic fatigue syndrome, from what I can tell of her story.  She used to be genki and
then about 4 years ago, she had to drop out of work and just slept all the time.  Still isn't back
to normal yet.</p>

<p>When I was on my way out, I offered her a hug.  She accepted after assurance from Mark that it
was utterly platonic and my girlfriend wouldn't mind.  Masae was like, &quot;then can I have a
hug?&quot; (in Japanese (something like 「ハーグくれていいの？」)) and she came to where I was
standing and hugged me.  At first she was kinda one arm semi-formal, but then I felt her relax into
it but actually she had suddenly passed out and collapsed into a pile on the floor.</p>

<p>Mark saw the whole thing, and came over to help pat her back awake, and she took a few minutes to
recover, including some periods of moaning, and apparently not being able to hear me repeatedly ask her,
&quot;Masae, what's your name?&quot;</p>

<p>But then, after a few minutes to recover, she recovered to 80% normal, and okay enough to
apologize and say that she sometimes faints when hugging guys she doesn't know.</p>

<p>Wow.  That's a first for me!  Mark wondered if maybe she had been hypnotized to have that
reaction.  Weird; I know it's possible, but I wonder who would do that, and why....</p>
