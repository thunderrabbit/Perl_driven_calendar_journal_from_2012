<p>I love Lin soooooo much.  More and more each day.  Really happy that she accepts my
&quot;bad&quot; parts and sees my good parts.</p>

<p>She gave me a beautiful hand made &quot;card&quot; for my 15,000th Day.  It's got pictures from
our first day on Mt Fuji and cute cute little house and trees.  So sweet!!</p>

<p>We ate in KFC and basically had the whole upstairs to ourselves.  We decided we'll learn the US
states and Japanese prefectures.  I'm thinking we should learn the names of all the countries in the
world as well.</p>

<p>I showed her how Angry Birds makes money even after people pay for the app, and how Lil' Pirates
makes money even though the app is free!</p>
