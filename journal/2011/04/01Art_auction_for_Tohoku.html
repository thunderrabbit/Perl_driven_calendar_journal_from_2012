<p>Great success at the Art Auction for Tohoku at The Pink Cow on Fridqy night!  We raise 148,000
yen (officially 147,000 yen, but then Soness bought one last item for 1000 yen and put it into the
charity slush fund after I had given our total collection to Naoya.)</p>

<p>Soness was MC for the event and for the auction; it was great great great to have her on stage;
she really helped get the crowd going and I said later, &quot;well, I know now how to run an
auction,&quot; to which the obvious answer given by David (former Flow Union organizer),
&quot;yeah, get Soness,&quot; whereas I actually meant to have more lead time, have an actual
booklet of items for bid, and more space.   But anyway, I am certain that Soness quadrupled or
quintipled the amount of money that Divy, Roy, and I could have made, as I didn't really invite any
other artists, and I don't know if many of Divy's invitees joined.  Plus, none of us have the stage
presence of Soness.  wow.</p>

<p>I got the first item for bid, a dream catcher made by <a href="http://mediatinker.com/">Kristen
McQuillin</a>, who was the only one to donate 3D art to the event.  Her other piece was an indoor
earthquake detector, or an outdoor windchime.  Nice.</p>

<p>For Lin, Sachiko bought &quot;Synchronized Drips,&quot; one of my pieces, which we didn't have
time to actually auction, as we were sharing the evening with a musician and burlesque dancer.  For
herself, Kelly H bought &quot;Shadow Lines;&quot; one of my first pieces.  yay!!!

<p>(( right now as I'm typing, Lin and I are arriving at her sister's house; this is the first time
I'll meet her in a casual setting!  (I went to her massage shop for a foot massage a few months
ago.)  ))</p>
