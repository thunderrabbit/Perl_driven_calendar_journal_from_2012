<p>Yesterday I drew via Gimp a pattern that can be formed into a cube.  Today I drew a noodle path
on it with a start and end, but no dead-ends except for those at the very top and bottom of the 2D
version of the pattern.  The <del>style is kinda crappy</del> <ins>lines are a bit sloppy</ins>, and
the upload didn't work quite correctly, and I have a couple weeks to clean it up before its planned
date of publication, but I will start work tomorrow so I hope I can keep
drawing <a href="http://www.amazeaweek.net/">a maze a week</a>!!!
