<p>Great fun day in the park today near Lin's house!  I was super impressed with how she got over
her fear of climbing on the equipment.  At first she was like, &quot;eeep!&quot; and a few times
said she couldn't do it, but she did, and climbed up and over a metal structure and slid down the
poles on the other side.  The first time was her idea to slide down the pole, which synchronized
with my thought that it would be a good next challenge.  I didn't suggest it, but asked that she
choose the next challenge.  Wow!  Same idea!  So I modeled how to slide down, and she did it.</p>

<p>I encouraged her to do it again immediately, and she was much faster.  I raced her up and over
the thing, beating her time by an order of magnitude or so.  (It took me 6 seconds; I jumped down
the other side instead of sliding down the pole.)</p>

<p>We climbed over the other toys, sharing the equipment with some other kids who sometimes looked
at me like, &quot;wtf,&quot; and sometimes like, &quot;wow!&quot;  I'm glad none of them got hurt
doing things past their abilities, <em>and</em> I'm sure they did more than they might have had I
not been doing crazy stuff already.</p>

<p>We swang on the swings and at one point had three pairs of people on three swings, with one
person standing and the other sitting on the swing.  And all of our oscillations were
synchronized!  Fortunately the equipment was hella sturdy and didn't even consider moving due to
our combined swingliness.</p>

<p>We were in the park about 2.5 hours or so, some of which was just talking on top of the cubey
bar thing; what are those called?</p>
