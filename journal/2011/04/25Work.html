<p>At work yesterday, I finished a quick android app that could record voice and play it back.
Didn't get multiple voice entries saved, but I just figured out how I'd do it.</p>

<p>I was *not* able to get the page curl animation to work with anything but bitmap images,
including not being able to take a screenshot and curl that.</p>
