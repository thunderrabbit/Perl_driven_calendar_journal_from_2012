<p>At work today I might be getting a new Mac Mini.  It'll be fun to have a new machine, but a bit
of a pain to set it all up; I figure it will take most of the day.  Maybe I can work on my Mac
while I install software on the other Mac.</p>

<p>I will prolly either look into using Unity for the page curl (but then have to sort out the
audio recorder part again), or sumpin else.</p>
