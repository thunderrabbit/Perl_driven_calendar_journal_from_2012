<p>Sweet.  I saw Carla just ahead of me leaving Takadanobaba station; she was with Yuuka, who I
actually recognized from behind.  I meant to surprise her, but instead she was like, &quot;you
scared me; I could feel someone approaching quickly... Rob!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I said HI to her, Yuuka, and Kazzah for a bit up in the GET office and then headed out to Artists
Way workshop.  Carla is here for a couple weeks to join a work team up in Tohoku area with PB.
Awesome!</p>

<p>ps: it's not 100% ridiculous that I met her; I knew from FB that she was coming, and knew she'd
be in Takadanobaba tonight for a quick 52 and 54th reunion!</p>
