<p>Interesting that there are three upcoming parties  with people I know through PB 52.  Maruan
will be celebrating his 30th solar revolution, and Carla will be volunteering in northern Japan,
but will be chilling with people on her two Tokyo days on either end of that trip.</p>

<p>I want to go to see Maruan and Kyoko, Carla, Tony, and my few other peeps who I know and love,
but I feel embarrassed when I don't remember other people's names, and those faces will span 8
years ago when I worked at NOVA to 4 years ago when I volunteered with PB.</p>

<p>So when I told Lin about it, my voice was not all super genki, and she was thinking that means I
don't really want her to go....</p>

<p>Ah...  I just realized another part of it.  I don't want to tell people that I'm still jobless
and living for two years on Soness's living room floor.  gah.</p>
