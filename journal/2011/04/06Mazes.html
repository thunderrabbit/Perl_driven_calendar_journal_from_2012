<p>Using Gimp, I finished a relatively challenging maze for <a href="http://www.amazeaweek.net/">A Maze A
Week</a> after talking to Phat Pat about his art, for which he often employs Gimp.  I basically
used it to copy some squiggly lines, and then connected them together in random-ish ways so they'd
have familiar patterns, but then be quite different overall.</p>

<p>It is scheduled to be published on the first Tuesday in May.</p>
