<p>Good day at work today, researching 2D engines for an android app we plan to make.  I'm half
thinking we should use Unity 3D so we can do cooler apps later, but another part is thinking it's
good to just use the size of an engine we need.  AndEngine + Box2D will probably be my choice in
that case.</p>
