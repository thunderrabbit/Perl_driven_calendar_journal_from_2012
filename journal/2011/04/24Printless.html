<p>Here at work in Yokohama, after applying &quot;72 updates&quot; last night, my boss has found
that the printers aren't working the way he would like, as in, at all.</p>

<p>He's a man of integrity regarding money, though, and I still get paid.  That's nice, but I'd
rather be with Lin outside at the park with Carla and peeps.</p>
