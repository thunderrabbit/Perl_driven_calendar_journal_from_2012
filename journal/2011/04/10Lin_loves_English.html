<p>So last night Lin asked if I could help her prepare for her English interview.  I was like,
&quot;mmmmmmm&quot; not like it was a delicious idea, but like I wasn't really sure it was a good
idea.  I explained that it's not really easy to know what they'll ask, so trying to memorize perfect
answers for questions could be a waste.</p>

<p>Today, she wanted me to revisit this idea, asking me if I like to teach.  &quot;yes, if the
students are interested,&quot; and went on to explain that most Japanese students of English just
toy with the romantic notion of learning English, and aren't really interested in doing the
work.</p>

<p>Lin assured me she was not like that (which I knew already), and I realized how much moe-joe
feeling I've got tied up in my brain about teaching English.</p>
