<p>Before the filming, Mark made a saw blade with a milk carton while we talked to his friend Jin,
who may be suffering from what we'd call psychosis.  She sometimes screams (apparently every 10 or
15 minutes or so when not on her medication) and says it all started when she took some medicine to
help her sleep or something (I may have the story confuzzed in my mind).</p>
