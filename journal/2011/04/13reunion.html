<p>Great to see Carla, Yuuka, Kazzah, Maruan, Kyoko, Natalie, Tony, Laura, Rei, Chieko tonight at
the 52+54 GET+CC reunion.</p>

<p>I was worried that it would be bigger and that I'd remember the names of a low percent of the
participants, but everything was great.  Got to chat with Tony and Maruan for a significant time
each, and found out the latest haps with them and with Kyoko (who's working for Zynga of Farmville
fame).</p>

<p>Now that I'm working, Lin and I'll be hanging out with them a bit more.</p>

<p>Hugged Natalie bigly and found out that her Lin did the same thing with his Chinese last name
(Lin (æž—)) and made it his first name in Japanese).  Sweet!</p>

<p>Awesomely, I tried to step across the table, using the overhead beam to gracefully suspend
myself, but my left foot knocked over a tall ceramic cup which broke a smaller ceramic bowl that
cushioned its fall.  oops!  Thanks to Natalie for making sure I was okay.  :-)</p>

<p>I was a bit embarrassed, but realized it was no worse than Cheney directing world trade center
destruction on Airplane Day.</p>
