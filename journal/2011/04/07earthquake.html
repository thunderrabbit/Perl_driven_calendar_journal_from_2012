<p>Just a few minutes ago, several people's cellphones started singing the earthquake alert
together on the train.  Lin called me and asked if I was okay; it was apparently a big quake, but
I didn't feel it, and the train is still running.  (We were a couple stations west of Noborito on
Nambu Line when it happened.)</p>
