<p>I've officially, though a bit informally, proposed to Lin.  Just about 30 minutes ago while
parked near Yokohama.  I hadn't really planned it out, but the opportunity presented itself, and I
got over my fears.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a really hard worker,&quot; I assured her.  &quot;I play really hard; I draw mazes;
I play games on my iPhone; I'm really smart with computers, and I can program, and do massage and
reiki, but I don't always work <em>hard</em>, though I'm working to expand my life and ways of
making money and enjoyment.</p>

<p>&quot;It's possible that we'll be at this level from now on; are you okay with that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you marry me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.  are you asking now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yes.  I just wanted to make sure you know what you might be getting.&quot;</p>
