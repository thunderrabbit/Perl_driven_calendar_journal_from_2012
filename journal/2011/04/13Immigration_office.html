<p>I've just arrived at the immigration office to give them a copy of my UH transcript, which, with
my 3 year work contract, will hopefully be enough to assure them I'm deserving of a three year
engineering visa.</p>

<p>grrrr.  That was a stupid amount of wasted time.</p>

<p>My errors:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>not recognizing the line near the bottom of the page, which included &quot;go to counter 5&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>not asking the nice people at the front desk where I should go</p>  <p>I spent 40 minutes waiting for my number to be called</p></li>

<li><p>assuming when the guy said &quot;go to counter 3&quot; that I should go to counter
3.</p>  <p>I spent only 10 minutes in that line.</p></li>

<li><p>After showing the guy that my transcript did, in fact, include an indication that I had
graduated, I asked if he needed my passport.  He said he didn't need it.  He didn't say &quot;today
is finished,&quot; which is my translation of what they always say when waiting is pointless
because it will take more than a day.</p>

<p>20 more minutes waiting before I was like <em>wtf</em>, and went back to the counter.  &quot;oh,
today is finished.&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks, bro.</p>

<p>These are the times that I hate Japan.</p>

<p>I went outside after throwing a bit of water over my head to cool off, and the bus was just
leaving.  The driver saw me and stopped.  Okay, I don't hate Japan anymore.</p>
