<p>Today I finished the project I had been doing last year when I left after finishing the main project.  This last task was still dangling and I hope it's completed to our 3rd party's satisfaction.  Basically it's a data dump of some of our data and they want it in a really strict format, but aren't really forthcoming with details.  Gah.</p>

<p>Cool!  I went through a <a href="http://www.droidnova.com/playing-with-graphics-in-android-part-i,147.html">beginner tutorial on Android</a> and got it to work this time.</p>
