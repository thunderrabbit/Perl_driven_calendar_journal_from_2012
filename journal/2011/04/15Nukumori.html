<p>I think nukumori means feeling someone's warmth when when hugging or closely connected.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://www.facebook.com/amy.mccaleb">Amy McCaleb</a> organized an event called
Nukumori at <a href="http://seed-ship.com/">Seed Ship</a> in Shimokitazawa</p>

<p>The event included Amy and another guy live painting, several musicians, and a slideshow from a
guy who had been to a tsunami shattered area recently. But the best thing for me was a two person
original play by <a href="http://bion5.com/">Aki</a> and Abe, which brought me to tears, plus was
really awesomely presented!  For 80% of the dialogue, the two characters were talking to each other,
but the actors were facing us directly!  We could see their every facial expression, perfect
reactions to the other character's lines.  Wow!  I don't know the name of the performance, but I'd
love to see it again.  I wanted to jump up and hug Aki as the play ended (but hadn't met her yet so
didn't).</p>
