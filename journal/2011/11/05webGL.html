<p>Starting from <a href="http://marblesoccer.com/">marblesoccer.com</a> (which is hosted on
github), I copied all the latest versions of the source code and got a version running on my server.
After getting the latest version of all the code, the marbles floated above the board instead of
rolling right on it, and the camera was positioned just *under* the player marble.  I figured out
how to adjust the camera so it's watching from a comfortable distance, but I still need to have the
camera swing around to face the way the marble is moving.</p>

<p>I turned down (from 1 to 0.1) the restitution of the tiles so the marbles would quit bouncing and
be unworkably difficult to thread through the little sample maze I put up.</p>

<p>(I'm writing while offline now, but I'm considering taking a snapshot of the current version just
for posterity)</p>

<p>Next steps are to grab a copy of the map editor and incorporate that on my site so I don't have
to copy json to a local file, upload it to my server, then copy its contents into the code, though
that ain't half bad compared to typing in pages of byte codes from Compute! magazine to run the
latest flowerpot dodging game!</p>
