<p>Last night was Irina's birthday party at Crayon Cafe near Omotesando.  Yummy buffet and cake and
great to hear Yumi tell the story of Tsunamika, a book illistrated from a story, written from a song
written by a 12 year old whose everything was washed away in Sumatra tsunami back in 2004.</p>

<p>Also got to hear Yumi and Anastasia describing what it was like to move to Japan in high school
and university age, respectively.  Wow.  I wonder how bullying here compares to some other
places.</p>
