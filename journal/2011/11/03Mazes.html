<p>While watching &quot;The Body&quot; starring Antonio Banderas, I just finished 2 more mazes, so
as soon as I scan them I'll be 4+ weeks ahead of schedule
on <a href="http://www.amazeaweek.net/">weekly mazes</a>.</p>

<p>Lin is helping her elder sister a bit today; I was invited, but elected to stay home and chill.</p>
