<p>Went to Paola and Jon for the final yoga class of 2011; Paola is going to India tomorrow for a 5
month trip.  Nice!</p>

<p>Yumi, who told the story about Tsunamika last night, told her story about the hugging mama, upon
whose ashram she happened while on her way to the beach.  Yumi was there for 3 days, but never
queued up for a hug.  She said hugging mama never got up to pee nor eat in those three days of
continuously giving hugs, each one of which was genki like her first hug of the day.</p>

<p>Shiho said she quit her job recently, and wanted to get into some graphic design for the web.  I
offered to let her do ctbriefs.net, which I've had up for a few years, always with my untrained
design.</p>

<p>Paola prepared a veritable feast of cashews and almonds + fruit and champagne + other people
brought stuff.  Yummy yummy!!</p>
