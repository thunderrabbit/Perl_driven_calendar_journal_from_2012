<p>Went to lunch with Lin after her (unsuccessful) appointment in Yokohama (Sakuragicho).  We made a
funny game in the restaurant, interrupting our normal (?) sequence of words &quot;Moe&quot;
&quot;Joe&quot; &quot;Moe&quot; &quot;Joe&quot; with 「ブーフ」 because it's funny (for us).  I
can't say you had to be there, though; even then it wouldn't have been funny.  You'd have to be
us.</p>

<p>In other news, I finished my first job on
Fiverr: <a href="http://www.fiverr.com/users/thunderrabbit/gigs/send-you-a-postcard-from-tokyo-japan">I
will send you a postcard from Tokyo, Japan for $5.</a></p>

<p>The cost was 147 + 70 yen, and $5 is about 415 yen, so I made 198 yen for my efforts.  Not
necessarily worth the price, but fun nonetheless.</p>

<p class="date">1:55pm JST</p>

<p>Ah crap.  They take $1 so I get 115 yen for my efforts.</p>
