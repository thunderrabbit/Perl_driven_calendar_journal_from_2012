<p>Woke up at 5:26am to get packed and take the 6:26am train to meet Kellie (not Kittie Kellie) to
take me to the elementary school on Atsugi Air Force Base to give massages on the teachers'
in-service day!</p>

<p>4 clients (3 of whom are repeat customers) requested an hour each.  Sweet!</p>

<p>I just ate lunch, and have an hour before my next, final appointment.</p>
