<p>Yesterday I was kinda quiet all day given the late night discussion I had had with Soness; it
turns out that she was the opposite of quiet, &quot;trying very hard to make things normal,&quot;
which I can appreciate took a lot of work.  I guess I should have told her I needed to talk more,
but I didn't really want to get into it with her again, esp. since she was in such a good mood.
(but turns out she wasn't.)</p>

<p>But, I did get some stuff done: I read a lot of chapter 3 of Artists Way, and got a good start
on a painting, and we had a 1pm meeting that started talking about online information marketing,
and then moved to talk about Yuji's new website idea.</p>

<p>PS, I've been relieved of duty working on Soness's website.  She wants someone who won't be
swayed by significant other to &quot;get a job.&quot;  Fair enough.</p>
