<p class="dream">Riding TJ Bike on the porch / sidewalk next to a building to go see Jesse at his
school where I might be getting a job.  He and the other teachers were laboriously moving some heavy
futons and full mattresses down the steps from the school to clean and back up the steps to put in
the school.  The boss was there, a young guy wearing a green jacket of a general, and Jesse was
telling him that one of the teachers was really disgusting with cigarette smoke, and probably
shouldn't be allowed to be near the students.</p>

<p class="dream">One of the students asked how I met Jesse, and I said &quot;we both used to work
on the Metro line together,&quot; but she didn't hear me, or didn't understand.</p>
