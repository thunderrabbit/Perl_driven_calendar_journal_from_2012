<p>OM is so annoying.  I mean, I know my primary job here is to do my job, but during the downtime,
we've got ye olde internettef, right?  Not right now.  For some reason, partially because he has no
idea what's what, he's like, &quot;why don't you just unplug the white boxes so we can start from
scratch when we start, and that way it's fresh.&quot;</p>
