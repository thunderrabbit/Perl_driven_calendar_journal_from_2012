<p>With Sachiko in the car, Lin picked me up from work last night and we ate at Tung Fat in
Chinatown, drove around a bit and then I had the great semi-joking idea of going to a hotel with
them both.</p>

<p>And we did!!  No romping three-way action, but we did have excellent heart to heart talks and
massage and really great evening.</p>
