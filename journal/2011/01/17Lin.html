<p>Been sending emails back and forth with Lin.  I'm really enjoying this stage of being newly in
love with her.  Because we keep things so real (&quot;you're free anytime&quot;) and don't hold back
feelings, whether joy, fear, sad, or anger-based, we're in a living relationship, and I love it.</p>
