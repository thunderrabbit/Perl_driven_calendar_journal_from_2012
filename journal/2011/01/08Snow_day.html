<p class="date">6:08pm JST Saturday  8 January 2011 (day 14899)</p>

<p>Woke up at 4am to get a 4:56am train in Chigasaki to get a 6:45am bus in Shinjuku to Hakuba with
<a href="http://www.tokyosnowclub.com/">Tokyo Snow Club</a>.</p>

<p>Today in Hakuba I chatted with Daniel and Roy at various points, enjoyed an onsen with Roy (who
has had, like me, a similarly critical spinal/cranial injury), and chatted with Moses, Shah, and a
woman from England who's been here one day, and whose name I've forgotten.</p>

<p>George and Nana got some equipment needed for the sound system while Roy and I went to the onsen.</p>

<p>Back at the venue, a club called Naughty, I set up my massage mat near the door, so I will be
able to give massages to people tonight.  Awesome!  I'm planning to do it for whatever price each
person wants to pay, with a suggested price of 1000 yen for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I just drank some hot cocoa while sitting here next to Nana, with George running around, and Roy,
who fears taking buses in Japan, reserving a bus ticket for Daniel, who dreads making phone calls in
Japanese.</p>

<p>The only snow I've touched was while tossing a &quot;cold potato&quot; snowball back and forth
with Micah, from one of the bands that's playing tonight.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll get a 5:30am taxi to Hakuba station for a 6:12am train to Matsumoto station for a
7:59am shinkansen to Hachioji at 10:06, and then normal JR to Yokohama for work.</p>
