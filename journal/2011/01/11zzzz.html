<p>Our internet connection went out here.  The worst part about it: I could have fixed it had I
checked the cables.  But htf did a cable come disconnected when no one touched the actual modem or
wireless router?  I called the company to no avail, and then took a nap.  Yuji fixed it by checking
the cables when he got home.  (I had just pulled and replaced the power cables, not the data
cables.  damn.)</p>
