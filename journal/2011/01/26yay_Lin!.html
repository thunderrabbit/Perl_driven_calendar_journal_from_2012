<p>Really happy to see Lin tonight and tell her my good job news (Rainer + Yoshio), and she told me
her great job news (first in line to show an apartment), which she obtained by working diligently
for a client</p>

<p>I told her about my ideas for fly2.nu, and then the long version including lots of sub stories
about Francois.  She almost cried when I told her how I lost Francois,
and I think hmmmmm maybe there's something useful in this story!</p>

<p>She thought Francois was related to thunderrabbit, so I told her about Thunder Rabbit and his
origin.  Then I told her about Laura teaching me some genealogy stuff, and that I just put new
software on my new website so Lin can put her family's genealogy on it.  Not sure how far this
project will go, but she is interested in her very interesting family history.</p>

<p>She told me about baby rabbits in her childhood.</p>

<p>We barked a lot and kissed a lot and suddenly it was time for me to head home.</p>
