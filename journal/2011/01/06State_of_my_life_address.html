<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>It seems that as I've been on a free-floating schedule, I've been much *less* likely to
write in my journal.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have been happily dating for 3 months now.  3.5 I guess, actually.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm pretty sure she's The One for me.</p></li>

<li><p>I love that she speaks directly to the point, with no dillydancing around the topic.  If
she's got an issue, she's like <em>boom</em>.  We get stuff out, discussed, sorted, <em>finished</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>I love her smiles, eyes, nose, face, hair, body, smile, strength, focus, eyes, smiles,
stamina, curves, beauty, and more.</p></li>

<li><p>We enjoyed several lovely lazy days together during the holidays.</p></li>

<li><p>In other news, I've been working on Soness's website, learning the shit out of git, django
and python.  Actually right now I have an issue with git, trying to create a submodule from a bare
repository cloned from an SVN repository.  It says it's unable to initialize because I'm on a
branch yet to be born.</p></li>

<li><p>I found some pretty sweet django tutorials
at <a href="http://www.lightbird.net/dbe/">http://www.lightbird.net/dbe/</a>.  The dbe stands for
Django By Example.  Other parts of the site may be equally awesome.</p></li>

<li><p>I will be going to Nagano on Saturday to give massages at a concert that will feature
something like six different bands.  I'll have an area with a chair, and I'll bring my mattress, and
hopefully it will be a great time for all involved.  I'm looking forward to helping sore skiiers and
snowboarders become less sore.</p></li>

<li><p>Yuji is in Japan for two months, so he and Soness have been hanging out a lot.  Right now
they are in 北海道 for winter type fun.  They'll be back tomorrow (night, I guess).</p></li>

<li><p>Soness has a great idea for how we can help me learn the material I bought recently: teach
it!  We're going to offer it as a bonus class after the Artists Way classes that start in January.
People can make some big money online with this stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>I'll be making a visa-run to Korea in a couple weeks.  I think it's from 17-22 January.  I plan
to stay with Soness's brother Chris and just work on Soness's new website.</p></li>

<li><p>Tonight Lin and I had a nice date in Yokohama.  Conveni dinner and a bit of a Rest.</p></li>
</ol>
