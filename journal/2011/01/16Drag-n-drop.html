<p>Though the success response doesn't get displayed, I finally got file uploads to work!  I had to
install a new version of <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.1/">Python
(2.7.1)</a>, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools
0.6c11</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/">mysql-python 1.2.3</a>, and
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/download/">Django 1.3</a> (even though it's still in beta),
make a couple of tweaks
to <a href="http://kuhlit.blogspot.com/2010/12/ajax-uploads-in-django-with-little-help.html">Alex

HI Alex

I ended up installing Python 1.7.1 and Django 1.3 (my project won't go
live before 1.3 becomes stable), and I got your code to work with two (?) 
little fixes from what's in your article.

1) I had to import json at the top of the views.py
2) You have an extra colon near the bottom of your example views code

   # save the file
   success = save_upload( upload, filename, is_raw ):

It must have been copied from the function definition line.

Again, thanks very much for the code; I hope I can put it to good use!
