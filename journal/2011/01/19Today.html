<p>&quot;Today&quot; (yesterday as I write this), I got the first vestiges of indication that I could get the Ajax
upload to save directly into Photologue (inc. Imagekit).  That was vaguely late at night, a bit
after I chatted with Lin for an hour on Skype.  I'm glad she's getting better at computery type
stuff!</p>

<p>After that, I watched <em>Cop Out</em> starring Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis.  Pretty funny,
and I was strangely intrigued by the annoying character's tenacity.</p>
