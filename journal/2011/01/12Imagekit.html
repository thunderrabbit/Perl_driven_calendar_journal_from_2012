<p>I am <em>beginning</em> to get my head
around <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdriscoll/django-imagekit/overview">Django-Imagekit</a>,
which I intend to use for my images online.  The next major step for me is to be able to upload
images without using the admin interface; I need to be able to upload images per user, and I would
like to be able to upload images
like <a href="https://github.com/glenmurphy/dropmocks">Dropmocks</a>.  Maybe I'll be able to
unravel his code now that I've been goofing around with Django a bit.  (jeez I hope it's written
for Django.)</p>

<p>Hmm; it's not.  Oh well; the code is easier for me to parse now anyway, so that's good.</p>
