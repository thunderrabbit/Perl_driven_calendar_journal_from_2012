<p class="dream">Coming back from a bit of a a shopping trip after moving in to a new location, and
coming back to a class of about 70 youth whose names I didn't really know, but was learning, I was
asked to go in and tell them class would be delayed about 20 minutes.</p>

<p class="dream">I came in from the back of the room, which they reacted a bit like,
&quot;woah&quot; and I  aid in my best radio announcer voice, &quot;this lesson brought to you by
Tipness and Piereniss, and will begin in twenty minutes&quot; and I gave a deep bow and they all
laughed a bit and understood and then I was sitting on the floor a bit outside their group and one
girl asked, &quot;why are you here teaching and in the other class [as a student]?&quot; and I
thought that was a really good question, so I went dramatically shuffling to the from of the
class, noticed some slippers the same as mine but smaller, and said, &quot;good question.&quot;
&quot;The question was, why am I here, and also up there,&quot; and they agreed it was a good
question, and I answered, &quot;I've been here before, teaching this class about four or five times,
but the class upstairs is new to many, so I'm taking it to see how it's taught.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">They were satisfied with the answer, and I noticed someone was playing the piano
really dramatically loud in the back of the room, I thought his name was Mike but I found out it
was Frank, and I hollered &quot;FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANKK!!!&quot; as loudly as I could and
he stopped playing, and I go, would you like to rejoin us&quot; and immediately realized I should
have said, &quot;your piano playing is amazing&quot; first, but I said it second &quot;I can tell
you'll be able to make a lot of money at that in the future, if you want to&quot; and he kinda
went aw man and I addressed the group, &quot;I hear that from a lot of people like, &quot;aw man I
don't need money; I ain't worried about making money,&quot;  and then said in my best reference to
someone, &quot;you will, young one, you will.&quot; </p>

<p class="dream">Then I aw Peggy and them ready to teach the class, and they came in from the back
as well, and I go, &quot;and now it's balloon day!!!&quot; and yayyyyy!! and woke up.</p>
