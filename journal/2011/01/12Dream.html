<p class="dream">With Tammy and RC in Japan, we had a request from someone to make ginger ale from
scratch, but it would require more time than was available before the restaurant closed so they told
the guy to try again after the holidays.  The basic issue was buying the syrup required a license
because it was so much syrup.</p>

<p class="dream">Tammy and RC had to leave, so though I was barefoot and a bit worried about gashing
my foot on the escalator, I took them up the escalator in a shopping mall to the shinkansen tracks,
and the shinkansen was on display with its outer shell off so that people could see the curious
seats inside.  They were all plush with recliners and TVs like in a living room, and since Tammy had
planned ahead, they were able to bring their inflatable tent which folded up into a nice mattress
about a foot thick and they placed that on the ground of the train to sleep on the way back.</p>

<p class="dream">The train operator began to put the shell of the train back on, and I wanted to
help, but I told them not to help because even I shouldn't help, but when the guy told me I
shouldn't help, I gave him the finger snarkily and then went barefoot down the escalator to get
Tammy and RC their present.  I remembered the syrup wasn't available so that I couldn't get their
present, but didn't get back up before I woke up.</p>
