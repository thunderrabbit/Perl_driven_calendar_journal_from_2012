<p>I've gotten the code about as far as I can given the non-coding design I've done so far.  Need
to get off the computer and start drawing some pictures and stuff because I'll otherwise start
creating spaghetti and nothing useful will come of that.</p>

<p>Oh, and I need to start packing soon cause I'm leaving in about 12 hours.</p>
