<p>I got on a bus that had the right markings, but it left 20 minutes before I expected, so I
thought, &quot;hmmm!!&quot; but it went to the right place and I went to grab some food, then a
taxi, and showed him the address where I'm staying.</p>

<p>He drove me right to it and was like, &quot;???&quot; and I go, &quot;????&quot; cause I wasn't
sure, but I showed him the picture I had of the place, and it *looked* about right, but I wasn't
totally sure.</p>

<p>He called his friend and we drove around a bit, and it turns out it was the right place in the
first place, but I paid him the new bonus-taxi-ride fare, plus a tip, and paid his friend a tip for
driving out and assuring my driver it was, in fact, the building I wanted.</p>

<p>To <del>git</del> <ins>get</ins> into the apartment, I had to press the keypad code and *.
Otherwise it was like, &quot;nah.&quot;</p>

<p>Guess what I forgot!!!</p>

<p>I forgot to bring an electrical outlet adapter. Chris may have an extra one, though.</p>

<p>(he won't be home until 9pm.)</p>
