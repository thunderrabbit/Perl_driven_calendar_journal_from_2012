<p>Lin and I are driving to IKEA today because she chipped one of Soness's new plates.  IKEA's
website sucks because it didn't clearly say &quot;we're closed on January 1st.&quot; In fact, it
said things that made me think they were open normal hours throughout the holidays.  We had a nice
walk in nice weather on January 1st, but what an aggravation to see them closed as we arrived.
dammit.</p>
