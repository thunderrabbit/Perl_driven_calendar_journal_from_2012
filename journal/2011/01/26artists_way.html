<p>Great to see Arwen again!  I missed her last week while in Korea. She told me some funny stories
that happened during the last week.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>The group played a tag game in the street that was pretty fun, but even more fun when I played it
full out.  But, I didn't necessarily like that when I played full out, I was more attached to the
outcome.  Hmm!</p>
