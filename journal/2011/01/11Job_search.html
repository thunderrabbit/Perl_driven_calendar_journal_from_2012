Good morning, Rainer!

I hope you enjoyed a pleasant weekend.

&gt; My name is Rainer Morita, providing executive and engineer matchmaking as
&gt; well as career coaching services.

Great to meet you!   I'm Rob Nugen, masseur, programmer, artist, teacher.

&gt; In order to help you effectively, I would like to know more about your
&gt; situation. I kindly ask you to briefly answer the following questions:
&gt;
&gt; What is the goal of your job search?

I would like to stay in Tokyo, and have enough money to get an
apartment with my future wife Lin, raise two (future) kids and put
them in International school.

I have been looking for web / database programming work; my goal for a
job has been to find a position doing web/database development in a
language I know (PHP, Python, Perl, C/C++, SAS, MySQL) or even better,
a language I don't yet know (Ruby, Java, Oracle, Sybase, etc) on a
unix system in an environment of people who know how to program.  I'm
open to a management position, but should probably start small because
I don't have any professional management experience.  I'm definitely
open to learning management skills.

&gt; For how long have you been searching for a job so far and what are your
&gt; biggest challenges for finding what you really want?

Biggest challenge seems to be that I don't have experience in the
banking/financial industry, or that I don't have enough Japanese
language skills.  Others are that I haven't had really long term IT
employment in Japan.  One company went out of business while I was
working for them, and the other two were contract positions.  Rakuten
said that by my age (41), they would want me to have management
experience.

&gt; Have you been considering new career directions and possibilities which are
&gt; different from what you did in the past?

Yes.

I finished my most recent IT contract in early 2010 (with sbstrm),
then went to Thailand for 3 months to study Thai massage, hoping to be
able to start a business related to massage.  I have a lot of
experience and great feedback from giving massages, but I didn't have
a certification recognized by a government.  I still don't have that
certification, so I've been hesitant to really advertise myself as a
masseur.  I'm trained in reiki as well, but again no certification.

My friends and I have thought that the idea of private house-call
massage in English would be great.  There's plenty of money with
people who work from home or who take care of the home, and I'm trying
through word-of-mouth to get into that market.

My housemate Soness has the brilliant idea of starting a business that
combines IT and massage.   I'm working on getting that started as
well.

We are also looking at teaching workshops for internet related
business, starting in early February.

&gt; How satisfied are you with the service of other recruiting agencies?

Well, I haven't gotten much response from them.  Usually I get at most
a single suggested company when I sign up with the recruiting agency,
and then "okay we'll keep you in mind" after that, but no real
response.

&gt; How satisfied are you with the progress of your job search?

I'm optimistic that I will find the right position / business if I
keep putting effort toward these different paths.

&gt; Thank you for your cooperation. I will be in contact with you shortly.

Thanks for that.  I really appreciate you asking useful questions, and
I look forward to working with you.  Upon successful placement, I look
forward to taking Paola, Jon, Lin, you and a friend all out to dinner!

   cheers!!
   - Rob
