<p>Today was meditation in the morning and the bread baking fun at Paola's house with Lin, Sachiko,
Leila, Emma, Mayuko, Kamechan, Paola, Jon, May, and Shige.  45 minute meditation became easier when
I used my version of Sachiko's technique of clearing the mind instead of trying to focus on
something.</p>

<p>Salad, soup, and bread were yummmmy.</p>
