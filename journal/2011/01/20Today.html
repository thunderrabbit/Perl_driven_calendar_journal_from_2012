<p>Getting better at getting images to save from Ajax to Photologue.</p>

<p class="date">2:44am JST Friday 21 January 2011 (day 14912)</p>

<p>But couldn't get the User to be saved along with the upload.
I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750200/is-system-user-defined-in-django">indirectly
asked about it on SO</a>.  And I found a question related to the work I've been doing, and answered
it as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750168/fileupload-with-django/4750292#4750292">ajax-upload usage</a></p>

<p>There's been no answer to my question after 40 minutes, and no comment on my answer after 30
minutes, so bedtime for me now.</p>
