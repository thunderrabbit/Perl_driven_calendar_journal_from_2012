<p>Lovely to see Lin last night; while she cooked cheesey potatoes, I got Python 2.7.1 installed,
setuptools installed, Mysql-python installed, and django 1.2.4 installed,
but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4692816/installed-new-version-of-python-but-django-still-uses-system-default">Django
refused to use the new version of Python</a>.</p>

<p>Thank goodness for stackoverflow, cause I got the answer immediately!  It was an <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Passenger_WSGI#Passenger_WSGI_and_virtualenv">easy change to
Passenger WSGI</a></p>

<p>Lin and I barked and barked, and ママ was like, &quot;you guys are crazy; go to sleep!!&quot;
We were quiet after that, but didn't sleep for a while.  Too hard to sleep at 10pm, when I usually
sleep at 2am.</p>

<p>I reallly like Lin.  Most def.</p>
