<p>Before meeting Lin near ドンキーホテー, I went to the massage studio on B1F and told them
&quot;no, I don't have an appointment, but I give massages.&quot; and the guy talked to another guy
and came back saying &quot;we'll call you,&quot; which I'm guessing means &quot;we'll never call
you,&quot; but at least he went back and talked to the guy.</p>

<p>Oh, before that, I saw a couple down near Hanzomon Line with a map, and asked if they needed
help.  They were trying to determine the identity of the light gray train line that went straight
to Meguro.  I told them what it was (Yamanote), showed them where it was, and how to buy tickets.
Even got a picture of them next to Hachiko.</p>

<p>Met Lin and she drove me to Yokohama, and we stopped at Denny's along the way.  Talk talk talked
while there; I told her stories about how my parents got together, how I got here, and how I used to
treat Fred badly back in the day.  Explained that I might be sex crazy because when I was young
(around age 10), the girl across the street taught me how to kiss and the pleasures of oral sex.</p>

<p>I just tonight put that link together.  Not sure how much merit the story merits.</p>

<p>I told her why I have resisted learning Japanese, and she told me she totally understood, given
that she remembers going from a native Poruguese 9 year old to a Japanese fluent 11 year old.</p>

<p>Somehow the topic got to Celcius vs Farenheit degrees, and it turned out her confusion was
thinking that &quot;celcius&quot; and &quot;farenheit&quot; were units, like, &quot;degree.&quot;
I can see how that would be confusing, cause they're totally not units.  Anyway, I got her sorted
on that, I think, (using an imaginary poster featuring pictures of different dogs as an analogy).</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing her after work tomorrow.</p>
