<p>After lots of staring at my code and others' libraries and a little Google and tinkering with
toots, I got something to work, even if it didn't work.</p>

<p>Here's my commit message (with linebreak added for my journal):</p>

<pre>
    I love when it's awesome to get a Failure message.
    it means *something* worked, in this case ajax upload
</pre>

<p>Sweet as.</p>

<p>The only little issue: the last library I used is licensed with GPL, which means either I can't
use it, or when the site goes live, we have to release all the source code.  It's mostly a
patchwork of libraries, but I wonder if I can convince Soness it's the best way to go.</p>
