<p>Hanging out with Sachiko for the last hour here at Outback Steakhouse in Shibuya, we've been
talking about relationships, the bleach-blonde waitress's hair, Lin, the art museum Sachiko visited
today, my art that I still haven't uploaded, the all male Japanese group who got three Bloomin'
Onions (deep fried onion sliced like a flower), and how most people she knows are Mac users.</p>

<p class="date">7:48pm JST</p>

<p>Yay!  Lin just arrived!  She was stuck at work waiting for NTT to install wiring at her client's
house.</p>
