<p>Great time at karaoke with Lin, Soness and Yuji after they got home from Nagano where they bathed
with monkeys in hot springs.  Lin's a really good singer!  Somehow I didn't notice the high quality
of her singing the first time we did karaoke together.  Soness was also like, &quot;omg she is
really good!!&quot;</p>
