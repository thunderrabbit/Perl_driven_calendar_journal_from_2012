<p>Soness has led The Artist's Way workshops at Ben's Cafe in Takadanobaba twice in the past year,
and I didn't join because I had to work long hours.  Now I'm not working long hours, so I joined
this, the third &quot;season&quot; of The Artist's Way in Tokyo!</p>

<p>We had a good turnout of like 11 people, many of whom I know from The Pink Cow, or Ben's Cafe
(Yoshiko, herself).  There were maybe 5 people I didn't know previously.</p>

<p>Arwen was there, and I really hope she stays for the duration.  She's a lovely person, and I'd
like to get to know her better.  Divy was there, and I am sure she'll stay for the duration.  She's
a lovely person, and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better!  Same for the rest, but
right now, those two stand out the most for me.</p>
