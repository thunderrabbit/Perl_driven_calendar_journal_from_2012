<p>Lin wins the awesome award for being awesome.  I love (like treasure) that she says what's on
her mind; she doesn't complain about shit a week or month after it happened; she tells me in real
time.  That way we can get it discussed and out in the open, air it out and kick it out.  This
perfectly matches my interests.</p>

<p>Today I was going to show her pictures of something on Facebook, but then realized I didn't have
my password so couldn't log on.  She was like, &quot;what do you mean you don't know your
password?&quot;</p>

<p>I paused for a bit, and then countered with, &quot;can I change the topic significantly?&quot;
She said, &quot;no; tell me why you don't know your password,&quot; and I said, &quot;I'm telling
you, but to do so I have to change the topic.&quot;  She goes, &quot;oh, well okay.&quot;</p>

<p>And I told her about <a href="http://lastpass.com/">lastpass.com</a>
and <a href="http://supergenpass.com/">supergenpass.com</a>, which both take a master pasword and a
domain, and return a stong password per domain.

<p>I also told her about Bruce Shneir's method, after telling her that he said &quot;we'e already
trained to protect small piieces of paper.&quot;</p>
