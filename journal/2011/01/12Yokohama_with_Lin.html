<p>Lin and I hung out in Yokohama after she drove us from Shibuya.  3 hours of hanging out with her
past in a flash; I so enjoy her company and talking talking talking.  I'm really quite confident in
my plan to marry her once I get some financial footing sorted.</p>

<p>We talked about my basic plan of applying for 1 job / company / recruiter per weekday until I get
an acceptable job, or until March 1st (and then we'll think about another strategy), while still
living with Soness and helping with her new website, and building our internet based businesses.</p>

<p>Lin has been asking for a bit questions like, &quot;are you sure you want to marry me?&quot; and
&quot;since when did you decide<del>d</del>?&quot;</p>

<p>I told her the real shift happened when we were in a hotel before we really got together, and I,
though horny, asked her to just let me wash her back in the shower.  She said, &quot;are you sure
you're okay?&quot; and I recognized I was sure, and said &quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p>She got into the shower with a towel wrapped around her derrier, and only showed me her
back... and I suddenly <em>remembered</em> we have done this before.  I'm talking past lives, and
omg samurai Japan, or is it the Tom Cruise movie I remember, but it sure feels real, and I can
nearly taste it.  This connection runs deeply.</p>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; I said tonight, &quot;that you <em>trusted</em> me to not do anything, and that
I <em>remembered</em> we had done this before....  That's when I started to be sure.&quot;</p>
