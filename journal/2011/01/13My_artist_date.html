<p>Sweet!  Without even really planning it, I went on an Artists Date with myself.  The original
goal was to get a blank book for Morning Pages, but I didn't find one in Chigasaki nor in Sekaido in
Fujisawa, but I did buy some white paperboard boards for drawing.  Went downstairs seeking a snack
and found a most delicious treat!  T'was at that point I realized I was doing whateva I wanted to
do, so I bought two more delicious treats, a delicious vanilla shake and sat down to draw and
eat.  Yummmm!!!</p>

<p>At the end of my date, Peter, who is *also* in the Artists Way group happened by!  He came up
behind me in the shop, &quot;is that Rob?&quot; in his radio announcer voice.  &quot;Peter!!!&quot;
and we sat for a bit and chatted while he ate a scone and I admired my new artwork.  I'll almost
certainly upload pictures tonight.</p>
