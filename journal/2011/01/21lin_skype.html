<p>Skyped with Lin tonight after she got home from work.  The first cool thing was that I basically
felt her availability.  I had been writing a letter to her and was suddenly like, &quot;oh I bet
she's home,&quot; and went to check my email.  She had just emailed me 7 minutes before, which is
the exact amount of time it takes for such a feeling to go over the sea between Japan and Korea.
Amazing!</p>

<p>Anyway, we skyped for an hour, mostly talking about what we plan to do to(gether| each other)
tomorrow, though very little of the discussion focused on the dinner and movie part of the plans.
We'll be seeing The Social Network.</p>

<p>I plan to wake up in a bit less than 4 hours to write morning pages and head out to the bus
station.  Good night!!</p>
