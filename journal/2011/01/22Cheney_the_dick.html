<p>It's really fucking hard for me to keep love in my heart for Dick Cheney each time I go through
security at the airport.  For me, he's the dick who brought us all into this, by orchestrating the
Pentagon and military stand down on Airplane Day, now almost ten years ago.</p>

<p>I really hope he really believes he did the best thing for humanity, but I believe he did it for
selfish reasons.</p>

<p>Lemme break it down for you, and maybe I'll put this
on <a href="http://ctbriefs.net/">CTbriefs.net</a>:</p>

<p>The managers of the megabanks and megareligions are working diligently to sustain their control
over the world.  By telling people that money is important, the banks keep us working and chasing
physical things (like cats chase string).  By telling people we can only find &quot;salvation&quot;
through them, the churches are an effective innoculation against true spirituality.  Instead of
watching TV, try being creative.  writing, singing, dancing, painting, anything that helps you find
your personal connection to your Self.</p>

<p>I think that's short enough for CT Briefs.</p>

<p>Anyway, The three World Trade Center towers were destroyed by people with control inside the US
military+political+financial complex.  These people have the means (install bombs and demolition
equipment beforehand, and tell the military to stand down on the day) and motivation to execute such
an event: it gives them huge, short and long term financial gains and keeps them in effective
control of the masses by scaring the proverbial shit out of them.</p>

<p>People who think otherwise are probably blinded by TV or paid by the government to essentially
troll articles, movies and other information online.</p>

<p>To be honest, I haven't done the footwork to go interview hundreds of eye witnesses.  Enter the
magical power of ye olde internettes, and the truth becomes more clear.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How many towers collapsed that day?</p>

<p>three.  very little media coverage was given
to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wtc+7">WTC 7</a> which collapsed at 5pm that day.</p>
</li>

<li><p>How hot was the rubble 6 weeks after the collapse?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wtc+molten+metal">hotter than fuck</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am writing this while waiting in the airport, so can't look up exact links, but the terms
above should be pretty good searches to get one started on the WTC WTF research adventure.</p>
