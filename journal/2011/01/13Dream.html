<p class="dream">Living in a house that condoned casual sex, we could just arbitrarily play sexually
with each other, with no strings attached, nor any expectations of orgasm or not; it was just fun
and loving and relaxed.</p>

<p class="dream">Watching clouds go by with Lin, we saw all kinds of really cool formations created
by the wind going at various speeds, fast then slow, then sporadic and choppy; it was creating
spectacular shapes and some of the clouds fluffed off and floated down to us to catch and became
balloons I could use to fly a little bit.  I jumped up to a tree using the lofty balloons and called
to Lin to take a picture of me swinging my legs out sideways.  She didn't want to take the picture
at that time, and was analyzing the camera and I finally was like, &quot;have you taken a picture
yet?&quot; and she goes, &quot;no,&quot; and I dropped down out of the tree, &quot;I'm done,&quot;
and walked away without further discussion.</p>

<p class="dream">After a few minutes I realized that violated our trust, so I went back to her and
caressed her head and hair, saying &quot;you're a good photographer,&quot; and she goes,
&quot;thank you; I was just uncomfortable using a new camera; I wanted to read the whole manual to
make sure I used it correctly, etc.&quot; and I said, &quot;I understand, and I'm sorry I didn't
respect that.  it was just a miscommunication.&quot;  She agreed and we made up.</p>
