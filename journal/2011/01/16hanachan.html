<p>I've gotten over the idea of romping with Lin and Sachiko.  Now I have a new second girlfriend
and Lin's 100% approval.  I have loved Hanachan for a long time, and today I finally got a chance
to smooch her (because she was so cold).</p>

<p>Lin took me to Yokohama station for 3 hours of free hanging out and omg I'm going to miss her so
much when I'm gone to Korea for the week starting tomorrow, but we'll do some non-free hanging out
on Saturday night when I get back.</p>
