<p>Today was a &quot;job fair&quot; featuring about 15 booths with employees on one side of the
table and 4 to 30 candidates on the other side of the table.  I rocked up to the less crowded
booths and gave my massage card &quot;HI; I bring massages to the workplace, so your hard working
employees can get a healthy relaxation break during the day.&quot;  Or in Japanese, &quot;um, yeah
I'm Rob I massage.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave my card to about 10 different people I think, a few of whom were like, &quot;cool&quot;
or, in one woman's case, &quot;nice.&quot;</p>

<p>Sam was there; he's an IT guy I e-met through Soness, and we've been helping each other with
latest job search tips.</p>

<p>I'm on the train now to see Lin in Shibuya, and I just got an email (from her, I hope!)</p>
