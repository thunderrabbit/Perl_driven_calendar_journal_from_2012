<p class="dream">Flying from Narita to Tokyo in a large aircraft, we flew backwards up and over a
mountain.  I was surprised at how closely we were following the contour of the mountain, and how
little the pilots seemed to be paying attention to the plane.  Looking backwards from my seat, I
could see we were flying under electrical lines, between houses and trees, and only about 10 feet
above the surface of the mountain.</p>

<p class="dream">We arrived safely, and I asked the pilots why we had flown that path, and the
woman was like, &quot;well, there's actually two branches of mathematics that say that's the best
route.  The first one is calculus,&quot; she said, while drawing the smooth shape of the mountain.
&quot;Because the mountain's shape is so regular, it's easy to graph.&quot;  I suggested that its
was an easily defined function.  She said, &quot;not easily defined, but convex; it doesn't have
any dips.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Her voice trailed away as she was thinking about something else, and I was going
to remind her, &quot;you said there were two mathematics here,&quot; but then Fred and I were
leaving the plane, walking to school.  We were talking about something and then suddenly he did not
turn where I did turn, and didn't say &quot;bye,&quot; or anything, so I was sad to miss him.  I
decided to walk to his side of the building, and then I remembered the cool dream I had had about
the airplane flying backwards, so I took my computer to write it all down.  The computer box was
pretty big, so everyone could see I had a non-local computer.   Walking the shortcut back route to
avoid detection, I went up the stairs on my side of the building, which was more like a hotel.
Walking on the hallway/balcony overlooking the hotel entrance, I went to the elevated crosswalk to
Fred's building.</p>

<p class="dream">While in the crosswalk, I went past the computer repair center on my left, and
realized that people probably thought I was going there so didn't bother asking why I was carrying
my computer.  The people in the shop saw my entire computer box and I expected were probably
relieved when I did *not* come in to ask for support.</p>

<p class="dream">Outside, there was a street crossing the crosswalk, and up came a strange car,
perhaps a weinermobile advertising hot dogs with bright neon signs.  It passed, and I crossed
safely, into a downward sloping garage area, where a guy wearing a spiderman + transformers outfit
was playing hackey sack with another guy, who knew me, though I didn't remember him.  He invited me
to play, but I declined, citing my need to &quot;get some work done,&quot; but I assured him he
should keep playing because the circle will certainly grow (and one more guy joined them just while
I was talking so I said, &quot;see?  it's working already!&quot;), and that I would join them on my
way back if they were still playing.</p>

<p class="dream">Down the back of the garage and into the school, I found Fred immediately inside a
room.  I went up to him, &quot;hey do you think I can steal an internet connection?&quot; and
immediately wished I hadn't used the word &quot;steal,&quot; which might bring attention to the
fact that I shouldn't *actually* be there.  He was like, &quot;yeah, and showed me to another room,
and found an available ethernet cable between two couches, upon one of which was sitting Joana
Olson, who I hadn't seen in some time. She didn't notice me at first, but then I was like,
&quot;hey Joana,&quot; and she was lie, &quot;HI!&quot; and then we were interrupted by the room
monitor who asked if I woudln't be able to use one of their local computers.  Fred and Jonana both
immediately covered for me, saying that I had a lot of installed software that I needed for my
project, but would not be able to install on the local computers.  The woman asked then if I'd be
able to install some of their software on my machine.  I said, &quot;almost certainly, yes,&quot;
not agreeing to do it, because I had the feeling that they couldn't force me to do it because they
couldn't touch outsider machines, and if I *did* install it, they would have access to my machine,
which I didn't think they needed.</p>
