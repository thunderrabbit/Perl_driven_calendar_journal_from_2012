<p>Today, after a relatively slow morning to early afternoon, we got a call from the client saying
that something was amiss in the app we released on 14 September.  Hmmm!</p>

<p>I fixed the error in about an hour, most of which was spent fiddling with settings to make the
image show up in just the right place in the RelativeLayout, and then discovered a neat thing about
.apk files.  They <em>literally</em> are just .zip files, but with a .apk extension.  I needed to
unzip the old .apk to get the zipped books out of it (long story), and boom there they were, in all
their zipped glory.  Perfecto.  Put the app in the Android Market.  version 1.11 weighing in at
50MB, with version 1.2 on its 4.15MB way soon.</p>
