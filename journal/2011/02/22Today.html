<p>&quot;Today&quot; I went to the beach after Sam called me to see if he should pass on my resume
to Hays Consulting.  Hays Consulting called me while I was at the beach and asked a few Qs about my
current situation, and ultimately said they'd introduce me to the IT department at GABA.  Nice.
We'll see how that goes.</p>

<p>I also worked on Android study a bit, getting through five chapters of the Learn Android in 24
Hours book.</p>

<p>Soness, Yuji, and Shasta came home from Nagano and Yokohama, respectively, and Soness and Shasta
talked about the latest haps while Yuji went upstairs to sleep; he has swine flu.  Awww yeah.</p>

<p>I talked to Lin for a bit; she had a rough day, but seems to have gotten the best option in the
end.  Hopefully the client will sign her contract.</p>

<p>Then I watched the first quarter of The Century of The Self, featuring the beginnings of
Propoganda brought to the US in the form of Public Relations
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>.  Interesting spooky
stuff!</p>
