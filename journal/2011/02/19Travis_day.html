<p>Hung out with Travis for a good portion of the day today, from 1pm in Ikejiriohashi to like 10pm
in The Crocodile in Shibuya.  We ate at Soul Food Bangkok, his favorite restaurant in Tokyo.  I
liked that the waitstaff was actually Thai!  I ate pad thai, and Travis had something else.</p>

<p>He told me about his plans for business growth, and explained how he plans to use a sustainable
growth model, have optimal exit strategies, and prepare for his future, all at once.  Wow!</p>

<p>We brainstormed ways to implement fly2.nu, and a couple ways to make the area around his house
quieter.</p>

<p>We walked indirectly to Shibuya by way of several diversions, esp around the stadium sized
traffic spiral on 246 near Shibuya.</p>

<p>To the 6th floor in the Q building (with Starbucks facing Shibuya Crossing), we ate in Wired
Cafe, ostensibly for its free internet access, of which there was little, unless I give them my cell
phone email or my ISP email.  No web-based email addresses.  dang.</p>

<p>But he showed me a fun game
called <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/PleasingFungus/manufactoria">Manufactoria</a>, which
I'll readily admit is more fun for some people than others.  I got to the third puzzle before I was
temporarily stumped, and had to quit trying before my computer's battery gave its last oomph.  I
continued to think about the problem, though, and solved it in my head while in The Crocodile.  When
I told Travis he was like, &quot;niiice,&quot; in a supportive way.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't as supportive of him when he asked what the mostly-covered painting said
on the wall behind the stage.  I think he could have figured it out, but I just blurted it out and
was like, &quot;aw man; it says Crocodile!&quot;  sigh.</p>

<p>Moonshots played, and they're exactly the kind of music leaning toward that which I do not
love.  It wasn't utterly unacceptable, but I sure didn't dance much.</p>

<p>Lin arrived and they wanted to charge her 2000 yen to come in, but I wanted to go out, so we
said bye to Travis and headed out.</p>
