<p>I started making my Marble Track 3 back in 2008.  I stopped construction when I moved to Chez
Soness.  I'd like to revisit construction, and I think I can make room to do it, if I move Joel's
box and Jaime's bag out of the closet.</p>

<p>I'm not ready to upload the video so far to youtube, but I might upload a private version of
it.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>I don't have a strong enough word to berate myself for losing data that I thought I had backed
up on S3.</p>
