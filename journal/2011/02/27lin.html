<p>Great time with Lin after work; best of all, we found a kids' play area with a big net hammock
inside the Happy Lawson near Osambashi port.  Awesome.  Also met Mahammed there; he's from
Bangladesh, and wrote his name for me in Bengali.  I'm going to try to get Aardvark to find someone
who can type it for me in UTF-8.</p>

<p>Lin and I talked about past lives, our future life, PB, the desire to travel, Bonnie, the rest of
her family, and more, I am sure.</p>

<p>We sat in Zohnohana Park (&quot;elephant nose park&quot;), which I would write in Japanese, but I
forgot what word they used for &quot;Park.&quot; It wasn't 公園.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Google satellite map of the area still shows it under construction, so it
showed our blue &quot;y'all are here&quot; dot in the middle of a construction site hahhahaha.  I
uploaded it to my picture distributor, which sprays it in various locations on the internets.</p>

<p>Oh; that's another thing we talked about recently.  Last night, I was explaining to Lin how the
internets were formed, and told her a bit about the difference between the internet and the web, in
terms of who designed each, who uses them and the type of content that can be sent.</p>
