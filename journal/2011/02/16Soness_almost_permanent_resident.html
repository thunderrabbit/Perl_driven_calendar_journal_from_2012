<p>Soness went to the immigration office on Monday, with her old passport, so she couldn't get her
permanent residence visa.  We talked to one of the senior guys there and he said because I live in
the same house, I can pick it up for her, if I bring my passport, alien card, Soness's passport, a
copy of her alien card, the postcard that says she can get her visa, and a revenue stamp for 8000
yen.</p>

<p>I brought all that to the counter today, and the girl was like, &quot;sorry; you have to be
family or married.&quot;</p>

<p>I assured them that someone said it was okay, but didn't know his name.  They were like,
&quot;yah why don't you talk to the guy at counter number five.&quot;</p>

<p>Turns out, because this is &quot;the last visa&quot; someone receives in Japan, they want to
have a little chat with the recipient to make sure they respect Japan culture or something.</p>

<p>hmmph</p>

<p>I saw the guy who said it was okay, and was like, &quot;hey remember me?  remember Soness? etc
etc,&quot; and he did, but they assured me it's still impossible.</p>

<p>gah.</p>
