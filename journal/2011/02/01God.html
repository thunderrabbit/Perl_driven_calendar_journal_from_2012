<p>God came to the door in the form of two women
pimping <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/">watchtower.org</a>.  I explained my beliefs were
incompatible with the concept of a god with human attributes of ego and emotions, except maybe love,
depending on what that means.</p>

<p>I didn't get so far as to describe epp or ipote, but started with the billboard I saw (&quot;LOVE
DOES NOT TALLY THE FAULTS OF OTHERS&quot; (or something like that)), then talked about past lives
and buddha consciousness + enlightenment, plus a brief version of my grandmother speech.</p>

<p>The more talkative of the pair was pretty well able to ask good questions, but still, for some
reason, didn't sway me to join their ranks.</p>

<p>I assured them I don't think god is a long beard guy taking notes, and she asked me what I
thought god was.  &quot;Well, a couple of years ago, I used to think that god was god and thought 'I
wonder what it's like to <em>need</em> something,' so he made us so we could play a game of
forgetting that we are actually god, and believe that we need to stay inside the bodies to live.
Eventually the body dies and the spirit goes back to god and says 'wow that was really weird!' and
god says thanks for checking it out for me.&quot;  Then, &quot;But now I realize that that couldn't
be because it would have said god had a need / want to know what something was like, which goes
against my belief that god has no needs.  So, I am thinking god is simply consciousness,&quot; and
went on to describe the author of Eat Pray Love saying that when she experienced ______ for a bit,
it was like &quot;sitting in the palm of God&quot; and &quot;completely natural&quot; (I think
that's a pretty close quote.)</p>

<p>They left with all their pamphlets. </p>
