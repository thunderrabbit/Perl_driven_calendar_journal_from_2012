<p>&quot;Today&quot; was a Beers for Books event in Chigasaki, organized by Masami and Diane.  I
went from about 1:30pm to 6pm, mostly during which I hung out and enjoyed chowing and chatting with
Diane, Leanne (sp), Tiffany, Amy (sp), Darlene (sp), Dave, and Maryanne (sp).  About an hour of
that time I spent giving massages to anyone who wanted them.  The money went to B4B charity (40
books paid for with massage), and I was happily surprised to even get some tips!</p>

<p>Tiffany had a cool idea of combining yoga massage and yoga, so we talked about how to do that in
March.  Sweet!!  I look forward to expanding my repertoire.</p>
