<p>Went to the immigration office to get my 3 year engineering visa, but my company needs to fill
out one more form, which I'll ahve them mail.</p>

<p>Soness arrived just after Jesse was like, &quot;HI&quot; to me, asking about my computer +
keyboard and iPhone running and charging...  I told him I was learning Android development, and he
said cool because he has some apps in mind, and then told me about his mom who is helping some
people get connected with some huge markets (unlimited + awesome = nice) and I'm like,
&quot;woah,&quot; cause it's supa-cool.</p>

<p>Soness got her permanent residency visa!  yay!!!  She's been approved, but now just needs to go
back with her correct passport (oops!).</p>

<p>She and I had tea and chatted and got everything sorted.  No more fighting, and for that I'm
realllly thankful.</p>
