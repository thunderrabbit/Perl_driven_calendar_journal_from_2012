<p>Went to the ward office to get my new visa info written on my alien registration card, and they
were like, &quot;actuallllyy.. you gotta getta new card.&quot;  D'oh!</p>

<p>Good news is they took my old pictures (made for Thailand trip, I think), so I didn't have to
pay a photobooth for a pic.</p>
