The government is largely paying for it

6000 yen for colon, stomach, lung cancer screening

<pre>
12 hours of not eating, plus sticking a stick in my shit for two cycles, 
and soon the culmination of a thermometer up the bum!  
and then..... lunch

<p>Wow!  That was actually quite fun and quite easier than I expected!!</p>

<p>I got to get my stomach gassed up, then got to drink milky chalk and flip around on a rotating
board, though it didn't rotate enough to require seat belt, much less enough to keep me on with
centrifigual momentum, but it was fun.</p>
