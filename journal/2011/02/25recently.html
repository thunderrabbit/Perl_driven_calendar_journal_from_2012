<p>Have been kinda down and out with influenza type A (&quot;swine flu,&quot; yes!!) for the past
couple days.  The doctor who gave me the diagnosis was quite cute and I fell in love a bit.  Didn't
get her name; didn't tell her I had a crush on her; it's all temporary so no use in that.</p>

<p>Two guys have been diligently knocking down the house across the street.  I've been diligently
watching them, but *not* getting pictures.  <!-- ((( I gotta getta good photo uploady thing
going... I may well set up the one I made for Soness's website.  Fortunately all concerns about
using GNU Copylefted code are released, like me from her project. ))) --> The most fun parts are the
loudest, with big timbers breaking as the second floor and roof come tumbling down.  Most
interesting to me is the way they systematically keep everything relatively <em>clean</em> while
doing the deconstruction.  Even in the work area itself, most notably, cleaning up bits of wood on
the ground from between the slats of flooring of the floor they were about to destroy next.</p>

<p>On the understandable side, they were largely sorting the rubble into distinct types: wood and
nails, tar paper, sheet metal, plaster board, electric wiring, toilets, sinks, and the rest.</p>

<p>I noticed a wooden bowl in the rubble and after a great deal of deliberation and prayer that it
come to me intact, I went and asked the guy driving The Claw if I could「すみません、あそこ見つけた
のボウェルをいただけますか？」「あれ？」「サラダのボウェル」And I was glad he pretty much understood
me the first time and retrieved the bowl, in quite perfect condition.  I plan to give it to Lin for
her birthday, as a beautiful heirloom.  I wish I knew more of its history.</p>

<p>I emailed Wende and Christine for their birthdays; I hope they're each doing well in their
family lives.</p>

<p>Nibbles escaped the confines of the house for the larger part of last night and today until I was
near the neighbor's house when the neighbor inadvertantly found Nibbles behind her bicycle.  (the
neighbor's bike, not the cat's)</p>
