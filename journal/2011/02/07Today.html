<p>I washed and hung laundry last night; that's a great way to get a jump start on using the sun's
drying prowess.</p>

<p>Dug out my suitcases from the shed and shed some old clothes that I'm unlikely to miss.  I
stored them for a bit but then found stacks of old clothes donated at Co-op, so added mine to the
stacks.  Took suit to the cleaners.</p>

<p>Went to get cheap cancer screening, but the first hospital I visited was like, [nope; we've
reached capacity], and the second clinic was like, &quot;we can do these two, but not this
one,&quot; and the third clinic I tried was closed until 3pm.</p>

<p>Aight; I'm going to go back there now.</p>

<p>Appointment made for all three tests, and I canceled the tests scheduled for the other clinic.
Awww yeah.</p>
