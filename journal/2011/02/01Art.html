<p>Been working on a piece since yesterday that I think I'll name because of its circles.  There are
several squiggly lines and then 21 sets of concentric circles drawn behind the lines, with the
increasingly larger circles eventually talking to the other circles, but again, (mostly) with no
colors overlapping already drawn colors.</p>
