<p>Tomorrow I will be talking to a company about possibly working for them.  It's not a guarantee,
so today I emailed a couple of schools and a summer camp to see if I can teach English for them.</p>

<p>Then I got a call from Alfonzo, my former boss, to see if I can have a lunch meeting with him
Thursday, to talk about the possibility of work.</p>

<p>Then I got an email from a guy saying he has 2 possible jobs for me to look at.  One pays 7
million yen per year.  The other pays 10 million yen per year.</p>

<p>holy snappers!</p>
