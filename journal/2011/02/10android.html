<p>85% chance Nate and Alfonzo can hire me back on full time.  Sweet as.  I did some Android Hello
World tutorials, and got a bit stuck on the HelloTab one.  It runs but no tabs are displayed.  I
think I got a bit too cocky with my class names oohhhh I think I know what it may be.  Yeah the
project was supposed to be called HelloTab or something, and I called it HelloDog, which was one of
the tabs, so the Activity which runs is the Dog tab, not the tabs' parent view.  I just gotta
figure out how to tell the parent to be the correct parent and not the dog.</p>
