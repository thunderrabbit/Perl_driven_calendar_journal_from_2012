<p>Hmmmmm I just scoped the code I'm using for my art permalinks, and I see it's ripe for attack.
Hmmmm.</p>

<p>In other news, I added &lt;permalink&gt; tag to my wiki so that it resolves to a line that gives
the permalink of the art.  It works in most cases, but not all, and I know how to fix it....  have
set up a dev site to make the changes, during which I'll fix the SQL injection problems as well.</p>
