<p>Went to meet Lin in Kawasaki, and we ate at The Oven (American Buffet), a buffet restaurant that
seems to do pretty brisk business, not least of all for the soft serve ice cream and nearby
chocolate fountain.  I wanted to load my ice-cream loaded cup with chocolate, but didn't.   Good
thing, actually, because it would have been a bit much.</p>

<p>Lin told me that her sisters want to meet me, but they don't want to meet me before we've made
some sort of commitment.  I have made the commitment already, but not as formally as I plan to once
I have some stable income coming in.  Looking forward to meeting on Wednesday with likely new
employer.</p>
