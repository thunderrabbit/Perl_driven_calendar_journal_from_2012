<p>So, it seems that Soness believes that because Lin didn't accept Soness's offers of friendship, I
won't be able to be friends with Soness.  Soness is angry that I didn't tell Lin I will choose with
whom I'm friends, but instead assured Lin that Soness and I would still be doing business type stuff
together if it continues to work out.  Soness reminded me clearly that she has graciously given me
her living room floor for sleeping purposes for nearly 2 years now, given me money when I had little
or none.  Soness assures me I should be careful having a girlfriend who tries to maintain that level
of control over my life.  I would agree, and am glad Lin doesn't do that.  Soness assures me that
Lin should be &quot;busting her ass to be friends with [Soness]&quot; because of how much Soness
has done for me.</p>

<p>In the end, Soness offered me a licorice piece, which I said I'll treasure until it gets
sticky.</p>

<p>She knows I don't like licorice, so I think she was actually offering the joke of offering me
something I don't like as a token of friendship as a token of friendship.</p>
