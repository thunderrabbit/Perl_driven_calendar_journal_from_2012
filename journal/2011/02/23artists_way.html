<p>While Soness was sick (and I thought I was not, but actually was just getting sick), I led the
Artists Way meeting for her.  Divy and Peter said I did quite well; I'm happy to hear that positive
feedback.</p>

<p>Arwen sat next to me and made sure I stayed on schedule; I'm thankful for that, and for keeping
me entertained with her funny comments.</p>

<p>Lin and I hung out afterward, and she assured me I probably had the flu.  bah.  She was right.</p>
