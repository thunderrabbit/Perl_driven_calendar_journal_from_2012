<p>In other news, I drew a new maze today (&quot;RGB Spot Maze&quot;), scanned it and uploaded it,
but haven't yet given it a short URL.  I also scanned a picture (&quot;Old School&quot;) that I drew
with Lisa in the park back before I went to Thailand.  I wonder what happened to her.  I hope she is
well.</p>
