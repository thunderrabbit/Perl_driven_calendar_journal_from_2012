<p>Today Lin and I ate at Jonathan's near the home center close to Minato Mirai.</p>

<p>I joke-explained at one point that she wasn't so simple, and she said mmmm maybe not.  Everyone
thinks they are simple because they are in their own head, but actually being simple may not be
true.</p>

<p>At one point in the restaurant, she was like, &quot;I'm worried that you need more time to be
sure you want to stay with me,&quot; and at first I bought into that, thinking <em>maybe I do need
more time; oh man what do I say now???</em>  and she was like, &quot;I want you to say 'fuck are you
talkin about???'&quot; but I couldn't at first, or even at second, but</p>

<p>I realized that I <em>am</em> sure I want to stay with her, and I layed out the reasons: I have 
had a million girlfriends, and I ain't found one more perfectly matched than you in 
age/communication/sex/temprament/skills/skillz and, though I hate with girls say &quot;oh snap I'm 
30,&quot; I'm 41, and I'm ready to stop jerking around in relationships.</p>

<p>And, I added, &quot;don't ever ask me that again.  I am not going to break up with you.&quot;
And then I added, &quot;but if you need to ask you can ask, no problem.  but I don't want you to ever 
have the question in your mind again.&quot;</p>

<p>She saw a stuffed toy shaped like a mini version of Bonnie, so she bought it on our way out of
Jonathan's at 10:45pm, though I had thought it was 11:45pm.   We got back to Our Spot in Yokohama
and held hands talking for a few minutes until 0:00 and then I left.</p>
