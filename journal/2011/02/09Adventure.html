<p>I'm headed to Paola's place in 池ノ上 (ikenoue) to wash her windows for food (and drink).  She
called some professional companies and they were like, &quot;nah; too dangerous mate&quot; and
refused to clean the windows.  I'm like, &quot;gimme dat ladder,&quot; and I'm sure I'll have no
problem.</p>

<p>So anyway, in 藤沢 (fujisawa), I entered the JR line, figuring I could take JR to Yokohama, and
then my original train line (reliable like an old friend) Tokyu Toyoko line to Shibuya, and then
Inokashira line to Ikenoue.</p>

<p>But when I checked ye olde internetf (*), I found I can save even *more* money by taking the
Enoden line.  And turns out I save *time*, AND get a seat, with which I'm writing this entry
now.</p>

<p>(*) I gotta learn when f was used for s back in the day if I wanna continue that joke.</p>

<p>I figured it would be めんどくさい (a pain in the ass) to explain to the station attendant that I
had gotten onto the wrong line (and went to the next station (during which I checked the above
mentioned web of interlocking digital resources) and back), but while at that next station, I
figured even *if* I had to pay extra for my erroneous trip, it would be worth it for the adventure
of using a new line, possibly saving a bit of bling, and possibly getting a seat.  But, given that
they <em>don't have a computer system there</em>, he couldn't check when I entered the system, and
just assumed I had come in through JR gates and then gotten to his gates.  He gave me a slip of
paper to show on the other side, so I should have no worries on the way out.</p>

<p>Fear vs Adventure: Adventure wins.</p>
