<p>I'm meeting Cyrus in Hiro-o to audition for a one day video shooting to be a big brother for
some younger kids.  The audition will get me the part for at least a day of shooting and 60,000 yen
compensation.  yay!!</p>

<p>It was fun and easy overall.  I got to audition with Bob Whorley (sp), who I know from comedy nights at The
Pink Cow.  We had to jog in place, and then get tired and ask the other to wait.  Then switch roles.</p>
