<p>I just finished my 2010 taxes here in Japan.  It's the first time I've filed taxes here in 4
years.  The paperwork for the previous 3 years has been scattered via neglect because I didn't make
a lotta money and figured it wasn't worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Today, thanks to filing my 2010 taxes, I will get <em>all</em> of the tax I paid in 2010 back in
my bank account.  That's cold hard notes of cash to myself.  19,200 yen worth, to be exact.</p>

<p>To be in self-perceived good standing with Japanese tax system, I gotta frackin' harass my old
employers to give me copies of my W2 equivalents for the previous years.</p>

<p>Note to self: do yer taxes each year.  And keep all your medical receipts.  You'll probably get
a little spring bonus of cash back.</p>
