<p>Went to see Lin at Paola's, at the end of their ayurvedic cooking class.  Jon had been out
snowboarding for the weekend, so had also missed the food.  Paola saved us some yummies and I was
totally stuffed after eating it all.  mmmf.</p>

<p>Emma, who looks like Christine (from Houston), was there, but I couldn't remember her name.
bah.</p>
