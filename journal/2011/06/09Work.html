<p>Well, crapdogs.  I got through nearly my entire list in record time, but then for some reason
the English version of the app stopped working.  Gah.  And then the layout started to go wonky.  I
didn't touch that part of the code, did I?</p>

<p>I think English hasn't been used since I put country codes in the app, but I think I accounted
for that....  It's just like, &quot;oh we can't find the default resource for any of your
drawables.&quot;  BUT They're all right there!!!!!!</p>

<p>I think the issue was some *other* drawables were *not* in the default folder though they were in
the default-ja folder.  The error was about some resources that *were* in it, so they were confusing
me.</p>
