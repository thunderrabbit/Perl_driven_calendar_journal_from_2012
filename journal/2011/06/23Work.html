<p>Work was pretty good today in terms of getting shtuffs done.  Alfonzo told me a parable about
Steve Jobs having said &quot;thank you for disobeying me.&quot;  I accomplished that today, and
hopefully that will help shape up the code a lot.</p>

<p>I got a bit cleaner layout code for my layouts, and they work closer to how I wanted them to
work, so I'm optimistic I can get them to work a lot more like I wanted them to.  The big trick
will be to get them working on large screen sizes.</p>

<p>The GUI for the recording device is working better than it did; it now gives visual feedback to
the user for what they should be recording each time.  Thanks to Alfonzo for sketching out that
code.  I also need to write a version that lets users page *backwards* through the recordings as
well.</p>

<p>But what I'm reallllly wondering about is how to align the images the way I need.  Basically have
a big background image, and they want parts of it to react to user input, both visually and
aurally.</p>

<p>In the slightly bigger picture, Nate isn't sure if he wants to take on 12 of these projects.
The client seems to be asking for more than what's reasonable.  They seem to want an iPhone version
as well, but minimal extra price.  Dude.  The code doesn't really transfer over.  Only similarity
is that they're (*) both OO languages, but afaik (!), they (@) are quite different frameworks.</p>

<p>(*) Java and Objective-C</p>

<p>(!) as far as I know</p>

<p>(@) Android framework and iPhone framework</p>
