<p>Yay!  Nate and Alfonzo said the company is taking some steps forward and that the raise they've
said should be coming soon will start in July.  Yay!  I'll be making 2/3rds of what I was finally
making in the US!  (but actually with the current exchange rate of 82 yen per dollar, I'm making
4/5ths of what I was making in the US.)  Whooooo</p>

<p>It was funny; at the beginning of the meeting, Nate was like, <em>you know it's been hard, and
the office is cramped, and blah blah blah</em> for like 15 minutes, with everything pointing to the
culmination of &quot;so we're going to let you go,&quot; but I was like <em>あれ？　this makes no
sense given what Alfonzo has been saying!</em> so I figured it was just Nate's style of speaking.
but still it was weird!</p>

<p>Work is fun; I'm learning lots, and I <em>essentially</em> got finished tonight that which I hoped to do
by tomorrow.   Finished except that the view shifts uncomfortably in its seat while performing its
task.  Hmmm.</p>
