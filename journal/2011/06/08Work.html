<p>Yesterday I refactored some code, shrinking some classes quite respectably.  I was able to pull
the layout and logic for the bottom buttons on most animated menus into its own class that is
inflated when I need it.  I also moved into its own class the logic that allows the animated menu
to move into and out of the screen.</p>

<p>(fun: I finally get a chance to use the &lt;<b>merge</b>&gt; tag for layouts!)</p>

<p>Also, I watched Tupac Cat.  awesome.  I hope he appreciates the tribute.</p>

<p>Today I'll move into a private class (similar to the bottom buttons, but in a private class) in
the main menu, the logic that can display and process touch Events for the main menu.   Same thing
for the language menus.</p>

<p>I hope all this class action solves the problem of the animated menu's animation breaking when
the built-in pagination class does its pagination.</p>

<p>Ah crap I gotta build an inflatable version of that class as well.  Okay; no problem.</p>

<p><b>To do today:</b></p>

<p>to be continued...</p>

<p>(hint: see the next day's entry!)</p>
