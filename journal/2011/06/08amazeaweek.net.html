<p>Tonight I made the decision to hack the core files of Wordpress in order to change the format of
the Published Date as shown on the edit.php screen (which only site admins will see).  The default
format is hard coded deep in the classes, and I don't care to figure out how to inject a format
string in that far.  I'll just add the &quot;l &quot; (lowercase L and a space) to the string so I
know on what day of the week the Published Date falls.</p>

<p>This is an addition of two characters which, for now, I'm happy to do each time I update
amazeaweek's Wordpress installation.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
