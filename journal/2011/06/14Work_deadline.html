<p>Gar.  This morning when Alfonzo came in, he was like &quot;yeah; they bought the TV commercial
time, so the product deadline is set.&quot;</p>

<p>Rackum smackum grrr those crazy monkeys trying to kill us?  They trying to promote a big
flippin' flop?  How will we have enough time to finish it, much less test???</p>

<p>Alfonzo said he would support, but was sure of my ability to finish it all on time.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Well, actually, thanks!!</p>
