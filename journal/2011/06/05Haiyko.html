<p>Haiyko is the transliteration for the Japanese word meaning &quot;ruin,&quot; or something, the
noun form of an abandoned structure.</p>

<p>Today is the first time that <a href="http://michaeljohngrist.com/">Mike</a>'s haikyo exploration
schedule has allowed me to join him.  yay!</p>

<p>We're on the train now with <a href="http://creativedestruction.se/">Jan Jornmark</a> from Sweden; Jan is
does urbex (urban exploration) professionally.</p>

<p>Just finished exploring Western Village, the holy grail of which would be climbing to the top of Mt
Rushmore.  The way to the top requires climbing over a rail onto a roof by way of a piece of facade
that probably wasn't designed to support a person's full weight.</p>

<p>In the end, I did not climb on top, for that reason, and for the reason that there'd be no one at
the bottom to photograph me.</p>

<p>Back in Utsunomiya now.  After Western Village we went to a gravel factory, which
was <em>*MUCH*</em> more fun in terms of sheer numbers of things to climb.  I did the whole thing
barefootedly, having explained to Mike, &quot;if my feet start to slip, my sandals don't tell me
soon enough.&quot;</p>

<p>The only injury I sustained was on my finger, when picking up a big rusty chain.  When I got one
of the links unstuck, a section crunched down on my finger.  Ouch!!</p>

<p>Photos tell the story; I promise I'll put them up soon.</p>
