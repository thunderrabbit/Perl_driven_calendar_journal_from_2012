<p>Man I haven't really been writing much in my journal.  Lots of my time has gone towards working
on this Android project at work, and most of the rest of my time has gone to playing with Lin and
the internets.</p>

<p>The recent spate of security breaches of Sony, Sega, HBGary, etc has got me wondering if people
will wake up to internet security.  I wonder if *I* need to wake up to internet security.  I've got
secure passwords, but I don't change them often.  Perhaps I should identify the ones that I'd like
to keep particularly secure and change them every n units of time, where the length of the unit for
a particular password is inversely proportional to the importance of the site's security.</p>

<p>I've spent a good deal of time in
the <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/15/android">Android chat room on SO</a>, and have
traded some good pointers through that interaction.  There's a unicorn loving Austrian guy named
Octavian who's the owner of the room and tries to keep it useful.</p>

<p>In other news, Alfonzo and I are going to get a new PC to help with our interests in BTC.</p>

<p>Ah, today I got an image to animate into view and vanish from the view, all driven by XML file,
so that's pretty cool.  I'm trying to keep it so coding the next project can be largely done by
replacing the XML and other drawables.</p>

<p>Still gotta figure out a good way to make images move across the screen, with the trick being
precise placement while allowing for different sized screens.  Hmmm.</p>
