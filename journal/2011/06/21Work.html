<p>Today at work I didn't seem to get a whole lot done, but hopefully with some fresh eyes, we can
get some forward motion.</p>

Hey

What would probably work best: if you can get the code running on your machine, and then I can show
you different points where I have questions.

<p>Interesting to see <a href="http://twitter.com/LulzSec">LulzSec</a> followers on Twitter increase
by about 100 people per hour, while they weren't tweeting anything.  Now that's something awesome.
I hope it does make a change for the bester.</p>

<p>Got a new server up and running.  Hopefully it will make things work more quickly.</p>
