<p>It's raining outside, so I asked Lin if she'd come play in the rain with me.  She hesitated at
first, but then agreed when I wouldn't accept no as an answer.  (^_^)</p>

<p>We put towels by the door, then went out.  Got to the front of the building and I realized one
difference between this summer rain and a summer rain in Houston.  This rain is cold.</p>

<p>Boooooooo cold rain!  and we came immediately back inside.</p>
