<p>Lovely Paola and Jon organized a celebratory dinner for Lin and my marriage.  15 people total,
all connected to Yogasan in some way, chat and chowed at Nana in Mark City.  I most animatedly
talked with Julia and Taki about US foreign policy and its false flag attacks.  Chatted with Irina a
bit about PB and she looked absolutely delighted to hear of the possibilities there.  Awesome.
Irina is quite good at color sketches, and drew several pictures to commemerate her Fuji climb with
Jon's coworker Mikio.</p>
