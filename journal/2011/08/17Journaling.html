<p>Having journaled for a while, I have learned two or three things related to journaling</p>

<ol>
<li>If you stop journaling for a while, just start again instead of trying to &quot;catch up&quot;
the entries you missed
(Without catching up, I'm starting again right now)</li>

<li>Include the year with each entry you write.  In my early handwritten journals, there are pages
and pages and pages that just have the month and date by each entry, but no year.</li>

<li>If it's public, not everyone wants to be included in the journal</li>
</ol>
