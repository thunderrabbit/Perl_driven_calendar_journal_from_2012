<p>Yesterday I was sortof selfishly a jerk at Lin, and she let me know.  OMG I am soooo thankful
that she'll tell me immediately when I do uncool things like that; it helps me have a better chance
to correct them.</p>

<p>Today when she drove me from work to Kawasaki, we talked about random shtuff and a bit about last
night.  I'm so thankful that we're able to talk about everything.</p>

<p>She gave me a few tips for how to be a bit more romantic:</p>

<ol><li><p>don't give her flowers that someone else gave me</p></li>

<li><p>take her out on dates once in a while</p></li>
</ol>

<p>She said she likes white flowers more than pink flowers, and real plants more than cut flowers.</p>

<p>I jotted these tips down in my brain, plus a few more good ones that I should have jotted down a
bit harder!</p>
