<p>I got about an hour of work done, basically determined why I wasn't getting an integer value
from my XML file.  (getResourceValue() vs getIntValue())</p>

<p>Once I got that, I was able to get the app to sleep for the required amount of time.  But now I
need a different thread to be able to wake the app from sleep.  I'll work on that tomorrow, after
*I* sleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The best work-related news, though: now that we've moved, I have a key to get in any time I
like.</p>
