<p>We wheeeeeed today in the bright sunshine, with Soness on her skateboard and me on her blue
bicycle, which I bought to replace her old blue bicycle.  Hmmm!  Soness's bicycles don't have
names.  I never noticed that until now.</p>

<p>We're on the 8:05 Liner from Chigasaki to Shinjuku.  Though not too late, we had to move forward
two cars to find 2 seats together.  Too bad we're too busy on our respective tools to talk too
much.  She's chatting with Sorcha (yes, <em>The</em Sorcha>) about Friday night's Quakebook event
at The Pink Cow.</p>

<p>Before writing this, Soness helped me with Words With Friends, seeing that I had the letters
needed for FEMUR.  Sweet!  The F and M were nice on a double word score.  My opponent, Robin
Davidson from my high school days, has been regularly killing me at this game, so I was glad for the
help.  heehee.  Robin immediately replied with GED on a TW made available by FEMUR, and I couldn't
find much useful so I put down X for OX on a TL, and then Robin just put down NORTH on a TW.  She's
ahead 171 to 147, and Soness and I are in a long tunnel now so have no access to ye olde
internettef.</p>
