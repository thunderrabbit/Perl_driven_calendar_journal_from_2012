<p class="dream">In a club / ragtag group of guys or a large group so big that I didn't know
everyone yet and a large event or game was organized that would take 99 days with different people
being stationed at different locaations each day.</p>

<p class="dream">Looking at the schematic, it was like</p>

<pre>
day 1     not John

day 2     not Eric

not Phil

not Steve

not Raymond

not Chris

not Dennis

</pre>

<p class="dream">My name was not on the list, but I had just joined the group.  The events were in the woods and I
had just overheard a guy saying that it was important to let the local flora take over because it
knew how to grow there and &quot;in two weeks I could have thes turnips allover the place&quot; or
any other plant of choice. </p>

<p class="dream">I came back to him later and was like, what was all that about &quot;something' somethin' in two
weeks&quot; ? and he began to explain and I could see what he mean that the local plant should be
given priority.  &quot;In fact, al queda does the same thing; if they were given a plot of land this
size, they would first plant the local plants.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I wasn't sure who al queda was (who is; hahaha) but then on the bus I was talking to a guy about the
details for joining, and I was like, &quot;what time is the thing each day?&quot; and he goes,
&quot;about 5pm&quot; and then I go, &quot;oh man; I just realized I can't really do it!  I have to
work in Ebisu, until 7,  sometimes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 100  o'clock!&quot;   &quot;oh man..&quot;  and
I was so bummed, but I gave the guy my card, and next to him on the bus was a woman who was like,
&quot;your card looks like another colorful card I saw&quot; so I gave her my card and she  gave me
her card.  Her name was spelled out Mon sma ri el at the top.  I said it, and she goes, &quot;yes,
or just Monsmaria&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Lin and I got off the bus and I was like, &quot;aight I gotta peee&quot; and went over to the
restroom</p>

<p>and woke up and went to the restroom and wrote this.</p>
