<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I live in a combination of Chez Soness and on the weekends with Lin in Chigasaki</p></li>

<li><p>I am working again!  Back at my old company in Shibuya.  We're doing Android development
this time.  This time they got a Mac Mini for me to use, so I don't have to use my laptop.</p></li>

<li><p>My finances plan to get better while I work.  I currently owe $2500 to Soness $1000 to Linh,
$1000 to credit card, and $N000 to my brother, where N stands for Not Sure.</p></li>

<li><p>I proposed to Lin recently, and she accepted!  I've told my family, but I still haven't told
everyone yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Soness is in New Zealand with her honey Yuji.  They're also affianced!</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone now has a black battery case to replace the blue case that was getting a bit
ratty.  The black case is a hand-me-down from Alfonzo, who got an iPhone 4.</p></li>

<li><p>Right now, Lin and I are at Tazura's house.  Tazura is a weimereiner owned by one of Lin's
real estate clients who's out of town for Golden Week.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access here sux.</p></li>

<li><p>Programming in Java for Android is pretty easy.  All of the tricky bits are hidden by Java
garbage collection and Android's SDK.  I'm using Eclipse as my programming environment.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently started <a href="http://www.amazeaweek.net/">amazeaweek.net</a>, encouraging me to
draw mazes at least once a week.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have a plant named Alex.  It's a panda ear succulent.  I forgot its scientific name.</p></li>

<li><p>My life in Japan is basically unaffected by the earthquake in March 2011.  I'm sure it will
be called something equivalent to The Great Kanto Earthquake, which happened ten years ago or so.</p></li>
