<p>I hadn't seen Soness in a while (since Thursday morning) so it was good to talk to her this
morning.  Today is overcast with a drizzly cold sprinkle that's just enough for me to need an
umbrella after an extended period outside.  We therefore didn't wheeeeeeeee (*) to the station; we
just walked and talked about the possibility that this weird weather + earthquakes is caused by a
brown dwarf encroaching on earth's happy solar orbit.</p>

<p>(* wheeeeeeeee (with between 5 and 15 occurrences of the letter e) means she rides her
skateboard as I pull her to the station on her bicycle.)</p>

<p>Yuji is visiting Japan for a bit, so I'll get to see him soon as well, I imagine.</p>
