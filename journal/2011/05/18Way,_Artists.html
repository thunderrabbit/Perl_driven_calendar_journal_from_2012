<p>Tonight was the last formal Artist's Way meeting for the third group Soness led in Tokyo.  At
the end, I chilled with Arwen who was sharing some deets about her shtuffs, so that was nice.  It
may have been the first time I really talked to her, ever, I think.</p>

<p>During the group, the game was to receive blessings for a few minutes per person.  That
excercise put us 30 minutes overtime, but that was fine becuase Soness was 30 minutes late to
start due to another comittment.</p>

<p>I got to be the last one to chill with Arwen; I liked that.</p>
