<p>Been busy busy with work work work; it's nice to have an interesting project that I pretty much am
getting to design myself.  We're making an Android application, and though it's got specs (or does
it??), I get to decide how to implement the details.</p>

<p>I wiped out some AsyncTasks that I thought I needed to kick off some audio, but turns out I
don't need them, and today I implemented the pageElement duration design that I sketched out last
night.  That took about 4 hours, and then I was trying to get sounds to fade between elements, but
I couldn't do that without fading *all* the sounds, so there goes the concept of letting some audio
streams last for multiple page elements.  But it's still good that I got that most implemented;
last night, the sounds were being culled before they got to play at all.  *Now* they know if
they're allowed to keep playing by virtue of when they were created.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I've got to refine the elements a bit, allowing the first part of the element to fade
into view, and *then* kick off the next part.  (visual fades in and then audio starts)</p>
