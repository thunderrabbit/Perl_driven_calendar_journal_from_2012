<p>Lin drove me to Kawasaki station today and it's a free train ride the rest of the way to Shibuya
for work.  That's cause it's a free train ride from Chigasaki where Soness got 800+ air miles to
put my 3-month train pass on her credit card.  That pass will last me most of the remaining time
that I'll be living at Chez Soness; I'm coming toward the end of a mini-era of my life.</p>

<p>I'm so incredibly lucky to be with Lin.  She's like a super heroine of a super human.</p>

<p>Last night I asked her to shave my head, ended my three or four days of having a striped shaved
along the centerline from front to back.  Then in the shower I saw her razor so shaved a new center
line on my head.  Hahahahhahahahahahah I laughed for a long time when I showed her what I had
done.</p>
