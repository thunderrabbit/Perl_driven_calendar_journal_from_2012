<p>I got to work and found the door locked.  Nate arrived and we found the table on which I had been
working is dismantled, as was my computer.  &quot;I guess we're moving today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yep.&quot;</p>

<p>Movers have moved most of our stuffs.  I think the young woman who's on the moving team is as
strong as me or more.</p>

<p>I notice that they are often using their back instead of their legs to lift.</p>
