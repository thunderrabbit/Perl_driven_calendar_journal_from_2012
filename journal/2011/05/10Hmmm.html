<p>I seem to not be writing in my journal very often.  Part of it includes spending a lot of time
with Lin when I'm not at work.  Other time has been spent on drawing mazes
for <a href="http://www.amazeaweek.net/">A Maze A Week</a> (I just finished another hexagon one
today, well almost finished; the path is finished, but I haven't added the non-solution paths).</p>

<p>Work is busy with Android development.  I'm learning about Activities and Layouts and Intents.
Today I spent the better part of the morning wrestling with layouts, trying to figure out the
different reasons different ones are useful.  I ended up with a FrameLayout containing two Relative
Layouts, each of which contain Linear Layouts or something like that.  The bad news is that Android
does *not* support the cool templating engine that Django does.  Oh well.</p>

<p>The good news is that I got a nice animation working between activities.  The bad news is that
the code is not open source, but I might open source a version on unwim.</p>

<p>Speaking of unwim, I wrote an entry called
&quot;<a href="http://unwim.net/blog/2011/05/dont-do-this/">don't do this</a>,&quot; after getting
an empty email template from one of the mailing lists I used to be on (until they made the
mistake).  Plus I never read their stuff anyway.</p>

<p>Today I just got paid 50,000 yen for officially one week of work, but I started two weeks ago, I
think, but got four days off for the shamanism classes.  The income is nice because my weekend job
just fizzled out, so this past Sunday I did *not* get 20,000 yen for that day of work.</p>

<p>Lin just finished dog-sitting Tazra for the week, and didn't get paid for that.</p>

<p>Just arriving in Chigasaki now.  I hope Soness had a great day!</p>
