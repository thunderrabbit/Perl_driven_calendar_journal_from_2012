<p>Came to Paola and Jon's for a lovely lunch featuring Lin, Sachiko and 4 or 5 other students.
Yummy fish, salads, bread, cheese, fruit spread, and lichee juice for dessert.</p>

<p>Everyone but Sachiko, Jon, Paola, Lin and I left, and we who remained watched the third Focker
movie (&quot;Little Fockers&quot;), and it was pretty good; well character-driven, but a bit
predictable.</p>
