<p>Yesterday I joined several people meeting Chris for two movie shoots, shooting two scenes (people
chasing santa, and zombies chasing the hero).  The santa scenes were a bit delayed due to concerns
that the Shibuya cops would kick us out of Hachiko Plaza.  *I* wasn't concerned, buy Roy was, and
told Chris and we shot that scene near the end instead of near the beginning, which I hope won't be
noticeable due to the darker lighting in the earlier part of the movie.</p>

<p>But anyway, we had fun and I was glad when Arwen + Shizuka joined during lunch time.  They wanted
to be in the zombie part, which they did, successfully.  We got kicked off the private property
(&quot;on this side of the line in the middle of the sidewalk is our private property, and you can't
film here for privacy issues.  On that side of the line is Shibuya city, so you probably need
permission from the city of Shibuya to film there.&quot; ahem) so had a delay in filming to the
point that I didn't get to be in the movie (yet).  But Wade, Nathan, Arwen and Shizuka were featured
in that scene, as green-slime vomiting zombies, certainly a life achievement!</p>

<p>Mark from ELF was there; he's my initial connection to the whole thing.  His daughter Kristi was
able to come as well, so she got a start on *her* dream to be an actress.</p>

<p>I recorded some footage on my little underwater camera that will hopefully be featured in the
film.  Yay for getting my name in the credits!</p>
