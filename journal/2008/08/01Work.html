<p>Gah.  Still no real breaksthroughs.  Gotta sit back and flowchart and chop the snot out of some
code.  I printed it so I could get a better view of what's going on.  Actually had Sho print it
cause I couldn't get the printer driver installed on my PowerBook.  Firefox kept crashing like a
dummy, I think cause of some javascript craziness I'm trying to do.  I've probably got memory
overruns beyond its ability to cope with them, but dang.</p>
