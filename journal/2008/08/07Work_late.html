<p>Just on the train now to leave Shibuya.  We're working long hours, though not more than super
long..  not _ridiculously_ long hours such as staying over night each night.  But it's exciting
because we're about to launch <a href="http://sbstrm.com/">sbstrm</a>, our newest website (the only
website I've &quot;launched&quot; that has any chance of wild success), which I've not been really
involved with the design/creation, but I've been working on takeout (not even close enough to ready
to be linked here) which has similar architecture, so I have a pretty good idea of how it's set
up.</p>

<p>My job now is to fix Malek's error-infested English and do a full run-through of the system,
looking for bugs. I've found three major ones that I can remember, fixed some user-experience
issues, and noticed a security hole that's now been fixed.</p>

<p>We're going for a soft launch on Monday, so feel free to check back at that time.  Not sure that
we'll be able to do it that soon though; the entire site still needs to be translated, and that's
*after* I fix all the English, much of which is being used as keys for the translation engine, so
if it gets changed, the keys must be changed as well.</p>
