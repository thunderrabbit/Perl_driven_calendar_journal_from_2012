<p>I might be close on my uniquity code to search for train stations using Jorudan.  Well, I've got
the parameters sorted out.  I just need to see how to inject them into the jorudan page.  Not sure
if I can open the tab and then access its document parts, but if I can, then it's basically
done.</p>
