<p>Just got a pic with a totally panda-makeup made up young woman in Shibuya who identified herself
as ¥Î¥Ö¥¨ (Nobue), and specified katakana as the characterset.  I'll be uploading the pic as soon
as I get home.  And probably &quot;archiving&quot; a lot of U-Cow's old pictures..  should be good.</p>
