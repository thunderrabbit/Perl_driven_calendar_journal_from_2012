<p>I liked <a href="http://www.hancock-movie.com/">Hancock</a>.  In fact, found it pretty flawless,
save two points, though I must admit I'm unable to think of ways to make the second one much better.
The first one I disliked was the way the train didn't wreck much when Hancock stopped it.  Perhaps
had the train been shown to put on full brakes, but still coming fast enough to crush a car, then it
would have stopped in the way shown when Hancock stopped it.</p>

<p>The second point was when Hancock tried to kiss the girl.  There was no reason for him to do that
(that I noticed), so I think a little character point would have helped that.  I've considered a
couple of options, but equally discarded them.  He could've been a bit tipsy drunk, but not while in
an AA rehab program.  He could have said, &quot;I know I shouldn't but I can't help myself; there's
something about you..&quot; and that woulda been okay I think.  But just straight up goin' in behind
his only friend's drunk back didn't seem appropriate.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>The movie is great; highly recommended, and a good cry at the end.  Well, a couple tears, but
yeah.</p>
