<pre>
Feelin' kinda crap today
things aren't going quite my way
I don't know what else to say
I guess it's sposed to be that way.

<p>Well, that was a short rap, but it just came out.  u.cow.fly2.nu site is partially broken for
the moment; I upgraded to Media Wiki 1.13.0, and now get an error when trying to edit pages.  I
*did* meditate this morning, so that's something good.  Didn't eat though, and now I'm on the way
to Helma's then skipping a chance to view Stacy's pics on display and see some PB peeps at Cafe
Slow (Jennifer invited me some weeks ago, though I'm not sure if she's going to go).  Ai will be
there; I'd like to say HI to Ai, and perhaps <em>Rei</em> would be there.</p>

<p>I think what I really need is to cut these mental ties I have with old, un-available relationships.</p>
