<p>Nice if brief breakfast with Natalia this morning.  I'm thankful that she woke up early to spend
the time with me.  We had a nice chat with Fatima last night, sharing ice cream and a lovely little
private byebye party in a way.  Fatima didn't go in to work last night, but she had gone to work
the night before and so couldn't join the official byebye party for Natalia.</p>

<p>Anyway, last night was great, and this morning felt quite blessed for me to get a moment to chat
with a sleepy Natalia who had plenty plenty to do today.</p>

<p>We talked about getting a fly2.nu animal to her, but didn't / don't really have time to do it.
Ami has Marcus Lion in Kyushu and won't really be back until after Natalia heads off to Narita.  We
could conceivably do it tonight, but I doubt it will happen.  (*)</p>

<p>(*) It didn't happen.  Maybe I can ship U-Cow over to Spain while Natalia is there.  Would have
to send him express so he'd get there in plenty of time before she comes back.  Maybe Kris will get
back to Canadia and I can have her send Go-Rilla to Natalia instead of me.  (I actually intend to
give Go-Rilla to Natalia when he gets to me, so might as well just send him to her directly.)</p>
