<p>Wow!  I now have a virtual computer: <a href="http://g.ho.st/">g.ho.st</a>.  If you sign up, do
the setup wizard and enter thunderrabbit@g.ho.st as the referrer if you wanna give me an extra Gig
of storage space.</p>

<pre>
<a href="http://g.ho.st/">http://g.ho.st/</a> is another web-based computer for which I signed up.  Kinda heavy on the processor
usage (in my web browser), cause it uses Flash, but since it uses Flash, it's pretty cute!

I ain't used it a lot yet, but if you sign up, feel free to enter thunderrabbit in the referred by
field (you find it after you verify your email address, log in and run the setup wizard)

Plus, they have the best domain name EVER.
