<p>I'm quite happy with my MacBook's battery / power management these days.  I think I've found the
trick.  Do not run your computer with both battery and power plugged in for hours and hours.  What
I've been doing is plugging in to get the battery to full capacity, and then unplugging and letting
the battery run down to 0 capacity.  Then plugging back in and charging to full capacity, etc etc.
Last night I let my computer run down to 0 capacity and when I came back today it was fully off and
unresponsive until I plugged it back in.  But then once I plugged it in, it woke from sleep and
everything was restored to the way I left it last night.  (except my Samba connection was dropped,
but that could be because its IP address changed or something. (I don't know enough about Samba to
say.))</p>
