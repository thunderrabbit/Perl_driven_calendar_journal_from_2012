<p>Last night, at the end of a long work day, again fighting mootools to work and not finding what I
need in its documentation, Andrew, from his memory, told me what the solution was.  Basically, to
access an element in the parent of an iframe, I couldn't do $(elementid), but had to do something
like parent.window.document.sumpin(&quot;#&quot;+elementid)</p>

<p>I might remember to correct this later so if you find it, it'll help instead of tease.</p>
