<p class="dream">My parents had purchased a replica of Mr Van, and came to pick up me and Fred. I
climbed in through the back doors and noted the velure fuzzy bench seats were different from the
vinyl which we had had before. The front window on the driver's side was open though it had been
raining, so I tried to close it from the right hand side handle; I wondered how the handle was
connected from the right side to the left. It was certainly easier to close the window all the way
when closing from the left. The windows looked like eyes; I was seeing them from the inside.</p>

<p>They sorta remind me of what Snufalufagus eyes might look like from the inside, including big eye lashes.</p>
