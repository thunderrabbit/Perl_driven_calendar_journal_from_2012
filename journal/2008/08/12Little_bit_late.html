<p>Rolling in to work a bit late; I just got on the train in Motosumiyoshi, though normally I like
to get the 10:24 train, and optimally betweeen 10 and 10:20.  But that pales in comparison to
halfway getting back in touch with Abbey Tennis!  I got a mass email from Mattboy Kime; he emailed
TO everyone he knew instead of BCC, but that's good for me in this case cause I was then able to
write to Abbey.</p>

<p>I hope she's enjoying super greatness!</p>
