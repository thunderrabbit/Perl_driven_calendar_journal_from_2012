<p>&quot;Fuck,&quot; I thought.  Had a bit of a bummer a few hours ago when I asked a question
about something I was working on and they were like, &quot;that's all going to change; don't worry
about that.&quot;  So I took a 2 minute break and then started working on the thing I &quot;should
have&quot; been doing, and, nicely enough, it can use that which I did today that appeared to have
been wasted.  Woo.</p>

<p>So now I'm designing an object that will read and write keitai websites to DB and output the
keitai website to keitais.  Got a pretty cool idea for it, so that's sweet.</p>
