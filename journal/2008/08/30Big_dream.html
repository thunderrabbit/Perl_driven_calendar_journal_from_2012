<p class="dream">floating on a small</p>

<p class="dream">fishing on a boat, I apparently caught a fish, and when I pulled my line up, it ws just a tangle of
line.  I</p>

<p class="dream">disrupted a couple of people to cut the line clean, but took care of it, gu</p>

<p class="dream">cutting off what I didn't need  (likke cutting through a net / hammock, not just a line)</p>

<p class="dream">boating away, but had forgotten my swisher sweets cause I had decided to start smoking?  I had
smoked one apparently</p>

<p class="dream">ah snap I forgot my something else, floating on the water, a box of manga</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;oh that's intersting, &quot;man&quot; means raw.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Ohhhh!  I just realized another word that means raw.&quot;  but  didn't say it.</p>

<p class="dream">The girl on whom I had a crush was like, &quot;manko?&quot; </p>

<p class="dream">&quot;um, yeah&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">and we were all lined up, me behind the smelly Japanese guy I dnd't realllly like, but nothing I
could do</p>

<p class="dream">then he was like, &quot;I want you guts to get closer  to the sides to balance</p>

<p class="dream">so we were</p>

<p class="dream">so I invited her up to join me
she had to squeeze in under a bar to get there, but it made things better for balancing the boat,
and she was close to me, and the salaryman didn't stink anymore.</p>

<p class="dream">or I wasn't pressed up against his back, I was off to the side so I could see</p>

<p class="dream">and she was next  to me and she could see as well</p>

<p class="dream">he drove , navigating through traffic that was a bit chaotic   now on the streets</p>

<p class="dream">We arrived in new location</p>

<p class="dream">looking at pictures of old PB ports and such,  some funny pictures that were half black and white,
half color,  like the bottom half of the pictures were color, and the top was bloack and white, and
Spike The Dog was pictures across the line.  Just happened to be that way and I liked the pictures
becuase of that, moreso than what was in it.</p>

<p class="dream">pictures from when a crazy lady was showing us how she could hold her cat under water and it
wouldn't feak out, evn as wabubbles were escaping out of its nose, it was sit there calmly.</p>

<p class="dream">talking to my russian friends who were next to two friends who were shooting missles over at some
other guys, not knowing why they were being shot at</p>

<p class="dream">went back over to those guys and wer  they were like, &quot;we don't know why they're shooting at us,
oh, yeah it's just Boris who is shooting back ther.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I sorted out that it was just Boris shooting from one side, and Only Hans shooting from the other
side,  though Katinka was helping, and made them come talk and sort things out.  Hands pretnded to
kill boris, but they were just playing</p>

<p class="dream">Then someone telling a sotry of a scary movie</p>

<p class="dream">watching the moie as a frightened child  frightened hand of a child had grown</p>

<p class="dream">childs hand was personified</p>

<p class="dream">watching the hand  timidly walk forward.  One of the </p>

<p class="dream">not walk like on two fingers, but  all fingers together like a dog shadow puppet inching forward,
with one figuer bent a bit to becomgt  to be the eye, and it actually grew an eye to see.  then
something shifted and tehe eye turned into a hat and it wore a hat and had a new eye and moving
forward, and I became the character  in a house and going into a  kitchen to help my mommy do
dishes, but my hands were covering my mouth.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;how are you?&quot; she asked</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;&quot;Find thank you and you/&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I said through closed mouth</p>

<p class="dream">how are you she repeated?</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Fine thank you and you?&quot;  with my ahands covering my mouth.</p>

<p class="dream">How are you?&quot; she asked again</p>

<p class="dream">fine thank you adn you?</p>

<p class="dream">I was not fine, and I still answered through closed covered hand and mouth</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;how are you?&quot; ahs asked again.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;fine thank you and you?&quot; I said through covered mouth.</p>

<p class="dream">she sterted to wash the two dishes.  Yes you are fine.</p>

<p class="dream">and she left the dishes half washe,d   and I washed them the rest of the way repeating fine thank
you and you fine thank you and you</p>

<p class="dream">then I looked out the window and </p>

<p class="dream">IT was right there; the window was utterly blacked out I couldn't see anything but blackness of IT
and I screamed thr eshrillest screaming shriek and went to find my mommmy but both doors were closed
I was trapped in the kitchen</p>

<p class="dream">I broke through one door into the living room where the hand had been creeping forward
 and the house was spooky closing down around me; IT was all around the house.</p>

<p class="dream">I was scared beyond balls shitless and I realized it was a dream.  or no, but it was at that level
of scaredness that I always pop awake.</p>

<p class="dream">Not this time.  I styed in the dream and screamed holy bloody anger</p>

<p class="dream">RAAAAAGGGHHHRRRR  (that's like 192 point font)</p>

<p class="dream">the energy of the house cleared up</p>

<p class="dream">RAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!!!   like a thousand angry chewbaccas in unison with a chorus of King Kongs.  I
wanted to destroy the house by blowing it apparet from the inside, but I didn't have that much
control over the dream.</p>

<p class="dream">the energy was clered up.  things felt a lot cleaner and clearer.</p>

<p class="dream">I gently woke up.</p>

<p class="dream">found my physical body lying on my bck (normal) with hands clasped together on my chest (not normal?
maybe?) and one leg bent at the knee with foot on pile of pillows (not so normal)</p>

<p>awesome breakthrough to not run away from the scariness in the dream.  I've never done that
before, or not in a long long long time.  Sweet.</p>

<p>I lay in bed a while recalling the deets of the scenes before the last scene to write down as
many as possible.</p>

<p>Notable things: I interrupted people to cut the line.</p>

<p>I had started to smoke (I'll take this as &quot;be okay with being imperfect&quot;)</p>

<p>I stood next to the girl I liked, and it allowed me to see</p>

<p>I negotiated a peace treaty meeting</p>

<p>I stood my ground while being utterly scared, shouting away all the baddies.</p>

<p>Oh, I just now remember there was a part of me that thought while screaming would be an
effective solution, it was not the best, and it would be actually best to stay there and be quiet
slash calm.</p>

<p>But after I screamed and began to wake up, I realized I hadn't really done that before, so it
may in fact have been the best solution, and that &quot;be quiet&quot; message is the one that's
been getting me in trouble all these years.</p>
