reconfirm she had seen a cow on my chest.  I gave her one of U-Cow's
cards and was happy to find that she speaks pretty good English, and
happened to *also* be headed to Motosumiyoshi!</p>

<p>I nearly gave Cow to her for a the weekend, but she said she
couldn't give him back until next Friday when she will be going to
Nigata.  Hmmm...  so I was like, "gimme da cow; upload the pics you
have now, and then I'll give you cow again before your trip."</p>

<p>She agreed that was a good idea and took some more pics at the
train station entrance.  Awesome!  Here's hopin' they get uploaded and
Cow finds a great new travelin' buddy!</p>
