<p>Another good ISIS session.  Different than before.  This time not as much crying.  This time more
falling asleep, waking up, pissed that I fell asleep, sad that I can't do this, mad at whatever is
holding me back, </p>

<p>(At one point in the early stages of the process, I was feeling furious for not being appreciated;
I just wanted to yell, &quot;pay attention to me!&quot; and scream, &quot;I AM IMPORTANT!&quot;)</p>

<p>I cycled cycled and then suddenly all tension released, I (suddenly became aware of high
frequency ring in my ears, and it wasn't like I hadn't been paying attention and it had always been
there, but more like it just turned on, though I'm sure at some level of reality it has always been
there; I just tuned in to that level of reality.  I just let go and tuned in to that reality and)
just floated in helplessness which needs no help.</p>

<p>Floated there for a while as <a href="mailto:helmaschipper@clairvision.org">Helma</a> was
connecting for me.  She asked what I was experiencing and I said something that included
&quot;angels&quot; like &quot;happy angels&quot; or .. maybe that was it.</p>

<p>She said basically, &quot;well keep experiencing that 'cause it feels [to me like it's] good
[for you to be in that space].&quot;</p>

<p>I stayed floating and feeling waves of tingles over my body.  Just slightly like a gentle cosmic
sprinkle.  Fell asleep, but didn't get mad when I woke up.  Just be.  Simply be.</p>

<p>Eventually it was time to re-engage Focus 1 waking reality (to borrow a term from The Monroe
Institute) and I slowly did so.</p>

<p>After waking up, I asked if I could stay for a bit to write the above, which I did as she headed
out to get lunch.  I remembered to pay her before she headed out, so that was good to support her
lunch purchase.  She even got me a little protein squeezie drink thing.</p>

<p>Just a moment ago, a guy was showing one of the empty rooms in this building to a woman, and he
was about to come in to Helma's room.  I saw the handle turn and was like, &quot;HI!&quot; to
announce that we were in here (having lunch, so no worries), and he was like, &quot;sorry, wrong
door,&quot; but Helma opened the door anyway, and OMG Helma has met the woman being shown the room!
Amy バスかビール had introduced her some months ago.  Turns out the woman lives five minutes' walk
away.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>
