<p>I couldn't help but notice a large cordron of the exit gates blocked off with ropes, and cops
hollering for everyone to keep moving.  Some larger sized video cameras were on tripods; I whipped
out my camera for a few snaps and then switched to video mode as I walked around the perimter of
the circle.  As I got around to the other side, I saw a monkey chillin' (?) up on the sign to the
Tokyu Toyoko Line.</p>

<p>Oh dear.  Poor monkey!  I wonder from where s/he came...  I didn't see anyone who looked like a
concerned owner.  But I did see a guy with a fishing net, like a butterfly net.  I doubt that would
be a polite way to catch such a critter.  If it were up to me, I'd climb up the ladder with some
snacks, and just start munching until the monkey joined me.  Then cuddle my new monkey friend all
the way to fame and fortune.</p>

<p>I don't have my video transfer cable here at work, but I may remember to upload the semi-blurry
pics and vid I got.</p>
