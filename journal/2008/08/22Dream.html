<p class="dream">Allowed to climb on anything I wnted, balcony rails, counertops while people were
eating, brbranches and cliffs, we found a video of a wise horse who wouldn't take any wise cracks,
but would tell us exactly how to fix the world, if we would do neigh but listen..</p>

<p class="dream">I enjoyed being with lots of my fiends and family from YRUU and PB as well as The
Pink Cow.  Just a great community of happy people and I got to climb on whatever I liked.  I was
even encouraged to do so; it ws beter for the community if I cliimbed around on things.</p>
