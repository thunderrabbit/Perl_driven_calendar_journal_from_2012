<p>I walked from our lesson to Yoyogi, instead of Sendagaya, saving 20 yen, and realistically taking
no more time than waiting for the train to make the transfer to go one station, yet past where I
actually need to go.</p>

<p>Anyway, during the lesson, he asked me about what I did &quot;about a month ago&quot; (two weeks
ago): meditate.  I told him the word again in Japanese, and he didn't know how to spell it, and
looked it up again in his dictionary.  The first definition is like, &quot;honored priest,&quot; so
I moved the cursor down to &quot;meditation.&quot;</p>

<p>Twenty minutes in Japanese trying to explain why I do it, and that I try every day.  He assured
me it's a waste of time (not that he's tried it; he didn't even know the word in Japanese when I
told him the word in Japanese).  I assured him that he didn't have to meditate, and explained that I
do it so that I can remain more centered during my normal activities.  But I don't know how to say
that in Japanese, so I was like, &quot;so I know who I am.&quot;</p>

<p>That didn't work, so I told him about the time I broke my shoulder and wasn't phased (much) by
it.  I told him when mosquitoes bite me, I don't spend all lesson counting them; they don't phase
me.</p>

<p>blah blah blah words and stuff were spoken, mostly in Japanese, a bit in English, and a smaller
bit in Tagalog (he likes Filipino girls.)</p>
