<p>Didn't get quite as much done at work today as I wanted, but did get a good deal done.
Basically designing the DB for keitai sites, writing a bit of PHP to create HTML / javascript to
support choosing data (colors) for appropriate fields of the DB, and writing a note to self to get
my brain synched on Monday. </p>
