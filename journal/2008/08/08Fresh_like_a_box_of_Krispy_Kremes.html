<p>At Krispy Kreme I have finished my gratis sugar drenched pastry and $350 cup of flavored ice, and
am now waiting for Tariq; I think we were supposed to meet at 9:30, but perhaps it was 10am.
Anyway, though my computer power management has been *great* ever since I met Sumiyo at Apple Store
a couple weeks ago, I ran the battery down to 8% last night while winning Marble Blast level
&quot;dexterity,&quot; on the way home and didn't charge it at my house, so I'm glad to have found a
free outlet here at the sugar shack.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  If I had internet access at this point, I would upload the &quot;dexterity&quot; image
Fred sent me (to remind me which one he was talking about (&quot;dude, you made it!&quot;)) write up
a wiki entry about the game, a couple of its features, and the screenshot I took after solving it
last night.</p>

<p>I might do all these things later, but by the time I get access to the intertubes, I also might
have forgotten slash gotten busy slash anything else.</p>

<p>Dang.  Tariq is still not here.  I'm getting the distinct feeling that he's not coming, and I
think I know what happened.  He emailed me asking if we were still good for Friday; I replied yes,
but he didn't reply back..  So I think he may not have gotten my reply.  He's switched to iPhone
since the last time we were in closer touch, so I can't call him now.</p>

<p>I'ma play Marble Blast until 10:05 and then roll to work.</p>

<p class="date">9:53am JST</p>

<p>I didn't even get as far as tweaking the game parameters to let me play all the levels when
Tariq arrived.</p>
