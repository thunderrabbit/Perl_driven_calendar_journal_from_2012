<p>Out here at ultimate, there's a white blimp way over yonder.  Havin' fun playing for the first
time this year.  The ground features a good deal of fine red dust that's so fine it's like dry snow
and wooshes around at the slightest touch.</p>

<p>Jenny with a Jee brought chocolate; Kerry with Yoshi brought some awesome date slices; basically
oatmeal based with dates and yumminess.  Delicioso.  Canadian Mike is here, also for the first time
in a while (two weeks ago, and then three months before that).  Terry is here for the first time,
cause his family is out of town.  Tammy is here from Purue for a monthish.  Lots of regulars: Doug,
Niji, Atushi, Jay, Geoff, Shin, Luke, Shag, ...</p>
