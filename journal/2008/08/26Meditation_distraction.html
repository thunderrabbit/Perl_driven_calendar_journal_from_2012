<p>After writing my dream (on my other computer (and forgot to upload it)), I meditated for 20
minutes, about 15 of which were consumed with brainwaves about how I could meet Will Smith, who was
recently featured in the movie Hancock.  (as opposed to Will Smith, my friend who lives in
Houston)</p>

<p>Anyway, I imagined emailing him my phone number so he can call me next time he visits Japan.</p>
