<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Today I had a breakthrough in my energy andor perception of my energy.  I sat down to eat the
apple given to me last night by ÎëÌÚ¤µ¤ó, gave it a reiki energy bath, and I could actually feel
the energy pouring into my hands.  Basically it felt like my hands getting warm and blood just
rushing through the blood tubes to nourish all the cells.</p>

<p>I thanked my angels, thanked the apple, gently ate the apple while enjoying the energy.</p>

<p>I reiki-blessed my NICE BOX, in which I've placed some dreams/desires to be fulfilled, and again
could feel the lovely warmth pouring through my hands.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that I've not been consciously doing the antahkarana (sp) work that Hari
taught me a few weeks ago.  I requested 7, 8 and 9 as they can support me and the meditation group
today.  Then I did the channel clearing exercise, and could feel tingling throughout my torso,
especially in head and chest.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for this positive feedback to my meditative and spiritual practice.  It seems to
have taken a while; I'm glad to continue this path.</p>
