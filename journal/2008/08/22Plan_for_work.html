<p>I'm hopin' we'll install (? what's the word?) the new version of sbstrm today so we can really
know how it will work in the field.  The site is DBically tied to a few other sites, so it's not
trivial to always set up the links in email messages to be correct.  If it's an email from one test
site that has an email referring to itself, of course the link uses the test site's URL.  But if the
email refers to a different site, there's no reasonable way for the originating system to know what
domain should be used for URLs in the emails.</p>

<p>えにうぇい、</p>

<p>I'd like to transfer my R.O.B.O.T. writings to my wiki; I think they're essentially hard coded on my
site, but with SVN backing them up.  Also need to create a backup for my wiki, though that might be
a bit heavy by its sheer definition as a place to put images.</p>

<p>Need to work also on takeout.  Um, maybe get Andrew's code that drives the new user process
(allowing them to log off and back on, but still be in the same state of the account creation
process).</p>

<p>I've been gettin' a bit jealous of blogs that can be easily updated with images taken remotely
and uploaded by mobile devices over WAP or the like.  Considering ways to create/install an
interface for my site, specifically for my journal.</p>

<p>In Jiyugaoka now; but I let the supa express train go by.</p>

<p>If I had had that ability, I could have posted pictures of the Shibuya monkey close to
realtime.  Actually it would take some training on my part as well; I already have that ability to
post from my cell to either flickr or facebook (one of them was (still) broken last time I checked)
and recently to a new service that's connected to Yahoo! in a way.  Firesomething or Somethingfire
or somethingelse, or else something in my brain is amiss.</p>

<p>Um. yeah.  So as MJG &quot;complained&quot; recently, even if I use those other services, my web
presence ends up being spread all across the web.  No centralized point to get to stuff.  Though
perhaps I could make a tab in robnugen.com to be called &quot;consolidate&quot; or &quot;etc&quot;
or &quot;and in this corner&quot; or something about 10 times better than any of those (maybe only
5 or even 1 times better than &quot;etc&quot;), but the tab would have feeds/links to all the parts
of the web that have my other stuff: youtube, smugmug, flickr, facebook, twitter, maybe the firefire
thing above,  </p>

<p>in Shibuya now.</p>

<p class="date">11:10am JST</p>

<p>At work now.  I waved to the radio DJ girls with whom I've been flirting through the glass with
U-Cow for the past couple of days.  The DJ has often been busy, but her assistant has smiled each
time.  I can tell I miss DJing at KTRU.</p>

<p>I passed a girl walking in one of the small streets between the love hotels as she was scuffing
her heels.  As in, scuffing her high heels.  For those who live in Japan (Tokyo?) this is a common
sight.  But it's still beyond my conception of reality.  I guess it just goes to show how common
high heels are in Tokyo.  They're not &quot;sexy;&quot; they're &quot;everyday.&quot;</p>
