<p>Today, overall, has been a more progressive day than last week, overall.  Progress per time
spent.  Anyway, got some coolness done: the actual labels of the page change depending on what
options are selected by the user.  So if they choose Japan, the states are called Prefectures.
Wait.  No they're not.  wtf?  I thought I had that part fixed.  Anyway, though *that* part isn't
working quite as planned, the text on the screen changes according to the user's location choice,
*and* their language preferences.</p>
