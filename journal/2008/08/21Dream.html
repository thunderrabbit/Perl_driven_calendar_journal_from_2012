<p class="dream">Driving a car in my old neighborhood; I could steer just by pressing left or right
keys on the keyboard.  Drove into some newly repaved areas that had been redesigned in a much nicer
way.  Larger radius to turn, and stuff like that.  it was good to have things so easily
navigatable.</p>
