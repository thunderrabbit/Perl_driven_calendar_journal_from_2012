<p>Cool hangout with Shimpei today; we went to Shakey's Pizza for their buffet (tabehodai, but not
a proper buffet) and chatted about all the shizzle that's happened in the last year that we haven't
hung out.</p>

<p>His arch enemy at work quit/was sent back to Germany, so Shimpei was happy about that.  He said
that now that his company is opening stores in various countries, he's getting to go on more
business trips, so the overall job is a lot more interesting.  That's super cool because I remember
when he was nervous about going overseas to sort out some business deals.  Now he's enjoying it.
Awesome.</p>

<p>tonight is the night I forgot my umbrella on the train, called Shimpei and had him leave it in
Kikuna, where he transfers to Yokohama Line.  I hopped on the supa express train to Kikuna and
picked it up, just by giving my name.  Doubly awesome.</p>
