<p>Aight; I'm going to slap down some ideas for pages to put U-Cow pics:</p>

<pre>
Daily Life
* work
* home
* errands

Out and About in Tokyo
* Pink Cow
* random peeps
* on train
* with friends

Events
* Peace Boat
* matsuri

Travel
* overseas
* via postal mail
* short trips
</pre>

<p>Hmmm.  I just realized there's no reason to not give U-Cow to someone different every day to take
him around.  Hmmmm.  How to find the right people?</p>
