<p>Best ISIS session ever.  This was my fifth session.  (three with Helma, one with Kevin, this one
with Helma)</p>

<p>Helma started with two touch points, perhaps around my kidneys.  Sadness.  &quot;I knew you were
going to choose that spot.  Why'd you have to choose there?&quot;</p>

<p>but I knew it was a good spot to choose.</p>

<p>She shifted her hands more toward the center, and the sadness immediately went away.  no no; go
back to that sadness.  That was a good spot.</p>

<p>She pressed harder.  nothing.</p>

<p>harder.  nothing.</p>

<p>harder still  Nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you feel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;you can't get me&quot; = &quot;you don't want me&quot; = &quot;please want
me&quot;</p>

<p>crying crying crying</p>

<p>there's too much sadness; I can't do this.</p>

<p>crying crying crying gasping crying crying lack of air; stop breathing; stop.</p>

<p>Go.  breathe.  good.</p>

<p>dang, this is great; I can't recommend this highly enough to Kathy Fey.  I will email her as soon
as I get home.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you feeling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to recommend ISIS to my healer in Texas; she's a reiki master and does other
healing work; I want her to be an ISIS practicioner like you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just stay with the feeling.&quot;</p>

<p>Stay with the feeling stay with the feeling; I try so hard to do it right but sometimes my brain
turns on and I don't feel anything; stay with the feeling</p>

<p>I try so hard to be perfect, but I can't be perfect.</p>

<p>Crying crying crying</p>

<p>Stop fucking asking me to do shit I can't do.  I can't be perfect.</p>

<p>Anger.  Anger.  Anger.</p>

<p>wtf?  anger?</p>

<p>I have boundaries.  I do what I want to do.  I don't have to do everything people ask.  I can
just be.</p>

<p>I hear music.  Cicadas singing.  Some people say it's noise, but they are a connection between
humans and angels.  We can tune in to cicadas' musical vibration more easily than to angels'
vibration; it's a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Just be.</p>

<p>Just be connected with angels.  They are always here for us; we just have to tune in.</p>

<p>Upon review, Helma said she was going for the anger.  She suggests that's where the real work is
for me; she was thrilled when I got to that point, and then broke through to the <em>just be</em>
of angels and symphony.</p>

<p>Lord Gana was here during the session, notes Helma.</p>

<p>Helma says the 9th of August is usually a good day for her.</p>
