<p>For some reason the Ginza Line train kept going and going and going.  I skipped the stop where I would
transfer to Hanzomon Line and was like, &quot;next = Shibuya, so I'll just keep writing,&quot;
cause I was in the flow writing and then the train kept going when it should be in Shibuya.
wtf??</p>

<p>Oh snap!  I'm not on Ginza Line; I'm on Chiyoda Line!  I don't change from Ginza to Hanzomon,
but from Chiyoda to Hanzomon!  garsh, what a gaffe!</p>

<p>So now I'm back on the train, on the track, headed back, jack, to Omotesando to make a beeline to the
other line, be feelin' fine, only 30 minutes late for work, but basically on time.</p>
