<p>Met with John Iammatteo today, talking to him about Ensofic Ray Healing, of which I hadn't
previously heard, but if it's as cool as he's saying, then I look forward to trying it.  The price
he's asking ain't all that much for the benefits of the modality.</p>

<p>Basically I wanted to get a sense of how it would work with ISIS sessions I've been doing with
Helma.  My angels say it will be fine.</p>
