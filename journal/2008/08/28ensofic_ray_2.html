<p>Just met with John for our second Ensofic Ray session, plus a cord clearing ceremony during which
I visualized a person to represent negative relationships that I'd like to release.  I pictured the
woman I dated who is closest in age to me.  I think.</p>

<p>During the process I fell asleep a lot, and then had a meditative state of clarity, or perhaps
just Focus 10 (mind awake, body asleep), or something.  Also, I thought if I could do *anything* and
not fail, I'd want to do my idea of 100 dates in Kora Kuen (sp), near Tokyo Dome.</p>

<p>After the process, walked back to the station with John who told me about a man who describes
monetary abundance as a river that he predicts and goes to where it's going, then leaves before it
leaves.</p>

<p>Said bye at the station and I went walkin' around looking for a tea shop he described as nice.
Didn't find it, but found a vegan cafe that looks at least as nice.  I may invite Kanae to meet me
there next time I meet John.</p>
