<p>Met Akiko for almost an hour during which I gave her the painting she bought (Party) and the
painting Rimi bought (Blind Lines), and the four small paintings that weren't bought so perhaps
they can be sold at Rimi's house-art-party.</p>

<p>We did the painting transfer outside by the green train car near Hachiko, and then stepped over
to the Lawson's near EV so she could quickly step into her lesson and we'd have a quiet place to
chat.  I complained about my student Komatsu, though trying to keep it fair, if not objective.
Akiko was shocked at (my version of) his behavior, so I felt a bit better / justified in my
rant.</p>
