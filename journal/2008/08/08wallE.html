<p>Saw Wall-E last night after work.  I never sorted out what WallE's name stood for; I saw the
first two initials or so, but I've forgotten now.  Anyway, the movie was cute, but I didn't cry like
the love scene in Carz (s? z?) with speedy and the Porsche, but, yeah it was cute.</p>

<p>The aptitude with which the future humans leapt from their sloth to walking piggies seemed a bit
unrealistically fast, but, it's a movie for kids.</p>
