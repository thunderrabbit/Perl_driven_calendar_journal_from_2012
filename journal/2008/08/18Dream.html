<p>I sent this as an email to Christina Branum-Martin</p>

<p class="dream">I just dreamt that I saw you at church.  After a nice long hug, you told me you
were working with children (not just your own) from 7am until 11am.  The hug was actually at 7:05am,
so you had to go back soon.  Then someone was like, "Christina, don't forget about [your commitment
to] the parking lot," as if you had to be two places at once.  You sighed and I woke up.</p>
