<p>Got U-Cow back and got some pics tonight.  With Travis, with Alita, with Cow on my head, Cow with
some wine bottles, Cow on a platter..  All of those were at a Spanish restaurant called Casa del
Buena or something.  I was a bit infatuated with Alita's smile and NZ-ish mannerisms, though she's
from Melbourne; maybe they're geographically close not counting the water.</p>

<p>Went to McD's after that for some dessert, and almost played a dare game, but Alita said she was
just kidding when she said she could pick up a woman with interestingly dyed,braided,stacked hair.
I tried getting a U-Cow pic with her, but she declined, (plus she was on the phone).</p>

<p>We headed then karaoke despite Alita's assurance that she doesn't sing.  Basically required our
assurance that we wouldn't make her sing.  A good time was had by all; I sang Business, Without Me,
Be Our Guest, and Raspberry Beret.  Others sang other songs, including Bust A Move and others.
Somehow, my version of Business was like as perfect as I've ever done it, despite not having done it
in months and months and months.  Without Me was nearly as good.  I was impressed with YK doing Bust
A Move; I think he got it perfectly throughout; I errored during the beach portion.  &quot;On the
beach you're strollin' / real high rollin' / everything you have is yours and not stolen.&quot; I
was thrown off by the word &quot;strollin'&quot; I don't know what I thought it was, but I didn't
think it was that.</p>

<p>Somehow I forgot U-Cow cards at work <em>again</em>, so I wasn't able to give one to Alita, nor
to the woman next to whom I'm sitting now on the train.  She has a plaid bear nearly the same scale
size as U-Cow.  The bear has earrings and some cute jewelry.</p>

<p>There's a guy across the train from us with three friends supporting him as he's tearfully upset
about something.  I've never seen this type of behavior in my years in Tokyo.  I've seen guys
crying toward angry girls, but never seen this.  He's sad and angry, I imagine; he slapped the
train door a while ago.  Then immediately apologized when everyone looked up at him.</p>

<p>His friends are good support I believe; he's smiling despite still tears in eyes.  It's nice.</p>
