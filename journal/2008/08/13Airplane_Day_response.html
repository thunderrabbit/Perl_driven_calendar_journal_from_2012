<p>I tried responding to a guy on the No Planes Theory on YT (link later(?)), but YT ate my
response.  Twice.  The first attempt included a URL like physics911.net (no http), and the second
contained physics911 dot net (no .).  Not sure if those ate the response, or bad internet
connection, but while I have a second of free time on the train, I'll rewrite basically what I wanted
to write and see if I can get it posted.</p>

I replied to this but the response got eaten; I'll try again.

Certainly the wings would be deformed, but they would be ripped from the plane's fuselage, not fold

back and disappear into the Pentagon.  See "The Missing Wings" on physics911 net.

And the Pentagon wasn't destroyed; it's been rebuilt, probably "stronger than ever."

Also, regarding your previous comment: a government would attack its own people to induce fear and
ensure the government's own survival.
