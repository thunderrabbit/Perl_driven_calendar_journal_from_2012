<p>Late last night and this morning, I was recursively sidetracked after wanting to play Marble
Blast, then document my previously created levels, therefore upload to my wiki, then wonder if
another &quot;official&quot; wiki exists, then find a scattered community from garagegames to two
wikis and a forum on a different site, then find a genealogy wiki on Wikia, create a new account,
then sleep and wake up, check email, get a welcome message from genealogy site, find problems with
the welcome message, report those problems, then look for Texas Foley on the genealogy site, then
wonder about uploading my Master Genealogist data, therefore write a question in the forum, go back
to email, get a message regarding my NPT on youtube, reply back to that, get a decent reply back,
try to reply *twice*, but YT ate my reply, wonder what the tinyurl is to the Airplane Day wiki I
made, look for tinyurl reverse lookup, have to get ready for ultimate.</p>

<p>Accomplished: almost nothing!</p>
