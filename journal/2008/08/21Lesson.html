<p>About to meet Komatsu for our &quot;lesson.&quot;  Maybe he has decided to study.  Hopefully!!</p>

<p class="date">5:00pm JST</p>

<p>Back from the lesson.  It was a bit less interesting than previous lessons; he read through an
email that was way too difficult for him, but presented in such a way that I thought for a panicked
moment that he needed to not just grok it, and not just respond to it, but actually organize aspects
of a conference and such.</p>

<p>Turns out he doesn't need to do that.  I don't know why he brought the letter in, but whatev.</p>

<p>We did a bit of listening in his text (that's nearly over his head), and today, finally, with the
help of Miss Suzuki, I got him to understand he <em>really could</em> take the book home and use it,
keep it, write in it, etc.  It cost less than a fifth of the price they're paying me for each
lesson, so the book is like giving him free air or something.</p>
