<p>Worked pretty late last night.  Left at like 11:30pm.</p>

<p>Productivity waned near the end, but overall we had fun using the newly installed trac system,
and porting issues from our wiki to trac.  Trac is all great except for one thing: it doesn't use
UTF-8!  Wha???</p>

<p>So when I tried to write some Japanese there, it didn't work.  Bluh.</p>

<p>Now, it's possible that *Emacs* wasn't using UTF-8, and so I'm willing to look at this issue
again and see if I can sort it out.</p>

<p>ps: one day I need to switch the Japanese in my journal over to UTF-8. I'm using EUC-JP, I think.</p>
