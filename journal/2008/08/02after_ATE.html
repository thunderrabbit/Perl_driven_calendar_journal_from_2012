<p class="date">6:30pm Saturday 2 August 2008 (day 14010)</p>

<p>Dinner at an organic buffet in Ikebukero with Brett and Helma after
the ATE (Brett's fifth or so, and my second).</p>

<p>I had some nice breakthroughs in vision (?) of seeing colors of a
dreamlike quality, but while fully conscious.</p>

<p>8 participants beside the four of us (three plus Mia) who had done
workshops before.</p>

<p>The workshop was two stops from Ikebukero on Marunochi line, so
Brett, Helma and I went to dinner in Ikebukero at a delicious, mostly
organic, mostly vegetarian buffet restaurant (orange juice included)
for 2097 yen for an hour of chowing goodness.</p>

<p>Brett has been doing Clairvision work for about 5 years, so he and
Helma had done various trainings and workshops before.  I enjoyed
hearing their stories and experiences.  I imagine this will become a
significant part of my life training, 'specially in the spiritual
department.</p>
