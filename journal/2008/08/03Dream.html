<p class="dream">Was playing at Dude and Veronica's house and Veronica paid me 1000 yen because i
had parked TJ Bike outside and not brought him inside because Bailey was inside instead.  But the
1000 yen note was actually a 2000 yen note, one I had given her a long time ago.  But when I had
sent the 2000 yen note to her, it had been devalued on its way out of Japan; it was literally marked
on the bill with a note that said it was now 1972 yen.  But then it had an extra note, &quot;If the
married man states such, the note becomes 2000 yen value.&quot;</p>
