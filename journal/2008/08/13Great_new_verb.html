<p>Until today, I didn't know about this great new verb: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WT:-)#recow">recow</a>.</p>

<p>This is from YK:</p>

Will recow you then!

Cheers!

<p>update:</p>

<pre>
restore recow

Hello

Sorry to contact you this way; I don't see another way to do so. I wrote the recow entry after my
friend YK sent an email before recowing me last night. My cow had gone on a trip with YK, and I
looked forward to being recowed upon his return.

I readily admit that the word has not seen extensive usage in English, and perhaps should not,
therefore, be included in wiktionary.

But, given that I did spend several minutes writing the entry (sorting out the pronunciation), I
wonder if you could do me a small favor by copying the text of the entry to the WT:-) page, so that
I may link my journal entry to that definition instead of the now-missing recow entry.

Thanks!
