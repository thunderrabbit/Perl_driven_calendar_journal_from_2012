<p>Last night I left work at a normal time (basically didn't get anything done after Komatsu's
lesson) and met Ami on Yamanoted Line at 7pm.  I was at the platform a bit early, and she stepped
smilingly off the train that arrived at 6:55pm (coming from Ebisu (Roppongi)), and I pointed right
back onto the train, and we went to Ikebukero</p>

<p>Because we were on the first car, I got a bit lost getting out of Ikebukero (normally get out in
Ikebukero from the middle of the train), but after a bit of a walk, including outside, I sorted out
where we were going (didn't know the name of the exit nor the building, but I know what it looks
like when I see it.</p>

<p>At ate the buffet restaurant where Helma and Brett and I went to dinner after the first night of
the ATE a couple weeks ago.  We each got two plates, featuring almost completely different foods
(I'm a sweet tooth and she's
a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=spicy_tooth">spicy tooth</a>) We were seated
in the back of the restaurant (where Helma, Brett and I had sat near the front) where two girls were
seated in the table next to us, one of whom had light (nearly white) colored lipstick.  I kept
glancing over at her and feeling a bit guilty cause it's Ami's birthday for goodness sake, but Ami
didn't seem phased.  She basically doesn't care if I look, but just doesn't want me to touch.</p>

<p>I noticed how the two girls were like continually chattering; I couldn't tell about what they
were speaking, but they started off with an おつかれさまま, so I imagine they work together.  I
wished Ami and I could speak that easily together.</p>

<p>I mentioned that I was approached by some massagie-massagie girls on the way home from work the
previous night, and I turned down the first girl because I had to get the train, and she said it was
okay: we could stay overnight at the hotel for no extra cost.  
Ami said basically, &quot;there'd probably be a thug there the next morning to make you pay up, so
be careful.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow!  I really appreciated this answer; I know there's no chance I'd take up such an offer, but
that I nearly have permission, is quite a nice feeling of freedom.</p>

<p>I told her about teasing the second girl by offering her a back massage, but she squirmed away,
and then a third girl scooted backwards up to me to get a massage.  I gave her a shoulder massage
for a bit.  (Left out the detail of the girl saying &quot;more power,&quot; so I put too much
pressure on her shoulders and she kinda buckled down so I let up and finished at a more appropriate
pressure.  I like giving massages and wondered if I'd enjoy having girls run up to me in the streets
to receive for a quick massage.)</p>

<p>On the restaurant's dessert bar, they've got little shot glasses of green stuff that's sorta
sweet and I've got little idea what's in them, though they sorta taste like banana (and the sign
says バナナ, so I guess that's a good indication).. but they're green.  Anyway, I offered to let Ami
try my first one and she sniffed it, but was like, &quot;no way!&quot; so later when I offered her
my second one, she sealed her mouth up, until I went to drink it and she opened her mouth like,
&quot;I want some!&quot; and then I'd offer it to her and she slammed her mouth shut again.  We
played like this for about 10 rounds, and I almost tricked her by switching the pattern and opening
my mouth to drink, but offering the drink to her.  Funny funny.  I love being able to play little
games like this with Ami.</p>

escalators.  We took the Fukutoshin Line to Shibuya, where I saw some guy run up to jump over the
rail, thereby escaping without paying the fare.  Oh!  Jesse!!  I haven't seen Jesse in a while, so
we chatted for a bit (he didn't jump over the wall) and then he headed home to Ana and
baby-chan.</p>

Ami and I headed to the プリクラ and got pics.  I got one sent to my cellphone, which is now my
wallpaper.  (I wanted another one, but I miss-clicked, though I still like this one.) Ami and I
shared a seat (in succession) on Toyoko line on the way to my house where I told her I'd be her
servant and do anything she wanted...</p>
