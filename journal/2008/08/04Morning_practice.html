<p>With the enthusiasm of this weekend workshop, I was able to drag myself to meditation position
and practice meditation first thing this morning.  And, I had another breakthrough:</p>

<p>Previously, I would get up to meditation position, and then about 2 minutes into it, feel
shockingly tired and give up, lie back down and sleep.</p>

<p>But today, I got up to meditation position, and about two minutes into it, I felt the subtle
tingles that I described previously as shocking tiredness.  But instead of succumbing to them, I
felt them.  At one point I was like, <em>what is that?</em> and they vanished.  So then I
re-relaxed my outer mind and noticed they came back.  And they could be perceived as crazy
tiredness, but I stayed with the feeling, and stayed with the feeling, and lost consciousness for a
bit, then came back, and focused on breathing (with throat friction).. etc.</p>

<p>Basically I passed through a mental block to meditating, and experienced some energy in a
different way than previously.</p>
