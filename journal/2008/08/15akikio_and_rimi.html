<p>Great time with Akiko and Rimi tonight.  We spent an hour in
Seikaido where I bought a bunch of white boards and some POSCAs with
which I plan to make some colorful pieces, and some canvas boards and
a paint brush and eraser.  Oh, and some multi-purpose cleaner,
including for oil.  Sweet!  I'm all art-supplied.</p>

<p>Then to an okonomiyaki place where I enjoyed chatting with them and
at one point realized my thoughts were everywhere but present, so I
recentered and felt a better connection with reality.  That was nice.
Soon thereafter they asked me if I had ever been seduced by a man.  I
told them about my four different experiences.</p>
