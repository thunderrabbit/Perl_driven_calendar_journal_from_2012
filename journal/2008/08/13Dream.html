<p class="dream">A dog sorta curled up (*) beside us, and I noticed she was a woman, basically a
Furry, I guess.  She smiled al bigly and I wanted to curl up with her, but didn't know if Ami would
approve, as she was between me and the dog-woman.  I mostly just wanted to meet this critter and ask
questions.</p>

<p class="dream">With Princess Leah in a room and we could hear Han Solo yammering on about how
great he was as he approached the room.  His six legged scout robot (basically a 6 legged tripod
lookin' thing) scooted into the room and then tripped over something and fell.  I grabbed it by its
legs and started to swing it like a bat at the floor and the door to shatter it and prove we could
match Han Solo in a fight.  He came in and said, &quot;why don't we go to Vlad Turin region to talk,
so that way if we get in trouble, I'll be arrested, too?&quot; (his proof that he wanted no
trouble.)  He had a wrist growing down from his head over his right ear, and then I realized it was
just a styled radio headset.</p>

<p class="dream">OM was in the corner, talking about his fears of not having enough money, and I
realized he was on the edge of tears.  I told him I hoped he would make all the money in the world,
but that he didn't need any money to be happy.  He could just meditate and thereby connect with the
universe and be fulfilled.</p>
