<p class="dream">Taking a shower, I decided to shave my head.  It hadn't been very long since I
shaved before, so there wasn't much of a difference, but I fell asleep while shaving my head, and
forgot about the rest when I woke up and got out of the shower.  I realized later what had
happened, when I happened to brush my hand over my hair.  Oh snap!  I fell asleep while shaving!
No one else seemed phased.  I just kept putting my sleeping bag in its case and into my backpack.
It fit more easily than I expected.</p>
