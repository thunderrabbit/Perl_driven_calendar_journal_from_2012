<p class="dream">As I was sitting diagnolly behind Jennifer N from PT!
in Houston, she did some sort of emotional support thing for me,
asking questions by typing them in Emacs, and I was answering.  We
were both editing the buffer at the same time, and somehow it switched
to a different buffer as I was trying to answer something from the
heart, so I got pulled into my thinking mind when I was undoing the
changes to restore the buffer.  But in the end I wanted to talk more
to her cause we were finished.  I scooted my desk forward to talk to
her more, but there was another guy in the way.  He turned around
like, HI can I help you? when I moved my desk, but I didn't want to
talk to him, nor admit I was trying to reach Jennifer.  I saw she had
big blisters on her feet; not just the back of the heels, but on the
soles: heels, balls, arches, everywhere.  She had to go out for a bit,
but I thought she would be back in a bit, but she said, "see you
tomorrow," and i was like, "tomorrow?" in a little meek
voice.. "okay." and then I was on a train, leaving and as the train
went by Jennifer, she called over the loudspeaker very quickly just as
my seat passed her, "Idon'thateyouRobbie!" which was her style of all
but saying I love you.  I didn't even know she knew I wanted to talk
more, much less would she acknowledge it; I started crying, and
actually woke up crying. (*)</p>

<p>(*) started to outwardly cry as I woke up.</p>
