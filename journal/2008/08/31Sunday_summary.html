<p>Because I still haven't gotten Emacs correctly set up on my PowerBook (from Jason), I didn't
write anything yesterday, cause *this* computer doesn't have its own place in my room.  I have to
swap the computers or make new space, and it was just too much trouble.  Or I'm just lazy, or a
combination of both.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  :-)</p>

<p>Yesterday featured sleeping late and then showing Ulrike to Motosumiyoshi after taking some
pictures of my fork-bending prowess, where she arrived a
couple days ago, having no idea how to get to the apartment, and ended up with five people helping
her in the rain.  A taxi was involved.  Anyway, the morning we walked out there was sunshiny and
nice.  I enjoyed the process of slowly examining the station, fixing it into memory.</p>

<p>She led us back to the house, turning left at the first left which turned out to be not the same
first left that we had used; she sorted out the difference quickly enough.  Identified home by
seeing Ami on my apartment balcony doing laundry.  Turns out I had left a pack of kleenex in one of
my pockets.. oops!</p>

<p>After helping Ami hang the rest of the clothes, we chatted a bit after I wanted to bite her foot
and she was like, &quot;no way!&quot; and I was like, &quot;please?? I'll never ask for another
favor ever again, ever cross my heart, etc&quot; (there's actually sortof a word for this in
Japanese, that I'd translate basically as a once-in-a-lifetime-request, but it can only be used once
(per set of participants).)</p>

<p>Anyway, she was like, &quot;really?  really?  you know this is your one chance, right?&quot;</p>

<p>And I was like, &quot;wait stop wait wait,&quot; and we had a bit of a discussion because I
have <em>already</em> used my once-in-a-lifetime request with Ami, and I was taken a bit aback to
think that she had forgotten it *again*, because she did forget it once.</p>

<p>I took a second / minute to cool down and then re-engaged the conversation and was relieved to
know that she did remember my one request: I want her truth.  Whatever it may be; I want her to
speak truthfully with me.</p>

<p>Back to smiles and kisses, then we walked with Ulrike to Musashi-kosugi, to show her that
station and the ward office, and Ami got her DOCOMO phone turned off (in favor of her iPhone), and
then we went grocery shopping at a new 24 hour store called Foodium, and I slurzzled 200 ml of ice
cream on the way back.</p>

<p>Then a big fat nap before dinner, and I decided how I'm gonna arrange pics on Uncle Cow's site:
basically by giving them all categories.  I had been trying to make pages to collect similar
pictures, but that's a nightmare and 1/2 for each desired category.  Using actual categories is
about 10 times easier, and an almost perfect solution.  I'd like the option of having category
galleries embedded on the main page.  But, I can do that by hand..</p>
