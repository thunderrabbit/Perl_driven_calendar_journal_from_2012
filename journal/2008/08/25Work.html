<p>Have been working on getting Brackup to work for my website today.  Basically I'm a bit
confuzzled on how to get GPG set up.  Not sure why I can't find quite the information I want.  What
is my UID?  How do I get my public key as a text file?  Why can't I delete my existing key and
start over?</p>

<p>Besides that, though I got the backup and restore to work properly, I also got an error message
at one point, and couldn't get around it except by deleting a .db (?) file that was stored with the
backup chunks.  Not sure what caused that, nor if I should reconsider using Brackup to backup my
site.  It looks like the best option I've got (free, works on Dreamhost, sends to Amazon A3)...  Mr
Fitzpatrick doesn't seem to be actively working on the code; not sure that I want to dig in and
start changing things, but I'm not completely adverse to the idea.</p>
