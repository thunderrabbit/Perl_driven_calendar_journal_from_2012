<p>I called Ami on my way home, but no answer.  I was gonna head home anyway and wait for her, but I
realized that might be silly.  Headed instead back to Yoyogi-Uehara to take the Odakyu Line to
Shinjuku.  Returning to Yoyogi-Uehara, I noticed three guys with cat ear headbands, so I got a
picture of them with U-Cow.  Almost didn't, basically out of fear of approaching them, but I
realized it would be silly not to.. They're wearing cat ears!</p>

<p>Helma happened to be on the platform on the way to Shinjuku; we chatted a bit on the train and I
told her of my close call to going home to wait for Ami.</p>

<p>Said bye in Shinjuku; I headed to the book store where last night I ordered a book for Ami
(another copy of the text that Komatsu-san won't take home), and picked up Ami's copy.</p>

<p>She called me while I was paying, and confirmed with me that she'd be working today and see me
around 10pm.</p>
