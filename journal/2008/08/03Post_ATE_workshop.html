<p>The workshop was super great.  I mostly enjoyed meeting Brett and listening to Èþ°¡'s
translations.  I learned some new words: ÆîËÌ, and ¤¤¤·¤­ (I think).  I could have sorted out the
meaning of Namboku had I really looked at the kanji, but I had never used the train line (until
today) (Mia used the word when she was basically trying to describe longitude and latitude lines
(the grid of Earth lines)).  Ishiki means conscious / consciousness.  That word was used about a million times
during the weekend, and Mia translated it the same way each time.</p>

<p>Doing the meditations was equally great; seeing Helma and Brett's interaction was great; doing
the eye contact exercises was great.  I'm looking forward to a new infusion of energy into our
weekly ongoing meditation meetings.</p>

<p>After the workshop, Mia, Brett, Helma, and I hung out at Tea Time near ¸å³Ú±à and chat chat
chatted for a long time.  I was surprised at how much effort had gone into making the workshop a
reality.  Could I do all that?</p>

<p>I think for now I'll just stick with painting and meditating and takin' care of my own
biznass.</p>

<p>A man named Yoda spoke pretty good English; he's been doing Buddhist meditation stuff for some 10
years or so.  Robert is from Poland, and has lived in Japan for a while; he asked lots of questions,
which was great when others seemed too shy to ask.  Kumi and Tenko were the last to leave each day;
I imagine I'll be seeing them at the ongoing meditation group.  I chatted with Kumi more than with
Tenko, and even gave her my URL after I mentioned I had my journal online.  I barely spoke with
Tenko, but I hope her kanji is Å·»Ò and that she and Kumi will both join the meditation group and
ISIS intensive in October.</p>

<p>But I mostly mostly wish °¡Èþ could have been there.  I realllllllllly want to do this type of
work with my partner.</p>
