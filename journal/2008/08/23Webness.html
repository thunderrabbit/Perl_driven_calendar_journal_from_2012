<p>Came to work right after meeting Helma.  Ah cripes I forgot to write about the ISIS session.  In
the end, it's more important.  hang on.</p>

<p>Okay I'm back; I just wrote the (backdated) ISIS entry.  That was my 3rd ISIS at Helma's
apartment on Saturday (3 in a row) and a few before that; I sorta lost count, but hope I've
journaled them; I want to put them in my wiki.</p>

<p>Um, online I fixed the wikis for uncle cow, go-rilla, Monty bear, and the isfuzzy main wiki.  I
had upgraded the files, but not the DB because the 'how to upgrade' email from Dreamhost pointed to
a portion that had been renamed from 12.0 to NULL on the wiki page.  I sorted out what had happened
after I fixed the wiki DB myself and was about to write to explain how to do it, and I noticed it
had already been written.  Oh.  Just need to rename the link.</p>

<p>After that, looking for ways to backup my DB for robnugen.com/wiki before I update it; looks
like I'm gonna go with brackup (sorry no link at the moment), if I can figure it out.</p>
