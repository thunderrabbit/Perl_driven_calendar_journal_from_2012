<p>I just noticed that I didn't write anything about Ami yesterday.  She stayed at my apartment
while I went to ultimate, so she missed all the rain, but cooked me some lovely dinner and lunches
for the forseeable future.  We slept late late in the morning because I had closed the storm
shutters as a &quot;joke&quot; -- I explain my seemingly random actions with &quot;あきない！&quot;
which I think means basically always interesting or something.</p>

<p>The shuttering idea sorta backfired; I guess I shoulda known it would.  Ami's an excellent
sleeper, and the darkened room kept her right on sleeping, and she didn't even notice the room was
far too dark for 9am or whatever time it was when I finally couldn't stand continued sleepin'.</p>

<p>I was a bit off-kilter yesterday (and here I am awake at 4:30am), partially due to that,
partially due to not meditating, partially who knows what.</p>

<p>We romped and I rode TJ Bike to ultimate, came home to nice dinner and then I wanted to work on
my Marble Blast level, but so as to include Ami, I showed her the game and watched as she rolled
through all but the last beginner levels.  I showed her the levels that I made... I'd have links
right about now, but I haven't posted them to my (or any other) wiki.</p>

<p>I came up with a genius idea (!) for a game which saw me off to sleep.</p>

<!-- Basically called 亜美'sちんちん, or &quot;Ami's penis,&quot; I lay back and let Ami play with
my stuff like I used to back in the days of puberty. Like make it look like a turtle or make the end
of the urethra into a talking worm puppet. I've generally grown out of this game for myself, but
it's still interesting for Ami, so I think she enjoyed playing.  I fell asleep during the game and
she gave me a smooch or three as she collected her stuff and headed home. -->

<!-- oh, I made a funny pun by stretching out my scrotum into a square shape and called it Tama
Plaza.  Tama Plaza is the name of a station &quot;close&quot; to here, and tama means ball, and is
slang for testicles. -->
