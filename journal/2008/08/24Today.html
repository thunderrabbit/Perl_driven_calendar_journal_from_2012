<p>Meditated this morning, then transferred all
my <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Category:ISIS">ISIS experiences</a> from my journal to my wiki.
Then a quick smooch,etc with Ami before going to ultimate, but before going to ultimate, drizzle
started drizzling, and I stayed on my computer and updated
my <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Facebook:_FriendsForSale">FFS images</a> as well as Francois'.</p>

<p>Now we're going to watch Hancock.</p>
