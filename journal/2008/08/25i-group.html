<p>Only Kevin and I in I-group tonight.  We met in Takadanobaba and ended up at an Indian place
cause Ben's Cafe is closed on Mondays in July and August.  Kevin liked the food better than the
Indian place in Gotanda, but it was all the same to me.  Food is food.  He told me about getting an
email from one of his students, an Italian woman who owns a book publishing company.  She wants him
to give her a crash course on shamanism before she heads down to Australia for some shamanic stuff.
Wow!  Could work out that Kevin can publish some books in Europe through her company.  That would be
awesome!</p>

<p>Anyway, as always, I enjoyed chatting with Kevin, and told him the cool things that have happened
in my life.  He said the dream I had after Ensofic Ray seemed &quot;significant,&quot; and was glad
to hear that good news.  A woman started smoking at a nearby table, and we dashed out just before
her husband started to puff up his own kid-killin' cancer cane.  Yuck; their poor daughter!</p>

<p>Kevin showed me the local art theater, lamenting, however, that all the subtitles are only in
Japanese (of course).  We stopped in Starbucks for a drink and more stories and jokes.  Good times;
I like Kevin.</p>
