<p>Despite having been up late watching Ghost Ride the Whip, getting a primer on Bay Area hip hop
culture and therefore waking up a bit late this morning, I did my meditation and reiki stuff
anyway.  Used to be that I would skip 'em, wanting more my internet connection than my meditation
connection.</p>

<p>I've also noticed recently that I've had less interest in kicking my brain off to sleep with a
porn-induced orgasm.  Like I haven't done this in like a week or less.  Pretty sure not this week.
But it could just be that I've been so flippin' tired, working long hours.</p>

<p>And it could also be that meditation practice has connected my energy with energy that doesn't
need to do that anymore.</p>
