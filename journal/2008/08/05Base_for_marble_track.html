<p>Bringing the base for my new marble track to work today.  Since it appears I won't be making it
super-easily levelled, I do plan to make a stop-action movie of its construction.  So first I'll be
making a camera holder to stablize the camera relative to the track.  Not sure how to keep
consistent lighting, but if I do the whole thing inside at my office, it should work out relatively
well.</p>

<p>I plan to make the camera holder primarily with chopsticks.</p>

<p>As opposed to my regular request for no bag and no chopsticks when getting food at a convenience
store, today I got no bag and three pairs of chopsticks.  One good thing though: these choppers
happen to actually be bamboo instead
of <a href="http://www.seekjapan.jp/article/1682/Knowing,+but+Not+Doing+-+Japan%27s+Disinterest+in+the+Environment">wood
from China</a>.</p>
