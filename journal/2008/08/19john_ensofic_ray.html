<p>Not impressed with how late John is in seeing me for our first (last ?) session.  I mean, he said
a little late, but this has been over 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I would have stayed at work if I had known what he meant by &quot;a little late.&quot;</p>

<p class="date">10:11pm JST</p>

<p>Was on the edge of leaving, but a coin toss suggested I stay.  I'm glad I did; it's better to
face the issue instead of get grumpy and run away with hurt feelings on both sides.</p>

<p>I described to him the concept of a makeup, and he offered an extra bit of energy work; I
accepted and all was clear between us.</p>

<p>The actual process this evening included lots of interesting subtle energies coursing around my
body; it was neat.</p>
