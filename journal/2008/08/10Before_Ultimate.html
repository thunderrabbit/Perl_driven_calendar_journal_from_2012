<p>Dang.  I was late to get the train to meet Doug at Futako-Shinchi on time, then realized I could
make up the time by riding TJ Bike to Kosugi, made up the time (including taking an express train on
Odawara (?) Line) and got to Futako-Tamagawa on time, but then took the express and passed
Futako-Shinchi.  Barf.</p>
