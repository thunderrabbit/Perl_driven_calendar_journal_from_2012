<p>Good wet time at ultimate.  I randomly met up
with <a href="http://www.michaeljohngrist.com/">British Mike</a>, his girlfriend Su Young, Hitomi,
and Yasuko on the way there.  Tossed disc with that group while scrimmage continued from around
noon.  Mike suggested we practice different types of throws.  Hitomi definitely improved during the
practice.  I didn't really improve noticably, given that all the throws we practiced are in my
repetoire, but I enjoyed noticing those throws used during the game.  There was no rain until we
really got started playing; then in slowly oscillated between a fine mist like at supermarket
veggie sections to a heavy sprinkle that encouraged two handed catches.</p>

<p>I played even less effective D than I normally do; without shoes, my feet were pretty slidy on
the wet grass.  Any cuts left me behind, though I did block Mike one (1) time by sorta crashing
into him as we ran for the disc.  I called interference on myself, but he let it play, giving me
the disc.  Not sure if we did anything effective after that, but I think I made a completion with
that particular throw.</p>

<p>I was about 60% for completions today, and about half of the misses were the fault of the
slippery disc, so I'm pretty happy with my accuracy.  I'm definitely a bit out of running practice;
I guess 6+ months off will do that.</p>
