<p>This will end up in my wiki soon, but I don't have online access at the moment.</p>

<p>Not as much emotional experience today, but more &quot;mapping&quot; of my etheric body, learning
some of the messages that roll around in my brain: looking for approval, not approving of myself;
wanting to help people, not knowing how; wanting to be good, hating society for watching TV and
smokin', drinkin'.  People are idiots and I hate them all.  Of course, this has nothing to do with
people, nor even individuals, except for one: the one living in this monkey suit body typing this
collection of words, and who just skipped the train so he better writing something good.</p>

<p>My homework includes reading, writing, (*) painting, and I realized the perfect way to do
Colleenie Beanie's painting: it will be my first oil painting!  This solves a few issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I need to do my first oil painting</p></li>

<li><p>It would take a lot of acrylic to start this the way I want, and just make a mess that I
didn't want to clean up</p></li>

<li><p>profit!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Just kidding about profit, but I can't think of a third item.</p>

<p>The writing includes about my sub personalities.  I might call them my Peeps.  And I think I'll
write about my Monkey, meaning my monkey body in which I'm livin' these days.  14035 so far.</p>

<p>(*) just had a lovely chat with Sally!  And my son Tina!</p>
