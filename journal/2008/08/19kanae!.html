<p>Wow!  Saw Kanae jogging; actually she saw me; I must embarrassedly admit I didn't recognize her
partially because she was speaking only Japanese, and cause she was all hot-n-sweaty from jogging.
I didn't chat very long cause she was jogging, and I was still chatting with John, but gave her
U-Cow's card and asked her to get in touch.  I need to get my *own* name cards made so I can give
out something with my email address.</p>
