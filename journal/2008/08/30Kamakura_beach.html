<p>Went to Kamakura Beach with Ulrike on Saturday (30 August).  It was her first full day in Japan,
and she was well ready for anything besides the nightmare of first night lost in a new
city/language/culture of the night before.</p>

<p>Got a free Pocari Sweat, but couldn't take a picture with the blue-dressed girls and Uncle Cow.
Found Ami's friend's workplace: Blue Lagoon, and chilled out there for a bit of food, drinks, and
ice cream for me.  I got cheap refills for using the same container.  I think also they just want to
get rid of it because the store is now closed for the season.</p>

<p>A woman with long sandyblonde curly hair and a little accessorinu (a word I just made up:
combination of accessory and the Japanese word for dog: inu.  Basically a little dog that is used
more as a cute accoutrement than respected as an animal) named Noi-noi arrived, and Ami was like,
&quot;she's famous, or she used to be, but 'went crazy' and fell out of the lime light.&quot;  I
met her and learned her name by way of greeting her dog.  Tomomi something, though we didn't see
much of her, and I didn't get a U-Cow picture with her.</p>

<p>Did get U-Cow with a guy buried in the sand, and also played with some guys who were trying to
volley a ball while balanced on a raft.  Fun times.</p>
