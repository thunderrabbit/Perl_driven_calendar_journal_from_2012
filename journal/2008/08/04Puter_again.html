<p>At the Apple Store, picking up my computer again after the first fix included no R in the RGB
output.</p>

<p>On their first attempt to show me that it's working, it didn't work.  I dunno if it's their
monitor or my &quot;new&quot; logic board.</p>

<p>If this shit keeps up, we'll have to call for some more drastic measures, like gimme
a <em>new</em> new logic board.  sumpin'.</p>
