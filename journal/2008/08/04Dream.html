<p class="dream">Hang gliding from the top of Mt Fuji wasn't as easy as I had hoped, but if my om
had done it, I bet I could; I had to get another jacket though; on my first trial flight it was a
bit cold.  I didn't want to do a full flight, but just a test, so I was lucky I could bring the
kite back down after I took off from the top.  I came down only like 30 meters later, and then went
quickly to the bottom to get another shirt; I was looking for a tank top with high contrast against
the snow, but couldn't find one before I woke up.</p>
