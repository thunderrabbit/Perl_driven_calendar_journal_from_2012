<p>Didn't meet Ami tonight as originally planned.  :-(  But I am *almost* done scouring the site
for typos and such, though I must say my scouring intensity has waned over the course of the day.
Just one more section to check, then I'm going home.</p>

<p class="date">12:39am JST</p>

<p>On the train now; it's scheduled to leave at 12:44, but generally leaves at least 5 minutes after
that.</p>
