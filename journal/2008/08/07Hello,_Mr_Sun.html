<p>I sang a freestyle love song to Sol, Earth, clouds, trees, walls, nature on the way to the train
station.  The sun is bright today after having been chillin' behind storms for a few days this
week.</p>

<p>For the record, the song was mostly to the tune of Hello Mr Zebra by Tori Amos.</p>

<pre>
Hello Mr Sun
How are you today?
thank you for warming up the world in your special way!
The gratitude I posess for you
has got to fill up the whole zoo
so if you're ever lonely 
then just smile down on me!
</pre>

<p>Etc, then,</p>

<pre>
I figured it out
if I wanna be happy
all I have to do is 
simply be happy ee ee
</pre>

<p>Or some such.  Good song.  Thanks, Tori!</p>
