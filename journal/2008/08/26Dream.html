<p class="dream">In my messy room, I got a call from Pat Lilja before
we were about to leave for Osaka.  He asked if I planned to keep my
room or if I wanted to move my stuff out completely.  I hadn't
actually known moving out was an option, so as I looked around at my
bookcase and all my stuff, compared to the amount of time we had left
before leaving, I was like, "no; I'm going to stay," because it
wouldn't bode well to panic pack and make a mess of things
emotionally.</p>

<p class="dream">I went outside to help my dad get ready to leave, and
he asked if I would help water some grass with fertilizer-water, so I
sstared to do so, splashfully pouring out water from a can, and he was
like, "no no no, not those plants, " and I was like, "aight, tellme
clearly which plans," and he was vague again, and I was like, "no.
what about this?" and I pointed with my foot at a particular plant.
He wasn't listening, and was vague *again*, and finally I got a
straight answer after some perseverance.  I finished the watering job,
and still had some water left in a drink bottle, but I didn't know if
it was drinkable, so I went looking for some grass to pour it out.</p>

<p class="dream">Ended up outside a stadium where I heard a large
number of people counting down the final seconds on the clock, from 1
to 10 (*), and then counting down/up again for the other team, even
though the first team had already won the grand prize: a VCR.  I
climbed up the stands in search of some water on the back side, but
saw nothing but concrete outside the stadium.  On the way down, I
barefootedly jumpingly navigated between people, and at one point went
under a guy's leg, bumping his foot and his boot fell off.  I caught
it and placed it down on the seat below his foot (so he could easily
reach it), and then he caught me with the crook of his knee.  His foot
was all stinky, so I squirted water from my bottle onto his jeans to
get him to let me go.  Ended up pouring all my water out on his legs
(it was ice cold water) and then he laughed and let me go and I
laughed and was like, "yeah, your foot was stinkin' so I had to escape
somehow!" and he took (mock?) offense at that as his buddies laughed,
and he came running after me wearing only one boot.</p>

<p class="dream">I ran out of the room, slamming doors closed behind
me, but at the same time wondering what he could possibly do in this
situation, wearing only one boot, and not having his friends with him
to help.  But still I felt some fear and didn't face him and thought
it would be funny to vanish into like the fourth dimension. So I did,
by waking up.</p>

<p>(*) not sure why there were counting *up*</p>
