<p class="dream">At a UU assembly, held in a rather large collection of buildings.  I was walking
barefootedly outside on a balcony, enjoying the feel of gentle wooden planks supporting each
step.</p>

<p class="dream">On a train with Colleen, I was writing her a letter by affixing plastic letters
with clothespins to a coat hanger.</p>

<p class="dream">S I N C E Y O U ' L L H A V E A R A I N C O A T , W H A T M O R E C O U L D Y O U N
E E D ?</p>

<p class="dream">As I was affixing the letters, I was thinking about several different things,
including how I was going to send her the coathanger, how I appreciated that she'd understand my
joke, how much more time I had before arriving at my station, and how we would joke about it later
when I told her she should definitely bring Monty Bear, her huge stuffed bear she won at a
carnival.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I realized Colleen was watching from the other side of the train, so I rotated
the hanger so it was pointing right at her forehead so she wouldn't be able to read the note.  She
laughed and crossed her eyes, pretending that would give her enough angle to read it.  Then I
realized we were at Motosumiyoshi, so I got off the train, leaving the coat hanger note with
Colleen.</p>
