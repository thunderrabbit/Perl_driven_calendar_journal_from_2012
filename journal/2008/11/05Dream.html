<p>I remember waking up from a dream with two insights about my character, and thinking, &quot;I
should write this down!  Wooohoo zzzzzz&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">in Michael's apartment, but Michael wasn't supposed to be there.  Another guy came
in and I was like, &quot;yo!  get out!&quot; but he said, &quot;no, I live here,&quot; and I was
like, &quot;aight,&quot; and then he told me two things that were really insightful about me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and</p>
</li>

<li><p></p></li>
</ol>
