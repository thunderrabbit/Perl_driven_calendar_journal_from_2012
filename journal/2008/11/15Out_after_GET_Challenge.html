<p>Neither Tony nor Ozaco joined, but Pania, Natalie, Steve, and I went to HUB and joined 4 of the
GET students there for drinks after the day.  I chatted mostly with Steve, the bulk of my speaking
time spent on Francois begat U-Cow story.  Natalie and I agreed we miss Francois.</p>

<p>After a couple of drinks (6pm to 7pm) the students left, and we remaining teachers (minus J who
went to change clothes) headed to Shinjuku to meet more peeps and continue our festivities.  Met up
with Sarah, plus Kencan (sp) and Bruce (sp), and then headed to a bar called アルプス (Alps) which
features 生ビール for 100 yen each.</p>

<p>I'd describe アルプス as a Japanese Pink Cow.  It was quite laid back, quite loud, and conducive
to people mingling, which I basically *never* see in Tokyo except at Pink Cow (disclaimer: I don't
go out all that much, so my experience is limited).</p>

<p>I got to sit by Nat and across from Sarah at first.  Tried for a bit to guess Sarah's home state
from her accent, and came up with Illinois, but Kansas is correct.  She's been to World's of
Fun.</p>

<p>Throwing U-Cow around a bit, I woulda gotten some pictures, buy my camera battery had died.
Arif (sp) came in and introduced U-Cow to the table behind him; I barraged gracefully walking on
benches to get over to where Arif was doing the introduction.  Got a picture with the table, and
then apologized to the young woman I had bumped, asking if she or her friends would like to get a
picture with U-Cow.  No they would not.

<p>Fair enough.  I said また、おじゃまします。 as I climbed back to my seat.</p>

<p>Jen and Taka arrived; Jen wasn't feeling super great, though we had a nice chat.  Told her I'm
reiki level 3 and about to start shiatsu classes.  Told Taka the same story a bit later, and then
explained a bit about what reiki.</p>

<p>Chat chow; chow chat; cow chat; good fun.  Chat with Nat about politics a bit.  I need to send
her a link to Head of Skate.</p>

<p>(writing the next morning)</p>

<p>I hugged on Nat a lot cause I hadn't seen her in a while.  We pinky-promised to meet up soon.  I
tried to use my left pinky at first, but that didn't quite work..  Although it was better than I
expected!</p>

<p>I left after a bit (as you do), and this time ended up getting starry looks from the group whom
I had bumped while climbing out and back into my seat.  This time they were okay with getting pics
with U-cow.  Perhaps because we had been tossing him around for pics with various peeps.</p>
