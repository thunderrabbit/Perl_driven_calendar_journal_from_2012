HI Amber!

My name is Rob; I sailed on PB's 49th and 52nd voyages, and have a Google News search query for
related terms, so I saw an article about your upcoming voyage as web reporter!

I decided to stalk, ahem, er, find you online, and success! Here I am, writing you this note.

But that's not why I'm writing. ;-) I'm writing to ask if you'd be so kind as to put me on your
outgoing emails list, if in fact you have one. I sent &quot;Rob Updates&quot; during my voyages (and
subsequent travels) (*), and enjoy staying in touch with the lovely PB life, if only
electronically. (**)

(**) I'll be at the GET Challenge in mid November, physically, not electronically. Woohoo!

Have a great day!

- Rob!
