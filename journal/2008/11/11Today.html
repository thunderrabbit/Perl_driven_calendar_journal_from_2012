<p>Ummmmm</p>

<p>Malek stayed up all night programming on something related to our imminent project (for which I
joined the company to code).  Though this didn't affect me, I note with some interest that I felt
slightly more productive near the end of my day today than near the beginning.  Perhaps it takes our
brains that long to warm up to coding.</p>

<p>Andrew and I chowed at すき店 (I think that's the kanji) and then went to ドンキホーテ to look
for pipe cleaners.  They didn't have 'em, but they did have cokes and ice cream.  Good brain
food.</p>

<p>Saw a hemp clothing / Reggae music / smoking accessory shop so I stepped in there.  They had pipe
cleaners for 210 yen for a pack.  Not only that, but the fragrance in the store was quite nice.  Not
only that, the smile on the clerk was stellar.  I practically wanted to get her digits just to have
her smile to me.</p>

<p>I told Andrew about her, and he goes, &quot;and she was thinking, '<em>I</em> know what you're
going to do with those pipe cleaners.' ... No, no you don't.&quot;</p>

<p>With these pipe cleaners, I plan to fashion little worker-people to put together my marble track
in a stop-action time-lapse video.  The project may be too big (long) for me to do (well) by
myself, but I plan to start.  Just as soon as I have some free time.</p>

<p>Dude asked me today if I could help him put together a website for a business idea he has.</p>

<p>Kevin asked me (again) yesterday if I could help him put together a website for his business.</p>

<p>In both cases, they are offering to pay.  Dude wants to take a bit of time, and Kevin would like
to get his done within 3 weeks so he can give the URL to peeps he meets in Italy.</p>

<p>Kevin's should be technically easier, but Dude knows a lot about <em>how</em> to build websites
so he knows what information he needs, and he's already got a web host.</p>

<p>Met Jesse for a burrito-kebab from Ayse, my new favorite restaurant in Shibuya.  I asked him if
he brought his hackey sack so we could play like old times.  We joked about playing outside in the
crowd, which would be really funny considering how much fun we have while playing so obnoxiously
badly.</p>

<p>He got a free burrito-kebab with his point card, so we split the cost for the other.  300 yen each.</p>

<p>Chattin' chewed upstairs, talking about his family, Ami's departed mom, internet and the relative
value of expensive hardware.</p>

<p>Walked him back toward Gaba where he bought me some nothing-juice (*) and took a picture of me
with ZARA.</p>

<p>But the best news was yet to come: Jesse has made over 1000 x 0 yen for 1000+ tickets ordered
through his ticket reservation system.  I'm glad it's working so well for him.</p>

<p>(*) (In Japanese, なし, the pronunciation of the word for &quot;pear,&quot; is the same
pronunciation as the word for &quot;nothing.&quot;)</p>

<p>Went back to work and got some good coding done for an hour.</p>
