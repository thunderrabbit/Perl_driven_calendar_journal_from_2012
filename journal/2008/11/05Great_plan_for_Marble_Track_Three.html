<p>While in the shower, I came up with a great plan for time-lapse photographing the construction of
MT3.</p>

<p>Basically my plan was to show the construction as the pieces magically appear in place, one by
one.  Then I was thinking the pieces could climb themselves into place.  And <em>then</em> I
thought of having little pipe cleaner characters move the pieces into place.  Perfect!</p>

<p>And, because the base is so heavy, I figure they wouldn't be able to raise it, so I'll give a
cameo appearance to Rabby, my 35 year old stuffed rabbit which has somehow lasted all this time.
Being much bigger than little pipe cleaner characters, he'll be able to heft the large base into
place.</p>

<p>Because I have OS X 10.5 on my other computer, its Automator has more functionality, *and* it
has photo import software that works directly with my camera.  And, and, it's got a lot more space
on the HD than this computer.  I'm thinking, therefore, that I'll be compiling the photos into a
movie on my other computer.</p>

<p>I need to name my computers.  I guess descriptive names would be fine.  This one can be White
MacBook, and the other can be Titanium Powerbook.</p>
