<p class="dream">On a large ice berg, with some large ice bergs around it, and land on one side, with PB
people, we were trying to get everyone back to land, but my roommate Shawn wanted to go to the next
ice berg.  We were yelling to him to get him to come back, but he was already in the water, nearly
to the other ice berg.  I  wanted to send someone after hm, but couldn't, so we just continued to
yell and pleaad with him to come this way.  Then he wanted to goto the *next* ice berg, and we were
like, &quot;doooood it's farther away than you think!&quot; but he headed over to it as well.</p>

<p class="dream">Then a small boat came our direction and I tried to stabilize it when it got to
us, but just then a big wave capsized the boat; basically a big flat canoe, and  we were in the
water around the ice ber trying to get the canoe back upright.</p>
