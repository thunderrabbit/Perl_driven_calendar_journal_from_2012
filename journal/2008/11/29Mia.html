<p>Helping Èþ°¡ (Mia) move today.</p>

<p class="date">5:42pm JST Saturday 29 November 2008 (day 14129)</p>

<p>Nice time helping Èþ°¡; the work was pretty easy, strictly speaking, and she bought lunch for me
and Izumi, plus I got to chat with Èþ°¡ and the bonus of hearing more of her story which I hadn't
previously heard, made possible by crowds and traffic on the way to µÈ¾Í»û station.</p>

<p>Èþ°¡'s new apartment is smaller than her previous one, which was smaller than her previous house
from which she moved 9 months ago.  She offered to have me and °¡Èþ over for dinner some time after
she gets unpacked.  (It may take a bit, because she'll be moving during this whole week; today was
just the first five loads or so of boxes.)</p>

<p>Tenko arrived as I was finishing unloading the fifth load.  She looked cute as always.
Interesting to see them chatting together; Èþ°¡ has known Tenko for 15 years, and Izumi for 13
years.</p>
