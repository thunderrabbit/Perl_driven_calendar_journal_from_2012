<p>Late day at work; our official stop hour is 8pm, but that's gotten a bit lax.  I've gotten to a
point that I had hoped I might get to more quickly, but I have solved the issue to the point that
now the next part is stuff I've solved already.</p>

<p>For the record, <a href="http://mootools.net/">mootools</a> rules.</p>

<p>Formatted for clarity:</p>

<pre>
$$('.select_id').addEvent('change', function() 
  { 
     this.getParent().getNext('.inject_select').set('text',
     'Now we need to do a JSON call and HTML inject the select items that correspond to id '
     + this.getSelected().get('value'));
  });
</pre>

<p>For another record, Andrew is pretty smart.</p>
