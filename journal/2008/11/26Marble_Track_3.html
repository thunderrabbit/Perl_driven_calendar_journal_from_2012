<p>Worked a tiny bit on Marble Track 3 today.  Basically getting ready to get started taking pics of
the construction in progress, to make a stop action movie of the whole thing.  I've got a crazy
tripod custom built for my camera (for which I just bought a new battery and charged for 24 hours
until last night), and just about got the tripod base connected to where the marble track base will
be.  The need to be connected so the movie looks right.  But the thing is, once I start actually
making the marble track base's base, I need to be making the movie.  So here's a shot of the making
of the making of <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Art:Marble_Track_Three">Marble Track 3</a>.</p>
