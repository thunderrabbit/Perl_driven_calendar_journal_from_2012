<p>Finally got to see Ami! (last night as I write this)</p>

<p>We had a Talk, cause I had gone out with Keiko, and gave her a peck at the end.  Told Ami it
woulda been much more than a peck (<em>ass</em>uming Keiko was down) had I not had Ami.</p>

<p>Ami couldn't see how the idea of smooching another girl would have crossed my mind at all
considering that Ami's mommy was dying, etc.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;well, we're different people.&quot;</p>

<p>Subsequently explained my belief that Ami does not *need* me, in particular.  She, as all humans
do, needs love, and sometimes having humans help us connect to love is nice.  But doesn't have to
be specific humans.</p>
