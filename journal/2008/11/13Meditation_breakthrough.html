<p>Note: by breakthrough in meditation, I mean a slightly greater awareness of something subtle.</p>

<p>I think I mentioned a few days ago that I noticed that when I began to &quot;see&quot; dream
images in my brain, that corresponded with when I would &quot;forget&quot; that I was supposed to
be in meditation.</p>

<p>Today I had some dream visuals that started when I forgot I was in meditation, and persisted for
a moment when I remembered I was in meditation.  They were quite fleeting.</p>

<p>Also, just as I began to play with this seeing visuals *and* remembering I was in meditation, my
20 minute timer went off.   Hmmmm!  I could have enjoyed a bit longer meditation.</p>
