<p class="dream">My visa status was incorrect, so I stamped a new stamp in my passport to fix it,
but realized it didn't have all the same markings as an official stamp, so I wondered if it would
work, or get me into worse trouble.  Then I decided to scribble it out, but thought that might make
things even worse worse, so I did nothing.</p>
