<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Haven't meditated in the past two days, but I intend to pick up the practice on Monday.
Well, actually I sorta meditated on the train on Friday (or was it Thursday?) and today, but
haven't really spent the time at home as &quot;usual&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Nor have I done neti in as many days.</p></li>

<li><p>Nor reiki.</p></li>

<li><p>But I have been reading <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em>
by <a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/">Elizabeth Gilbert</a>, and am thoroughly enjoying the
experience.  I literally cried for some minutes after reading a section (I know I wrote a version of this
this morning, but now I am sitting instead of crouching):</p>

<pre>
&quot;Instead of trying to forcefully take thoughts out of your mind, give your mind something
better to play with.  Something healthier ... like pure divine love.&quot;
</pre>

<p>Oh <em>snap</em>!  I haven't been doing that.</p>
</li>

<li><p>This book was given/loaned to me by Travis, after he loaned it to his friend whose name I
know if I hear it, but don't know if I could spell it if I could remember it.  I'd like to register
it with <a href="http://bookcrossing.com/">bookcrossing</a>, but want to give him the option of
doing it since he read it before me.</p></li>

<li><p>Fred is coming to town for something like three weeks, from 25th or 26th of December to 13th
of January!  I'm really looking forward to seeing him during the time that I don't have to
work.</p></li>

<li><p>I've started work on stop-action filming the making
of <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Art:Marble_Track_Three">Marble Track Three</a>.  So far, I've got
the base in place, the first four sticks (those that literally are glued to the &quot;studio&quot;
floor (made of the blue cloth tarp that Sara Farina (she'll always be Sara Farina to me) bought for
me on a whim as the background, covering my (Sakura House's) chest of drawers and two walls) which
will hold the base) (*) were magicked into place by a pipe cleaner guy, but then he was unable to
move into place the base, so it was brought in by Rabby.</p>

<p>(*) sorry for confusing parenthesis</p>
</li>

<li><p>I'm &quot;supposed&quot; to be working on a video game for Tariq (and me?) which will
hopefully get us started so we can hire some guys and all this stuff.  I'm sorta just not seeing it
happening.</p></li>

<li><p>I have essentially been given notice at work.  I'll be able to work there during December,
but then it's time for me to look for a new job.  The timing is quite lovely; I will be going to a
drug trial in Kagoshima on 13 January, but even more importantly, it will mean <em>I don't have to
work</em> while Fred is in town!</p>

<p>Malek specifically said it's going against the plan he made with me, and is *not* because I'm a
slow programmer, but they are putting on hold the first project I was working on until perhaps March
(at the earliest). I'm pretty sure I can finish the billing project before the year is out.  But
it's only three weeks!  If I work from home as well, I can likely do it, but so far, I don't have
access to the server from my crib.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in a Sakura House apartment, and there've been a few changes since I wrote about my
co-residents.  Fatima, who was in 101, just left today, after being with us a year.  Over a month
ago, Curry moved out after hardly living in Juergen's old room, and Ulrike has been in Natalia's
room for three months now.</p>

<p>Across the hall from me is Karen, who has lived there longer than I have live in my room (203).</p>
</li>

<li><p>It would be really nice if I knew fo sho that I'd be getting the $9000; that way I could
blow a bit of it with Fred, traveling around to different cities and the like.  Man, having this
bonus time with him is just fantastic; we can do anything!</p></li>

<li><p>I've been a bit busy on Friends For Sale on Facebook, both as myself and as Francois.
Francois's FFS persona has a thing for women with mega-sized breasts.  The story goes that he likes
to bounce on them, so writes &quot;boing boing boing!&quot; as the nicknames for those pets.</p>

<p>Reality probably includes some not-so-repressed part of me playing the part for Francois, who's
become quite popular on FFS, btw.</p>

<p>His current favorites are Trang and Erin Cahill, both with normal sized breasts.</p></li>

<li><p>Hmmm, speaking of my various personalities, I haven't really given much thought to them
after toying with the idea a bit after one of my ISIS sessions with Helma.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently got an email from Helma, basically saying that she wasn't coming back to Japan.  I
wonder if that means for the foreseeable future, or if it's more like さよなら.</p></li>

<li><p>I admire her ability to live life freely, choosing spiritual pursuits over earthly matters,
but I also have a belief that earth matters, as well as the people on it.  I've got some
relationships here in Japan now, and am loathe to abruptly cut them off.</p></li>

<li><p>Most frequently dialed numbers recently (in order of when I called them, and then the number
of calls &quot;recently&quot;):</p>
