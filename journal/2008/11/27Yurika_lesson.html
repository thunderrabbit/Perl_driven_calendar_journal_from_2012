<p>Interesting questions came up in lesson with Yurika today.  The one I remember can basically be
summarized with a Google query: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=into+vs+"in+to"">into vs
&quot;in to&quot;</a>.  She was able to explain the different meanings of</p>

<ol>
<li><p>walk to the store</p></li>

<li><p>walk into the store</p></li>

<li><p>walk in the store</p></li>
</ol>

<p>and that helped, but didn't solve this.  Why don't the <del>deleted lines</del> sound right to
me?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>moved in to the apartment building</p></li>

<li><p><del>moved into the apartment building</del> (*)</p></li>

<li><p>moved to the apartment building</p></li>

<li><p>moved into the neighborhood</p></li>

<li><p><del>moved in to the neighborhood</del></p></li>

<li><p>moved to the neighborhood</p></li>

<li><p>moved in next door</p></li>

<li><p><del>moved in to next door</del></p></li>

<li><p><del>moved into next door</del></p></li>

<li><p><del>moved to next door</del></p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) this one sounds fine if we're talking about crashing, not changing domiciles</p>
