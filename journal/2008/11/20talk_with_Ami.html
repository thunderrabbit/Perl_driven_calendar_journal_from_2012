<p>Well that was interesting.</p>

<p>Ami called me, and I called her back all fine and dandy, but I immeditately started being pissy
toward her, and then apologetic about it cause there was no reason to be pissy and I just wanted her
to understand that I had a bad day, though I really didn't; I just want her to understand me at
all.</p>

<p>Then she was like, &quot;hey yo I was thinkin': you say you want me to change and stop watching
TV and stop drinking and start meditating.  Well I want you to stop chasing other women.&quot;</p>

<p>And I was like, &quot;yo; I want that too, but it's apparently impossible.  I've wanted that
shit for 15 or 20 years, but I can't seem to stay with just one woman.  I could get connected with
Angelina Jolie and still probably be lookin' after not too long.&quot;</p>

<p>And I thought we were going to break up right there on the phone, and I was fine with that.</p>

<p>Then I was like, &quot;see the thing is, I like your smile, and I like your cooking, and I like
your h, and &quot; I mentioned several things I like, &quot;but I don't like when you sabotage
yourself, saying you can't do stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>Like when I say I can't stay faithful.  fuck.  this isn't working out at all!</p>

<p>And then a bit later Ami was like, &quot;we haven't really been able to do stuff together recently,&quot;</p>

<p>And I just started crying and crying.  I didn't even see it coming; I didn't even know it was in
there!  Just bawling.  Finally, &quot;Ami; I miss you so much.&quot;  more tears tears crying blah
blah blah and &quot;when you were taking care of your mom I tried so hard to give you space and it
was so hard; I tried so hard to be faithful to you, and I was largely successful.&quot;  I didn't
say all that, but I wanted to.  (I was busy crying.)</p>

<p>And we decided to go hiking together with Travis on 30 November (strictly speaking, I was
already set to go; I just hadn't invited Ami, partially (ironically) because Tamara is going, and I
wanted a chance to talk to her about my relationship with Ami).</p>

<p>And I asked if she would come to ultimate with me.  More crying.  &quot;Why did we stop going to
ultimate?&quot;  But what I really wanted to ask was 'why did *you* stop going to ultimate?'  but I
didn't, because I don't know whose idea it was to stop.</p>

<p>But I do know that people would ask me &quot;where's Ami?&quot; each time I went without her,
and I just realized that was one of the reasons I stopped going.  More tears.  Very interesting.</p>
