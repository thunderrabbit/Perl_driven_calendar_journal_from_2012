<p>I ate a sandwich (thereby cleaning up the remaining two slices of bread and accompanying bag
from my floor) and fell asleep.</p>

<p class="dream">I noticed the DJs on the radio were trying to get th caller to correctly pronounce
&quot;linux&quot; and he was like, &quot;lie-nux&quot;, &quot;linus&quot;, and they were like,
&quot;um, we should just give it to him anyway...  Okay, caller, just say 'Have a great day!'&quot;
but the caller wouldn't even respond to that, so I was like, &quot;I'ma call them right now and
actually give them some answers!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I turned to my desk and was trying to remember the phone number of the station, and
trying to remember what station it was.  I picked up the phone and a voice said, &quot;HI!&quot;
before I dialed any digits.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;hello?&quot; and I heard in the background, &quot;station
Melchisedek&quot; or at least I thought I did, so I was like, &quot;um, hello, how are you?&quot; and
getting interesting tingles in my body to think about how this could have possibly happened.  A man
on the other end of the line picked up and said, &quot;hello?&quot;, and I was like, &quot;what
station is this?&quot; and he said, &quot;you don't want to know; I can't tell you.&quot;  I was
like, &quot;if I can tell *you*, will you let me know if I'm right?&quot; and before he could
answer, &quot;is it station Melchisedek?&quot; and he visibly relaxed and said, &quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I visibly un-relaxed and got even more tingly excited, wanting to keep the
connection, but not sure how.  I said, &quot;wow; it's really interesting how this happened because
I was going to call a radio station, and when I picked up the phone I was connected to you,
litereally before I dialed any numbers.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The man to whom I was speaking didn't really comment, so I just enjoyed the
connection for a bit until I woke up.</p>

<p>Oh!  That's how it happened!</p>
