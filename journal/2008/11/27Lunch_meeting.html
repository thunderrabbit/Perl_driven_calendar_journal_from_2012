<p>When I arrived at work today, Malek asked if I had plans for lunch (no), and therefore if we
could go out to lunch (yes), which means basically we're going to Talk, though I don't know the
details yet.</p>

<p>I'm glad though: I'm guessing it will either confirm that I can get out of here and start lookin' for better
paying work, or that I'ma start getting paid more.</p>

<p>But now that I think about it, seems like bad news would warrant taking me out to lunch, whereas
good news could just be presented straigtaway.</p>

<p>Then Malek promptly headed home to nap cause he &quot;isn't feeling too good.&quot;  He wasn't
feeling too good yesterday, either.</p>

<p class="date">12:41pm JST</p>

<p>Okay; Malek has awakened; we're about to head out.</p>
