<p>I just put a little green label on a 1/8th inch stereo extension cable Sho loaned me.  I made
sure it's pretty permanent, <em>and</em> it can be taken off without any affect to the cable.  (no
latent stickiness, netc.)  (netcetera is the way to ext<em>end</em> a list of negatives.)</p>

<p>I'm just writing about this because, while I wrote the month and year on the label, I didn't
write the date.</p>
