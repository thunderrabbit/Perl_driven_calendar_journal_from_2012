<p>(two) I found a Vie de France in 新鮮 station.  I got a few items and went to the counter.
Braces on her smile.  Subtle ones, like clear plastic.  But I saw them and they still make me giddy
(and have ever since I got a crush on the character Sam in some TV show way back in the day).</p>

<p>I was like, 「この店はポイントカードがありますか？」</p>

<p>「そうでございます。」</p>

<p>「それいただけますか？」</p>

<p>「しょっしょ待って下さい。」</p>

<p>Day one: 7 points.</p>
