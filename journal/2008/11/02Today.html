<p>I've definitely officially started on preparation for filming the construction of Marble Track 3.
I've been making a wooden cradle thing for my camera so I can take it with me during the day and
take pictures with it at home.  Only problem is with the focus mechanism; it doesn't seem happy to
focus multiple times in a row on close-up stuff, such as, for example, my marble track.</p>

<p>SO, I might have to get a new camera for this operation.  Anyone have a hand-me-down digital
camera?  I don't need huge high definition.  Just focus.  There's a 20 percent chance I'll try to
take this camera apart to clean it, though that didn't help when Hitomi's camera had the same
problem.  I took that happy snapper apart down to the bare cogs and everything looked clean and
fine to me.  Put it back together and it only worked as well as it had before I took it apart.</p>

<p>What's causing this rubbish focus?</p>

<p>Since when did I start saying &quot;rubbish?&quot;</p>

<p>Today's the day I chowed lunch at the kaiten sushi shop near my house.  Little sushi plates pass
by each seat on a little conveyor belt.  Quite a nice lazy way to eat.  I mostly got salmon (salmon)
and a couple of maguro (tuna).</p>
