<p class="dream">Preparing for a trip with peeps from ultimate, I was in charge of having a place
available for everyone to stay.</p>

<p class="dream">Taking a shower, I sealed the dreain in the bath tub so all the water would stay
in and keep my feet warm.  I hadn't brought shampoo with me, so I searched around in the shower
area and found some sort of gel that was supposed to be good for moisturizing skin.  I had never
used it before, but I recognized the brand name and blue jar and white translucent jelly lookin'
stuff inside.  Someone had used a bobby pin to scoop some of the gel out, and the thin but deep groove was
still intact in the jelly. I scooped out a similar volume with my finger, being careful not to cause
the carved groove to collapse.</p>

<p class="dream">I washed my face with the jelly and noted it was alcohol based, not exactly
conduscive to moisturize skin, I thought, but I was just careful to keep my eyes closed.</p>

<p class="dream">It was time to go, and I headed out of the apartment and off the fifth floor
balcony down to the parking lot below.  The lot looked a lot like a parking lot for a shopping
mall, bustling with activity and shopping carts.  I headed down the hill (the entire landscape was
sloping down toward the right) toward what I hoped was the right direction.</p>

<p class="dream">Another guy called me back as he was coming out. I had thought I was the last one,
so I went back to make sure he was okay, but then some people from the mall area were asking him
about the location of a store, and he went toward the left out of the balcony.  I had trouble
seeing him for all the cars and posts in the way as I was down in the parking lot, but I sent him a
mental message to come toward the right when he was finished.</p>
