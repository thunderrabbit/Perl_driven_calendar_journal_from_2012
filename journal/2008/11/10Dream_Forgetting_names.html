<p class="dream">Arrived at a partyand a woman was like, &quot;do you remember my name?&quot;  and
I immediately said, &quot;Ebe!&quot; and she was like, &quot;nooo!&quot; so I go, &quot;Yuki!
Yoko!  Miki!&quot; and she was like, &quot;it's Yuko....&quot; so I was like, &quot;Yuko!&quot; but
she was unimpressed.</p>

<p class="dream">A bit later, another girl was like, &quot;do you remember my name?&quot; and I go,
&quot;Yoko!  Miki!  Yuko! Yuki!&quot; and she's like, &quot;It's Ebe.&quot; and I was like, &quot;I
said Ebe first a while ago for Yuko, [if that counts for anything],&quot; but it didn't.</p>

<p class="dream">There was some discussion about why who remembers what names, and I told my
version.  I was like,</p>

<ol>
<li><p class="dream">&quot;First, I'm a visual learner.  If I just hear someone's name, I'm very likely
to forget it in two seconds unless I visually spell it in my mind, or carefully learn the kanji.</p></li>

<li><p class="dream">&quot;Second, when I talk to people, I'm shy, and I don't look at their face.
I'm like, &quot;this spot on the ground looks pretty good; I'll just look at it.&quot; And this is
even more pronounced with Japanese culture.  We're not supposed to make eye contact.  If she's an
おばさん, then I look so far away that I'm like, this,&quot; and turned my head to look the opposite
direction, &quot;oh hello, nice to meet you!&quot; as I waved in the direction of my invisible
granny.  The girls laughed, so I knew they could relate.</p></li>

<li><p class="dream">&quot;Third, and this is part of Japanese culture, Japanese don't tend to
individualize themselves.  When every guy has short spikey hair, and every woman has shoulder length
dyed brown hair, and everyone is like, &quot;I'm an office worker,&quot; and, &quot;I like sleeping
in my free time,&quot; how am I to make a file in my brain?  &quot;I'll just file this one in
'expensive hair tired worker,' It's not helpful when everyone is in the same file!&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="dream">I wondered about taking pictures of everyone, and really trying to make an effort
at remembering names.  When I was first advising in YRUU, I would spend hours poring over the
mugbooks, carefully remembering all the youths' names.  I could usually end up remembering most of the major
cities / churches, and some addresses.</p>

<p class="dream">Perhaps U-cow's site could be useful in this regard.</p>
