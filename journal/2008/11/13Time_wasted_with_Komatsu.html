<p>I <em>finally</em> got him to understand that there are no correction marks on the first few
pages of his workbook, not because I didn't check them, but because there were no mistakes.  He
watched me as I checked it again and wrote OK next to each question for two UNITS (4 pages) until he
caught on.</p>

<p>Then he asked me about five times respectively if I had already checked the entire book after I
told him five times I had checked the entire book.</p>

<p><em>Now</em>, though I'm 99.9% useless in here, I don't have to push the Pause button of the CD
player while he answers the questions uttered by the CD.  &quot;What's your last name?&quot;
&quot;Are you a student?&quot;  (UNIT 1); &quot;Where would you like to work?&quot;  &quot;How long
will you work here?&quot; (UNIT 2).</p>

<p>He's &quot;done&quot; the homework for those sections, and he went over the answers with me as I
checked them, so now he's able to answer all the questions without me having to press Pause between
each one.</p>

<p>That's the good news.</p>

<p>The bad news:  I don't have to press Pause because he presses it instead.</p>
