<p>mootools rules.</p>

<p>With that handy javascripter, I was able to set up an AJAX request to read plan ids, names, and
prices (per month or year) based on the client's product ID.  The request comes back and I append a
&lt;select&gt; into a &lt;td&gt; and then when that select is changed, OR if the duration is
changed (to month or year), those two field values together determine the price of the plan for the
client.  Sweet-o.</p>
