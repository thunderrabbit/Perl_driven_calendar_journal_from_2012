<p class="dream">Climbing up a trail with janette's quilt as my only item, there are pine trees
around, but a clearing in which the trail is climbing up the hill.  The trail is drit while the
grass around is nice and green.  There are curious animals who watch e climbing.  I walk up for a
ways, wondering why I don't have any stuff.  Have I left something down below?  I don't want to go
down and look for it</p>

<p class="dream">I'm in a bunk bed inside a cabin, with a guy from KTRU zonked out next to me.  Two
female DJs come in and it's determined that he should sleep on top of me.  I know we know we're all
best buds and nothing we do will change that, so I say something like, &quot;come here,&quot; with
arms open wide, and he lies on top of me in my arms and we're careful not to have our faces close
together, but I can feel his junk
on my knee, so I'm a bit creeped out by that, and move my face a bit further away, making sure I
can get fresh air, and not wanting to contaminate his air with mine.</p>

<p class="dream">Station manager Meg comes in as we are all four puppy piled on top of each other
(with me on the bottom) and she comes in just as we've gotten ourselves arranged.  She's just about
to shout, &quot;to attenTION!&quot; and a couple of us open one eye as if to say, &quot;you're not
going to make us climb out of our comfy puppy pile, are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Watching a video starring the GET teachers from my voyage:</p>

<p class="dream">Kris faces Angie who asks &quot;did you cut my hair?&quot; and Kris goes, &quot;and
I dyed it purple.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Then Natalie faces Kris who is like, &quot;did you cut my hair?&quot;  and Natalie
is like, &quot;and I died it purple,&quot; but in a different way than above.</p>

<p class="dream">This continues for a bit, and I wonder why I don't remember making this video
until I notice some teachers who were *not* on my voyage.  I realize this must be from their
previous voyage (47th).</p>

<p class="dream">The video continues with a presentation from dancers right out of flying carpet
Arabia.  One scene of their dance featured a guy with a long curving sword, with a spiral end.  He
whirled it around his arms for a second and then ritually cut a broomstick into three pieces, but
did it so quickly and precisely that the stick didn't fall even though it was only being held by the
ends.</p>
