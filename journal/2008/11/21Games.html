<p>Chillin' in ¸µ½»µÈ station at the moment, waiting for the ÆüÈæÃ« line train to leave
so the train to ½ÂÃ« can arrive.</p>

<p class="date">10:10am JST</p>

<p>It's leaving; don't worry.</p>

<p>On the way down the stairs from the new, improved, Motosumiyoshi station, I decided to go down
three steps per step.  I usually go *up* three steps at a time, but down just one step at a
time. Why?</p>

<p>So I went down three steps at at time.  I held the hand rail to make sure I didn't clip my ankle
(perhaps *that's* why!), but generally speaking, no worries required.  However, when I got to the
landing, which I had to skip <em>as well as</em> the *next* step below it, I made durn tootin' sure
to hold the hand rail as I leap[t|ed] five or so feet total.  Landing required the use of both feet,
which hadn't previously been sharing steps, but they didn't mind, and my ankles remained
undamaged.</p>

<p>Then, as the Hibiya line train was slowly (!) arriving, I thought it would be pretty funny to
act as the ground crew for an airplane, telling the pilot/driver to keep coming, coming, coming,
slowowww, stop!</p>

<p>I didn't do it, though; if I'm going to be that silly, I should make sure to put a video online.
But when the doors opened, I got the genius idea of walking in one door, and out the next, in the
next-next door, and out the -next, all the way down the train until I got to the seats on the far
end of the platform.  There, I was able to start this entry, <em>and</em> ensure I got a seat to
continue this entry.  The auspicious gap between &quot;worries&quot; and &quot;required&quot; above
took more time than most gaps in this entry.</p>

<p>Oh!  And on the way to the station, while enjoying the bright sun and blue sky, I saw a jet
flying by, and remembered conspiracy theories about the con trails (there wasn't one visible behind
this particular jet) *and* the classic conspiracy about chemicals in our water causing rainbows at
ground level!!!</p>

<p>I thought Jesse and I should make a similar video, confirming that the same chemicals, notably
dihydrogen-oxide, are in our tap water in Japan, causing the same rainbow effect!  Perhaps (if it
hasn't been done already) we can start a string of such videos to confirm the conspiracy...</p>

<p>I wonder if I can find that vid without a connection to the web.</p>

<p>Meh; not worth my time.  If I forget to post it, let me know.</p>
