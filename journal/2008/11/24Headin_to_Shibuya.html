<p>Ami and I are going to Shibuya for a bit of shopping.  I wanna get a battery for my camera (hope
it costs less than 4000 yen) and Ami plans to buy a book for Noah, whose first birthday party will
be today.  Noah's parents, Mahk (*) and Yoko (*), are friends of Ami's.</p>

<p>(*) &quot;Is that Mac like Mac, or Mahk like you can't say R?&quot;  &quot;Mahk like I can't say
R.&quot;</p>

<p>(*) Actually 洋子 (ようこ), which would be literally transliterated as Youko, but is pronounced
Yo-ko with a long vowel on the first o, yo.</p>
