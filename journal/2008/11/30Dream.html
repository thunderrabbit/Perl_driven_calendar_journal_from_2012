<p class="dream">Testing and debugging Travis' software, which could display information about
people's personalities.</p>

<p class="dream">I happened to sit by a woman who I had met, but who didn't remember I worked at
77hz.  She called someone and started talking about sbstrm, wanting to create an equivalent system,
completely stealing our idea.  She goes, &quot;sbstrm has 15, 9, 0, and 9 bits of data, so how much
would it take to do that?&quot;  and the guy with whom she was speaking was defending the sbstrm
system, saying, &quot;well (not only do your &quot;specs&quot; mean <b>nothing</b>) there's a lot of
information that we cannot get about sbstrm, like all their clients and information about them in a
massive database.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The woman still thought she could build a better system, and kept trying to find
ways to do it.</p>

<p class="dream">Jesse and I were on a tree stump, enjoying an earthquake as I was hanging from a
gymnastics ring hanging from the trees above us.  I pulled the ring all the way to the ground to
connect it with the earthquake and see if I could detect the earthquake before it happened.  I noted
some fiber optic cables in the ground that were designed to do the same thing, as I was periodically
interrupted by Jesse exclaiming alternate joy and anger when unveiling his new toy, some sort of
vehicle or tent with a little (little!) scooter attached to the back.  He got the scooter out,
&quot;woohoo!&quot; and knocked over some tools, &quot;God dammit!&quot; and I was like,
&quot;Jesse!  You shouldn't say that, as a self-professed Christian,&quot; and he agreed, but said
he had trouble at times.</p>

<p class="dream">We were looking for a way to attach his tool kit to the tent so it wouldn't fall,
and I could see he needed to use a screw, but which screw would attach well to one layer of
cardboard?  I looked at pictures of the various screws he had, most of which  looked like screws
wrapped around other screws, twisted like pipe cleaners, and I told him those would just rip a huge
hole in the cardboard, so he should use these instead, and went on to explain that the screws
wrapped around screws were good for screwing into wood, as it would regrow around them and lock
into place.  I wasn't sure if my logic was correct in this case, thinking to myself, 'but isn't
wood 'dead'?' but answering, 'not as dead as cardboard!' and certainly agreeing with myself.</p>

<p class="dream">A shinkansen went by and we were like, &quot;yeah!&quot; but it was only two cars,
so not as impressive as it could have been.  A woman from his church came up to me all smoochy
like, &quot;hi Rob!&quot; and kissing me on the cheeks a bit too closely for comfort, and I just
said HI, but didn't really respond back because I couldn't tell if she was like that with everyone
or if I should remember her from somewhere.  I went into the caravan where Jesse was standing with
his friends and I go, &quot;hmmm mmm???&quot; meaning 'who's she?' but not wanting anyone else to
understand.  Jesse goes, &quot;oh, that's Cortrina,&quot; as if that explained everything without
giving anything away to others who might know who she is.</p>

<p class="dream">I realized I had left my keys at the camp, and was talking again to the woman who
was trying to steal sbstrm, but this time on the phone.  She and I had been quiet for a bit, so when
I arrived back at the YRUU camp, my brain was like, &quot;I'm home!&quot; and hung up the phone, but
then immediately called her back cause I was like, &quot;oh yeah, we had been 'talking'&quot; and
the guy who answered was like, &quot;good thing you called back, because her computer just died, and
that's the only place she has your phone number..&quot; &quot;oh yeah, good thing, then,&quot; I
agreed.  I sat down outside at a picnic table with my YRUU mates and then Samuel L Jackson drove up
in his car, looked over at me, then turned off the car and put my keys down in front of me, started
the car again with different keys and drove away.</p>

<p class="dream">My keys!</p>
