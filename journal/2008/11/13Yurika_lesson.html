<p>Stopped by McD's for a 100 yen vanilla shake, slurped it down and then went up to find Yurika in
line at the cafe.  I almost thought she wasn't herself because I haven't seen her hair this way, nor
such bright and brightly speckled hose.</p>

<p>She's finishing up her homework while I write.  &quot;Take your time.&quot;</p>
