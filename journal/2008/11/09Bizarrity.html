<p class="date">8:06am JST Sunday  9 November 2008 (day 14109)</p>

<p>Aight, the most bizarre changes have occurred in my brain, I suspect, or maybe I'm suddenly
forgetful, or something else altogether.</p>

<p>Three weird things happened in the past few days, </p>

<ol>
<li><p>PasMo card in the wrong location in my wallet</p></li>

<li><p>can't remember right now the second thing I was going to write</p></li>

<li><p>Kept falling asleep during reiki charging, not remembering if I had done all the steps or
feel asleep during the middle of them</p></li>

<li><p>woke up with my alarm  which I had &quot;obviously&quot; set yesterday to be too late to wake
up today (cause  it was set *after my yesterday wakeup time to do my reiki charging)</p></li>

&#14;
</ol>


<p>I actually thought this morning that my phone alarm had misfired <em>too early</em> when I
looked at the time.  I was like, &quot;that's cool&quot; because it gave me time to do my reiki
charging, which I did, but then when I looked at the clock after doing those, I suddenly realized
&quot;shizah!  I have to be on the train in 9 minutes!&quot;</p>

<p>I leaped up, put on my contacts, didn't even change my shirt nor underwear from yesterday, nor take a shower,
and zoomed out the door and started heading toward Motosumiyoshi, but quickly remembered today is
Sunday so i can ride TJ Bike to Musashi Kosugi (catch an express train (if the timing is correct)
and not have to pay to park TJ Bike.</p>

<p>The train I caught was at 8:06, a local train from which I'll have to switch to get to the right
station.  I know this much, but I don't know where exactly the optimal change will be.  I think
I'll be able to understand the announcement when it's announced, though.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  that change is now-ish.  bye!</p>

<p class="date">8:22am JST</p>

<p>Okay.  I need to wait here until the train at 8:36.  This line is weird (in my opinion); they
run three trains in a row on one branch, and then three in a row on the other branch.  Seems like
that leaves big gaps and surpluses in service to one or the other.</p>

<p class="date">8:37am JST</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm on the right train as far as I can tell, and have eaten my &quot;nutritious
breakfast&quot; of Balance Up cracker things and milk tea.</p>

<p>So anyway, after I arrived at Kosugi on TJ Bike, I bought my breakfast in the few minutes I had
before the next train, and for some reason my PasMo card was slow to respond.  I opened my wallet
and found it was in the wrong slot.  &quot;When did I move it?&quot; I couldn't remember.  I still
can't really imagine how long ago it must have been, and why would I have moved it and why put it
back in the wrong location.</p>

<p>Bought the food, put the card back in the correct location, went into the gate for the train and
wondered  if, perhaps, I was dreaming.  I stopped, jumped, landed back down quite effectively.  Not
dreaming.  (*) (**) and headed up to the train.</p>

<p>(*) Am I a man dreaming his brain is going crazy, or a brain going crazy dreaming I'm a man?</p>

<p>(**) and by &quot;dreaming&quot; I mean limitedly conscious of the physical world, as opposed to
an infinite spirit limitedly conscious of the real non-physical world.</p>

<p>And in lighter news, though I haven't charged my computer battery in two days, and have only 30%
battery remaining, I chose not to bring my power supply because I know my battery is pretty good at
doing what it's supposed to do.</p>

<p>I'll probably even have enough battery juice to write some tonight.</p>
