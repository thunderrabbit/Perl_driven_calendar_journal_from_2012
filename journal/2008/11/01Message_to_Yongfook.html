Dearest Yongest Fookest,

Though I'm your senior by ten years (March (but also Aries) 1970), and I've had my journal online
since before "blog" was a word, it seems you're my web-senior by a longshot.  I found your site
while trying to sort out a way to update my site in near-realtime.  I don't know exactly how I got
to your site; neither "sweetcron" nor "yongfook" are in my google search history.

But that's not why I'm writing.

In searching for how to tweak sweetcron, I ended up sidetracked on *your* lifestream, and faq, and
old site, and old faq.  I like your humor and apparent allegiance to Apple and open source.  And
your hair and gray suits are sharp.

I've started several websites, and have content strewn around the intertubes; thank you for helping
me get the content back together.

In other news, I also live in Tokyo (Àîºê»Ô, near ÉðÂ¢¾®¿ù) and work (and sometimes hang out) around
½ÂÃ«.  Do you ever hang out at The Pink Cow in Shibuya?  I plan to attend their vegan night buffet
on 12 November.  Do you ever attend the Tokyo PC Users Group?  (I don't, but if you do, you may know
my friend Travis).

I work for <a href="http://77hz.jp/">http://77hz.jp/</a>; we
produce <a href="http://iflyer.jp/">http://iflyer.jp/</a>, <a href="http://sbstrm.com/">http://sbstrm.com/</a>,
and have some other projects in the works for which web designs may be required.

I imagine your Tokyo life is at least as busy as mine (which ironically isn't busy this weekend),
but I think it could be cool to meet you somewheres.

   Peace!
   - Rob
