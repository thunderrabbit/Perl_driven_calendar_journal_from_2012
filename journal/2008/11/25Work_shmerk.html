<p>argh</p>

<p>I've been working on the billing project for like 2.5 months now, maybe 3.  The project started
with Malek saying &quot;just make it really quick and dirty&quot; but instead of doing that I made
it good and functional.</p>

<p>I got kudos for that, and then it was determined that the project could be tied to the actual
system and turn off clients' websites if they haven't paid.  Great!  Andrew even designed a way to
connect the databases, and I've re-tooled 2.5 or 3 weeks of work (that may be an exaggeration) to
get the new technique in place.</p>

<p>I *almost* got the system to a state that Sho could use it to bill our clients this month, but
because it will take him some time to get used to the system and make sure all the data is correct,
he/we decided not to use it.  So I went back to cleaning up the GUI and have been working on getting
past one point on which I've been stuck for a bit: getting mootools to populate some fields into
sortable table rows after getting some data with a JSON request.</p>

<p>Because it's taken Sho all day to get the invoicing done with his old system, Malek is back to
saying, &quot;I want to redo the whole system; I don't even want to worry about telling them what
they're being billed for.&quot;</p>

<p>Ah fuck.  That's exactly the part that I've been working so hard to finish.  Which way will it
be?  Throw away all my code?  Keep going and make something cool?</p>

<p>Got the bit of code finished.  One problem that took me a while to realize: I had essentially
this code:</p>

<pre>
var css_name = 'class';
var css_value = 'classname';

css_object = { css_name : css_value };

var myTD = new Element('td', css_object);
</pre>

<p>but myTD ended up being &lt;td css_name='classname'&gt;</p>

<p>wtf?</p>

<p>That totally killed my plan to generalize the code (the first two lines are simplified
versions of code that was being read from DB and parsed, etc.).  bah.</p>

<p>Thanks to Andrew for helping me get it solved.  I hope I survive well without him over the next
6 work days (he'll be in Kagoshima getting paid to get drugged).</p>
