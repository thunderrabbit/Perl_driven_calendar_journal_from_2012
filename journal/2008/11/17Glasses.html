<p>Last night and this morning I wrote to Izzy.</p>

<pre>
These glasses were pretty expensive (for me at the time I bought them); I had just been on vacation
for a month, and did not have a job when I came back to Japan.  But somehow I had lost my glasses on
vacation.  I am *sure* I know where I left them (at my dad's house), but they didn't come across
them, and I never found them.

I had one last pair of contacts that I had been wearing longer than they were supposed to be worn,
though I was sure to take them out every night.

Anyway, I bought these glasses because they have very light frames and hinges (I learned my lesson
from buy glasses that were flexible, with no hinges; the little tiny points by which they are held
didn't hold, and I ended up supergluing them repeatedly to keep them together (those were the ones I
lost in the US, so maybe it's better)

I bought these glasses, and they don't fit very well.  I'm in Japan and don't speak Japanese very
well, and have never gone back to the shop to get them fixed.  No time to go there while they are
open (I have a job now, so ironically I don't have time to go back).  So just by looking down at my
feet, or even more annoyingly down while doing something such as washing dishes, my glasses come off
the left temple, and then hang precariously by the right temple, touching my nose annoyingly need a
good push back into place, but my hands are busy washing dishes, thank you very much glasses.

very annoying.

But hopefully good for your stories!

&gt; Hi Rob:
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for writing back.  When you said that your most interesting glasses
&gt; experience was one that I wouldn't want to hear, I was expecting you to tell
&gt; me that you had had lasik. 
&gt;
&gt; It is very interesting that you feel that your glasses are a barrier and
&gt; that you feel more outgoing without them.  From what I have seen in the
&gt; videos, you are pretty darned outgoing with those spectacles.  I always got
&gt; the impression that there was nothing that a pair of glasses would stop you
&gt; from doing.
&gt;
&gt; Sure, bungee jumping is probably easier with contacts but I was wondering if
&gt; any of your other activities have caused your glasses to fall off or get
&gt; damaged.
&gt;
&gt; As for you time lapse photography project, it sounds cool.  I love time
&gt; lapse whether its the evolution of a flower or piece of architecture or the
&gt; background in Madonna's "Ray of Light" video.  Best of luck.  I look forward
&gt; to seeing the videos but hope it won't take until Halloween.
&gt;
&gt; Rob, take care of yourself.  Wear your glasses proudly, even if it's when
&gt; you are alone in your room.
&gt;
&gt; SEE you!

&gt;&gt; Yo!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What it is, Iz?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My most interesting glasses experience will probably be one you'll hate to
&gt;&gt; hear, but ..  I've stopped wearing my glasses during the day when I interact
&gt;&gt; with the public at large, though I still wear them while chillin' in my
&gt;&gt; room, like right now writing to you.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I feel more outgoing without glasses; they felt like a barrier between the
&gt;&gt; world and the real me.  Or something like that.  So anyway, I've started
&gt;&gt; wearing contacts again.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In other news, I've started experimenting with doing time-lapse
&gt;&gt; photography for an art project that I plan to put on youtube.  It'll
&gt;&gt; probably take a while to finish...  Perhaps by next Halloween!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What's up with you?
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;    - Rob!
