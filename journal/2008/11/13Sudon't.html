<p>Trying to connect to the correct directory for editing a file on staging system, but I can't ls
the subdirectory to find it.  So I tried sudo.</p>

<pre>
rob:/home/sites$ sudo ls

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for rob: 
rob is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.

<p>Hahahaha. &quot;This incident will be reported.&quot;  Good thing the admin is my coworker.</p>

<p>Anyone who understands the above should have seen this comic, but just in case:</p>
