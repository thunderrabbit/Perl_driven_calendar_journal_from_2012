<p class="dream">In a hospital, hearing a page overhead: &quot;Dr Stable, we're having trouble
getting the patient stabilized for surgery.  Dr Stable, we're having trouble getting the patient
stabilized for surgery.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I found myself intrigued that the Dr's name was the same as the anti-condition of
the patient, and that they announced the Dr's name, but not the patient's name.  I wondered if it
was code for something else.</p>

<p>I just remembered</p>

<p class="dream">Finally got to see Ami after her mom's death.  She was finally able to cry without
concern for others nor her surroundings.  I felt happy that I could support her in this way.</p>
