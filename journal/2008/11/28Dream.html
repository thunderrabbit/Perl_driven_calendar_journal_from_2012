<p class="dream">Riding in the back seat of a train/bus, the back doors were open, and I was having
to hold on tightly to some sort of padded table to keep myself in the train.  I had what felt like
half a seat under me, though it looked like a full seat when I looked down to see how perilously
close to the edge I was seated.  I saw my backpack equally close to the edge of the exit.</p>

<p class="dream">The guy next to me had sat down while the train stopped at a station, and the
crowded train had forced him to take over part of my seat.</p>

<p class="dream">Later, I was in the same seat, but the bus was now headed to my dad's house on
249, and I was in the front seat.  An accident occurred just in front of us, so everyone suddenly
had to stop, and the bus started to stop really hard and I had to hold super tightly onto the
padded table to stay inside.  The bus curved off the main road to afford itself more time to stop,
as did a couple other cars, and I stepped out onto the hood of the bus to afford myself some more
space to stay off the ground.  The bus driver yelled at me like, &quot;Rob! Get back inside!&quot;
but I was hardly phased, given the choice between following the rules and staying alive.</p>

<p class="dream">The bus stopped, and everyone was okay.</p>

<p class="dream">Ami was sitting beside me in some sort of booth with a TV in front.  A woman was
sitting in the booth to our left, but she was too busy putting on mascara to augment her fur-scarf
wearing, make-up laden, perfume overloaded look to look at us.  While I looked up &quot;fox wine
tah&quot; online, trying to find information about something a newscaster had mentioned, Ami moved
to sit behind me, and I wondered what she was doing after a bit.  I turned around to find she had
taken off her shirt, and was applying some sort of gel to her aerola, and just about to press
against me in a funny surprise attack of the tickle-fight variety.  I was like, &quot;what??&quot;
and then squirmed around to keep her from touching me with her gel-topped toplessness, and she tried
to wipe the remainder of the package on me.</p>
