<p>While writing my dream, I noted that the date features the word &quot;November,&quot; in
particular &quot;1 November,&quot; the first day
of <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>!!  But what to write?</p>

<p>Oh!  How about if I just write my dreams each night, and expand as necessary... Hmmmm!</p>
