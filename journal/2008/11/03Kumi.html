<p>Met with Kumi tonight to talk about the email I sent her saying &quot;I love you, but not in the
way most people mean when they say that.&quot;</p>

<p>Her basic reaction was, &quot;well, nothing's changed so that's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Before that conversation, we ate pizza and salad in Mark City, and then got dessert from the
nearby dessert shop, and then headed to the roof of Tokyu Department store, but it was closed, so
we headed to the &quot;park&quot; area sorta behind Cerulean Tower to eat our dessert and chat
about meditation type stuff and Ami's mommy afer Ami called at 10pm.</p>

<p>When it was time to go, I asked if I could hug Kumi, and she demurred, asking, &quot;aren't you
conflicted?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes,&quot; and then I tuned into Clear Fountain for inspiration.  &quot;Thank you
for helping me maintain clear boundaries.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, once I was no longer conflicted, I said, &quot;can I hug you as a friend?&quot;</p>

<p>She goes, &quot;are you already unconflicted?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am right now!&quot; I waited, and then, &quot;window's closing... five, four, three, two,
one,&quot; and turned around to pick up my back pack and we back tracked to the tracks to head
back.</p>

<p>On the way back to the station, I was like, &quot;could you *feel* my conflict, or just infer
it?&quot;</p>

<p>Just infer it.</p>

<p>She told me a story of how this has happened to her already this year with another guy.  At
first I was thinking, <em>competition</em>, and then I realized I was no longer conflicted.</p>

<p>Weird.</p>
