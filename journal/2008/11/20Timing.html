<p>Hmmm; on the local train, it's farther to 明大前 than I guessed.  I don't know if I'll make it
to work by 11am; we may have to arrange for me to be late on my Shiatsu days.</p>

<p>There's a guy hacking coughing down at the end of this carriage.  He's sitting in the old-people
seat (he looks old enough but not *that* old).  I hope he's okay.</p>

<p>Now arriving in 明大前.  10 minutes..  Should be fine.  (?)</p>

<p class="date">10:55am JST</p>

<p>Getting back was fine.  In two ways.  (one)  I'm at work 5 minutes early.</p>
