<p class="dream">In a small office, crowded with three desks, lots of stuff, including a model of a
waterfall made out of posterboard, and three people who didn't want to work, I was watching the
waterfall model, and noted a  woodroach climb out of one of the islands on the top of the model and
start walking across the river of water before it turned into a waterfall.  I  stopped the river
with a pamphlet of paper for a bit and then let it go to gush water and wash the roach down the
falls and off the model.    It was able to keep from being flushed all the way down to the bottom,
so I caught some more water and tried again.  But the water supply was dwindling perhaps because I
was only doing asymptoticc progress on getting rid of the insect.</p>

<p class="dream">Realized I had something to write about, so I was preparing what to write and
Andrew came running by like, &quot;I'm going to win the race&quot; even though we're not racing,
and he's not even started writing.  Male was like, &quot;wtf is he doing?&quot; and I agreed I also
had no idea.</p>
