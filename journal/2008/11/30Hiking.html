<p>Happy to meet Ami on the train at 6:28am in Kosugi.</p>

<p class="date">8:26am JST Sunday 30 November 2008 (day 14130)</p>

<p>On the bus now, in Shin Matsuda station.  Travis and I included Cynthia in our conversation at
first, but then we shifted to nerdy programmer talk and battle of emacs vs vi, and why he hates
using PHP (poorly written array implementation, for a start), and how he's writing a new framework
that can deliver pages in under a milisecond.  Travis is purdy dern smert.</p>

<p>Ah; I forgot to tell him my bro is coming into town.</p>

<p>Ami slept for most of the way.  She used my left shouldr as a pillow.  On my right, Cynthia and
I had a bit of a kneeshoving fight while Travis and I chatted; that was my communication with
her.</p>

<p>Now Ami and I are chillin' on the bus, with tons of people a with hiking gear (I want to say
utensils to honor kT, but with hiking equipment, the effect is not as great as her term
&quot;sleeping utensils.&quot;) in the aisle, effectively cutting us off from Travis and Cynthia in
one seat, and behind them (and beside us) are Tomoko and Ayumi, who I j  we just met  before
getting on the bus (they had planned to join the hike, but)  (oso did like 10 other people,  or
maybe 8, 4 of whom cancelled before the fact, and 4 of whom were still sleeping at 7am when we were
in Noborito.)</p>

<p>The weather is <em>perfect</em>.  No clouds.  Brightly colored trees, Mt Fuji majestically
covered in snow.</p>

<p class="date">4:44pm JST</p>

<p>Good times.  Couldn't get all the way in, but took a vid and slept in the sun afterward.</p>

<p>Then my camera died again.  It's not just the battery.</p>
