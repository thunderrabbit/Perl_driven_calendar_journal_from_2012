<p>I missed Ami's call while walking from Tokyu Store in ÉðÂ¢¾®¿ù, so I called her back.  She was
crying.  I thought it was over her mom, but then she said, in plain English, &quot;my father is
angry at me.&quot;</p>

<p>compassion</p>

<p>I listened and listened to her cry.  Told her after a bit that her dad was sad about Mama dying,
but he shouldn't be angry at Ami.</p>

<p>I listened to the details.  Best I could understand is that people are stressed and some people
are trying to accomodate others, and one person (let's call him Ami's dad) feels obligated to
ignore self care and take care of family who is over for funeral festivities.</p>

<p>I asked how Ami's brother is doing.  I didn't understand the answer, but he's the one who wanted
to go to bed though guests are over.  Fine, right?  Wrong.  Papa disapproves.</p>

<p>Then when Ami tried to defend her brother, Papa was like, &quot;I don't want to talk to
you.&quot;</p>

<p>Ouch.  I can't imagine my Dad saying that to me.  (Well, he often tells me he's busy, but in
gentle terms, and he'd make time if I insisted.)</p>

<p>I said, &quot;Ami, I like to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p>She started crying anew, &quot;thank you.&quot; I knew it was the right thing to say.</p>

<p>Talked for a while longer until she was okay again.  Asked her about her plans to move out (of
her parent<ins>'</ins>s<del>'</del> home); they've been derailed until perhaps April.</p>
