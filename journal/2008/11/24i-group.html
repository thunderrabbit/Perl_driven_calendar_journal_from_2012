<p>Did not want to be at I-group.  What's the point of doing this work?  I have no answers; I don't
know what I want to do; this just sucks..  Eventually came around to realizing I want to be a
spiritual master (wtf ever that means) and make a living creating art and doing massage, reiki,
shiatsu, etc.</p>

<p>Oh, and telling stories.</p>
