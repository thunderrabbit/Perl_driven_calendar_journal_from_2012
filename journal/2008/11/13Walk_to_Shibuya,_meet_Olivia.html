<p>Because I had two hours between lessons, I chose to walk from Yoyogi to Shibuya for my lesson
with Yurika.  Good thing, too; in Harajuku I was spotted by Oribbia!  She caught up to me on the
sidewalk near H&amp;M where I was asked to wait for a moment while the next 8 or 10 customers were
let in after waiting in line to enter the store.</p>

<p>Orribia informed me H&amp;M is like the Ikea of clothing.  Hmmm.  I guess that's why I've never
heard of it. hahaha</p>

<p>Chatted for 45 seconds with Olivia until the next intersection I explained why I was walking
there, and turns out we had similar stories.  Had some times, so decided to walk.  Only difference
is she's meeting a friend, and I'm meeting a student-friend.</p>

<p>Said bye and we agreed we'll meet up somewhere for New Years or on Facebook. </p>
