<p>Yes.  <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/node/3058714#comment-3208574">I screwed up</a>.</p>

<p>But I think my apology is golden.  Golden and hilarous.  ;-)</p>

[Thunder Rabbit scampers toward the door, frantically searching for someone who can fix the site.

Just as Thunder Rabbit leaves the room, someone shouts in carefully measured tones, "Wait Right
There, Rabbit!"

Thunder stops quickly, wondering if his luck has changed. He turns around to find himself face to
face with a high ranking Administrator.]

Um, Hi!, I'm Thunder Rabbit!

["Yes, I see," muses the Administrator. "And I also see your name on this post."

Thunder Rabbit's eyes followed the Administrator's finger pointing toward the sky, just above
Lousy's post. He swallowed.]

Yes, I wrote that.

["Yes. And I'm sure you thought you were very witty by mocking the tone of a new user."

Thunder Rabbit swallowed again. This was not going the way he had hoped.

"May I ask you, Mr Rabbit," asked the Administrator politely, "how you arrived in this room?"

Thunder knew, somehow, the Administrator knew the answer already, so it was best not to lie.]

Um, through the forum labeled, "Site and Message Board Feedback and Suggestions."

[Thunder spoke carefully so as to properly capitalize each word.

"And did you see, at the top of the 'Site and Message Board Feedback and Suggestions,' a post
labeled, 'Read Me'?"]

I believe it said, "READ THIS FIRST - New features and enhancements. What to post here." um, sir.

[The Administrator's eyes widened a bit. "And did you, Mr Rabbit, READ THAT FIRST?"]

Um, er..

[Thunder Rabbit looked down at his big fuzzy feet.]

er.. no.

["I see," smiled the Administrator. "If you'll permit me, I'd like to quote a line from that
post. Line 5, starting from the first character, 'THIS FORUM IS NOT FOR BUG REPORTS. That's tech
help, next door.'

Thunder Rabbit looked up at the Administrator. Then back down at his feet.

"Mr Rabbit," said the Administrator calmly, "we've had a few server issues."

Thunder watched as the Administrator flipped through a clipboard of paper featuring post-it notes,
scribbles and highlights.

The Administrator found the appropriate note, and began to read. "The word count validator will begin 
working at midnight," he paused, "November 1st," he continued, "2008," he added, "PST," he explained.

"Please enjoy your stay."]

Thank you!!!!!

[With that, Thunder Rabbit scampered back to his writing.]
