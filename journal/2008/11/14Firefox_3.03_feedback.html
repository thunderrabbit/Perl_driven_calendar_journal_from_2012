Summary: Firefox 3.03 (OS X) easy editing of Bookmarks Toolbar items in folders

Comments: 
I've got some folders in my Bookmarks Toolbar.  Inside those folders,
some of the links need to be deleted.  I'd like the ability to
right-click on the item (in the folder in the actual Bookmarks Toolbar)
and select Delete (or Edit) so I can easily affect those bookmarks.

The only way I can see to do it now is via the top menu:
Bookmarks->Organize Bookmarks (Shift-Option-B), then find the bookmarks
in a vertical column (instead of horizontal on the actual Bookmarks
Toolbar), and then right-click to delete.

In other news, in the Shift-Option-B window, it took me a moment to
figure out where to *edit* the bookmarks (down in the bottom of that
window).  Because I can right-click to delete bookmarks, I looked in
that right-click menu to edit them as well.

Thank you guys for a great product and listening to our squealing
feedback.  ;-)

   Blessings
    - Rob!
