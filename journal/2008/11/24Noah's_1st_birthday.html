<p>Chillin' under a beach umbrella with Matt, David, Mark, Shin, and Mark's neighbor, while it
rained around us and Mark cooked various meat products on a grill with no BBQ sauce.</p>

<p>Though we were cold and slightly wet, I preferred that to playing with four or five little 1 year
old kids inside.  Ami laughed at the faces I made.  David said, &quot;it's called fear,&quot; as we
watched a little baby crawling toward us without using his knees for propulsion.  Just his arms and
let the rest slide on the hardwood floor.</p>

<p>Lots of food and I fell asleep on the couch watching Sesame Street until Misa came.  Eventually
all the babies left (except Noah), and it was much quieter.  I felt a lot more comfortable at that
point like I could actually make silly faces and play with Noah, but didn't quite do it.  Ami
brought him to me and I was like, &quot;waaaahhh!!!&quot; of mock fear like, &quot;what's this
thing??&quot;</p>
