<p class="dream">In some sort of space military, we were engaged in battle, but for some reason our
spherical ships were offline for the moment.  The battle was going on, and each soldier was in his
spherical ship, waiting for them to be released.  The ships were inside a larger ship, with rows of
ports where each sphere connected.</p>

<p class="dream">Many ongoing discussions, and then suddenly all the spheres began to come to life,
like the had all just been charged up and turned on.  Inside one sphere, I witnessed it clunking
out of its port into a groove with all the other spheres, and then each in turn rolling down toward
the launching chute and shooting out into space to engage the enemy.  The spheres didn't roll, or
if they did our point of view remained steady within them.  But they did have full manueverability
when we got into space.  Could just go anywhere any direction we pleased.  Could shoot the bad guys
with lasers launched out from our feet.</p>

<p class="dream">When our spheres went online, there was a lot of excited chatter on the radio as
we went into battle.  For me, the battle inspace lasted only a few minutes, and then I was inside a
facility, with the sphere on my back, but it was just a heavy round energy pack I carried around.  I
still had pretty decent manueverability, but it was using my legs walking around on carpet instead of
in the freedom of space.</p>

<p class="dream">A superior (by several years) was training me, and I was a bit cocky liek,
&quot;yeah yeah I can do dat&quot;  I saw a bad guy walking through the hall (indicated by red
numbers floating under his feet as he walked).  If I killed bad guys with red numbers, I would get
that number of points added to my score.  If anyone with green numbers was killed in my vicinity, I
would lose that number of points from my score.</p>

<p class="dream">Walking toward the library, away from the bad guy who was being handled by the
older soldier, I could hear people commenting about my slow pace and squeaking boots that sounded
like squishing water with each labored step I took.  The weapon on my back was quite heavy, and
forced my posture to like a 45 degree angle as I walked.  The squishing sound was leather squeaking
boots.</p>

<p class="dream">I arrived in the library and walked in by moving a shelf open like a door instead
of walking in where everyone else did.  I wanted to surprise any bad guys by coming in quickly and
unexpectedly.  I didn't see anyone with numbers, red or green, but I did notice a woman make eye
contact with me, so I began making my way over there, aware that it could be a trap, and even if
not, the corner of every eye in the place would be watching me, so I maintained a professional,
polite, killer face, keeping my eyes on the room as I wound around the quietly crowded tables to
get to her.</p>

<p class="dream">Everyone in the library was studiously reading, and as cramped as a cafeteria
might be.  One quick glance around the room before I leaned my head close to the woman, &quot;you
called, ma'am?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Uh, yes, I noticed your wife's collection of stuffed animals behind the
water bottle,&quot; she began, and though I knew I didn't have a wife (the animals in question were
mine), I didn't react; that could be the end of me immediately (you react, you die! was our
mantra), or could cause embarrassment to the woman, and require a long story to explain that they
were my rabbit and cow, so I just let her continue.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;and I wondered if she would like to have my white bear named
&quot;Benny&quot; to add to her collection?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Oh, I think she would enjoy that very well,&quot; I replied, referring to my
non-existant wife. &quot;You can just give the bear to the librarian and she'll take care of it.&quot;</p>
