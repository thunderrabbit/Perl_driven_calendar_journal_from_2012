<p>(*) Before anyone is all, &quot;omg you're [sic] Japanese is so good!&quot; let me assure the
non-Japanese-typing readers that I just enter option-space to switch to Japanese mode, type the
letters i-n-o-k-a-s-h-i-r-a-s-e-n-n in order, and then type space again to switch that to kanji.  I
can recognize the first two characters easily enough, and the fourth one is correct, but the third
one I just assume is correct.  It's like having a spellcheck, and assuming the computer spells
correctly.</p>

<p>We've arrived in Shibuya.  brb.</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm on °æ¤ÎÆ¬Àþ (*) now.</p>

<p>(**) I only know that the romanji version of the name starts with Sasa, and I know it's just 1 or 2
stops from Meidai-mae on the only other line in that station.  This will be enough information to
get me there unless there are two stations that start with Sasa as the first and second stops from
Meidaimae.</p>

<p>(***) Apparently we are overdue for a decimating earthquake in Tokyo.</p>

<p>(*) That time I just had to type i-n-o-k-a-TAB to get the kanji.</p>
