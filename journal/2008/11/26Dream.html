<p class="dream">Talking to Ami, telling her I had had the most gaseous farts all day.  I was
describing them by making a long series of explosion sounds with my voice.  &quot;Today my butt was
all ________, _______&quot; where the _____ represent English-unspellable glotteral throat noises
using my uvula to simulate fart noises.  I kept going on and on just for effect, way longer than
what was actually true, just because I like making Ami laugh.</p>

<p class="dream">I was writing about this occurrence in my diary and then realized I need to call
my mom, so I did that and she was happy to hear from me, and had read my diary and made some funny
comment or question about it.  Glad to talk to my mom; it had been a while!</p>
