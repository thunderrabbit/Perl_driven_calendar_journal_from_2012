<p>This is the night that I suggested we go to Mac's Carrot in Meijiro (near Kevin's house) after
he suggested we don't go to expensive curry again in Ebisu.</p>

<p>We sat at the corner of the bar, with his brown suede jacket on the chair to my left, and him to
the left of that, around the corner so we could be more like face to face than side by side at the
bar.</p>

<p>Stories and stories, talking about Ami, and Peace Boat, and Keiko.</p>
