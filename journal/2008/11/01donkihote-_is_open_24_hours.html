<p>In my quest to begin construction of Marble Track #3, I needed to buy some extension cords to
get better lighting.  Basically I want to make a stop action animation of the construction: piece
by piece.</p>

<p>Not sure if I can do this project, nor how long it will take, but I know I can make a marble
track.  It's just keeping and then stringing all the photos into a movie that's the trick.</p>

<p>My trip to get extension cords started with a TJ Bike ride to the <del>99 yen</del><ins>100
yen</ins> shop near 平間 station.  I had estimated that I needed a 3 meter cord, so when I found
they only have 0.5 meter cords, I realized 100 yen wasn't enough for 3 meters.</p>

<p>Emailed Ami to see if she could call me (she's chillin' with her mom in the hospital; I didn't
know if I could call.  She called me back, and I told her what I wanted to buy.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you wait until tomorrow or Monday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;nope.  Gotta have 'em now.  Now now now.&quot;</p>

<p>So she described where I could find ドンキホーテ, the cramped Wal-Mart of Japan, open 24 hours
for my purchasing pleasure.</p>

<p>I spent a significant amount of time finding the perfect solution.  I already have (energy
saving) bulbs, so I didn't want to buy a lamp, as such.  I ended up buying three extension cords,
and two bulb sockets.</p>

<p>(( One extension cord (1098 yen) is simply to &quot;move&quot; the outlet that's hidden behind my
closet door.  For a year I've had my phone charger, electric toothbrush charger, camera charger, and
AA battery charger connected back there.  Well now with my handy 6-outlet extension, I can move the
toothbrush closer to where I keep other toiletries, plus a bonus: no longer on the floor. ))</p>

<p>For 898 yen, another cord (featuring a single power switch for 3 outlets) will connect to the
other wall outlet, where I have both my computers taking up the sockets now.  I don't really need to
plug anything else in here, so it will host one or both computers, plus the third extension
cord.</p>

<p>The third cord has three outlets, but does not have a switch, and not a well-known brand; it was
only 398 yen.  I'll use it to hold two light sockets, at 90 degree angles to *sort of* spread some
light around.  I imagine it will work well, if I can just get it placed well.</p>

<p>Grabbed some pennies (actually yennies) out of the brimming take a penny leave a penny cache,
but didn't use them when the cashier checked me out.  I just stored them in my wallet for next
time.  Maybe 5 yen.</p>

<p>Rode slowly back on TJ Bike, text messaging Ami to let her know my status.  Because TJ Bike has
been living out in the rain, I can't get the back sprocket out of top gear.  So I just peddaled
slowly back, enjoying sparse traffic and quiet of night time.  Rode past Maruetsu where Ami and I
often visit near Hirama station, past 南武線 without having to wait for a train, and with some
effort (in top gear) up the hill near my house over the train tracks.</p>

<p>At home I labeled all the cords with &quot;1 Nov(ember) 2008 via TJ Bike ドンキホーテ
398/898/1098 yen&quot;</p>
