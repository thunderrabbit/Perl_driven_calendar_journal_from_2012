<p>Today</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ami's mom died.  Got a call from Ami that sorta spooked me with her business-like approach,
while I know she has had a close relationship with her mom.</p></li>

<li><p>Billing project didn't get quite as much as I might have hoped, but did get some DB changes
made.  I made a backup before making significant changes, but still don't want ot break the DB too
badly.</p></li>

<li><p>Class with Komatsu was two hours of near boredom, featuring either him telling me stories in
Japanese, or sputtering nouns at me in English with hand motions for the verbs, or me pressing play
and pause on the CD player to improve his listening ability.</p></li>

<li><p>Dreams have escaped my brain from this morning till now.  Something interesting happened; I
think another sex dream, but I didn't write it down cause I needed to get ready for a meeting with
Tariq.</p></li>

<li><p>Earlier than normal, I left the house to meet Tariq at 9;45 at Krispy Kreme in Shibuya.
Didn't get a free donut, but that's probably better for my stomach.  We're movin' along on this
game; I hope it works out nicely.</p></li>

<li><p>For lunch at work Malek ordered pizza cause today is the first Friday of the month.  We had
2 pizzas last first Friday and 1 pizza today.  Sho wasn't very hungry so his three pieces were
consumed as cold pizza from the fridge by Andrew and me later in the afternoon.</p></li>

<li><p>Got a call from Kevin just after I left the office.  He asked if I had a camera that we could
hook up to his computer.  He seemed pretty surprised to hear that Mac laptops come standard with
camera built in.</p></li>

<li><p>Had to turn around to get my VGA output cable from work where I had left it (given that I
didn't think I would be using my computer as a camera for his projector)</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't had much to eat today - just five sixteenths of a medium sized pizza, oh and
pudding and cookies, but not enough to keep me from being hungry now.  I think there's some granola
and soy milk at my apartment.</p></li>

<li><p>Just about to fall asleep here at the keyboard.  Train is in ÅÄ±àÄ´ÉÛ now.</p></li>

<li><p>Keiko was on my mind for a lot of the day.  Part of me wants to call her to hang out again
tonight, but certainly that's not in my overall best interest, plus I've gotta be up sorta early
tomorrow for Kevin's RV class.</p></li>

<li><p>Learned about Songbird, a new open source music player.  Downloaded it but wasn't able to
import my music library from iTunes because I've got all my music on Amazon S3, and Songbird wanted
to (down)load all the music.  I had to kill the process because I had to leave for work.</p></li>

<li><p>My train has just arrived at Motosumiyoshi.  Will be walkin' home in a moment.</p></li>
</ol>
