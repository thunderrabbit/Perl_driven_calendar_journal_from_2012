<p class="dream">While watching a garbage truck be connected with a large trash can (or perhaps
dumping its garbage out from the back of the truck), the captain of PB's new ship and I were having
a casual chat when he asked a sortof weird question.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;If your father was the captain, do you think he would drink while
working?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Well,&quot; I started looking for the 'correct' answer; I didn't know this
guy well enough that I thought he might want the truth. &quot;I'm sure that there's a lot of stress
on this job, so it would be important to find a way to relax.  But while *actually* *driving* the
ship, I know he would not be affected by alcohol,&quot; I spoke a truth without revealing that I
had never seen my dad drunk before, and think he may have stopped drinking altogether in the 10+
years that I've not lived at his house.</p>

<p class="dream">Later, driving Mr Van on the way to my old house in Spring, Texas, I came up on
some construction right across the street from the house, but it was forcing traffic to divert such
that I would have to go miles and miles around to get back to the house from a different
direction.  I thanked the construction guy after asking him if I could &quot;just drive over the
curb here,&quot; and into the drive way, and he said &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I noticed another equally short way I could get to the house, and I pulled into the
driveway.  I got my luggage out of the back of Mr Van, and pulled it up to the front door.  One of
the wheels made a strange repeated thunking noise, along with a scraping slide leading up to each
thunk.</p>

<p class="dream">I opened the door to the house and was surprised to find Karen at home!  I said HI
to her, and she commented like, &quot;I had wondered what that noise was, but I couldn't see
anything through the window,&quot; which was lightly veiled with a thin white drape.</p>
