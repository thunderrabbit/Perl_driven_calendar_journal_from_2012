<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I've started building Marble Track Three.  I plan to make a stop action video of its
construction.  To that end, I have 
<ol>
<li><p>cleared the top of my chest of drawers</p></li>

<li><p>tacked up a backdrop: the blue cloth tarp given to me by Sara in Colorado</p></li>

<li><p>started building a camera holder which will literally connect my camera to the marble
track</p></li>

<li><p>Taken 130 or so test photos to see how the animation could look</p></li>

<li><p>Tried making a movie with iMovie</p></li>

<li><p>tried google searches on terms like flash stop.action.animation and tutorial</p></li>

<li><p>Called Will cause those searches weren't working</p></li>

<li><p>tried Google searches on terms like 'time lapse' photos and came up with a list of
<a href="http://www.stopmotionworks.com/stopmosoftwr.htm">stop-action animation software</a></p></li>

<li><p>Downloaded Boinx IStopMotion, I Can Animate, and AnimAideXT to try making a movie with the
photos.</p></li>

<li><p>Couldn't open AnimAideXT.  Didn't want to run the Installer for I Can Animate, so I dragged
and ropped IStopMotion to my Applications folder.  Its trial license is good for 5 days.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>Started writing a novel called _My Dreams_, but at no where <em>near</em> the rate required
to finish 50,000 words by the end of November.  Plus, half the counter-widgets and stuff of NaNoWriMo
aren't working properly, so I don't feel compelled to enter my data and watch my progress.</p></li>

<li><p>So I've 98% given up on writing a novel this year.</p></li>

<li><p>I started testing SweetCron in an attempt to get my lifestream on my site.  It's pretty
great overall, and definitely free.  Haven't sorted out a way to get Facebook to show up there, nor
quite how to list my posted vids on Youtube.  (It will show my Favorited vids, but not posted
ones.  Silly Youtube).</p></li>

<li><p>It can do Vimeo, which has useability benefits over Youtube, but nowhere near as many vids
of mine on there...  So if I switch to Vimeo, my vids will be scattered about the tubes.  Gar;
that's an issue of the overall intarweb, not either of the services.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't seen Ami much recently, as she's been chillin' with her cancer havin' mom.  I can
dig that, though I do miss her.</p></li>

<li><p>Have just arrived in Shibuya, and just about to meet Michael to get my ballot to vote for
Obama.  Closin' puter for now, but there's more to write in this SoML.</p></li>

<li><p class="date">6:50pm JST</p>
<p>I have my ballot!</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I have restarted work on a flash game.  Though it took me a bit to get used to the
interface, my flash skillz are definitely improved now from the first time I worked on it.  Though
there are very few (4?) frames, I've got some objects moving around the screen in pre-specified
(soon to be XML-specified) locations, and tracking clicks while they go.  Should be able to make a
pretty decent game out of it.  I hope!</p></li>

<li><p>I've been working full time for the past threee payperiods for a paltry 150,000 yen per
month (250,000 is the minimum required by law for full time, but I'm officially doing contract
work).  BUT, this month I'll get 170,000, and hopefully sooon soon soon a mo' betta' than 250,000
yen amount.</p></li>

<li><p>Signed up with peraperaworld (I think), which is like findateacher, but slightly easier to
use interface.  Only bad thing is I've been getting spam (in the strict sense of 'unwanted
messages') from students who write, things like &quot;can you teach on Monday morning?&quot; and
&quot;can you teach kids in shanty-town?&quot; and &quot;can I get a free lesson?&quot; when my
profile specifically says I teach non-beginner adults on Tuesday and Thursday *nights*, near
Kawasaki or Shibuya, and offer 1000 yen off first lesson.</p></li>

<li><p>In related news, though I offered to teach Ami for free, if only she'll do homework, she
hasn't done any homework for me to check.</p></li>

<li><p>In related news, I haven't done much Japanese study recently.</p></li>

<li><p>In related news, I'm planning to switch my journal encoding from Shift-JIS to UTF-8, so I
can more easily write in other character sets as well.  Not sure if I need to tweak my Mac, or just
Emacs to do the encoding when I write.  Not sure how to re-encode files in a batch, but I'm sure I
can sort out a way.</p></li>

<li><p>In related news, because PHP seems to be the most popular scripting yatsu for websites, and
I've grown a bit fond of it since I've had to use it for 15 months for work, I may write a new
journal indexr for my site.</p>

<p>I want the site to still feel the same, but I want some better/additional functionality:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>search by tags, people, etc (this will require more careful data entry on my part
probably (oh wait; I could just give a list of names to search for and slap em into a DB))</p></li>

<li><p>better RSS feeds</p></li>

<li><p>better commenting.  (might outsource this to something
like <a href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>easier integration with various photo sites: smugmug, facebook, picasa, imgserv, my wiki, my
images directory</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p class="date">7:15pm JST</p>

<p>I'm on the roof of Tokyu Dept Store (as indicated by the large neon sign) for the first time.  I
was chillin' on the floor on 2F, but a security guard invited me not to sit there.  He suggested I
sit on a bench.  I told him I had looked for benches, but couldn't find any.</p>

<p>(That's cause they're on the roof.)</p></li>

<li><p>Fred is considering visiting Tokyo during winter break.  That'll be great if he can!</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't been playing ultimate frisbee recently.</p></li>

<li><p>My basic weekly schedule: go to be early, wake up without an alarm, do reiki charging, do
neti in the shower, do 20 minutes' meditation, get ready and go to work, work, and then any of some
assorted activities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Monday: i-group or work late</p></li>

<li><p>Tuesday: teach Reika or work late</p></li>

<li><p>Wednesday: meet Ami</p></li>

<li><p>Thursday: teach Yurika or work late</p></li>

<li><p>Friday: Meditation or meet Kumi or work late</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p>I haven't worked a lot on Colleen's painting, although actually I did a couple hours worth
of work on it recently.  It's thinking about being done soon.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't heard from Colleen since she was pulled off the rig to take care of her friend's
funeral.</p></li>

<li><p>The past couple of weekends, I've seen Ami sporadically, worked on flash game sporadically,
other computer stuff, usually not porn.</p></li>

<li><p>Kevin called me back recently, and because I (had already sent an email related to the
reason I called him, and) had him on the phone, I asked him a bit about meditation, and my thoughts
&quot;taking me away.&quot;</p>

<p>He suggested that I don't try to control the thoughts.  He's like, &quot;you aren't your
thoughts.  You don't look up at clouds and think they are you and try to ride away on them..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmmm; that's true,&quot; I agreed, &quot;but, I *do* sometimes get carried away by my
thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So do I!&quot; he assured me.</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>As a result, for the past two days, I've had better meditation, meaning, I've had more continuous
awareness that I'm in meditation, even as my brain relentlessly recites Eminem's &quot;Rabbit
Run,&quot; (yesterday) or something else today.</p>

<p>Thank you, Kevin.</p></li>

<li><p>I want to add a bit to the analogy: I don't see clouds and try to stop them; I just let them
float by.</p></li>

<li><p>My subjective experience during this 'new type of meditation' feels something like a
relaxation of my temples, and my awareness centered in my brain, just below the surface of the crown
of my skull.</p>

<p>Though this state of awareness often results in my outer mind becoming quiet, even if it
doesn't, I can still maintain awareness while it babbles.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't seen Kumi in a couple of weeks, but about to meet her in Shibuya.  I'd like to talk
a bit about a late night crazy email I sent her.</p></li>

<li><p class="date">10:36pm JST</p>

<p>Just said bye to Kumi as she departed the train in Nakameguro.</p></li>
</ol>
