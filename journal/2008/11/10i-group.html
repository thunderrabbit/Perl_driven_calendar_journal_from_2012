<p>Basically the most significant thing &quot;today&quot; was my i-group process.  Short
version:</p>

<p>I said I felt shame, but didn't know from where it came.  I asked Kevin to lead me with some
provocative questions.</p>

<p>Found the shame in my heart, and sank into it, carrying me back to 3 or 4 years old when I pulled
up the carpet yarn and made a wig for myself, saying I wanted to be a girl.  My parents told me I
shouldn't want to be a girl and I was doing something wrong, etc.</p>

<p>Michael took my place as 4-year-old Rob, and I reframed the experience by adding (an older
version of) myself, saying, &quot;don't worry about what they say; you can do anything you want.
You can play any way you want!&quot; and I put some kleenex on my head and invited little Rob to do
the same, and then I put a pillow on my head and he did the same, and I called him the great Swami
cause it looked like a turban, and we traded places so I could relive a golden version of the same
scene.  We played and I became a Roman Emporer with a tissue behind each ear and climbed on the
chair and did everything I wanted for a moment.</p>

<p>Then brought the same energy forward 34 years to me now, by which time my head and chest and
hands were tingling with lovely etheric energy (same type of tingles as I'd get during significant
ISIS sessions.  same type of tingles as when I finished my carpet work in original MKP weekend).  I
gave myself the blessing of access to this energy at any and all times.  Gave the same blessing to
the rest of the men in the circle, as if an energetic initiation.</p>

<p>Quite an amazing experience.  Wonderful for me.  Best one I've had since my initiation in
November 1997.</p>
