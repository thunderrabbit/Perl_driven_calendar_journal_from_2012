<p>Spent several minutes getting Rabby to act well in his cameo appearance in my Making of Marble
Track Three movie.  Last night I had had him propped up with pipe cleaners, but they were visible in
the frames, so I deleted those and reshot the scene this morning.  I think it's really funny, and
when I watched it by fast forwarding the pictures in my camera, I just laughed and laughed.</p>
