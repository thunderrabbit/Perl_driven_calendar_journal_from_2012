<p class="dream">Overheard a woman talking on her cell phone as we walked out of the school into
the U-turn  pickup area.  She said she was meeting Natalie, so I asked if she was meeting Ntalie
Ferris.</p>

<p class="dream">The woman didn't know her Natalie's last name, but I didn't give up there.  I askd
about the nature of their meeting.  &quot;What does Natalie like to do?&quot;  I asked.  &quot;My
Natalie likes salsa,&quot; I offered, after hearing they were going to meet for yoga.  &quot;I
guess we know different Natalies.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I kept hanging around, though, basically wanting to expand my people skills.  I
asked how they had met, but I don't remember the answer. Her Natalie arrived in the area and called
to complete the visual connection.</p>

<p class="dream">We saw her on the other side of the U-turn, and walked over to meet her.  After
they said HI, I was like, &quot;HI; I'm Rob,&quot; and &quot;I was wondering if I could join, if
that would be okay.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Natalie asked her two students what they thought, and when they said it would be
okay, I asked how much she would charge for one lesson.  Natalie said, &quot;ten dollars, so I
guess that's 1000 yen.&quot;  Ah; she hasn't been in Tokyo very long.</p>

<p class="dream">I said, &quot;excellent; I'd like to join,&quot; and as a joke, I gave her 1000
Vietnamese dong.  None of them noticed, but the original woman I had met said, &quot;it's actually
10,000 yen.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Natalie put the 1000 dong in her wallet, and I was like, &quot;wha?&quot; in my
mind, and then said, &quot;Okay wait; I have a little problem.&quot;  I first turned to Natalie,
&quot;you said 1000 yen, and as a joke I gave you 1000 dong.  I figured the others would notice
immediately and then i'd give you the correct amount.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I then turned to Natalie and the original woman.  &quot;But <em>she</em> says now
that it's 10,000 yen, and I must admit that at this time I choose not to pay that much for a
lesson, but I would like your card, so I can pay that much in the future.&quot;</p>
