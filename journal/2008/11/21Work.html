<p>Arrived back at work after Komatsu lesson to find my computer disconnected from the external
monitor.  Nothing to fear: Andrew installed ubuntu on one of the two machines we picked up a few
days ago.  Now it's officially allocated as my machine at work.  Yay ubuntu!</p>

<p>It's quite useable, though not as much like OS X as I imagine it's like MS Windows.  Andrew
deftly installed Eclipse and the PHP Projection (projection?) and then the remote file system thing
for Eclipse.  Soon enough I was editing and working on billing project again.  Even got some shtuff
done: merged two quite similar files, and removed the large chunk of mootools-enhanced javascript
from two files.  That code was more than half of each file, and almost identical in each one.  I
pulled that code into its own file, and made the necessary changes to let each main file include it.</p>

<p>Then found I had created a bug, and it took nearly as long to make the Task in Tracker as it did
to fix the bug, though, to be clear, it was in typing the task details that I realized what the bug
must be.  &quot;It was working before I did the file merges...&quot;  ah!  That's what happened.
Fixed the file.  done!</p>

<p>Sooner than later, 10pm arrived, and it turns out I didn't lie to Komatsu after all.   I worked
until 10pm.</p>
