<p>Lesson with れいか today at the cafe where I have lessons with ゆりか.  Actually れいか showed me
this cafe first, but ゆりか and I have met here more times, and more consistently.</p>

<p class="date">8:56pm JST</p>

<p>Lesson was fun; she's preparing for an interview with Square Ennix (sp), the game company that
made Final Fantasy and something else I've heard but not played.</p>

<p>I certainly hope she gets the job!  She's definitely on a great track for her chosen career
(international business, including translation and interpretation).</p>
