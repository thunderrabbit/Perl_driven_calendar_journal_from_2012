<p>I thought I had written some yesterday.</p>

<p>Finally finished some coding to the point that I could show someone, and basically say it's
useable.  There are a few issues in data input, but once data is in the DB, it's okay.</p>

<p>Two big issues are with automagic fill-in of data.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>when I click (add product) to add an item to the contract, a JSON query gets the allowed
products for this company, and inserts a list item (several fields in a table) into the list of
products on the screen, which includes a dropdown list of the actual product that will be invoiced
each month.</p>

<p>However, the price will only be written to the price field when the product selection field
is changed.  One imperfect solution would be to make the default &quot;please select&quot; so they
select a product and the price gets filled in.</p>

<p>The optimal solution would be to select the most common product *and* fill in its price.</p></li>

<li><p>Also, if I set some prices of products and then add *new* products, all the newly added
products are reset to the default, and their prices reset to &quot;&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I imagine these two issues are related.  Oh, in fact they *almost* have to be; they are the
same.  When I add produts, they are set without prices, and when I add products all the prices are
set to have no price.</p>

<p>Thanks.  THat helps me know where to find the bug.</p>

<p>In related news, having declared the contract creation page &quot;good enough,&quot; I moved on
to the invoice page, which will use mostly the same code.  Definitely the same objects and
functions, but just little tweaks because the invoice items have one extra field: the month field,
indicating for which month the item has been charged.  (the contract indicates in general if they
must pay ahead of time or after the fact, and the invoice remembers what month in particular.)</p>

<p>I'm going to think of a way to archive this source code; perhaps in my gmail would be an okay
place.  I can release it publically when it gets replaced...  There's a lot of code that I remember
writing but don't have anymore.  I've wanted to go back and look at my old code and be like
&quot;dayyyammm!&quot;</p>
