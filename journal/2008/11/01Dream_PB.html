<p class="dream">Had a chance to get a used table from a friend, so I solicited the help of some
friends to help me move it.  Richard (Kiwi) was helping move it when I arrived (late) with my group,
and he was upset.  I placed my hand on his chest and made eye contact with him for a few minutes as
he changed from hot and sweaty to normal; emotionally angry to spiritually enlightened; and from
Richard the Kiwi to Kim Sawyer, my warrior brother.</p>

<p class="dream">I then apologized to the group for making them wait <em>again</em>, thanked them
for their help, and suggested that if we get just one person on each corner of the table, we could
lift it easily, or two smaller people on each corner, and a girl went to the opposite end and just
picked it up, &quot;or one strong person to just get the other end,&quot; and we started to carry
it.</p>

<p class="dream">She wasn't as strong as I thought and she struggled a bit to carry it; I
considered asking for help again from the group, but didn't.</p>

<p class="dream">Riding in a train along a river, there were plenty of people on it, but no windows
to keep us all inside.  We could see down the cliff into the river, and I noted with some curiosity
(and excitement) that PB was sailing along the river.  It looked really far away; farther away than
the river itself (or the river must be really wide?)</p>

<p class="dream">The train driver announced something about waterfalls that I didn't understand,
and then suddenly I couldn't see PB, because the river was right up at our level; because I had been
looking back at the ship, I didn't see the water falls!  The train turned to cross the higher
elevation river, so we could see the water flowing off to the right of the train, off the face of
the cliff.</p>

<p class="dream">Rolling across some islands in the water, we went by a family of kangaroos, one of
whom was a really cute blonde girl with kangaroo body (a centauroo?), who waved to the train as we
passed by.  She saw how the train had no sides, so she suggested helpfully: &quot;be careful!&quot;
as we passed by, even though normally she would just wave like a character in a theme park.</p>

<p class="dream">I said I was being careful, but then noted another equally cute woman on the train,
just in front of me; under the guise of being helpful, I scooped my arm around her waist to ensure
she said on the train.</p>

<p class="dream">As we progressed, I wondered if it was appropriate to have my arm around her, but
she didn't seem to mind, so I just stayed there.  Nice.</p>

<p class="dream">Arrived a a party, someone announced we could see PB, which was parked in the
river, visible from an onsen.  I was all excited like, &quot;really? where? where?&quot; because it
was my first time in this area.</p>

<p class="dream">A guy pointed and was like, &quot;roughly that way,&quot; pointing up a hill, so I
started out, taking a dirt road that led roughly that way.  He was like, &quot;no nononono,&quot; as
if I should have known better.</p>

<p class="dream">And I was like, &quot;fahkoff, so show me,&quot; and he proceeded to walk straight
down the little slope to go up the hill.  I realized I had forgotten my camera in my haste to
follow, but he had one in his pocket and threw it back to me.  We were soon climbing up a rickety
ladder with a goat standing on it.  He made it past the goat, and I made it past the goat more
quickly, and then past my friend.  As we arrived at the top of the ladder, I realized we were in the
onsen area, with two naked old Japanese men standing in the water up to their knees, looking at us
as if we might be invading their space.</p>

<p class="dream">We remained quiet, to support the atmosphere, but then everything changed when I
saw the ship.  She was there, just beyond the onsen, chillin' in a nub of the river fed by the
onsen runoff.  The onsen remained, and a dinner party appeared around it, complete with cocktail
dresses and a grand piano. I started taking pictures, but couldn't get very good shots, so I
started running as I kicked off my shoes behind the grand piano and arrived on the other side of
the ship, where I called to the driver (the ship was just a speed boat now), asking him to turn
sideways so I could see the PB logo.</p>

<p class="dream">He did, and I took pictures, listening to the sound of the click to know it had
taken.  The lighting was low, so I tried to keep the PB logo in place in the viewfinder as the
light meter ticked up from 0.00 to 10.00 in about 2 seconds.  I wasn't able to hold it quite
correctly, but a few times I got some nearly crisp shots of the ship.  I knew there should be a way
to set the flash correctly, but didn't know how to do it.</p>
