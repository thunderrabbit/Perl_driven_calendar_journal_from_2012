<p class="dream">To give the cow a taste of her own medicine, he gently pushed with the two scoops
of a front loader on the cow's butt, making the cow lean closer toward the fire.  The cow started to
squeal like a cat, but was no match for the mass and strength of the front loader.  He then pulled
the cow back, equally far away from the fire, and the cow continued to squeal like a cat.  Because
moving the cow away from the fire was less dangerous than toward the fire, he kept pulling until
the cow was forced to sit down on its haunches like a dog.  Then with the front loader, he gently
lifted it back up to its feet.</p>
