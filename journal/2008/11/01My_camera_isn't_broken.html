<p>Not that I ever wrote that it *was* broken, but I'm happy to report that my camera
is <em>not</em> broken.  I dropped it last night, and it seemed to work okay after that.  But today
when I tried to turn it on, I heard some small but ominous clicks coming from the lens movement
mechanism.  I torque and banged the camera a few times to try to get it to work, and then</p>

<p>it wouldn't come on at all.</p>

<p>Damn.  damn damn damn.  I didn't really plan to buy a new camera just yet.  Within a year, but
not *this* year.</p>

<p>I thought it <em>could</em> be the battery, so I charged it, but with the careful realization
that it might not work when I put the battery back in.</p>

<p>So, a few hours later, I giggled happily when it <em>did</em>, in fact, work, when I put the
charged battery back in.</p>
