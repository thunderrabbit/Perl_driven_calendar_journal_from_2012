<p>So, the first thing I did was come back and clean my room a tiny tiny tiny tiny bit.  Basically,
in the past 2 hours, I have thrown away three magazines (got at the &quot;Healing Fair&quot; back in
August(?) and never read), AND I spent some quality time by the &quot;creek&quot; (drainage ditch)
collecting soil for a plant that has been slowly growing for a bit over a year now (in harsh
conditions).</p>

<p>I uploaded the pic to Flickr and Smugmug.  The Smugmug version hasn't shown up yet.</p>

<p>Okay, time to clean my room some more.</p>
