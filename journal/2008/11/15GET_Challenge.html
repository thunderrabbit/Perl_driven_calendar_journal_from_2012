<p>My group = me, Erika (from my shy-girl-class on 52nd voyage), Madoka (who I barely remember from
52nd voyage), and Eiji, who has been leading the way point by point down the list of scavenger hunt
items, to what I predict will be our overall loss, because we're not seeking to do the questions
worth multiple points (5 vs 1).</p>

<p>Erika is shy as before, though she has asked me a few questions.</p>

<p>Food time now.</p>

<p>Back at the GET office, we were the first to arrive, so I gave us an extra 5 point bonus.  Our
team got like 48 points, coming in 4th place (of 6).  Described our adventures to each other and 83
year old Taki was given the floor to speak for &quot;10 minutes&quot; though we were asked to do 1
minute.</p>

<p>I gave my email address to Madoka and Eiji.  Madoka seems likely to pay me for doing a homework
checking service for her.  We might meet up, but probably not because we live pretty far apart.  I
hope e-checking homework works out nicely for both of us.</p>

<p>I helped clean up and broke a glass.  We joked about how that's a good way to get out of doing
dishes.  But most notably, I didn't feel the least bit negative about it.  No
sadness/embarrassment/guilt/shame ..  nothing.  Broke the glass; Ozaco helped me clean it up; I
found a few more bits of glass and threw them away.  Done.</p>

<p>I think I would have felt differently had it happened before my last I-group.</p>
