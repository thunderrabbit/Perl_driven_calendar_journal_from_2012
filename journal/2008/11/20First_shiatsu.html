<p>On Monday I was scheduled to go to Sasazaka station (I think) to have my first experience with
shiatsu.  However, I cut it too close and due to train lateness (it happens a bit in rush hour) I
didn't make it to Inokashira line until 9:22 or something, and called the guy (Kimura) saying I'd be 5 or 10
minutes late.  He said therefore it was impossible, and I could reschedule.</p>

<p>I rescheduled for today, and I told him, &quot;I *absolutely* will be on time,&quot; meaning I
wouldn't be late.</p>

<p>It's now 8:40am, and we're arriving in 中目黒.  渋谷 is only 2 stops away, and then change to 井の
頭線 (Inokashira line) (*), go two stations to 明大前, change to somethin-somethin' line and go one
stop to Sasazaka (it's Sasa-somethin') (**).  Unless the big earthquake (***) comes within 20
minutes, I'll be there on time.</p>
