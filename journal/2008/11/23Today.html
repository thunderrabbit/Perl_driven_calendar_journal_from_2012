<p>Ami came over today after she cleaned her house and received 10,000 yen from her dad.  I'm sure
she didn't clean it any more than she does every week; perhaps he's trying to make up for something
or show his appreciation a bit.</p>

<p>Ami brought some lunch for me and I thanked her with a bit of a massage instead of a bit of
shiatsu, which I explained had *not* be explained to me yet; I had just gotten one shiatsu session,
and need to schedule myself for the classes.</p>

<p>Today featured a nice nap, bookended with two nice romps, the second of which was probably the
rompiest Ami and I have achieved.</p>

<p>I had some extensive dreams during the nap, but don't remember them now.</p>

<p>Ami and I went to the Indian restaurant where Keiko and I went (on the other side of ¸µ½»µÈ from
here) and felt plenty stuffed with just cheese nan and curry.  I got veggie, and she got something
else.  I also got lassi and she got a beer.</p>

<p>Back home I showed Ami the zaniness of Southpark's &quot;The China Probrem&quot; from season 12,
cause Ami had me cracking up when she imitated the stereotypical look of Japanese from the American
point of view: big front teeth and squinty eyes.  I was like, &quot;stoppit stoppit!&quot; cause I
was about to spew.</p>
