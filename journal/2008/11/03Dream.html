<p class="dream">As I walked down the grassy hill toward the ship, I could overhear the
instructions from the organizer:</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;now we're going to give you some free time, but we'd like you to meet some
new people while you're at it.  Since most of you are twenty-something, for the older members, I
hope you don't mind being with some slightly hyperactive kids.  To that end, we'd like you all to
contemplate how long you'd like to stay out: just write down the number of hours, or write down the
hour you'd like to come back.   Just make sure it's before we leave tomorrow at 7pm!&quot;</p>
