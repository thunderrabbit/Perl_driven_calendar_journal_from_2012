<p>Helma, who was disallowed re-entry recently,'s stuff has now been moved out of her apartment, and
will be delivered to my apartment tomorrow evening after 8pm.  Total cost of operation: 2 hours'
travel, 1 hour packing, 2 hours waiting for pickup-guy, 4430 yen.</p>

<p>Total benefits of operation: food: 10 raisins, some nuts, crackers, box of granola; my choice of
several books; 2 hours to read _Bleeding Sun_; a chance to help my friend take care of biznass; 
a chance to help a woman find exit 14; a chance to tell another woman that yes, this train stops in
Âå´±»³.</p>

<p>Next stop, Âå´±»³, and next next next next next next next next next next stop after that is mine,
¸µ½»µÈ, and head home to sleep and read and chill.  Hopefully see °¡Èþ tonight, too.</p>
