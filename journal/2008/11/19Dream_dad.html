<p class="dream">About to go sailing with my dad, on a rather large cruise ship, we were waiting
for the ship to arrive, but we were *not* in a port facility, nor even on a dock.  Simply on a
steep sandly slope that fortunately was not getting into my clothes despite having sat in the
sand.  I noted the sand was wet, but remembered I was wearing snow pants, so perhaps they were
waterproofingly keeping the water from the sand from soaking through to my butt.</p>

<p class="dream">Around the point toward the right on this penninsula, we saw a large ship with
KONAMI written on the side, offloading stuff directly to their sports facility.  I was a bit
surprised they didn't use the port, but decided it must be a lot cheaper to just haul their
equipment up the hill, instead of hiring trucks to carry it across town.  That gym equipment is
heavy by its very nature!</p>

<p class="dream">Dad was playing on the sloping beach, causing an occassional slump of sand down
toward the sea when he got to close to the steep part of the hill.  After a bit, I could feel the
sand eroding from under me, so I suggested that we move up a bit.  Dad suddenly noted that he too
was slipping, and I took his hand to pull him up.  He had just gotten off work, so was wearing a
striped gray suit, and had some papers in his hand.  Likewise, I held the book I had been reading,
_Bleeding Sun_, and didn't want to get that wet.  So we inched our way up the hill, me crabwalking
using my two feet, butt and left elbow as my left hand held the book, and my right arm extended to
grab my dad's right hand, while he climbed forward up the hill, using both feet and his left
elbow.</p>

<p class="dream">We reminded me of some sort of robot contraption, and I thought it might be easier
if we had just put our respective reading material down, but then I realized the folly; they would
get soaked!  We made it up the hill to stable ground and I noted that a lot of people had
accumulated, watching our climbing effort with some interest.</p>

<p class="dream">One guy spoke up, something like, &quot;Now, check out these two, working hard to
make it up the hill while not getting themselves dirty.  A great effort required for such a
skill!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">My dad chimed in &quot;yeah!&quot; with a tone of voice that says he's simply
trying to make conversation, but didn't hear the details of what was said.</p>

<p class="dream">The guy continued, &quot;all because our government decided not to build a dock
for us.  Mother fuckers.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">My dad thought the guy was making fun of us, and was suddenly wishing he hadn't
said anything until he knew what had been the guy's intention.  I tried to explain, without drawing
attention, that the guy was just angry about the lack of a dock, and was using our hard work as an
example, and we shouldn't be embarrassed nor ashamed of anything; we're here having a great time!
Who cares what he thinks!</p>
