<p class="note">(written 9:56am JST Thursday 27 November 2008 (day 14127))</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to lunch with Travis and Cynthia, a cute Brazilian woman (whose name features
Brazilian pronunciation like, &quot;sheencha&quot;), whose manner reminds me of Charyl Teal.  She's
getting a Master's degree in ¤¬¤¶¤ï (or something), which we might call swimming crabs in English.
She said there are two basic types of crabs, and they have different names in Brazilian.</p>

<p>This was my third lunch at Legato: 1000 yen for a sandwich, a bit of soup, and a cute salad
buffet with nice quality, but limited selection.  Souper Salad is 50 times better, but this place
has a high ceiling, and the glass elevator to the 15th floor offers a nice view of Shibuya.  No
such view where we were sitting in the restaurant, but still a good time was had.</p>

<p>Travis came up with an idea for a website that should be pretty easy, and strictly speaking
hasn't been done yet, though the domain has just recently expired.  I doubt we will do it; several
people have had the idea.   Actually he <em>can't</em> do it right now; his contract with work
forbids him from doing *any* programming outside of work.  Gah.</p>

<p>Cynthia was left out of the conversation a bit while he and I talked about how we could do the
site, and some concerns about legal action taken against the site, but she said she enjoyed
watching us so excited about it.</p>

<p>Talked about the upcoming hike, and debated how cold it may or may not be.  Cynthia said she was
cold outside today, and then hot when we arrived in Legato.  We razzed her a bit about that.</p>

<p>They talked about Brazilian music that's played in Tokyo (better than &quot;Brazilian
music&quot; played in Brazil), and I asked Cynthia if she knew about afro reggae, a band / social
movement I had the great pleasure of meeting and watching in Rio when PB stopped there around
February 2006 (I think).  Cyn said Rio is one city she's never visited.</p>
