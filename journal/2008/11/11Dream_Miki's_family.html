<p class="dream">In a vehicle on a highway, sitting along the sides of the carriage.  No one had to
drive.  I found out that the amazing tour we had of the city via ship yesterday was arranged by the
mom of the family, so I thanked her profusely, and mentioned to her husband that he was lucky.</p>

<p class="dream">I was showing off my life-sized marble track to the group, and one guy crawled in
to see it in more detail.  I had parts of i covered with cloth for the party, so he couldn't see
where to step.  He stood on a part that was only thin wood, and it cracked as I
told him as he fell through.  I said not to worry about it; there were no marble track bits on that
part of the track.  The structure was basically made of three wooden pallets as in a grocery store,
all connected in a vertical stack, like shelves.</p>

<p class="dream">Miki offered me another slice of pizza.  Her sister was there and offered me some
chocolate topping.  I took the chocolate topping with my fingers and tried to eat it.  Miki was a
bit shocked, &quot;can you do that???&quot; but i couldn't answer as I was eating.  I had a slight
spill and got chocolate on my face.  I laughingly answered her, &quot;therefore, no.  I can't do
it.&quot;  She giggled and I smeared a bit of chocolate on her face and she laughed.</p>

<p class="dream">So great to see Miki so happy.</p>
