<p class="dream">In Tamara's experimental greenhouse, which was combined with her house, and
featured all sorts of plants, mostly flowers, and bags of seeds and beakers and decanters of a
biological laboratory, I was talking to her about possibly combining my seed with hers, to, just
for experiment's sake, see what kind of offspring would be produced.  I literally was thinking
altruistically, and believed this experiment could be done without violating any social norms, nor
agreements made with others.  As we got into the details of how it would work, I began to realize
it would require a direct deposit, as opposed to a combination in the lab.  At first I was like,
&quot;ooh; this is great news!&quot; and then I remembered the agreement I had recently made with
Ami, and realized I shouldn't do this experiment, although I seriously considered doing it anyway,
under the scientific endeavor of research.</p>

<p class="dream">Tamara began making preparations for the connection, and I began mulling over in
my head if I could complete the task and what I would say afterward.  Decided I probably shouldn't
do it.  Just as it was too late, I realized I *could* do it, for there would be no reproductions
nor reprecussions, but it was too late; Tamara had left.</p>
