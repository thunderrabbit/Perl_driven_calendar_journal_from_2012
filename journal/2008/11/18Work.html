<p>Progressing at work.  Have seemed quite slow recently to get past the part where I had used
mootools to populate some fields; that same code is now being used to display fields of records
that are in the DB already <em>and</em> fields of records that are added on-the-fly, either as
products or discounts.</p>

<p>AND the same code will be used to do the same thing for invoices: draw on the fly or from DB.
And the DB items will be either editable or not depending on their status in the DB.</p>

<p>In other news, Malek has written a new time tracking system (&quot;Tracker&quot;) because he
didn't like the system I had Sach install in Trac, and now he wants us to move all our items from
Trac over to Tracker.</p>

<p>It's hard for me not to see this as a waste of time.</p>

<p>Basically I just made a new item that's basically just to accumulate time in Tracker with all
the deets in Trac.</p>
