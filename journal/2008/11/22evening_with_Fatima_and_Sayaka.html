<p>I heard some activity downstairs (a bit rare for this apartment), so I went down and found Fatima
cooking dinner.  I had been cleaning my room, and went down to wash the jar of tahini and honey that
I got from Helma.  (The tahini oil had seeped a bit.)  I chatted with Fatima a bit in a hybrid
mostly based on English, but with some Japanese and occassional French and Spanish words for
punctuation.  The basic topic, &quot;I'll miss you so much!&quot; because Fatima is leaving in a
week; her byebye party is this Friday.</p>

<p>Her best friend Sayaka was over from せたま (Fatima's pronunciation).  I was like,
&quot;where?&quot; and eventually realized, &quot;ohhhh!  さいたま!&quot; and eventually Sayaka
came out of Fatima's room, lured by the (mis)pronunciation of her prefecture.</p>

<p>&quot;Saitama?  Saitama?  My name is Sayaka; nice to meet you.&quot; her English is a level or
two above Fatima's.  We all chatted a bit; it was probably more conversation than I had had with
Fatima ever, combined.  Sayaka told me she learned her English through TV and movies; she had the
occassional plural mistake and missing some vocabulary, but I was generally impressed; I thought
she had lived overseas to achieve her level of chatability.</p>

<p>Sayaka lives with her parental units in Saitama, but wants to move closer to Tokyo.  Fatima
mentioned U-Cow and I headed upstairs to get him, and ended up telling a brief story of Francois in
Japanese.  Hmmm; my Japanese is getting better.</p>

<p>Fatima cooked what amounted to hearty vegetable stew with chicken, and handily fed Sayaka and I
as well.  Wow!  I had thought the finishing of cooking would mean they two would eat and I would
retire to my room.  I offered some tahini (they both hated it, so it was a good thing I had said,
&quot;just try a bit first!  you might hate it..&quot;)</p>

<p>Fatima and Sayaka met via Fatima's work at GAS PANIC in Roppongi; a lot of the conversation
centered around the pros and cons of working there.  Apparently people in Gas Panic Club are drunker
than in Gas Panic Bar, so Fatima would regularly find money (thousands of yen (tens of dollars) in
bills on the floor) when she worked in the club.  She's not that big of a girl though, so she
eventually got moved to the bar, where it was less crowded, but unfortunately fewer cash perks.</p>

<p>Sayaka got cold, so Fatima offered her Zima to warm her up.  &quot;Alcohol?&quot; no, Fatima has
a Zima-branded suit that I'd guess is Power Rangers, but bet more money that I'm wrong.  Got some
pictures of her with U-Cow.</p>

<p>Ulrike came home and sat with us; I was a good enough host to unfold the chair that had been
leaning against the wall.  Her parents are coming to town tomorrow(!) for two weeks, and her
boyfriend Florian will be here on February 8, and then they'll go home to Germany on March 1, but on
separate flights.</p>

<p>When Ulrike left, the party finished itself.</p>
