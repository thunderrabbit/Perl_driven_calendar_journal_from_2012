<p class="dream">Flying over a football field, I knew I could do anything I wanted, but had a
little bit of trouble flying.</p>

<p class="dream">As the teacher in an unruly classroom, I went from classrom to classroom handing
out test pamphlets for the students to take a test.  I would give out a few at a time to students
and say &quot;pass them on; we're going to take a test.&quot; and they would hand them to the few
students around them. The classrooms were dispersed throughout the floor, and the students sort
haphazardly scattered throughout the area, so there wasn't an easy way to pass out the
pamphlets.</p>

<p class="dream">I saw Jackie Purdy and gave her a kiss, saying &quot;you're exempt from the
test.&quot; and then by way of explanaion, &quot;my dream, my choice,&quot; and everyone agreed I
could do what I wanted in my dreams.</p>

<p class="dream">So another girl was like, &quot;so if you want, you can have sex with me?&quot;
and I was like, &quot;absolutely,&quot; and I gave her a kiss and told her to take off her clothes,
which she did happily.  I entered her missionary style and everything was good for a bit but then I
lost my erection as something else distracted me in the dream.</p>

<p class="dream">Two more times I came back to this girl and tried again, first with a kiss and her
affections toward me, but then when it was due course for intercourse I had very little staying
power, just losing interest instead of making her lose her mind.</p>

<p class="dream">Laura Wallace was coming home, and I gave her a kiss and helped her get ready for
bed because she had had a long day.  Her mom and dad remembered me so I said HI to them, and they
left us alone to talk for a bit.</p>

<p class="dream">I had a chance to design two sections of a roller coaster and they were added to the ride.</p>

<p class="dream">I was sitting at the top of a hill overlooking the ride, pretty excited that t was working, and
wanting to go down and ride.  The coaster came by, and someone was asking how the coaster driver was
trained, as if the first person in the train was controlling it.</p>

<p class="dream">A new train line was being tested; it worked fine as the train rolled through new sections of
tracks in warehouses.  The tracks were temporary, made of plastic.  The train was working just fine
and then suddenly it went past all its other stops to the end of the line as the announcer guy
said, &quot;uh sorry; we have a problem with the train so we're going to the end of the line where
you can get off and onto a new train.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I knew they were lying because the train was working just fine; they just wanted
to get us all off the train in the wrong area so we would have to use the train again to get back.
A new train came, with cameras watching it and people walking all over the track in its wake.  They
had made a big media event out of it, so I knew it would take a while.  I just started walking down
the hill toward where the train would go so I could save a few hundred yen by catching the train
for a shorter duration.  I noted the tracks were even less permanent; just plastic crossties with
grooves in them for the wheels.  Then the tracks made a hard right turn by extending some really
long ties to the next warehouse.  I was surprised at this, knowing the train cars couldn't make a
right turn and I realized they must not turn here, but just slide sideways one car at a time.</p>
