<p class="date">10:18am JST Tuesday  4 November 2008 (day 14104)</p>

<p>Ran a bit to catch my train; I left at 10:08 and caught the 10:18 train.  Plus, I got a seat in
the front carriage so I can write.</p>

<p>Interesting realization during my meditation: I seem to lose track of my awareness of meditation
at the same time that I begin to see visual dream-images (as opposed to simple brain chatter).</p>

<p>Not sure how they're related, but they seemed to happen at the same time, though this morning I
quickly noticed most that happened.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>I sent a bug report to iStopMotion maker Boinx: a misspelling in their app, a broken link to
support form in their faq, and that I'm having trouble making a movie in portrait mode (as opposed
to landscape): though my images' exif data says they should be rotated, the importer in iStopMotion
doesn't respect that.  Also I can't make the movie taller than 576 pixels, but that's not such a
big deal.</p>

<p>That's about it for this morning.  oh I woke up from an almost-sex dream.</p>

<p class="dream">walking toward Sabrina on the couch, who was sitting by her boyfriend.  Even
though he was there, we were still intent on some fellatio action.  She started to take off my
shorts</p>

<p>when I woke up.</p>

<p>Okay; I'm going to jump over to the supa-express train and read some.</p>
