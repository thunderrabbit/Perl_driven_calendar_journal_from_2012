<p>On the train with a couple minutes to spare.  Going all the way to Korakuen, which used to take
me several changes and stuff to reach, but it turns out I lived right near Meguro line that goes straight
there (changing into Nanboku Line on the way).</p>

<p>The station is like 2 stops from Natalia's house, so I may go bug her tomorrow after the class.</p>

<p>This is my second RV class.  Kevin [wa|i]s the instructor in each case, but this one will be
focused just on CRV, which stands for something I've forgotten.  Because there were only threee
participants signed up last week, he cancelled the big room and got a small room, plus cancelled
(the beautiful) Tomoe, his professional interpreter, and Kevin's wife Yuki is doing the translation.
In the past week, though 7 people joined the class... so we're all &quot;cramped&quot; in this
relatively small room.  It could hold 8 pretty easily, but we've squeeze in one more table.</p>

<p>Robert from Poland, who took the ATE course some months ago, is here, and Christine, who I met at
Hari's Building Your Antikarahna (sp) some more months ago is equally here.</p>

<p>On Meguro Line, about to be in Âç²¬»³, after just saying by to Robert who got off a moment ago.</p>

<p>The course was okay today, but basically a lot of repeatin' for me because I've taken the course
already.  I just want to do the practices.  I jumped to doing Stage Three when the class was just
doing Stage Two, and ended up getting some pretty good data in a couple of cases.</p>

<p>I'm sorta able to tell if the data is coming from the right place to be good data, or if it's my
outer brain just adding BS to the target.</p>

<p>I say that now, but after hearing repeatedly from Kevin and inderectly from Joe (who have done
1000s of times more RV sessions than I have), it seems unlikely that I'd really be able to tell
good data from bad data.  But I'm glad to think it's true for now.</p>

<p>After the class, Kevin, Robert and I went to an Indian restaurant with pretty reasonable prices
(compared to the Ebisu restaurant) and yummy yum yums.</p>
