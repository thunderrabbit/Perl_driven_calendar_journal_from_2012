<p>Yesterday I got jungledisk set up on this machine (new ubuntu machine at work) (instead of using
my personal computer at work (I had been using my machine at Across (my choice; they had M$ only)),
and here, almost my choice, but now they got some extra machines), so I've been listening to my
music while programming on the billing system.</p>

<p>Today I got the invoices saving correctly and can create a new invoice, and now working on
getting the one-off invoices to work.  I need to add a field to the invoice table (to tell its
status) which will be used to tell if the invoice is editable or not, and if it's been sent, paid,
or overdue.</p>

<p>Previously I was just allowing edits if this was the most recent invoice in the contract, but now
with one-off invoices, there is no contract.</p>

<p>Things are going faster now that I've pretty much gotten past all the mootools stuff getting the
product names filled in on the new invoice and new contract pages.</p>

<p>Just in case somethin' crazy happens, I'm bringing my computer to the meeting.</p>

<p>Nothing crazy, but semi-predicted, but not for the reasons I thought.</p>

<p>Basically I'm going to keep working here through December, and then take a break of sorts,
hopefully including making $9000 as a guinea pig, and definitely including playing with Fred.  I'm
thrilled about that aspect of it!</p>

<p>The reason is *not* because the billing project has taken longer than I had predicted, but
because the first project, for which I was brought in to code, has been simmering, and is now
officially on hold, until, perhaps March (I'd be impressed if it was that fast), but.</p>

<p>I told Malek the timing is basically perfect: if I continue working through December, I'll get
paid in January, and then perhaps get PAAAIIIID in late January, and then just fart around and do
whatever I want for a bit until I get a new job.  I've got several connections now, so I'm not too
worried about that.</p>
