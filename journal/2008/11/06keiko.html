<p>Met Keiko from PB 49 at 8pm at Motosumiyoshi.  Indian restaurant for dinner (really great
restaurant; I'll definitely go there again!) and then went to her house to chat while I sewed up a
hole in the pocket of my snow pants, through which my cellphone had fallen twice recently.</p>

<p>Keiko and I reminisced about 49th voyage and times we've gone out since then.  She said a really
nice thing, basically no matter how far apart we are, we'll always be close.  True.  True.</p>

<p>She said HI to Ami.</p>
