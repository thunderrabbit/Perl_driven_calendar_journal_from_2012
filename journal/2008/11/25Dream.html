<p class="dream">Saw Adam Lock walking away from me down the hall.  I knew he might be drafted to
the war soon, so I gave him a long-distance reiki blessing to help him come back intact.  I
pretended to be asleep when he arrived at my room to say bye, but I hoped he would talk to me to
wake me up.  He didn't, but just said a silent goodbye, and then left.  I woke up a bit later,
wondering where I had left my suitcase.  I got up, put a red towel around my birthday suit and
found my suitcase was already on my bed; I had been using it as a pillow.  The room in which I had
slept was rather large for just one person.  I went to another room and turned on the light.  Gene
was in there sleeping, so I tried to turn off the light, but the switch wasn't working the way I
thought it would.  Finally got the switch turned off, and then went into the main room where the
plan for the day was being explained to everyone.  How did I not know about this meeting?  Why
didn't anyone wake everyone up before the meeting?  I guess it's okay to sleep through it given
that Gene and someone else was still sleeping. </p>

<p class="dream">I couldn't hear anything in the meeting anyway, but Mandy Jacobson on TV reacted to me
coming into the room, so I waved back at her, and then Abbey Tennis started speaking as Mandy Jacobson
on TV started holding up a beaker of transluscent black liquid.  Abbey said, &quot;earlier today we
showed this brown liquid, but it appears black on the TV.&quot;  I wasn't sure what was the point of
this information, but they explained it.</p>
