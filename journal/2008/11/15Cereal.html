<p>I'm chowing granola and soy milk (though it's slow going because it takes a while to chew
properly!) before heading out to a GET Challenge road ramble (using trains) from Akihabara to
Takadanobaba.  I'm glad to still be connected to PB energy.  Nat and Tony will be there, plus
Ozaco, Pania, Jeremy, and Maho.  Looking forward to big hugs from Tony and Nat!</p>
