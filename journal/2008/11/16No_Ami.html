<p>Ami called; she's got too much shit to do tonight to come visit.</p>

<p>Parts of me want to get pissed at her dad for having given Ami the impression that if she
doesn't get it finished, he'll yell at her.</p>

<p>Pissed at Japanese culture for not letting people take care of themselves emotionally.</p>

<p>I tried to call Natalie so I could bitch to someone.  I considered calling Jen; I considered
calling Keiko; I considered calling Kevin; I considered calling David.  I think I'll call Akiko, my
most-English fluent Japanese friend (who's phone number I know) who can hopefully give a bit of
insight on what exactly Japanese funerals are all about.  I guess I could call the Internet and ask
it, but I'll try Akiko first..</p>

<p>Nat called me back before I called anyone else.  Nice.</p>
