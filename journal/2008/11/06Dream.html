<p class="dream">With some rebels from some arm in a field in a neighborhood, chilling on a picknic
bench, one of them fired a missile from our location to a location on the other side of the houses
from us.  A big arc of smoke showed exactly the trail of the missle, but when it detonated,
destroying all the area over there, no one knew it came from our group, except for our bosses who
kept telling us (Jei) not to do that.  He replied each time that he understood, and then immediately
did it again.  </p>

<p class="dream">They radioed him again and he said it was an accident.  This time we saw the
victims: some dark skinned guy with full beard and no shirt ran out of his house and yelled toward
the fire fighters to spray him with their hoses to douse him so the imminent explosion wouldn't
kill him.</p>

<p class="dream">They sprayed his front side, and he turned around and they sprayed his back.  He
ran out of the scene and then we saw the explosion from afar, brighter than the first time.  ONe of
the guys commented, &quot;was that a 50 megaton?&quot;  And Jei goes &quot;yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I decided I didn't want to be near these guys anymore, so I started to leave.
They were like, &quot;where you going?&quot; cause we were trapped inside this cafeteria sized
room.  I was like, &quot;I can fly,&quot; and I flew up toward the ceiling (where I had to be
careful of some high tension wires) and they were all, &quot;whoah!  he can fly!  he can fly!&quot;
and they were thinking I must have some secret occult powers that they wanted.  I had no plans to
give them any such power, so I blassted out through the brick wall of the auditorium and basically
went horizontally through the building, smashing through wall after wall.</p>

<p class="dream">I noted with some curiosity that I normally flew vertically through floor-ceiling
after floor-ceiling.  I was having a bit of trouble getting my full flying power to come, so I
remained fairly affected by gravity, and ended up in a room on the far side of the building.</p>

<p class="dream">I thought, &quot;I'll say in here where I'll have just three crumbs of food,&quot;
but was a bit surprised/happy to see there were actually three hamburgers in the room, discarded
yet intact on the floor.  I explored around the room a bit and noted a propane stove was left
burning, and another open flame was in the corner of the room.  I turned off the flame in the sink,
and noted its nozzle protective grill was still red hot.</p>

<p class="dream">Around that time, Sarah from OZ came into the room and started fighting/wrestling with me,
as we both knew the red hot item could be used as a weapon.  I was surprised by her strength, but
then I did something caressing, and had a little fondle and sucked gently on her nipple.  She
relented and we began to kiss and make out.</p>
