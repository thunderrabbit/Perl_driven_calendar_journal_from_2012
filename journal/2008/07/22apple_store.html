<p>wrong form at post office despite translation via phone.  and it
took so long. hard to understand what they didnt understand.</p>

<p>Met Sumiyo at Apple store and helped her English a bit. She said I
was a good teacher so I said I was lookin for students and she said
she'd seriously consider it.</p>

<p>I told her 3000 yen per hour, but then was thinking I shoulda
lowered it, or mentioned the first lesson is free, or 2 hours for 5000
yen, etc..</p>

<p>Anyway, I've seen her there before; I'll see her again.</p>
