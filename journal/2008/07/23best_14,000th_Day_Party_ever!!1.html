<p>Best party ever!</p>

<p>I'm really happy that so many people came...  First Travis and I
were there, with a bunch of empty chairs, and then Ami brought two
friends and then a few more people came (detailed below), and I
thought we had reached max capacity when in rolled a buncha peeps from
ultimate!!  Woooo!!  Jenny with a G, Doug with a G, Mira with Ellie,
plus Luke from outside the city, and Hisa which means knee!  They were
hot n sweaty after the weekly night game, and fortunately got to sit
in front of the air conditioner, so that worked out well.</p>

<p>Earlyish in the evening, Keiko from PB 49 brought me a present as
well as her friend Mari, and they sat at the table with Ami's two
friends and had a lovely time in Japanese (I imagine).  When I
narrated my paintings to Keiko and Mari, I found out that Keiko lives
super close to me!  Wow!</p>

<p>A bit later Maruan with two of his friends arrived: Aika and Jeff
(sp), and a bit later lovely Kyoko came to fill out their table.</p>

<p>Natalia had to work late; she came just after Maruan had been
wincing until the Dr Sketchy's model was all-but nudely posed on the
front stage.  She welcomed the good fortune of fleshy eye candy then
met everyone and joined the table with Ami and friends.</p>

<p>Natalie had to work even later; she finished out the guest list and
arrived before 11pm (as promised by phone today) and I super hugged
her sooper hugely!  She bought _Two Weeks_ while Natalia bought _Alone
on the Alien Highway_.  So those are in addition to Ami buying _Heart
Center_, Akiko buying _Party_, Rimi starting off the sales on Sunday
by buying _Blind Lines_.</p>

<p>I must say, the most comments were received on _Blind Lines_, which
quite surprises me, cause it's one of the least imaginative.  I wonder
why it seems to draw so much attention.  It's definitely bold in its
orangeness.  Could that be it??</p>

<p>I also noted that _Island_ got the most comments in terms of what I
agree was artistic in its creation.  A lot of people were attracted to
that one, which is my favorite of the big pieces.  I can totally see
why: it's got details and details and details that just keep coming
out.  Jenny with a G said she liked wondering what I was thinking with
the various shapes and curves.  She saw a bunch of sea life in its
swirls.  Natalie liked it best, citiing its detail.  Mmmm good to
know.</p>

<p>I think Megumi was lookin' at that one pretty closely as well on
Sunday.</p>

<p>Doug liked _The Pen Slipped_, but chose to let it stay available
for another buyer.  I'm glad he likes it, though I wonder if he'd like
it more if it was more technically perfect (though it would then need
a new name).</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to have a great time, and I certainly did, flitting
around the various tables and chatting with peeps and generally having
a ball of it all.</p>

<p>And the presents; oh the presents!  Ami got me one of the thin new
Apple keyboards, which I'm using now to type this entry.  It's the big
full keyboard, with wire so it's lighter, larger, and needs no
batteries.  She also got me a set of Japanese study books, geared
toward passing the annual Japanese proficiency tests (level 3 and
level 2).  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>AND, Ami got me a secret, though I know not what, yet.</p>

<p>Everyone rolled home around last train, and I got some bonus hugs
from Mari after I noted that her hugs were quite huggy compared to
most I-met-you-today hugs.  Natalie was last to leave; we got some
bonus minutes together walking to the Tokyu Toyoko line with PB's
boarding limit on my brain, and Ami's new shoes keeping her lagging
behind us.  Natalie made her train, and then I went back to get Ami.
We made Natalie's train as well!  So some extra bonus minutes with
Natalie as we rolled home to Kosugi singing "don'tcha wish your
girlfriend was hot like me?" and me-n-Ami おりました in Kosugi and waved
waved waved to Natalie on toward Yokohama and home.</p>
