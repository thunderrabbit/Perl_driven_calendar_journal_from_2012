<b>'lost my marbles'</b>

<pre> I honestly have lost my marbles over your marble tracks. They
are a great inspiration and i am seriously considering starting to
make tracks. I have a lot of free time on my hands and i have nothing
to do so i think it will be great.

I was just wondering what you use to make your tracks and if the
materials are easy to buy, also i was wondering if you could explain
to me more about the switches as they didnt really appear clearly in
any of your videos.

Loving the work, so sad you still dont do it,
yours,
Josh.

Hey Josh

I'm glad you like the marble track!  I'll probably make another track
or more tracks, but for now I've been painting..  (not quite as
exciting, but it takes less room in my little room!)

Yeah, the materials are all easily available; I basically used
popsicle sticks and toothpicks for that track,.. there's a healthy
number of ice cream spoons in there as well.  And there are two wooden
chopsticks too.

When I made my previous marble track, I was in the US, and bought a
box of 1000 popsicle sticks from an art supply store.  Then just some
wood glue to put them together two at a time, bit by bit, day by
day...

I've got some photos of the track in progress so that will give you
some better idea of how I made it and the switches.

<a href="http://robnugen.com/images/art/marble_track_2/">http://robnugen.com/images/art/marble_track_2/</a> just click on the
directories, and click on the pics for larger versions.

and then I have a few pics of my previous track:
<a href="http://robnugen.com/images/art/marble_track/">http://robnugen.com/images/art/marble_track/</a> I made it back before the
days of the intarwebs.

The main thing you need is just patience.  People laugh at me because
it took 8 months to do.  Most of that time was *not* spent working on
the track, but doing other stuff while waiting for the glue to dry!  I
just used Elmer's Glue, so it took a bit for each piece to be dry
enough to add the next pieces.

And then just test the track a million times as you're making it.  The
"success rate" on my track was about 80% because I tried not to use
many walls to guide the marbles, and I tried to squeeze tracks through
pretty tight spaces.

I'd love to hear how yours goes!  Or if you have more questions, feel
free to ask.
