<p class="dream">On a farm / ranch, walking along a trench cut in the
ground about six feet deep where the cattle were all penned, we were
walking along this trench in an exploration type manner and I noticed
the far-away clouds included a tornado.  I knew the tornado was there
before I actually saw it and then I saw another.  They were impressive
to watch, but too dangerous to do nothing else, so we ran back along
the trench running running for perhaps a few minutes, long enough that
we had to stop to rest a bit and then running some more and I noticed
I was running like a primate, almost half my steps were with my front
two feet / hands, pulling me forward just a bit faster than only with
my feet.</p>

<p class="dream">We got back to the house and the cattle were all in
the trench, and I asked dad if he wanted to release them.  He said he
would lead them to a tree, but that most of them would choose to stay
in the trench.  I went into the house as he led a few of them up to
ground level, and I watched the tornado coming, and could hear its
rumbling growl.  I wondered if it wouldn't be safer to duck down into
the trench, cause I didn't know any cellars in the house, and the
house itself was certainly no match for this size tornado.  I noticed
the gas heater was on, so we should turn that off, but not just at the
wall, but at the entry to the house, but I didn't know where that
was.</p>

<p>then my alarm buzzed.  dang.</p>
