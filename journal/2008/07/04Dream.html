<p class="date">9:18am JST Friday  4 July 2008 (day 13981)</p>

<p class="dream">arrived at janette's house and she made me breakfast.  bright and sunny day with
sunny side up eggs; sunny smiles on everyone, and I was like, &quot;dear god I miss you so
much.&quot;</p>

<p>In a different snippet,</p>

<p class="dream">I looked out the window of my apartment way up on the Nth floor, and could see
Tanner and Jojobean and a couple others playing frisbee; they were throwing it around the building
with another YRUUer they couldn't see, like Mattboy or Paul, perhaps.</p>

<p class="dream">I was tired but realized it would be unthinkable not to join, so I went to put on
my contacts but got sidetracked somewhere.</p>
