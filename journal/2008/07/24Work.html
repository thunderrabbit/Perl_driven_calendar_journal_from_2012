<p class="date">12:40am Friday 25 July 2008 (day 14,002)</p>

<p>Stayed super late at work and am just now on the train in Shibuya to head home.  Last train, which will leave in 3 minutes or so (thought a bit later to let stragglers board)  Good work today, and really getting this thing finished.  Sach came in around 9pm and showed me the new wiki on which I happily tossed my scattered sheets and braincells of todo lists onto one entry.  Good stuff there,  and brainstormed with Andrew a bit for what field names would be good for this new product, regarding billing clients and admin users and client-level admins, etc.</p>

<p>I'm sure the structure will change; it's not exactly 3rd normal, but we don't know which way the product will get pushed by user requests, so we goot it ready to go either way, so have some id field duplicated so it can be btied 9billed) per admin or by location..  Tomorrow I'm going to do some surgery on this DB and tables and kill a table while moving its important fields to another table.  should be a good productive day tomorrow, though I certainly don't plan to stay this late.  I think ami's plan of going out with her friend Hitomi will be more attractive, though I've not decideed yet.  We'll see.</p>

<p>Leaving now at 12:47am (3 minutes late)</p>


<p>On the way walking to the train I thought I might have forgotten to save to the server the brainstorm we stormed, but I just now checked and they were saved.  both on the wiki and in the source code.</p>

<p>If I were to write an SOML right now, it would included that I'm now over 14,000 days old, and ahve applied for my new passport recently, and have my alien registration card updated now so I won't be arrested if I'm pulled over by a cop (very rarely does that happen, but it has happened)

<p>I would also say I'm not exactly satisfied with my financial state
at the moment, but I'll be able to survive another month (gettin' paid
150,000 yen on 10 August) and will be etting a few Ëü from teaching,
and I'll be doing ISIS with Helma "soon" and (probably August 9th
  (would be August 2nd, but we're doing the next ATE workshop, and</p>

<p>mind blanked.</p>

<p>I shulda invited Rose to the ATE, but I think I did, or at least I thoguht about it.  Maybe I just invited Megumi.
  Interested to see who will come and how our group might change with influx of energy(-filled people)</p>

<p>computer is in the shop so I'm using my old comptuer (new old Jason computer) and it doesn't have emacss set up quite the way I want regarding html mode, especially.</p>

<p>need to write to peeps who came to my 14,000th day party, and write to Mark in Macau, and stuff.  Might do that tomorrow before work. Might do it tonight before sleepin</p>

<p>oh and I need to update pics on U-Cow's website.  It's been a while, and I have some funny ones on this computer.  need to upload FFS pics as well.  dang.  perhaps I need to release the neeed to upload so many pictures.</p>


<p>writingjournal entries in my wiki would be way easier than in emacs, where I need to write the HTML along with the entries.  Like, as I 'm writing this withthe screen off to save battery juice, I'm just hitting return between each paragraph, and I'll have to add p tags later.  My other emacs will do it easily enough, but this one isn't set up correctly yet, as mentioned above.</p>

<p>aight, shuttin' computer down till I get home.</p>
