<p>Have gotten a good start on the next phase of programming stuff here.  Had a bit of a progress-hiccup with my computer going to the shop, but I'm  glad to have my backup computer (purchased from Jason) on hand.  Took a second to get it set up, but anyway, we're coding and going.</p>

<p>Have included a page that looks like it's designed to do just what I need to do next, so that should work nicely.  I just need to write the database code that goes along with it.</p>
