<p>Rolled TJ Bike back to Kosugi station and found the bicycle parking area has been expanded,
which is good, right?  BUT, the second level of parking has been removed, thereby effectively
keeping the same number of parking spaces, but doubling the amount of real estate required.  How's
that for American-style waste of space?  I'm pretty surprised from both a real estate usage point
of view, and a business point of view.  They could have twice as much income for the same amount of
rent.  I wonder if insurance for the second level racks is so much higher or something.  Weird.</p>
