<p>Jen called earlier to see if I could play, but I'm at work... but I'm about to visit The Pink
Cow to put me-n-Matt's exquisite corpses up, so I'll call Jen to see if she can play with me during that.</p>

<p>AND, hopefully she was able to find a foam posterboard thing, so she may have gotten that, too.
..  it would be to label the images.</p>

<p>I called Jen and it turned out to be Jen and Oribbia!  So we met up at LOFT near HMV where I
reimbursed Jen for the sheet of foamboard plus 30 yen delivery fee, and then headed to The Pink
Cow, which was closed.</p>

<p>And stayed closed.</p>

<p>Still closed now, for all I know..  We got drinks and sat out in the little courtyard back the
secret ninja entrance, but our ninja skillz weren't enough to get us in.  Little birds chased each
other in circles as we chatted about Ribbia's adventures with babies (especially blue dyed white
chocolate dipped cookie painted mouth on the motherly 3 year old girl) and Jen told us about Aik's
story of a guy calling the ambulance because he wanted someone to listen to him play guitar.</p>

<p>I don't see that story online; I wonder how true it is.</p>
