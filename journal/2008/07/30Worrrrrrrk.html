<p>Gar.  I'm just stuck stuck in this crap.  Trying to get some select lists to talk to each other,
and trying to get mootools to talk to the server to get the updated data...  perhaps I should
forget about that part and just try without mootools.</p>

<p>Brain is getting tired.  I'll have to do it tomorrow or later.</p>
