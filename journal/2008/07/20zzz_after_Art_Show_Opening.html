<p>Nice time at the party; we got to watch a movie _The Way Out_, which I'll characterize as a gangster flick set in Japan, with non-Japanese gangsters, and then meet some of the actors, including Edward L. Papazian, who played the gang boss, and a guy named Austin, who played the guy who got Out, without killing Papa Godfather.</p>

<p>Double lovely was chatting with Akiko and her friend Rimi, who
wants to be an art dealer, and purchased _Blind Lines_ as her first
acquisition in her art collection, which will be shown on 10 August in
her home.  They cuddled with U-Cow the whole time they were there, and
I heard for the first time that Rimi was *also* in San Francisco with
Akiko and Francois, at their (Akiko and Rimi's) mutual friend's
wedding.  But no photos of Rimi, cause she, like Akiko, claim shyness
in front of the camera.  "I'm anti-photogenic."</p>

<p>What???</p>

<p>Chiemi came for about 2 minutes, and asked some questions about my art technique, but she left pretty soon after the movie started.</p>

<p>Natalie called and said she couldn't come, but hopefully will be able to on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Megumi came for a while, and I narrated the pieces as she was in the bar scopin' 'em out.  I was with her when we met Edward, mentioned above.</p>

<p>Chatted with Megumi about Macau and bungy, and she told me about her Mt Fuji climb this past weekend.  She almost didn't make it at one point, but then when she heard "just 15 more minutes" after having rested about 30 minutes (after hearing "just 30 more minutes" repeated for some hours), her energy was rejuvenated and they saw a lovely sunrise from the top.</p>

<p>I told her about our storm and lack of sunrise when climbing with Sumidasan and the cute girl whose name I've forgotten.</p>

<p>(( whatever happened to ol' Teddy Bear Tomoko and Sumidasan, I'm not sure; they met up with me after my shoulder breakage, but then I haven't heard from them, even thought I've emailed them a couple times... ))</p>

<p>Megumi told me she didn't know about the possible job in the US (won't know until Tuesday), and then, despite weariness, she left to get some footage of a DJ who was performing at Parties 4 Peace.</p>

<p>Chatted for a while with Edo Papa Godfather Zian, and then he bought drinks for me an' Ami.  I gave him my email and he said he can help me get started in some modeling stuff here in Tokyo.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I'll put pics up on U-Cow's website.</p>
