<p>Having joined Ami a couple hours <em>after</em> she got in line for the iPhone, I'm feeling quite
uncomfortable for "cheating" the 500ーorーso people who were behind her when I originally got in
line and emailed her, all "where are you?" and she was way ahead and said it was okay for me to
join. So I did, but it feels weird, though I must say the feeling is waning, perhaps especially
after writing this (character by character on my cell phone)</p>

<p>Loaned Marcus Lion to the girl behind us after she *briefly* (unsucessfully) lay down to sleep. She pet his mane a bit, but is too busy talkin' to her partner to sleep.</p>

<p>I feel a bit better having offered Marcus to help her sleep.</p>

<p>They moved the line forward about 30 feet, during which time I shuffled forward with the best of them, so I guess I have blended in enough to be considered In Line.</p>

<p>I took a bit of a nap on Marcus Lion; our neighbor girl never used him to sleep <em>per se</em>, but she did sorta caress his fuzzy toes as she snoozed on her sweater or something.</p>

<p>Ami has been reading, but is beginning to look sleepy.</p>

並びはじめて6時間
あっという間に過ぎた気もするけど、まだ後6時間半も待たなきゃ！！
ちょっと寒くなってきたしトイレにも行きたくなってきた・・・。やばいなぁ~。

<p>Slept soundly. Brushed fuzzy. Thanked the stones that made my bed so well.</p>

<p>Reading the book Earth has confirmed my belief and energized my intention to be much more consciously more often thankful.</p>

<p>My current phone is still due 11700 yen, so I'm not going to get an iPhone today.</p>
