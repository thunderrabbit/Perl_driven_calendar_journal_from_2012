<p>Tonight  was Jalal's second to last night in Japan, so we went out for drinks.  I wasn't really
keen to go because of the likely cost and tiredness Id incur, but when some fun girls showed up
(and one was like, &quot;I'm only here cause I give good head,&quot; ) I was like, &quot;aigh I'll
go.  </p>

<p>Turns out she not only jokes a lot about giving head and dyking around, she's got some good
insight on political issues of the world, and therefore wants to get out of Japan where most people
know nothing.  She's aiming towards a few cities in Europe this summer to see if she can get work.
I imagine she can with such a genki personality.</p>

<p>They went to the next door location.  </p>

<p>Oh, I should mention that the  lights went out in the restaurant about 10 times (not joking)
during our evening, and they were going to give 500 yen off (16%, but due to an extra sob story by
our funny girl, they knocked off another 500 yen for a nice 33% off, so we got the food and drinks
for a special low price.</p>

<p>(it's a word problem to calculate the amount we paid)</p>

<p>Anyway, they went next door for round two, and I headed home, whereupon I called Ami cause she
asked me to call her and she asked about tomorrow's schedule, which is fair enough, but hen she
asked about today's journal, which is not my favorite conversation n the world.  In fact, it ranks
right down there among the worst conversations I can have, right along with  other bad
conversations of which I can't imagine right now.</p>

<p>Anyway, it went on for a while, during which I stopped to breathe, during which time a prostitute
ame up to me all, &quot;hey cute cow!&quot; cause I wear U-cow on my chest and I handed him to her
cause it's sure more interesting to flirt with a new girl and to fight with an old girl, so I was
like, &quot;Ami, if you wanna talk about this, call me back&quot; cause I sure didn't want
to <em>pay</em> to have my least favorite conversation in the world.</p>

<p>I got the cow back from the girl who informed me that we could spend just an hour for 10,000
yen, and I was like, &quot;no way am I payin' you anything,&quot; which is not necessarily true,
but no way am I paying her for the services I imagined she intended to offer: romp and rob my
wallet when I'm passed out.</p>

<p>Anyway I got Cow back, and wondered if Ami would call me, so I just tersely was like, &quot;call
me&quot; and she called me back and we talked for twenty-seven minutes while I stood wathing train
after train leave Shibuya for my house.  Yes what a victim mentality.</p>

<p>dammit. I've been writing for a while without looking and it all was in Japanese mode.  fuck fuck
fuck</p>

<p>I was just saying what a screwup I am, but hope to eventually do something useful, so I write in
my diary so people can see what a screwup I am, and if later I do something useful, then it will be
inspiring or something. </p>

<p>BUT my point is don't ready my diary and then bitch at me about it.  Just stop fucking reading
it if you don't like it.  It's not like I bitch at you about what you write in your diary because
probably you don't write a diary, and if you do it's probably not online, and if it is, I probably
don't read it because I read like 5 entries per year <em>total</em> of all my friends combined, and
I sure as hell don't bitch about what they write.</p>

<p>man I'm in a pissed off mood.</p>

<p>And to think this is the second day or so that I've been reading Earth, the second book in the
Bringers Of The Dawn series about Pleidians helping save humans from themselves.</p>

<p>Aight; it's the next morning, and I'm feeling quite better, though I imagine I'd like to chat
with Ami a bit more, and own my reactions to her requests..  this triggers a lot of the same issues
as with Hitomi: difficulty communicating across languages, even more difficult over cell phone,
whining about my journal.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  I'm curious about readers of my journal.  Do you keep a
journal?  Is it online?  Do these issues happen for you?</p>
