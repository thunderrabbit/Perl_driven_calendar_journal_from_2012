<p>On the way to the train station, I wanted to write some thoughts, but had no paper.  Happened to
walk by a pile of cardboard that included several paperboard cases for six beer bottles each.
Snagged one and wrote notes on it during the train ride here.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I came up with basically the same concept as Andrew did, but I'm gonna write a
class to support it.</p>
