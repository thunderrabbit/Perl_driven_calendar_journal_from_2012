Thanks for that rob!

Although it would be more fun finding out tips and tricks on my own is
there any you advise? It will make my life easier, lol.

Just a bit more research and ill be ready to buy my materials and
make, make, make! I have made my loft room tidy with a radio player, a
fair sized workbench and stool.

I'll be sure to follow your steps and take and record videos and
pictures so you can watch my progress is you like,
Yours,
Josh.

<p>It took me a couple days, but I just replied:</p>

Yes, actually, I just thought of something...

My first marble track was built over a period of years.... I would
work on it for a couple months, put it away, work on it, etc. After a
long time, I couldn't remember which parts I made when. Did I finish
that last year? how long was the gap between this and this? etc.

So I began to write dates on the pieces as I put them on.

But, this kinda detracts from the artisticness of the project (in my opinion).. so

For the second track, I used ink that's only visible in ultraviolet
light. I was able to get a marker for kids "to send secret messages"
for about a dollar.

Keeping notes of the progress may not be important to you, but for me,
I really enjoyed being able to go back with my ultraviolet light and
get a new look at the history of the track...
