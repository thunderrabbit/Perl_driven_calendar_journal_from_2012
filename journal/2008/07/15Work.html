<p>Good day at work.  for two reasons:  One:  I got the site on which I've ben working updated to
use the new skin thing that Andrew created recently (although it's apparently going away soon, but
it will allow for mobile phone sites to be made easily.</p>

<p>two: I recieved a key to the front door of the office, so now I can roll in anytime I like.
Even <em>right. now.</em></p>

<p>Malek was like, &quot;here's the key.  Don't steal anythig.&quot;</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>They all left the office at that point (Male, Sho and Andrew, and I was busily not stealing
anytihg when Andrew came back and coded a bit more with me (and I gave him some of the changes I
had made) and it was all good.  We rolled out together and I tested my new key.  And it looks new,
too, like they just got it cut for me.</p>

<p>I'm pretty happy about that.</p>
