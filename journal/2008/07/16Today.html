<p>Woke up pretty late today cause I had been talkin' to Natalia until 2am-ish, but still got my
reiki and antakharana (sp) stuff done, but not neti.</p>

<p>At work now and spent a good deal of time squarshin' a bug that would happen the first time some
code was run, but not the second time.  Each registration (iteration of bug creation and detection) took a bit
because it involved validating two email addresses per registration: a pc address and a mobile phone
address.  The PC addresses were easy enough to verify, but the mobile phones took the time:  Each
mobile phone has a unique serial number (at least in Japan) which is sent as part of its useragent
when browsing the web.  We keep a list of those unique serial numbers to make sure only one phone is
used per user.</p>

<p>So, right there meant I could only use my phone a single time (or keep deleting the entry from
the DB, but this kinda sneaky behind-the-scenes hack wouldn't allow proper debugging; that could be
affecting the outcome).  So I installed
an <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/user-agent-switcher/">add-on for Firefox to allow
emulation of different browsers</a>, and told the add-on I was Docomo somethin' something serial
number.</p>

<p>That worked once, and then for the next iteration, it would take several mouse clicks deep into
menus to adjust the serial number of my faux useragent, and then mouse clicks to select that agent
to emulate so I could do it again.</p>

<p>Anyway, finally determined that the bug had to do with the DB entry not yet being filled in the
first time, so a value wasn't being returned.  But on the next run, the DB entry had been filled in
so the value existed.  anyway, I found the bug and informed Andrew that he needed to change his copy
of the code as well.  His fix was a bit different than mine, and at first I liked my fix better, but
then I just put in both fixes.</p>

<p>He said the bug was there cause the code hadn't been fully tested, and has never been put on a
production system with users.</p>

<p>About to zip outta here and meet Ami at Softbank (actually 109 cause she wasn't sure which
Softbank I mean in Shibuya (there's only 1 huge one, but she couldn't tell their relative sizes by
looking at a list of addresses online.   I imagine every little nook-store that sells Softbank has
its address on that list). . . .  Anyway she's been having issues getting her iPhone set up with a
softbank email address, so in the likely case that I'm not able to help her (it's all gonna be in
Japanese and therefore more frustration for me than its worth), I suggested we have the cats of
Softbank hook it up.</p>
