<p>Good I-group tonight.  I realized part of my issue is that I've got a sortof superiority complex
when I don't drink, don't smoke, don't interrupt, try to speak with correct grammar, try to be
perfect, maintain consciousness as much as possible, blah blah and all this crap</p>

<p>So part of me doesn't want to talk to people because I look down on them.  This is not a
productive/useful/appropriate way to be, I'm sure.</p>

<p>I'm also sure that this complex is making up for an inferiority complex that's dwelling
inside.</p>

<p>I'm even pretty embarrassed to write it in here, but it just seems like I gotta air out this
stanky laundry of my soul.</p>
