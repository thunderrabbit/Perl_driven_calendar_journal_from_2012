<p class="dream">Fred had talked to dad about what more Fred had to do to finish his project and Dad
was like, &quot;just peel the remaining carrots and you can be done,&quot; Fred had a clear plastic
garbage bag of maybe 70 large cut carrots, and simply had to peel them.  I offered to help and fred
accepted, but then he was being intentionally wasteful of the carrots by cutting off hunks of them
and calling it &quot;peeling&quot; whereas I was peeling off a much thinner layer.  My way was
taking a bit longer, but producing significantly more consumable carrot content.  Fred didn't see
how I was doing it before he advised me to do it his way to save time.  I was like, &quot;no way;
I'm specifically *not* doing it your way to save carrot,&quot; and it was a bit of a tiff between
us, but eventually he relented and just let me peel carrots any way I chose.</p>
