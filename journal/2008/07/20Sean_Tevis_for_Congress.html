<p>Fred sent me a link to <a href="http://seantevis.com/kansas/3000/running-for-office-xkcd-style/">Sean Tevis' xkcd style campaign comic</a>, and I've just sent him (Sean Tevis, not my brother) $10, and posted this to Slashdot:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Sean Tevis is running for State Representative in Kansas against <a href="http://www.arlensiegfreid.com/meetarlen.html">Arlen Siegfried</a>. (multiple typos on this page!)</p>

<p>Sean Tevis supports the same things I do, and  he's <a href="http://seantevis.com/kansas/3000/running-for-office-xkcd-style/">campaigning xkcd style</a>.</p>

<p>I sent him money and I don't even live in Kansas..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm amazed by the typos on Arlen's page!  I found four typos and two errors that resulted in sentence structures that don't even make sense..</p>
