<p>The good thing, though: my computer's battery slash power management is quite better than before.
I'm quite happy to have received a new battery, even though I thought Apple won't replace them fo'
free.</p>

<p>Earlier today my computer went from 100% battery to 5% battery (while unplugged (I didn't time
the drop, but it was probably over an hour)) and told me it was on reserve battery power, and I let
it go down to 4% and then plugged it back in.  Got to 100% and left it plugged for a bit, but now
have unplugged it and it's slowly dropping.  74% at the moment (6:19pm)</p>

<p class="date">7:16pm JST</p>

<p>40% now.</p>

<p class="date">7:34pm JST</p>

<p>29%</p>

<p class="date">8:01pm JST</p>

<p>11%</p>

<p class="date">8:09pm JST</p>

<p>6%, and it just told me to switch to power adapter.</p>
