<p>I got to work late, and I'm leavin' early for a lesson with a cat who seems pretty low level,
but hopefully he'll be genki.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  This menu copying madness is getting way more complicated than
I had hoped.  There are images associated with each menu and each menu item, and so when copying
the menu items, we also have to copy the images, BUT I just realized the images have their own
attributes in different tables that also must be copied.  damn.</p>
