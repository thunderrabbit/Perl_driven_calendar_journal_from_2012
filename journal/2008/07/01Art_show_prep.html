<p>Woke up, did reiki, spray-glossed the small <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Art:For_The_Pink_Cow_Bar_-_July_2008">art pieces</a>.  A couple of them smeared.  Basically
the pink smeared badly on one part of one (from thin lines to a pink haze).  That's the very first
one I made as a testaroo to see if marker would work on canvas.</p>

<p>Because of the smearing, I didn't gloss the bigger pieces, but I brought the gloss in case Traci
recommends I do them.</p>

<p>Gotta jet out to Tokyu Hands to get nails to hang the art now.</p>
