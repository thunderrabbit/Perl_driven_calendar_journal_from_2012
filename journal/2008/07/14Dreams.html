<p class="dream">On da daytrip with Ami / my gilfriend not always Ami and had a fight, or I got angry at
something and went sort a crazy angry and wanted to break my mouse and cncel the tri and stuf.  She
asked if she could learn to drive scott, and I wasn't willing to teach her and eventually we made
up and I owned that I hadn't noticed what had triggeed my anger, and that I wante to do that more
effectively.</p>

<p class="dream">The a guy was wanting to fight me, or anyone, and I was behind a car door or behind a windshiedl
and used that to block his bows, but then  I got out like, &quot;I can handle this&quot; and
negotiated out of the fight in various ways until like I was a matador and he was a bull.  I
climbed a tree when he got in  a car to run me over, and I was going to disabl e the car by
throwing some old dead branches the tree had to offer me.  I was consious that the tree was givg me
part of itself to let me win this conflict.    I dropped a branch  (dried log) dwown at the car to
try and block the fan and I was somewhat successful, and then I threw down something else (oh the
ree had been wobly at first)  and I pulled off a branch which stripped down some of the tree's
bark, and I was again consious that this was not good for the tee, but it was selflessly giving to
me.  I jammed the branch down toward the carand not even that stopped it all the way, but
eventually the engine stopped and I was going to jump down when I realized I was dreaming.</p>

<p>lucid deam:</p>

<p class="lucid">I decided to walk through the air to  a window cause I knew I could fly bu decided to do
something more subtle than fly.  I walked toward a window at the same level I was in the tree and
the a floo appeared elow me and my dad was in the room.  I was like, &quot;dad  I want to
translocate (teleport) myself and he was liek, &quot;okay you're in a dream so you  can be as
multi-dimensioned as you like, &quot;  &quot;you're four dimensional  now you're N dimenional.
what do you see?&quot;</p>

<p class="lucid">I looked at the wall and realized it had a different wality (* I meant to type reality, but
wality is cool) to it.  I was like, &quot;I can almost count all these dots without counting them,&quot; and I walked aout the
room a bit trying to translocate, but not knowing how to go about it.  I thought, &quot;well if i
did knwo what would I do?&quot; and I made myself shrink down  or I imaginined myself to shrink
down (though my erception didnt' change) and then I moved and I imagined myself big again,&quot;
and my dad clapped.  I had done it.  &quot;Did I do it?&quot;  &quot;yes&quot; and I did it again,
making myself shrink dow, or imagining myself shrunk down, but my perception didn't change and then
mvoed, very conscious of myself still in the room) and then back to normal and my dad said,
&quot;very good&quot; as if I had done it again, but I was pretty sure it was only my iagination,
and nothing actualy changed. </p>

<p class="lucid">I was like, &quot;okay I need to go&quot; which was also weird cause I figured I would have
control over imte if I was multi-dimensional, but</p>

<p class="dream">I came back to normal dream reality and though nothing changed as I was still in the room with my dad, and outside we saw a rocket raft
power up.  basically it was a large inflatable raft with a long submaring ish hull and then two
wings and thrusters on each wing  or cylindrical thrust director s on each wings (two concentric
circles on ach wing) and a hue rocket flame out not rocket  jet flame out of the cnete of ths red
inflatable raft.</p>

<p class="dream">watched it for a bit and I told Dad about this article I had read about  high rate of suicides
and insanities in the US military.  He agreed the army had made him pretty crazy, even though he
never saw battle.</p>

<p></p>

<p class="dream">and then I was leaving dad a s we were on that raft-ship, and I told the other soldiers that I
was okay as I was leaping overboard, but then some soldiers were in the water with soft yellow life
rings, and one of the blonde girl soldiers offered me one, and even though it would slow me down,
it would keep me more afloat, and she was cute blonde so I accepted readily.</p>

<p class="dream">Went to shore and was in Fred's room / office helping him clean up or something, adn I wanted to
take some of his old business card,  but he got a bit mad at me for taking these instead of those,
wheer these had been carefully made or somethng.</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't worry too much about why he had gotten mad but just let him tel me what was what and
give the right cards, or actually he was looking for the right ones when I woke up.</p>
