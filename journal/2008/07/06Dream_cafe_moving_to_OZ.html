<p class="dream">Ami and I were on a plane with a couple behind us having sex semi-quietly, and Jen behind them, asking if I could just change seats if I was going to be having sex.  When I answered, she realized it wasn't me having sex, so she was like, "oh, nevermind.."</p>

<p class="dream">As I looked back at Jen, I was surprised to see that the couple having sex was actually some older men all kinda sitting around one older woman, who was being masturbated by one of the men.  She looked quite happy, so I left any ideas of asking them to stop.</p>

<p class="dream">There was an announcement on the intercom that we were slightly delayed takeoff for a moment, but that it was nothing serious.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was returning a rather large plate (*) to a cafe I knew nearby, and I was surprised to find they were closed.  The owner came out and was tearfully like, "we're moving to Australia, we have a contract for 30 locations there, and we just aren't making any money with our locations here," and I fully supported their decision even if I quite enjoyed the restaurant.  I hugged one of the staff who immediately came to embrace me for support when I came in.  I noticed a bit later I couldn't tell if I was hugging her from behind or face to face.  Her head was on my right shoulder, with her dark hair straight down and a small curl like a loop at the end.</p>

<p class="dream">I asked the owner if they had any extra food to give away, and she gave me a white pear with a flat rosy red bottom.  It looked quite delicious and I looked forward to chowing it when I was hungry.  I wanted to get a business card as a memory, and so I could show it to people as  historical proof / collectors' item.</p>

<p class="dream">(*) white, solid pottery that might break into two or three big pieces if dropped.  Its shape was a bit like a kidney bean: with all curved edges, but not round, not oval</p>
