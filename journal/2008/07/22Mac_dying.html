<p>My computer is powering off, even though it's got its battery and it's plugged into the wall
socket.  I even removed the battery to see if the old battery was triggering a power down, but it
still died.</p>

<p>And the first time it died was while Skyping with Ma who's at SWUUSI!!!  I miss all you guys!! aauuugggghhhhh!!</p>
