<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm no longer working in Shibuya at AClass.</p></li>

<li><p>Now I'm working in Shibuya at 77hz.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been pretty busy at the new job, seeing how an entire day has passed since I wrote the
previous item.</p></li>

<li><p>77hz is a startup of sorts, so I'm not tooooo worried about the little detail that I haven't
signed a contract or anything with them, or specifically sorted out pay.  Prolly need to do that
pretty soon, though.</p></li>

<li><p>In other working news, I may be working 4 hours per week at 4000 yen per hour plus train tix
for some company, teaching a guy who has some sort of learnin' plan, but is pretty low English..
Haven't met him yet, but we'll see how it goes.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really talked to Dad recently, but have been vaguely in touch with Ma in that we both
missed our recently planned call.  Fred and I have been a bit better in touch than me-n-Ma, but
lower than the past 2 months' rolling average of contact with Fred.</p></li>

<li><p>Ami and I had a bit of a fight a couple days ago.  Basically I want her to make time for my
activities, but I don't want to make time for her activities.</p></li>

<li><p>However, I've quite come to rely on Ami for makin' lunches for me and printing things for me
at work. (*)</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't played ultimate frisbee in some months.  We basically stopped when the weather got
cold, and never started again.</p></li>

<li><p>However, I'm going to Genny with a G's party with some cheese tomorrow.  It's bleu cheese,
part of the red white and blue theme to be all patriotic toward the US.</p></li>

<li><p>Tonight, Ami and I are going to meet Jennie J, Aiks, Orribia, and whoever else they can call
up for some antics in Kawasaki or Yokohama.  (This is an example of her coming to play with my
friends, BUT it's an example of friends drinking...  what I really want is for Ami to join my
meditation group.)</p></li>

<li><p>My ATE class (Awakening the Third Eye) has continued meeting each week for meditation
practice.  We actually are not meeting this coming Tuesday (3 of 6 members will be out, including
the one whose home we've been using), but we'll prolly meet again after that.</p></li>

<li><p>As Kevin has to move &quot;soon,&quot; he let me carry away any of a sampling of books for
cheap.  Currently I'm reading <em>The Way Back to Paradise</em> by Joseph M Felser.  I think I'll
be writing a letter to Dr Felser soon.</p>

<p>and by letter I probably mean email.</p></li>

<li><p>One of the main points of the book seems to suggest traditional science won't work on subtle
energies cause science wants the magic / synchronicities of life to &quot;prove themselves&quot; by
being replicatable in the lab.</p>

<p>( winner: wonky sentence contest )</p></li>

<li><p>He suggests we wake up and notice synchronicities in our lives.  To that end, I think I'm
gonna write some down.</p>

<p><del>now</del> <ins>later</ins></p></li>

<li><p></p></li>
<p>(*) I imagine that's going to seem really weird when read some years from now.</p>
