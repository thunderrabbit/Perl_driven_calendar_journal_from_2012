<p>Good time at the Pink Cow vegan night.  I sat with YK, Tom, Travis et. al., including Gareth,
Russell, Sarah, Lillian, and a guy who's name I forgot.</p>

<p>I yoinked Sarah's brownie as soon as she arrived back with a plate of pairs of food.  Russell
then asked if he could have the other.  I gave him a high five cause it was funny (and reminded me
of Bob who asked someone for his ice cream after having stood 45 minutes in line to get it)</p>

<p>I told Sarah it was partially my way of flirting with her, so she shouldn't be too upset.  I
ended up getting her another brownie.</p>

<p>Russell, Travis, and I are all from Texas.  But Russell is halfway from Florida.  When I heard
the discrepancy, I looked over at him; he changed his story, and I pretended to have pulled out my
guns when I heard he wasn't from Texas.  &quot;What??&quot;</p>

<p>Reholstered my air-pistols when he assured me he was born in Texas.</p>

<p>Nice times.</p>

<p>On the way out, Uncle Cow caught the attention of a genki nice-smilin' guy; I introduced Uncle
Cow to his table and gave them all cards.  I don't remember the 3rd guy's name, and the second
guy's name is either Josh or Justin, and the girl's name is Carrie, I think.</p>

<p>Then on the way to the station, U-Cow got the attention of two Japanese women who chatted me up
for a bit.  Mika and Kazuyo.  They got my number and I got theirs and then I was like, &quot;well,
any dates would have to be just for fun cause I have a girlfriend.&quot;  That was hard to say, but
I knew it would save me millions of concerns and tears later.</p>

<p>Mika went home on Denentoshi line, and I rode with Kazuyo to Kosugi, where she changed to Nambu
and I headed on to Motosumiyoshi.</p>
