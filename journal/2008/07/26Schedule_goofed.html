<p>Usually Ami comes to visit on Saturday afternoon and spends the
night.  So I was chillin' in my room (sleeping and uploading (rotated)
pics to U-Cow's site) and it got sorta late so I called Ami.  She's
not coming over until this evening, cause she's working a shift at a
friend's restaurant.  Dang.  I forgot about that.  My fault.  So I
coulda been out and about already.  I called Megumi and she's on her
way to see fireworks now (which I don't really relish the idea of
waiting in a mob for hours to see fireworks for 30 minutes), but I
coulda seen her this afternoon (today's her last day in Japan for 4
months).</p>

<p>I'm planning to see Levi's Sayonara Haircut tonight, which is why I
didn't coordinate times to hang out with Megumi yesterday..  I thought
with Ami, Levi, and Pink Cow plans for today, it would be impossible
to fit it all in.  But I forgot about Ami's other plans.</p>

<p>Anyway, Megumi may call me after fireworks and we might be able to
sort out something, and I'm willing to forgo Pink Cow (I'll be there
tomorrow, so it's not likely a big deal to miss tonight, although
every night at the Pink Cow is fun); it's possible Megumi would meet
there.</p>
