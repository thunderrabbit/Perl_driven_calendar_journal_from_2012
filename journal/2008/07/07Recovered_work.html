<p>I got back to where I was on Friday when I lost a couple days' worth of coding due to a network
drop when uploading a file.  Basically the file got erased, but not replaced, and my computer
locked up so I just killed the local process and.. hey no file.  Damn.</p>

<p>But anyway, I recreated all the changes I had made and I even have a backup now.</p>
