<p>In Shibs now after hanging with Kevin and Romi at The Pink Cow, where I met Ahmed who makes a living making art.  Sweet!</p>

<p>He was telling me he can easily sell my paintings for 70000 each, which I have a hard time imagining, but I'd be willing to do.</p>

<p>Even if I misheard him, the core message was clear:  keep making art. So that's why I'm headed home now, either work on my painting, marble track, or upload UCow pics.</p>
