<p class="dream">Walking down a street with Ami, came across some high school youth who I had never previously met.  We were in Japan, but they understood my English well enough, and were asking my questions after I watched them compete in some sort of strength competition, in which the boys were holding themselves up with just their fingertips.  I had Uncle Cow holding himself up with his fingertips as well as sortof a joke, and then when the contestants finished (they tied), they were like, "aw yeah, they were proving they're men," and though I hadn't competed, they were trying to adjust their definition to allow me to be a man as well.  I was like, "oh don't worry about me; I know I'm a man," and then added jokingly, "I'm an old man!" and then they were asking questions, and I said "well, you can do anything you'd like, but you probably need to get out of your parents' house to do it, so you can open your vision a bit  more," or something like that.</p>

<p class="dream">Just then, a wagon rolled by with some halloween dressed kids and hip-hop music.  I was like, "see?  how cool is that?  Someone came up with that idea and has made it real."  Another similar, but larger wagon went by,  and then some motorcycles, and then some more cars,.. and I didn't know if my point was being disproved or dilluted, but finally the parade ended, and I was like, "7 vehicles in the parade! and I guarantee it wasn't that big last year; it just starts with an idea."</p>

<p class="dream">I noted they were all working on some physics homework, and they described it a bit and they used the word "beauty" as uncountable noun, in a physics context.  I was like, "I know of up, down, strange, charm, truth, and beauty as quark names, but I don't know 'beauty' in the context you're saying."  They didn't know how to explain it, but I told 'em I could look it up online.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I noted Ami had gone on without me, so I got the youth together to get one picture of all of them with Uncle Cow.  I was like, "okay, arrange yourselves so that you're in about the same depth of focus," and they didn't really move from their positions at the table, so I said, "if you move back toward that wall, you'll be in better light, and we can get a good picture.."</p>

<p>I realized it was a dream and had the thought in my mind that I should keep dreaming until I could get the picture, but then I realized it "didn't matter," cause it was just a dream and I wouldn't be able to post the picture on U-Cow's website.</p>
