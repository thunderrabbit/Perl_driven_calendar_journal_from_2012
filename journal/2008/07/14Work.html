<p>Got good shizzle done at work today.  Didn't get as much as I may have hoped, but am learning
more about the system, etc.  Andrew made some structural changes to the code I've been twonking
(bigger changes than just tweaking), and I cleaned up some of the code he dropped into my file
structure.</p>

<p>Users can now register, and the links they click in emails work to verify their accounts, but
the emails aren't being sent.  Prolly just a small fix to get that fixed, but I'm not going to
debug it; prolly Andrew can much more efficiently fix it/direct me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Basically getting a good start on this project, but still have a ways to go.</p>
