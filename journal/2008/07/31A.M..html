<p>Woke up pretty early this morning, considering how late I was up.  I guess I got a bit over 6
hours of sleep, and I woke up without an alarm, so that's fine.  I had a bit of an internal alarm
though, in that I had been dreaming, and Malek said something about my project.  I got a bit of a
panic like, &quot;oh shipes we have a meeting today-,&quot; but not panicked to the point that I
thought I was late.. just that I better not waste time.  And then looked at the clock.  Oh.  Only
6:30.</p>

<p>Did reiki charging, in a different order than normal, cause I wanted some data for a theory.
Basically I had been doing the charging in this order: back, head, then front.  And it seemed
like <em>every time</em> I did my head, or most often, my eyes, I would turn sideways during the
charging as if to sleep.  (Otherwise I do all the charging on my back.)  So I mixed up the order to
head, back, front, so I could see if it was more likely the location, or the length of time into the
process thtat I get tired and want to sleep.  And, though it's only one day worth of experience, it
seemed like it was the order of the process.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>I'm just about to roll toward work after I finish this bowl of cereal. (*) I shaved the ol' beard
this morning cause it was getting a bit fuzzy.</p>

<p>(*) this was the first line I wrote, but then I finished the cereal while I wrote the preceding
paragraphs.  That's funny.</p>
