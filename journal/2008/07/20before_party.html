<p>Not sure who all is going to come tonight, but at least Akiko, (her
friend Rimi), Ami and I will be there, and Natalia RSVPed in the
affirmative at one point, but earlier today she was feeling a bit
sick.</p>

<p>It's been a semi-lazy day here at the ol' room-sized casa.  I did a
little bit of coding on the new map for chatforest, but it's nothing
more than just the hello world of Google maps.  Need to get some data
and points added on, but not sure how to do that.  Actually I pretty
much know how to do it, but not sure how to do it programatically.</p>

<p>Have showered and waiting for Ami to be ready to leave.  (She likes
to sit in front of the door, blocking it.  But at least she'll get up when I ask, unlike Hitomi back in the day.)</p>
