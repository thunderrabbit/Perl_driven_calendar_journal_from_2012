<p>Hello old computer!  I missed your ability to help me easily write journal entries.</p>

<p>At work, we've got functionality that will allow me to send emails from my cellie to my website,
and parse out the text and image(s?) and post them on my journal.  Sweet.  The ironic thing is I had
code like that before, like way back in the day, and I quit using it cause it was inherently
insecure, just using security through obscurity.  I don't know that this will be a whole lot better,
but I can probably more easily check the emails headers and such to verify that the emails are being
sent to my phone.  Hmm, and I could even set up a reply code that's only sent to my phone and then
that would pretty much guarantee only I could upload entries.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  Today I realized it had been a while since I dropped off my
computer, so I checked the paperwork... they had my old phone number.  So after my crazy long lesson
with Komatsu, I walked from Harajuku to Shibuya Apple Store and got my machine.  I'm sittin' at
their counter now, just with it on to see if it will power-off without my consent.  So far it
hasn't, but it's only been 6 minutes.  I <em>think</em> it's lasted longer than the last time it was
powering off before I brought it in here... ¤Þ¡¢ it's probably okay given that they replaced the
battery, heatsink, mainboard and fan.  Sweet.</p>

<p>Hmmm; transaction finished, but continuing to chill here a bit so I can ask Sumiyo about the
possibility of lessons: English in exchange for Mac Genius brains.</p>

<p>Hahah..  she vanished right after finishing with her customer..  I guess she don't wanna talk to
me.</p>

<p>But the good news: my computer power management is working way better than it had been.  It's
been a long time since I've been on battery at only 37%.</p>
