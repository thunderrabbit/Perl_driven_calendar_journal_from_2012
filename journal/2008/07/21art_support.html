Hello Rob!,

 Many thanks for the message. 

Likewise I truly enjoyed to be wrapped in an artistic ambience and met
a talented artist last night!

I believe you are to explore every way to cultivate the undiscovered
area of yourself.

Which I am so much looking forward to.

 
Below is the link I mentioned yesterday for the potential opportunity
for the start-up.

The restaurant, TY Harbor regularly recruits new talents for the
indoor open space exhibition for free of charge,

functions as an art supporter.  Hope you find it intriguing & encouraging.
