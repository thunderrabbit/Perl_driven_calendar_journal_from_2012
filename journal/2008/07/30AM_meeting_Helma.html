<p>Met Helma in Shibuya for a bit to give her bags back.  I held them in my apartment while she was
in Holland.  She got a picture of me on top of Hachiko, but I must say I don't really like it cause
I'm not big-smiling.  Pbbt.  I was happy to jump up there, but I guess too embarrassed to be all
&quot;Take Me!,&quot;  Ah well.  Next time I'll be more exuberant.

<p>While there (at Hachiko, not on Hachiko), Russell, who came to vegan night at Pink Cow saw me
and said HI.  I probably shoulda remembered his name, but didn't, though I did offer up a few names
from that evening as options.  But now that I think about it, I realize I thought &quot;of
him&quot; yesterday in that I remembered something we had discussed: &quot;a howdy is met with a
good howdy.&quot; or some such oft spoken line in Aggieland.</p>
