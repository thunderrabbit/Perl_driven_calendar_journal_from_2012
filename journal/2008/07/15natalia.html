<p>Had a lovely 2 hour chat with Natalia upon arriving home tonight.  It started with me giving her mail to open.. at first she didn't want to cause it was a bill..  but after a bit she realized it was *my* bill!</p>

<p>We had a good laugh and she told me the great news about her job situation, and her upcoming holiday for a month in Spain.</p>

<p>Rolled downstairs to scope a confusing message on the white board.  Turns out Natalia had misinterpreted Suzuki-san's confusing note which he replied to me (about the light being out in the kitchen), in which he said, "it's been confirmed," and "I change it today or tomorrow." and not to his previous message referring to us having a party for Shin, the new tenant of our little crib.</p>
