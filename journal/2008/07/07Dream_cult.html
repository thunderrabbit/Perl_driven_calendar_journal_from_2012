<p class="dream">Doing some sort of research into cults, and especially the finance of cults.
Basically the cult was producing various games that were designed to help people be guaranteed a
spot in heaven, and people paid money to play the games.  In return for actual currency, the cult
would give them cult coins or credit, which basically allowed them to play the games and have worth
only with other members of the cult.</p>

<p>but basically this sham system is the same one that &quot;actual currency&quot; uses.  Its value
is only good among people who believe it has value...</p>
