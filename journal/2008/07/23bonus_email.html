Hey Rob-

Its Katherine ____ from Emerson's YRUU.  I just wanted to let you know
that my students have become utterly obsessed with silent football.
Last week I had over half my class missing and couldn't teach new
material, so I taught them silent football (with a few minor adaptions
to make it classroom appropriate) and they LOVE it!!  I had forgotten
the beauty of Silent Football, and it brought to mind many a fond
memory!

Katherine!

That's fantastic!  I'm glad you were able to dip into a fond memory
for use as a classroom resource!  Congratulations on that.  What age
are your students?  Havest thou pictures?

Thanks for getting in touch; I'm glad you're well!

Today I celebrated my 14,000th day, which happened to be during the
month that I've got some paintings on exhibit at a local chillified
restaurant/bar here in Tokyo (so I had my 14,000th day party at that
restaurant).  <a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Art:For_The_Pink_Cow_Bar_-_July_2008">http://robnugen.com/wiki/</a>.

I, for one, had a particularly nice time.  Your email is a lovely
super bonus for my special day!  Thank you!

   Love and Light
    - Rob!
