<p>And by Teaching, I mean not really teaching so much as &quot;practicing&quot; some English stuff
with my student who doesn't seem very interested in learning, but just confirming that he can get
by with what he alrady knows.</p>

<p>I mean like, for making a hotel reservation, he can answer the Qs when?  single or double?
smoking or non smoking?</p>

<p>I asked for his credit card number and he said &quot;later&quot; which I don't know if that
meant he would actually say that while making a reservation or if he couldn't think of a fake
credit card number while practicing with me.  But whateva.</p>

<p>When &quot;ordering food in a restaurant,&quot; he flexed hi skills of being able to say
&quot;more cheap&quot; and 'too expensive,&quot; and &quot;do you ave,&quot; which will get him
far enough so that he  won't tarve, but I'm not sure that he'll get the food he actually wants.  He
didn't seem inclined to learn any more subtle ordering techniques, but.</p>

<p>We  made it through the first hour and then breaktime and when we came back, he was keen not to
do any more practice, but he asked me about the US and was asking why people were fat and why
people drive instead of walk and I was ike, &quot;culture,&quot; to explain everything.   He was
asking about the size and I looked up on wikipedia that it's 8893 km along the border of US/Canada,
and he was all shocked. he asked how many states there are, actually he asked how many capitals
there are and I said 50, and he was ike,  &quot;and Hawaii [is] 51,&quot; and I was like, &quot;um,
Hawaii is 50,&quot; and it was kinda hard to keep good humor about me when he assured me it was 51,
and i assured him it was not.</p>

<p>Anyway, he agreed in the end, and I didn't have to bust out with Puerto Rico would be 51 as if
that would ever happen,</p>

<p>And he asked basically how man.</p>

<p>h, no.  he asked which state was first.  And I was like, &quot;well, 13 were all first.&quot;
and he was like, &quot;what????&quot; and I was like, &quot;Wel, back in the dizzle 13 colonizzles
all decided to bandizzle togizzle&quot; beause that's about how little he would have understood, so
I asked him hwhich was the first prefecture in Japan, and he said, &quot;all together.&quot; and I
said, &quot;exactly.&quot;  And he asked if I could  recite the 13 original colonies, and I must
admit, I could not.  I got 8 written down, but my 8 included Vermont (which was not included) and I
forgot New Hampshire which woulda been obvious had I thought of it, but I didn't know that the
Carolinas and Georogia were in the list.  Dang.</p>

<p>So, oh and I forgot New Jersey, which I'm sure Frank would not be impressed, but anyway he then
asked if I was able to recite (write) ALL the staes, and I asked if he could write all the
prefectures.  He said, &quot;of course!&quot; and it was ON.</p>

<p>I busted out 49 states (and as yet haven't figured out which I forgot) and he busted out 44
prefectures, but I <em>think</em> he's missing 3, though he says it's actually 45 cause north and
south Hokkaido and East and West Tokyo are not really included, and I'm like, &quot;B S cause I'm
99.999% sure his claim is full of beans, even if he's just trying to save face.  I don't need to
rub it in his face, but I will write right here, just for the record, that I have memorized all the
prefectures (and sixne forgotten the details oof the list) and I think I'll get back on to learning
that again, along with the mising state (sorry, state!)</p>

<p>The good news is I took pictures of our lists, so I can find my mising state and his missing 3
prefectures.</p>

<p>Hey I want a Pleo; I just saw an ad for this little robot dinosaur on the train TV ads.  It
looks cute.</p>

<p>So anyway, at the end of the lesson, I was like, &quot;so you wanna practice again?&quot; as he
was trying to remember the &quot;last&quot; (45ht) prefecture, and he was like, &quot;no no next
tiem,&quot; and I was like, &quot;aight&quot; and didn't press him.  When Suzuki-chan asked me in
japanese like,
&quot;so, did he do more than last week?&quot; (in Japanese, &quot;we did lots of practices in
English,&quot; which was true; we did do more practices this week than last week, and overall we did
speak more English this time than last time, and since Japanese rolls off the tongue with such
loosey goosey meaning and ranges of possible realities behind the scenes I didn't find it too
difficult to not say he did basically squat for the last 30 minutes.</p>

<p>BECAUSE, last time when I was more honest about how much he didn't study, that news was reported
to the next person and the next person who called my student's boss to let him have a little chat
with the student as if that's going to help!!!  If the boss pulls him into a meeting, &quot;you
better study cause we're paying for this,&quot; it's *not* (in my opinion) going to do anything
positive for the student's desire to study.</p>

<p>okay bye</p>
