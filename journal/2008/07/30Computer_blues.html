<p>This morning when I plugged in the external monitor to my computer, it's got no red signal, so
everything looks heavily blue.  We confirmed the monitor is okay by plugging it in to Andrew's
computer.  Gah.  So either the adapter plug (from my computer to the monitor cord) suddenly broke
when it was riding around in my bag, or the visit to the Mac Store broke my computer's red-output
ability.</p>

<p>Coda locked up today; I had to Force Quit it, and then I rebooted for good measure.  Then I
think Coda locked up again.  Maybe it was Firefox 3.  I was switching between apps and then back
again and then again and it broke.  My app switching was faster than &quot;normal,&quot; but it
doesn't take me too long to hit alt-tab a couple times in sequence to get to the correct app.  I'm
guessing one of those two programs barfed when paging in or out of memory, but I couldn't tell
which one cause I couldn't do anything but move the mouse.  Couldn't get Force Quit window to pop up
via keypress.  Couldn't get dock to appear via mouse.  Gah.</p>
