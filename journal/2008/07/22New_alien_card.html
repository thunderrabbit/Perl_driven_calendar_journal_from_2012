<p>Dang.  Getting my new alien registration card (my old one expired last year) was SO EASY.  It was
free and only took my name, signature and about 5 minutes.  In fact, I didn't even get a new card;
they just updated my old card.  Not doing this a long time ago cost me about 4 hours of Jennie with
a G's 5th of July party.  (cause my card was expired and I had no proof of legal residency, I had to
roll back home to get my passport).</p>

<p>I woke up early with the plan to get started, got sidetracked on alien-somethin' website (30
second animated movie summaries, starring bunnies), then got TJ Bike out and headed to the local
government office ready to fill out forms and pay to get my mug shot shot etc etc and wait a couple
weeks....  But no; it was so easy.  (I've still got bad memories from the first time I got my card,
and the first time I had to replace my card after my wallet was removed from my possession.  Upon
the second making, I wasn't allowed to use the same photographs as the first time <em>even though
they had been taken within the correct amount of time</em>.  I don't even know how the guy knew
they had been used before.  Anyway, with that kind of madness still in my memory, I put this off
for months and months.</p>
