<p>Kevin and I went to the Indian restaurant after meditation tonight; had a nice chat about shtuff
and things, and now we're havin' an equally nice chat on the Yamanote Line.  It shoulda been an 8
minute chat here, but it's been 33 minutes so far.  I looked at my clock at 9:50, when we got on the
train, near a nice lookin' girl with doe eyes, but with a drunk guy shakily suspended over her,
unawares that the seats were even available next to her.  I didn't sit down there, but Kevin and I
are in the next carriage, chillin'.</p>
