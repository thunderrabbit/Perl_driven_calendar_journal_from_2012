<p>Well.  <em>That</em> took longer than I might have hoped, but the good news: I have all the
parts so that I can finish tomorrow what I was hoping to do today.</p>

<p>By royal proclomation, let it henceforth be known throughout the intertubes that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mootools 1.11's Ajax is Mootools 1.2's Request</p></li>

<li><p>Mootools addEvent <b>must not use 'on'</b>:
<br/>$('idname').addEvent('<del>on</del>change', function() { });</p></li>

<li><p>window.addEvent('domready') doesn't always seem to work.  I don't yet know why.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The woman in front of me is nearly falling off the handstrap due to sleepiness.  I'm gonna let
her sit in my seat.</p>
