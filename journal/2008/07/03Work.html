<p>I got some good coding done today.  Good enough that I sent myself a copy in email cause I sure
don't want to lose it and have to recreate it all again.</p>

<p>This is to allow clients to view different objects and to calculate a list of objects that they
*should* be able to view depending on their status.</p>
