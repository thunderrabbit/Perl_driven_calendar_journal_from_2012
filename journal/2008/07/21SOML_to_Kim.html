Kim!

I had a personal goal of writing to you on the first Tuesday of each
month, but now I'm at least writing to you once during each month.

Just had my art show opening last night at a restaurant/bar that
caters to westerners and networking.  (Japanese style groups don't
mingle, but this venue, The Pink Cow, is more "normal" in terms of a
US bar, where people can walk around the chat.)

Anyway, so I have several paintings up on the walls in the bar area
(which unfortunately is the smoking area) of the bar/restaurant, and
last night some of my friends came to view them, and three small
pieces were sold for about $30 each.  AND one of them was sold to a
bilingual woman who wants to become an art dealer.  She said my piece
was (very modestly priced, and) her first acquisition.

I'm inspired to get to work on two new, larger canvases I've got in my
room!

I got a new full time job doing website work for a small startup
company in which I can speak English to collaborate with my coworkers,
so that's a nice blessing compared to being in my own little
Rob-bubble of sparse ability to communicate at my previous job.
Everything is great (I've been there for a few weeks, and even have a
key to the office), but we have not specified my pay yet.  (yes, feel
free to wince)

This week, I will talk to Malek, the guy who seems to deal with the
cashflow in the company, and basically say I need some clarity on
income.  I'll let you know how that all turns out.

Tariq, (not Malek), is the guy with whom I was doing the video game
project, which got bound up in NDAs until no one could work on it
(that's my version of my understanding of the situation).  Anyway,
Tariq, Hitoshi, and I were working on that project, and then started
another project that is web-only, so that we didn't have to talk to
3rd parties and get caught up in NDAs again.  The website is
<a href="http://chatforest.com">http://chatforest.com</a>, and as yet there's no content, but we have some
ideas on what to put up there.  The first idea we had was going to be
way too hard in terms of technical work, but this new idea is within
my range of things I can do *and*, I've done quite similar stuff
before, so that's good.

I've also got a part time job teaching a guy English for the basic
equivalent of $40 per hour, 2 hours at a time, once or twice a week.
My full time job is flexible in hours so I can leave to do this
teaching work as needed.

I was just accepted to be a MOS for the Hawaii MKP weekend October
17-19th (I think).  I have fear about doing the weekend, basically
based on lack of clarity around money.  So I will give an answer to
the Hawaii MOS coordinator after I talk to Malek and see if I can sort
out a salary that will include time off to do the weekend.

I've recently done some meditation-related spiritual workshops (in
exchange for computer support for the workshop leader), and the
workshops are all great, but I am not sure if I've noticed results
during my meditations.  My sense is that I should just keep
practicing.

Thanks for reading; have a lovely day!
