<p>At work I've not been coding as quickly s I had hoped, but in the end today, things sped up a
bit.  I finally got some code pared down to its essentials, and the crem delos creamers, I got it
moved into an object, which certainly helped with making the logic easier to understand.  Chopped
the snot out of some code that I won't need and got the code moved to an object, got the core.php
file symbolically linked to nextcore.php, because the code is largely the same, but they've just got
different external templates.  The template is selected depending on the name of the core that calls
it, and to the user, they look like completely different bits of code.  But it's all the same.  and
the URLs won't have to change even if we end up splitting the code later.</p>

<p>Also today, I met up with YK to give him U-Cow and U-Cow's business cards just as YK headed to
the airport to head to Australia for a week.  The good news: I took YK's advice and re-inked
U-Cow's URL.  The bad news: I forgot to bring U-Cow's cards to YK.  ah well.  I'm glad U-Cow will
get to visit the US, and I'm bettin' YK will get his pictures uploaded before Gleb uploads pictures
from <em>his</em> overseas trip to the US, basically 2 months ago.</p>

<p>The other good news: I've gotten all my U-Cow pictures uploaded (though a lot of them are just
piled into the RECENT category)...  I may get the distributed out to other sections soon. hahahah
probably not, but it's a greater than 0 percent chance that I will.</p>

<p>In other news, I got an email from Sumiyo, the Mac Genius who I offered English lessons for Mac
Genius answers.  We're probably going to meet up on Thursday (her suggestion; I accepted, but
haven't heard back from her yet.  But she's probably been at work all day and not surfing the
web).</p>

<p>Ami is going to Kumamoto with her family starting tomorrow through Sunday.  She's visiting my
apartment now, cooking grub for me for the next some days, and hopefully getting to say HI/Bye to
Natalia, who will have her byebyeparty on Friday night.  She'll still be in tokyo after she comes
back from a month in Spain, but she won't likely be in the room next to mine.</p>

<p>For the last few days, all of my house mates have been women.  Florian left about a month ago,
and the woman who took over his room is Curry, from Hawaii.  BUT, Curry hasn't shown up except for
just a brief HI I'm Curry... and we haven't seen her past that.</p>

<p>The woman next to me on the train is probably more aptly described as a girl.  She's apparently
a teenager, with music in earphones, two cell phones, and she was talking on one a bit ago (a nono
in Japan) and now she's chowing down some chips and texting on her other cell phone.  Her tanly
peeling skin draws her attention at times for a vigorous rubbing, which provides shaking of beads
on bracelets on both arms, plus danglies from her cell phone.</p>

<p>Ah, youth.</p>

<p>Part of me wants to try chating with her, but... to what end?  It would just distract her groove
and be silliness.</p>
