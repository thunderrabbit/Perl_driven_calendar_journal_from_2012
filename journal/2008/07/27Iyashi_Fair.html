<p>At the Iyashi Fair at Tolyo Big Sight [sic] with Ami getting food
after talking to Kevin for a bit. He's been handing out flyers with
Romi at their corner booth. I got a piece of wood for my next marble
track, partially inspired by Josh's enthusiasm of seeing my track on
YouTube.</p>

<p>Also talked to Taran, whose business Play Food sells various
lactose free cheeses.  He and his girl Yoko are from LA and in Tokyo
for this event.  They got a picture of UCow for his site, including
one with their yellow pointer finger which they've been using to
identify points of interest in various pictures during their
travels.</p>
