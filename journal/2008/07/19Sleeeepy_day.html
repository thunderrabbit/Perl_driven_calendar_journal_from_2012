<p>Went to get my alien registration card renewed, but the office is closed on Saturday.  Not too
surprising, but at least I now know when I can go again (8:30am Tuesday)</p>

<p>I called Tiny Tracy from EV to invite her to my art show.  I didn't realize she had gotten the
invite via my email list, basically cause she never replies.  But she had already gotten it and
cited being too busy as her excuse not to go.  That's fair enough.</p>

<p>I read _Earth_, and came across some verrry interesting snippets.  Lemme quote one:</p>

<pre>
Traditionally, kundalini uncoils itself and electrifies your
body at around forty years of age.  By this time you are 
considered mature enough to house this kind of power.  For most 
people, the power is so profound that they go downhill from 
there and begin to age, rather than rejuvenate and put the
great creative electrical force to use.
</pre>

<p>I was like, &quot;WHat???&quot; 14,000 days is closing in on 40 years!  whoohoo!</p>

<p>It continues:</p>

<pre>
When you have a kundalini experience, it may feel like an 
intense concentration of energy in the sacrum area at the 
base of your spine.  Sometimes, when people experience 
kundalini, they feel as if they want to have sex because
they don't know what to do with all of the rising energy.  
The whole planet is locked into using its kundalini to 
reproduce.  People fornicate like mad without ever 
understanding that kundalini can move <em>through</em> the 
body and up into and around the head.  If you allow it 
to do this, it will provide a new interpretation of 
yourself.  You will understand that all of your creations, 
healing, manifestation--everything--come from the natural 
Goddess source inside yourself.

<p>Watched the rest of Jesus Camp.  The line at the end, &quot;I think they were muslims&quot; was funny.</p>

<p>Watched _Constantine_, and _Airplane!_ was just finishing when Ami came back from her friend's
wedding.  I helped Ami pull pins out of her hair.</p>

<p>Felt a bit sad at having waited for Ami so long today; I thought she was going to be home sooner
(so did she)...  we determined it might be best to just plan to not meet when one of us has
significant plans like attending a wedding.</p>
