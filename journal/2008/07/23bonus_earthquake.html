<p>AND, on the way home from Hirama, with ice cream in hand, I
suddenly heard the nearby building squeak.  I stopped in time to feel
the ground wiggling a bit.  Whooohooo!!  My first noticable outdoor
earthquake!</p>

<p>And this was just after Travis had been telling me Tokyo has
massive stockpiles of food and provisions in case of a natural
disaster.  Whoohooo!  I needn't worry about such preparations!</p>
