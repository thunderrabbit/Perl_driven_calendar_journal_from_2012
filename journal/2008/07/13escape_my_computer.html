<p>There are some journal entries at <a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Journal">http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Journal</a> from yesterday and today.</p>

<p>Right now I'm going to escape my room and my computer by taking my book _Earth_ to the curry place for some vegetarian curry (which features bits of beef in the stock) and read and chill in this "hot" sun.  (It's not as hot as Houston, but is hot for Tokyo).</p>
