<p>Leaving work now.  I went back to work after I-group, which I attended after getting a chicken
sandwich from Wendy's, and a frosty.  A <em>vanilla</em> frosty.  I was like, &quot;are these
new??&quot;  He was like, &quot;ummmm..&quot;  no?</p>

<p>That was after getting my computer back.</p>

<p class="date">12:35am JST</p>

<p>On the way to the station, I got a lot of offers for back massages.  It got a bit annoying, but
in general I like to be approached by those smiling girls.</p>

<p>At work I was getting a bit bogged down in details, so I asked Malek for a bit of history so I
would have a sense of what they want the user interface to do.  We had a bit of a meeting: me,
Malek and Andrew, and got some stuff sorted.  It made my coding a lot lot easier.  I was chopping
out big sections of my flow chart.  Coding tomorrow should be a breeze.</p>
