<p class="dream">Driving in traffic which included an airplane, who made an illegal maneuver of
taking off from within traffic and within a highway &quot;canyon.&quot; He crashed to bits and was
burned quite badly, but survived.  I led him to the hospital, and he was like, &quot;I want to go to
the UK hospital, as he was British, but when I asked the staff, they recommended against it cause it
would take too long to get there and he needed to be treated more immediately.  He was like,
&quot;well, who will my nurses be?&quot; and a whole line of women of a variety of shapes and
designs lined up and quickly stepped forward in random-seeming sequence.  I recognized a couple who
I had met here before and commented, &quot;oh, she's great,&quot; ¤È¤«¡¢ and he selected about 6
nurses from the bunch, and they all escorted him upstairs, joking that they would handle every whim
cause two would be enough to handle his strictly needed needs, but so they were up in the room
playing cards, all basically to distract him from the pain.  The card game was just being set up
when my dad walked in and sat between the patient and his preferred nurse.  I was thinking
&quot;what???&quot; but no one really said anything at first, but when they saw dad wasn't joking
and made such a faux pas, he was like, &quot;oh, I sat here because it's the most shaded chair; I
don't want to sit in direct fluorescent lighting.&quot; They rearranged things so the nurse would sit
next to the patient, and my dad got a shaded seat.</p>
