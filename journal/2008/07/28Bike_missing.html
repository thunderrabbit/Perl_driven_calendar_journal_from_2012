<p>As I left the house this morning, I noticed something missing.   TJ Bike.</p>

<p>WTF?  where is TJ Bike?  I wasn't super worried; it didn't seem likely that he had been swiped.
I thought thought thought for a bit until I realized I had forgotten to get him last night when i
came home ultimately from the Iyashi Fair at Big Site.  Ah.  Ami and I had parked our bikes near
Hirama station on the way to big Sight [sic].</p>

<p>I'm just writing about it now because now is when I'm headed home to go home, but first gotta
walk to go get TJ Bike.  The last train to Hirama Station has already passed, but it's
not <em>that</em> far of a walk.</p>

<p>The train I'm on now is the last train to Kikuna.  I think it leaves at 12:33.</p>

<p>Speaking of 33, my battery now has 32% power, and is still kickin' it.  Sweet!</p>
