<p class="dream">I was doing reiki, and Jackie Purdy came up all, "what are you doing?" and I explained it, and she was like, "cool; can I watch?" and she sat on me (while I was laying down) (there were sheets in between, so no funny business) while I did reiki charging, and I asked her to tell me if she could detect any changes in energy.</p>

<p class="dream">Watching an after school special, Mr T was a dentention teacher who came down on a kid, saying, "you can't leave detention until you come up with one million dollars," and walked away.  As soon as he was gone, the guy in front of the student turned around and said, "if you cancel any of *my* million dollar deposits in your enterprise, I'm gonna be mad," or something, and the kid was like, "but if I don't cancel yours, whare am I gonna get the money?" and the next part was meant as comedy, for the second kid was like, "well, you can get it from this magazine ad, or this somethin' or that somethin'" and just kept placing magazines on the table in a sort of character-development technique showing just how much money the kid controlled, and in what kind of investments he had it.</p>
