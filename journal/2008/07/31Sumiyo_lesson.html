<p>Happened to meet Ahmed at Hachiko when I went there to meet Sumiyo.  She and I hadn't traded
phone numbers so it was a good thing she found me.  Introduced Ahmed and Sumiyo and then remembered
that today's the last day of my art show at The Pink Cow, so Sumiyo and I are chillin' here for our
language-for-Genius exchange.</p>
