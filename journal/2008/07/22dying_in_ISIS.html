<p>Back to work installed XP on an HP Compaq machine but couldn't get
a network driver for it.  Gave up and headed to meditation: Helma,
Kevin, Romi and I at Romi's house. Did ISIS with Kevin as my
connector, and it was quite cathartic as I experienced a death and its
related sadness and totally transmuted it to the freedom of having
died and being free of my body. It was great and I was like let's do
that again!</p>

<p>At dinner after meditation, Kevin mentioned some of his favorite
movies, and then was telling us about his remote viewing course which
I'll hopefully be taking in September.  The course sounds fun of
course and Kevin said the practice helps with any spiritual work, in
that we practice perceiving subtle energies.</p>
