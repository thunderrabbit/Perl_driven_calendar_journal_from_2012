<p class="date">12:20pm Wednesday 23 July 2008 (day 14,000!!)</p>

<p>Just applied for my new passport.  I'll leave out the part where I
had to rewrite the form after writing my address in kanji the first
time and had to rewrite it in good ol' English.  I wrote the shit out
of it, nearly breaking the pen, which I subsequently swiped.  For
their 2000 yen fee to change 8100 yen into $75, I figured I was due a
pen, especially considering the check was written <em>without</em> any
information but the price, so I had to rewrite the information on the
check after having just written it on the form.  To what end did I pay
them 2000 yen?  Gah.</p>

<p>But, I shouldn't have to do it again before I'm almost 18,000 days
old!</p>
