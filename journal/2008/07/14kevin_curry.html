<p>After I-group, I invited us to curry, and Kevin joined me.  Talked about the book I'm reading:
_Earth_, and some other goodies, oh like my dream from this morning.  He expressed some concern
about the health of our I-group because there were only 4 peeps there tonight, and on a couple year
overview, numbers seem to be dwindling...  but from the 6 month or even a year overview, the numbers
are about stable.</p>

<p>Oh, speakin' of numbers, I determined if I get 3% of what I imagine will be sales when the new
project at work gets going, I'll be gettin' as much as I had in previous job.  5% would be quite
lovely.</p>

<p>Ah crap; I'm way late in writing my monthly update to Kim.</p>
