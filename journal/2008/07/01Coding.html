<p>I've sorta reached the end of what I can do on this code until we get some better specs on what
it should look like for the users.  I've slapped some shizzle together from an old project and
spare parts, and got several of them working, lopped off some others.. Basically a roughshod
attempt to get something vaguely rough-drafty up, but not even good enough for whatever comes
before alpha testing (assuming that comes before beta testing).</p>
