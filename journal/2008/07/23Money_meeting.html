<p class="date">1pm Wednesday 23 July 2008 (day 14,000!)</p>

<p>Had a meeting with Malek and determined what will be my first
payment, though it amounts to what he said is a consulting fee of only
150,000 yen for the month, but it's untaxed, and that's fine by
me.</p>

<p>We're hopin' to get this product out the door soon and money comin'
in so that payment can be augmented and I can be a properly paid
employee.</p>
