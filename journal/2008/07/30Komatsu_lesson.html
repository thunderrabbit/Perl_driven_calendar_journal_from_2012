<p>Today, Mr Komatsu said something like, &quot;you audience me presenter,&quot; and when I
suggested he say something like &quot;You be the audience.  I'll be the presenter,&quot; he informed
me (in Japanese) that, according to Mr Tanno (who asked me to come teach Mr Komatsu), Mr Komatsu
doesn't have to be 100% perfect in English, but just understandable.  Then summarized by saying (in
Japanese) 30% or 50% correct is fine.</p>

<p>Then he asked (in Japanese), why, in English, do we convert &quot;I will&quot; to
&quot;I'll,&quot; &quot;we have,&quot; to &quot;we've,&quot; but &quot;I will not&quot; to &quot;I
won't&quot;</p>

<p>I answered that I didn't know, but that he should simply memorize those (though obviously he
already had).  And of course, there are some strange points in Japanese: する changes to できる,
and 中 is sometimes なか and sometimes ちゅう.</p>

<p>He said the first one was just something we have to memorize, and of course, regarding 中, that
one was the Japanese reading and the other was the Chinese reading.</p>

<p>I said, &quot;yeah, and we just have to memorize it.&quot;  I told him I have the same problem
with Japanese as he does with English; there's stuff we've just got to memorize.</p>

<p>He seemed to get the point, and then came up with his brilliant presentation on Phillippean bars
in Japan, about 80% in Japanese.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>After the lesson, Mr Tanno asked me how Mr Komatsu's studies were going.</p>

<p>I didn't say &quot;Um,..  terrible?&quot; but didn't lie, either.  I don't know what I said.
Anyway, I just got an email from Mr Tanno:</p>

Dear Rob,

Could you make arrangement for Mr. Komatsu to try TOEIC test?

Thank you.
</pre>

<p>And I'm like, &quot;um, no?&quot; cause I don't know how to make such arrangements, and I'm
pretty sure it would be a slaughter if he tried to take it.</p>

HI Mr Tanno

What would be the benefit of him taking the TOEIC test?

From what I have seen, Mr Komatsu would severely fail the TOEIC test.
I don't think he should try it.

<p>Pretty much what I think is happening here: I'm working as a teacher for a company that has less
than no idea how to teach.  Mr Komatsu is simply an employee of one of this company's big clients.
Nothing to do with teaching English.</p>

<p>I'm getting 4000 yen per hour for this.  I wonder who is wasting all that money?</p>
