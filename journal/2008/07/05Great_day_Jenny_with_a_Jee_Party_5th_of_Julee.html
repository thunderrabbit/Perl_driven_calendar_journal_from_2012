<p class="date">1:49am JST Sunday  6 July 2008 (day 13983)</p>

<p>Have just arrived home after another great party at the Foote's, as conceived by Jenny with a Jee
(sp).</p>

<p>This was the day I got sent back to get my passport with proper visa date cause my alien card is
expired. (According to one of the soldiers, the Japanese guy wanted to arrest me (which part of me
wanted cause it woulda been a new experience for me), but) I just went (pissed off) home, got my
passport, and headed (pissed off) back, but in a rush I stabbed the crap out of my left big toe
while running up the stairs from Nambu Line to Odakyu Line, after leaping like a gazelle four steps
at a time for the entire staircase save the top.</p>

<p>(it still hurts)</p>

<p>On my first trip out there, Hitomi (from Ultimate) found me on the train, and I enjoyed talking
with her a bit.  Closer to the station, Kumi found us, and we saw Jason and his girl Aya in same
carriage.</p>

<p>I have the hots for Hitomi but can't quite explain why. Maybe the careful way she seems to listen
to me.</p>

<p>Several of us collected at Genny's station and then I led a group to the army base where her
parentals live.  That was when I was disallowed entry due to expired gaijin card.  Gah.</p>

<p>But even worse:  Once I got back, I heard that Geoff had the same problem, but got an even worse
bawling by the Japanese guy, being the <em>second</em> to have an expired card.  Just the timing
put me first and him second.  Geoff decided not to come back.</p>

<p>I came back, and though I was pissy, I was happy that Jay, Juri, and Rob Adams waited a few
minutes for me at the station, and we all went in together.  I showed my expired card again without
explanation, just to see if I could get the guy in trouble for letting me in on an expired card, but
he noticed the date and asked if I had my passport.  I gave it to him, but didn't help him find the
visa until he couldn't find it and finally asked me.  Page E: visa good through 2010.</p>

<p>I was, however, able to use my expired card in exchange for the visitor pass.  I doubt that is
allowed, but I had no proof so I didn't make a big deal of it.  Especially since by that time Mrs
Foote had arrived to sign us in.</p>

<h1>POOL</h1>

<p>First, the pool!  Mrs Foote dropped us off at the pool and we watched the others playing
volleyball, but then started our own game of practicing layouts into the pool.  Jay did quite well;
Kerry did quite well.  Genny did quite worse than she could have; she kept saying the frisbee seemed
further away than it really was.  I guess due to strange depth perception looking into the pool (no
pun intended).</p>

<p>I threw pretty crappy throws most of the time, but a couple times they were right on.  I enjoyed
seeing the others making such good catches.</p>

<p>Layout practice in the pool was more tiring than I expected!  After only like 10 layouts (or
maybe even less), I could clearly detect some shakiness in my arms as I climbed out of the pool.</p>

<p>Joined a volleyball game of 4 on 4.  Had good serves when it was my turn, getting our score up
like 4 or 5 to 0, but then kinda bad on the returns.  I could bump well enough, but they would go
to the moon and out of bounds.  Not sure yet how to temper those.</p>

<p>I slapped a serve onto their side for a side out and then Jason pulled the pole to tighten up
the net a bit, but instead the whole thing collapsed.  The game collapsed as well before we were
able to sort out how to get it taught again.  (The lifeguard had to help, and it even took him a
while.)</p>

<p>Then it was swim-race time, with Genny racing anyone who cared to try.  First she destroyed
Luke, and then I was like, &quot;I'll go,&quot; after no one else would, but I was sure she would
destroy me, so when they said, &quot;GO!&quot; I jumped out of the pool and started to run along
the edge. hahaha</p>

<p>We raced again, but fo' realz, and I was pleased with how well I did; I thought I'd be as fast as a
dog-paddling jellyfish, but actually Genny said I was faster than Luke.</p>

<p>Genny raced a woman whose name I've forgotten, and then Jason (who cheated or something weird
cause Genny suddenly stopped).  Then she raced Jay, but by that time she was getting tired and
didn't actually try, though she did finish the race.</p>

<p>Basically 6pm by then, so we headed to the house for outdoor food under a canopy and a huge
spread of veggies with sour cream dip, fruit with yogurt dip, salad, potato salad, baked beans, hot
dogs, hamburgers, veggie burgers, all with the comments (&quot;there's more where that came
from,&quot; and &quot;you can't leave until it's all gone,&quot; etc)</p>

<p>It was so good.</p>
