<p>Just chatted with Travis a bit; he works upstairs in this building!!  Wowowow that's so
awesomely synchronistic!</p>

<p>He told me he's going to climb Mt Fuji this weekend, and I'd totally love to go.</p>

<p>Then he told me Megumi is going as well.</p>

<p>AAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
