<p class="dream">walking along the canal, this time there were some significant waves being generated by the weather, and people were skiing on the waves, down aong the canal.  PB's other ship was headed down the canla, and the waves were such that there could be some damage done to the hull, so if that happened, both ships would be damaged, which would be very bad PR for the company.  But it didn't happen, and they arrived at the end of the canal where we could get onboard.  I had taken off my shoes so when I went to get on, they were like, "where are your shoes?"  And I said they're already on the ship; I'll just go get them.  They realized I would have to go barefoot to go get them, and then I said, "I was barefoot for 8 years in the US" and he didn't understand me at first, so I repeated it and then they let me get onboard barefoot.  woo!  So then my shoes were down on some rocks, and I asked my friends if they would grab them before they got on the ship.  First Elise went down, and I directed her, "okay, they're on your right," and she turned the wrong way, "okay, now they're behind you," and she turned another wrong way,  and then gave up for trying to find them and then she went running along some rocks and jumped for joy and didn't realize how high the rocks wwere (a few feet) and she landed crashingly.  I sent Fred down to help her, (and to use my shoes as a pillow for her head (hoping that would mean they'd come back with her, but knowing they might not, and knowing it didn't matter anymore; Elise was more important) and he reported that blood was streaming from her head, so the shoes would be of no help.  I saw Elise' mom Karen coming back, and told her basically, "don't come down; Elise will be fine I'm sure, but she's hit her head and she _looks_ dead, but she'll be fine."  So Karen stepped back, not wanting the vision burned into her brain of seeing her daughter looking dead, and *I* went down to Elise, who by then had stood up and was smiling like, "what happened?" and I showed her where she had jumped.  "You jumped off these rocks over here," but the ground surface had changed (due to the dream, or due to my change of perspective) and then I said, "oh wait, it was from over here," and the rocks matched what I had seen before, and she showed me the blood spot on the ground from where she landed.  It was further away than I had guessed, but maybe she's a good jumper, or just really lucky.</p>

<p class="dream">I gave her a kiss on the cheek and was like, "I miss you," and she said, "I miss you, too." and I put my arm around her and headed up the stairs to present her to her mom, who surprisingly wasn't there.  However, there was a man whose face was backwards so when he was introduced to us, I thought he was facing away, but then he looked down (or on our side, looked up) and his face was there, but it had just been strangely hidden by his hair.  Elise was like, "oh, Mr Short," and he led us to the hospital and I held Elise's hands behind me and she held onto the waistband of my shorts.  I wondered how I could be holding her hands and her hands holding my shorts, but didn't notice I must be dreaming.  Without using my hands, I pushed the hospital's glass door open, and we walked through and it basically closed on Elise, so we had to work out a different way to walk, so the next door to the waiting area, I held the door open for her, and she went inside.  There were a couple of black/poor people in the chairs; I walked behind Elise over to the next empty seats and looked at an experimental lego setup behind me.</p>

<p class="dream">A man asked that I don't touch anything on the lego matrix, and I said, "sure no problem" cause it looked like it had taken a long time to build.  But then when I looked back at it, I could see it was actually just a few pieces, some of which were repeated on the board (large green square lego "plate")   Two of the repeated pieces looked like spaceships in a way, with pointy ends and then curved tubes on the back end.</p>

<p class="dream">A doctor came up, and was showing me the results of their experimentations; basically they were trying to make narrower tubes out of calibrated glass test tubes, but the glass had a layer of protective plastic around it which did not shrink at the same rate as the glass tubes.  he showed me the spiderweb of cracks on the tube, and then easily pulled away some of the plastic and poked one of the glass pieces out and it broke free from the spiderweb, leaving a hole where it had been.</p>

<p class="dream">I commented to show my understanding, "so it's like safety glass, but the plastic is on the outside instead of between the layers of glass." He agreed and then went on to do a little experiement to show another example.  He poured some metallic string down onto the table and heated it with a device that instantly made the whole coil of string get soft, but not melt into itself.  he could adjust the coils a bit to align them nicely and continued applying the heat (he was wearing a full mask like one might when using a flame thrower, but I was actually closer to the experiment (at a different angle) and not affected by the heat. ) until the surface along the coil began to degrade and the wire making up the coil began to melt into itself.</p>

<p class="dream">He was like, "you know the film that strips away a layer from the surface of a hot motorcycle after its been driven for a while?"  No, but okay, "Well we did some testing on that, and it's not as big of an effect as people think.  I had to drive my motorcycle fully 500 millimeters before the effect occurred.</p>

<p class="dream">blink.  In my mind I visualized the distance he said as like the thickness of a layer of paint. I thought, 'um, 500 millimeters isn't so far; maybe he means that's how thick a layer was stripped off; I better not say anything for fear I might look ignorant.'</p>

<p class="dream">And I was like, "well, what about a military jet?  They go faster and farther than a motorcycle.  Wouldn't the effect be more pronounced?"  The doctor didn't answer, but then I answered my own question with a faux dialogue.</p>

<p class="dream">"excuse me, can I borrow an F16 fighter jet?  I promise not to shoot any of the missles."</p>

<p class="dream">I resumed speaking to the doctor, "I understand your point; too difficult to get a jet these days."</p>

<p class="dream">Another man came up and though I could still feel the heat coming from the coil, which had now melted into a blob of goo, he reached onto the experiment (reaching right over the coil) to grab some snacks from the table.  I grabbed his wrist to keep him from touching the hot coil, and the man seemed impressed that I caught his wrist, but he didn't react like, "oh, gosh thanks for saving me from the hot blob of goo,"  He looked over and said something to the doctor, leaving me out of their conversation like an infant between adults.  The man walked away and then later a nurse (who had been there the whole time???) walked away and the doctor continued being silent, and then I was like, "what are you thinking?"</p>

<p>He said something completely unrelated, which worked grammatically, but I can't remember the deets (after having typed all the above)  something like,</p>

<p class="dream">"Oh just how to pacify metal leaves."</p>
