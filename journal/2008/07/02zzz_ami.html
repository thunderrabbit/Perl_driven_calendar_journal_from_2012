<p>Lovely to see Ami tonight.  Dinner was great and she enjoyed
scoping some recipes in the book Natalia got from her student; I gave
Ami a Winnie-da-Pooh mug (given to me by Andrew at work); we scoped
the pics Natalia took of Uncle Cow; Ami printed labels for my art.  So
sweet!</p>

<p>We romped a bit, and then had a Talk.  Basically (!) <!-- I didn't want to
come inside because -->I don't want any babies at this point.  Ami also
doesn't want babies right now, but she does want them (and by them I
mean up to 3) sometime.  I think I'm even farther in the not wanting
babies department.  Like 1 at most, and only after I'm independently
wealthy at least, and optimally after the US government stops
destroying the world.</p>

<p>I want to meditate and help people become enlightened.</p>

<p>Ami wants a house and family.</p>

<p>Can these both work together?</p>
