<p>Dream from earlier this morning:</p>

<p class="dream">In a big field with a lot of YRUUers, including Tina-son (*) with whom I had just been speaking about the 200 dollars I owed her (about which I had forgotten until she told me).  She had been upset that I didn't remember, but I then remembered I had told her to remind me because I would forget.</p>

<p>She calls me mom; I call her son.

<p class="dream">I was talking to Mr Jason Fricke for a bit and then saw Tina, and was like, "aight; I gotta talk to her for a bit," and as I went over, all the girls at the camp huddled up, and then just for the effect/performance, they ran away while stripping off their shirts and bras, leaving their bras on the ground, layed out like colorful dashed lines.</p>

<p class="dream">We were all dumbfounded, like WTF? but no one was overly concerned about it.</p>

<p class="dream">With Ami in some sort of warehouse storage area with lots of bolts of felt, Ami was driving a forklift for the first time, just about to stack together a washer and dryer, when an unaware employee drove his even bigger forklift type thing and crashed into her washer and dryer set, knocking over one of them.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, "Ami, just get away," but she wanted to try and upright the washer, but the guy kept crashing into them and her forklift as she was trying, until eventually she seemed to be quite endangered, so she also wanted to get away, but the crashing was both violent and haphazard, so hard to predict when would be a good moment.</p>

<p class="dream">I had a slightly better vantage point to see what the guy was doing, so I told her like, "okay now!" and she climbed up and out and made it safely out of the room.  I ran away with her, but then stopped at the door to take a picture of the chaos, and of the guy driving the other forklift.  I got the picture and then was headed out of the warehouse, trying to wind my way through these tall rows of rolls of felt, as I heard a couple of other employees talking about the difficulty of this business and how they are lucky to sell a bolt of felt in a month, but then again competition is such that they can't price them too high, etc.</p>

<p class="dream">I followed the sound of their voices to the exit and said I wanted to report the problem we had had.  I showed an image that had been printed on a section of paper, and he could recognize the face of the troublesome employee, who then showed up to see what was going on.  The guy to whom I was showing the pictures was quick to say, "get back," at that other guy as I looked for the real picture and realized it was still on my camera.  I showed them through the playback screen, and said if they would give me a card I could email them.  They didn't think business card, but memory card, and handed me a memory card, and I was like, "no no; it's on my card still; I can't transfer it to your card until I get home.  But they insisted it was okay, and I took their card and my card and headed out.</p>

<p class="dream">Found Ami outside, after squeezing through a little flap of a doggy door to get out of the big locked door to the warehouse.</p>
