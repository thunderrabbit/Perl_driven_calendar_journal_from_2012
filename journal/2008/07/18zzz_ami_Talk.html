<p>Had a rather lengthy Talk with Ami, and in the end, like her more.</p>

<p><em>Basically</em>, I said I had some concerns recently, regarding
some of our core likes / dislikes.  I like hot humid weather, without
air conditioning.  Ami likes air conditioned air.  I like life without
TV.  Ami likes TV.  I don't drink alcohol; Ami does.  I prefer
vegetables; Ami likes beef.  I don't want kids.  Ami wants kids
later.</p>

<p>And so that was all fine and good (ish), but then came the real kicker when Ami asked why we're dating, and eventually discovered it all started with the h.</p>

<p>She cried a bit, and then I explained that was just the start, and since then I have grown to love her for other reasons.</p>

<p>Speaking of Love, the meaning of this word came into play in our discussion.  I usually say "I love you" with the meaning, "I choose to help your personal (physical/mental/emotional/spiritual) growth."</p>
