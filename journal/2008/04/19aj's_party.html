<p>I can't really say I went to her entire celebration, but after scooting out of the PB Article 9
conference volunteer orientation once the Q&amp;A began, Ami and I went to the intro party, with
plenty of food and bottomless drinks for 2 hours, and then cake after that.  Mark and Craig
converted the Reggae chillin' music into some bumpin' beats to which I happily did a Rob's Crazy
Dance and wished Jen from Perth coulda been there. (*)</p>

<p>(*) i seem to be in touch with three Jens right now, and I know a fourth, though I'm not in close
touch with her.</p>

<p>Anywayz, I chose not to continue with the party, though as i left, I realized Mark *was*
continuing with the party, so I was like, &quot;????&quot; and thought maybe I should stay, and
walked back to Shibuya searching for the reasons I chose to leave in the first place.  Part of the
reason includes having stuffed myself, and I'm looking forward to dropping the kids off at the
pool.</p>

<p>I guess I coulda done that in the restaurant, but I didn't even check the cleanlisness of the
loos.  I just assumed they were crap, like most cramped restaurants in Tokyo.  Shoulda checked, but
oh well; I'm already on the train about to roll out.</p>

<p>Another part is that I want to work on fly2.nu.</p>

<p>The girl in front of me just said 「おぱいマッサジ」 (which I my have misspelled here, but
there's no doubt it means &quot;breast massage&quot;  I can't catch but 1/3 of what they are
saying, but &quot;breasts,&quot; &quot;massage,&quot; &quot;large,&quot; and &quot;futon&quot; were
some recent key words.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh; I have to add this.  Early on in the party, when &quot;everyone&quot; was smoking, I did a
little reiki-powered request that I get all fresh air, and I was shocked to find the air
immediately became cleaner.  Now it may just be a fluke, but I thought it noteworthy, AND my shirt
doesn't smell disgustingly smokey right now, so I'm pretty impressed.</p>
