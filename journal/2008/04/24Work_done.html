<p>Called Ami and told her that work asked if they could pay me 5 days late.  There's a law in Japan
that says payment must be made on the same day each month (or something like that), but I certainl
don't see myself wanting to invoke that.Ami's reaction was like, &quot;welp time to start loooking
for a new job.&quot; whereas I'm thinking about my friends there and how I got the job.  I agree
with Kim, I'm emotionally tied to it; he suggested a business is'nt likely emotionally tied to its
workers.</p>

<p>I'm curious to know if this is indicative of a trend or if it will be smoove sailing from here
on.</p>

<p>My contract is up in August, so I should proly start lookin' for a new job anyways.</p>

<p>Hmmmmm.  More IT?  PB?  Teaching?  drop everything and roll to a new country?  I'd be loathe to
leave Ami.  :-(</p>

<p>Could I find high calibre private students?   Hmmm.

<p>Might have to dust off my suit.  Hmmmm.</p></p>

<p>I think I'll write a Rob Update and try to get some more interest in fly2.nu.  Perhaps do a bit
of advertising for it.</p>

<p>Perhaps try and automate domain creation....  with DH it would require a PS, which costs several
more dolars than I have no, but peraps I could put together a proposal...</p>

<p>but fly2.nu isn't really in line with helping people through healing.  Is it in line with
enjoying  the world? A bit.</p>
