<p>I think I know what caused my headache, and it wasn't merely the use of Friendsforsale.
Basically my posture seems to be with head curved down, so I put my computer up higher to try and
stretch out my neck muscles/bones the other way.  I think that pinched some nerves or some such
because in my agony flip/floppin' around last night, not able to sleep, I got back up and took a hot
shower then did some more Friendsforsale, and somewhere in all that, I realized what had
happened.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>I've enjoyed buying a pet named Sabrina, buying her back and forth with someone named Mark.  Her
price has gone from $30,000 when I first bought her to $66,000 when I most recently bought her.</p>

<p>And, even more delightfully for me, Sabrina and Ami have been buying me back and forth; I'm now
valued at $7575.</p>

<p>This morning, I boosted my cash amount by buying and selling a pet named Tim with Francois, but
leaving Tim in Francois' pile so I could walk away with the pile of cash to buy Sabrina.</p>
