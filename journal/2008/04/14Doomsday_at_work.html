<p>It's not actually &quot;doomsday&quot; here at work, but I just wanted an early-in-the-alphabet
thing after &quot;Dentist.&quot; However, I'm totally dead in the water at work.  The svn server
which has all the changes / code / everything I was working on can't be reached by http, nor https,
nor ssh, and I don't know any other ways to reach it.</p>

<p>Too bad it was decided to put all our SVN crap on there.  I'm trying not to be all &quot;I
muthafuckin' told you so!&quot; cause I thought it was a waste to host our own SVN server, when all
we really needed were clients.  This has caused over a week of downtime for me, and today is
another day that I'll prolly not be able to do anything.</p>

<p>Rebooting the machine  plus restarting the web server fixed the SVN server problem, and I was
able to reconnect with my week of changes, finish them, merge them with the trunk, and update the
live server.  Nice.</p>

<p>(*) however, I still believe we should not be hosting our own SVN server.</p>
