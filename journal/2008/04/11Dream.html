<p class="dream">I needed to find out the weather for the day, but only had a radio, and I didn't
know the frequency of an English radio station, so I went across the street to ask them.  It was
Methil Drive, where I used to live, and I asked, &quot;are you Mike?&quot; because I didn't quite
remember what Mike looked like, and the guy was like, &quot;no, but I moved into his old
apartment,&quot; and I looked up at where Mike's house had been and found a small apartment complex,
shaped like the brick school/jail building where Wende and I used to live together.</p>

<p>This is the second time recently that I've dreamt about Methil.  I wonder what's going on t/here.</p>
