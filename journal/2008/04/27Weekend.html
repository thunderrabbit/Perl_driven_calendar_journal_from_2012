<p>OMG I can't believe I ain't really written anything about the weekend.  I spent a lot of time on
Uncle Cow's website after the great salsa party last night, so you can see pictures there.  Now I'm
rolling on Tokaido Line back from Chigasaki where I just left about 20 people singing karaoke in
two differnt rooms between which I was bouncing and singing the better song being played in which
room.  My voice is a bit raw right now, but I'm sure by tomorrow that will turn into a hoarsness.
I'll let Uncle Cow speak for me while I'm a hoarse person.</p>

<p>I'm not driunk; didn't touch a drop, but I imagine I looked drunk; I just turned off all
inhibitions regarding dance and climbing around on chairs and taking pictures and throwing Uncle Cow
around and had a hella great time.  Rapped &quot;Business&quot; in as the first song of the night
(after a &quot;warmup song&quot; of &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; while people were not yet into the room
and it was the first song title I recognized in the book.  Later busted out with Nas' &quot;Made you
look,&quot; which I *still* have not heard except in karaoke, but some other cats apparently had
cause thy knew the subtleties way better than I have figured out.  Yelled the shit out of
&quot;Starfuckers Inc.&quot; and &quot;All the pigs, all lined up&quot; which were put in by other
people, and actually salsaed with a girl (forgot her name Yoshiko?  Wait, I don't think she was the
surfer girl I met early on) when she was like, &quot;who can salsa???&quot; and I was like (no way)
and then realized <em>I gotta do dis,</em> cause no one else was volunteering and I turned off my
brain as best as I could and did a few steps as she wiggled her bootay a lot and ended up leading
herself.  She said she was beter at leading the guy part, which is funny in a way, but basically we
had fun and later I saw her salsering with a different guy who knew wtf he was doing, and I
was glad for her.</p>

<p>I used reiki to clear the smoke away from me as much as possible, chowed a lot of chips and ate
one of the bananas that I had b(r)ought but didn't get eaten at the beach, and an apple maybe; I
forget.</p>

<p>Huge great day, and next year by golly I'm staying over night!  I had to leave during karaoke
last year as well.  But anyway, had big fun.  As I was saying goodbye in the &quot;other room,&quot;
a girl wouldn't let Uncle Cow come with me and she jumped up and I hugged her and she went in for a
bit of a kiss; and in the other room one of the guys swiped Uncle Cow like cownapping to keep me;
and another guy was like, &quot;just one more hour&quot;</p>

<p>I felt really happy that I actually had let myself enjoy enough to be enjoyed enough to be asked
to stay.  what a blessing.</p>

<p>During the headbanging part of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot,&quot; I headbanged the snot out of
Uncle Cow and during a different song I was using him as a guitar, a microphone, and as a pick on
my air guitar</p>

<p>&quot;Baby Got Back&quot; was great with three people busting out the lyrics quite well, and
Several people helped me get &quot;Zak and Sara&quot; belted out pretty well.</p>

<p>Super duper awesomely uper special thanks to Soness and Daniel for hosting and opening their
house to anyone who needs to stay over tonight.</p>

<p>Met Maggie with great curly hair, Rob and his girl with a great kanji.  Three kanji. ¼ùÎ¤¡¡then
ki over  sun, but I can't remember the pronunciation to write it here.</p>

<p>Met Jin from Chicago / New York.  She's lived in
China (Shanghai) then Korea, now Japan for 6 months so far (says each new language replaces the
previous one (sorta same for me)</p>

<p>Met Corinne from Austin and met someone who lives 10 minutes from my place in Motosumiyoshi.</p>

<p>got email address of one more girl but I forgot her story</p>

<p>Uncle cow had a great time and got many kisses and was assured that he stinks and smells like
sweat, so maybe (maybe) I'll stop using him as a pillow when I sleep and actually wash him tonight
when I get home or tomorrow night.  But I gotta do a shirt for work tomorrow ( I washed it but
there is still curry on the front) (Japanese washers suck) (they use only cold water)</p>

<p>YESTERDAY was great fun at the salsa night organized primarily (?) by Jen, with Natalie and
Cesar teaching salsa..</p>

<p>I think I can keep this up and stop being so shy and inhibited; somehow with
Uncle Cow needed a spokesperson, it's been helping me.  Mia and others at the meditation group
(ISIS related) were like, &quot;you don't need no Francois&quot; and I'm like, well for now I do.
Even on the platform when the Rob just a day or two ago would have shyly turned away after a guy in
a group of guys said HI to me (he must be drunk; Japanese don't do that 99.9% of the time) and I
instead was like, &quot;this cow's website yis a wiki so you can upload pictures of him; sanyone
got a camera?&quot; and they were like &quot;no&quot; so I pretended to walk away, and then showed
them just the fly2.nu part and was like, &quot;well, just remember this part and you can find the
u.cow part&quot;   I might have asked them if they had a cellphone camera (of course yes), but I'm
slowly learning how to promote U Cow.</p>

<p>Really great to walk up today and find Levi who I know from PB as he was just leaving and gave
him several hugs and  blessed his journey as he had just tcalled his g/f to say he was coming back
home.  (wehreas Ami had had to stay home cause her dad has been on her case about staying out with
me so much  (she might get her own partment soon) (actually closer to mine (*)))</p>

<p>(*) in a place to which I had an interesting pull and I wonder if that feeling can be associated
with a connectiong to the future or something. I've had it a couple times before, but I don't know
if it's just noticing that I've notiecd things before and then ended up there later, but just
ignore all the things I've noticed and not ended up there later</p>

<p>So last night was great and tonight / today was great and I've had a uper great weekend all
around, incluig some productivity on Saturdyay and getting a new comptuer on Friday from Jason) and
I'm looking forward to  Uncle Cow's continued travels around the world.  I really think we can make
this idea work.  I recently remembered the guy who has a watch business out of Okinawa I think, and
he was lie, &quot;the thing about good business ideas is that people give up before they have a
chance to tkae off.  It takes five years for a business to hit.  &quot; or something like that.  So
I'm gonna keep at this fly2.nu for a while.  Maybe I'll got ahead and extend the domain names for
that long now and commit to that mcuh time promoting different aniimals</p>

<p>saying that now because most everyone was keen on the idea, and I didn't mind repeating the idea
mutiple times (means I have good energy about it; usually I hate repeating myself cause it triggers
my &quot;not being listened to&quot; issues) and I kept having good ideas on how to make the site
more useful for Japanese (not big ideas, but just the idea that I should make an animal with a
Japanese we wiki by default Japanese by default wiki ancause Uncle Cow's is English by default, and
I' can make a how to, and I wonder if I can make an &quot;upload to this page&quot; box or
something.  Make it easier to upload pics to pages. or a faq that includes how to upload, etc etc
etc</p>

<p>Seems this is a goood idea and aint' no one had it quite like this (not with such a phat domain
name (and by phat I mean short!))</p>

<p>I actually left karaoke and caught the train 10 minutes before my last train, so I coulda sung
two more songs, but I'm okay with having set my boundaries and left well ton time and resisted the
urge to hug that girl who gave me the unexpected kiss.. just now arriving in Kawasaki, so I'll
pause for now.</p>
