<p>Where is Ami?</p>

<p>She called me at 11:30ish and said she was coming over (I thought)...  but she also said she was
drunk, and she said she was taking a taxi to my place from Motosumiyoshi.</p>

<p class="date">1:45am JST</p>

<p>I called Ami several several times, but no answer.  Just called her again before I'm heading off
to bed.</p>

<p>Japan is &quot;safe,&quot; so I'm not really worried about her, but I'm a bit concerned; I hope
she is well.</p>
