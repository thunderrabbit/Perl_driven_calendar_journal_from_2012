<p>I did get a &quot;mission&quot; finished: basically make the search mechanism not suck.
Previously one had to specify which field it would search, which therefore required *extra* code to
search each separate field.  I wiped all that down to just one block of code and the search covers
all the different fields on which the search ought be performed.</p>

<p>Past that, I chatted with Madeline for about an hour, and will Skype with her in 9 hours!
Woohoo!!  So great to talk about real stuff, if only by chat.</p>

<p>I also uploaded about 15 Three Rocks pictures, watched some UFO vids, defended my reason for
leaving the No Planes Theory video on Youtube (I didn't create the vid, but I was intrigued by the
theory for a bit) even though I'm not so sure it's accurate anymore.</p>

<p>AND, I uploaded the picture of me and the monkey at work yesterday, AND when I left work, I
decided to succumb to my own pleas, and buy an animal for fly2.nu.</p>
