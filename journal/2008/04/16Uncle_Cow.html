<p>I went to ドンキ in search of a stuffed animal, and I bought Uncle Cow.  His short name will be
u-cow, because he's shaped like a U to act as a headrest.</p>

<p>Got pictures of him before I rescued him from his unnatural habitat, plus with a wooden elephant,
chillin' with bamboo, around the neck of a bronze statue, and around Hachiko's foot (with two ギャル
with him).</p>

<p><del>Tonight I'll create <aint href="http://u-cow.fly2.nu/">Uncle Cow's wiki</aint> and get this party started!</del> (*)</p>

<p>To uniquify him from the other cattle, I plan to embroider his URL on his belly.</p>

<p>I wonder how long I'll hang out with him before sending him out to graze on his own....</p>

<p>(*) Actually I'm wavering on this until I hear back from DH on whether I should use my username or a new one.</p>

<p>But, on the rest of my way home I took several more pictures.</p>
