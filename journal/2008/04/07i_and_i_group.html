<p>Dammit.  Thought the 2nd and 4th Mondays of the month normally equate to every other Monday, they
don't always (e.g. today).</p>

<p>The good news: I wasn't late for what woulda been the group had I come on the correct day.  And,
I got to read some of my book while waiting for myself to realize that I had come on the wrong
day.</p>

<p>I walked lazily back through Ebisu Gardens, scoping The Glass Square (expensive shops with glass
walls) and choosing not to buy ice cream, though the thought crossed my mind several times.</p>

<p>In Nakameguro now, just capturing this moment, esp. since I've hardly written shit about the
great day yesterday, but I've hardly got the energy to do it justice.</p>
