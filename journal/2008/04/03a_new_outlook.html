<p>During the business card exchange, I wrote my name and email on a scrap of paper, while Katee
had these cool little business cards.  I was like, &quot;note to self: make some cards,&quot; and
then I thought about getting a card holder to keep them nicely before I hand them out, and then</p>

<p>(dramatic pause)</p>

<p>I had a flash on actually doing something crazy like buying a new shirt so I might have a more
refined / well-raised look about me, and I noted how that would/could help me feel more confident
about myself in social situations.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>These are exactly some of the things Kim Sawyer suggested back in the day, but at that time I
was like, &quot;yeah yeah whatevah,&quot; but now I'm like, &quot;hmmmm; could be nice.....&quot;</p>
