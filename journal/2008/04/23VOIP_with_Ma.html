<p>Tonight after getting tickets to Hong Kong, Ami and I headed home for dinner and so I could
catch my mom on Skype for an hour of connection thanks to fiber, VOIP, and countless other
technologies with which we are blessed.</p>

<p>I felt really loved when I pulled out Uncle Cow to show Ma and Ma was like, &quot;Uncle
Cow!&quot; Wow wow wow Ma reads my site and pays attention!</p>

<p>Great to talk to Ma; I encouraged her to put an animal on a wiki on the fly2.nu network, and she
told me about the latest haps in her life, including new screened porch, dental fun, choir practice,
yoga, and plans for the summer (GA, which will be held in a Port Authority, requiring ID to be
shown on each entrance).</p>
