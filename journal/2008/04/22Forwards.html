HI

I recently received an email that you forwarded earlier this month.  I copied your email address
from the email headers of previous forwards all the way back to Mr Dennis, who did, thankfully,
clean off the headers he received.  Thank you, Mr Dennis.

A lot of stuff on the internet is not real.  And even if it is real, bulk-forwarding emails and
asking the 1000th person to send to a certain address almost certainly won't be effective.  It will
instead clog "the tubes" of the internet.

If you'd like to send a message to the president, send a message to the president.  I doubt he will
read it, but perhaps one of his staffers will, if the spam filter doesn't kill the message
immediately upon arrival due to all the forwards.

But that's not why I'm writing.

If you want to forward something, please be so kind as to remove the previous headers so the
recipient doesn't have to scroll down pages to find the content of the message.

Also, there's an address field called BCC, or Blind Carbon Copy, which I have used to email this to
you.  (If you'll notice, your address does *not* appear along side the eight other addresses to
which I'm sending this message.)  BCC means "send this, but don't show the address."  This function
is useful when sending to people who don't know each other, and may not appreciate their address
being given to the other recipients.

But that's also not why I'm writing.

Instead of fearing "illegal aliens" taking all our money, let's request that the government stop
destroying the world so we can shift military spending to pay for social security, better schools,
etc.

&gt; SOCIAL SECURITY CHANGES  
&gt;     
&gt;   
&gt; It does not matter if you personally like or dislike Bush.  You need to sign this petition and
flood his e-mail box with e-mails that tell him that, even if the House passes this bill, he needs
to veto it.  It is already impossible to live on Social Security alone.  If the government gives
benefits to 'illegal' aliens who have never contributed, where does that leave those of us who have
paid into Social Security all our working lives?
