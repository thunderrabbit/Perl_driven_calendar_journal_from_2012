<p>Hung up with Ma and then played with Ami for just a couple of minutes before she had to bicycle
home.  I love playing kids' games with her; I'm always hiding or pretending to hide in various dark
corners, and trying to surprise her in all variety of ways.  Today, as she went outside, I hid
behind the door on the inside (there's windows in the entry so I had to crouch), and held the door
unlatched so I could stealth quietly out after her as she rode away.</p>

<p>I ended up bursting out of the door and quietly, &quot;rar!&quot; so as not to alert the
neighbors, and then a few more hugs and kisses before she left.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, bye,&quot; and she would take off and I would follow her like an attached puppy, and
then she goes, &quot;go home!&quot; as toward a puppy who simply doesn't know it's being scolded.
So funny!</p>
