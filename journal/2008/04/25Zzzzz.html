<p>Now I'm home and have been making some cash of FFS.  Haven't even opened the new computer.  I
don't really have anywhere to put it.  First I'll need to confirm how to transfer my userspace to
the new machine.  Gotta decide if I wanna carry the new one around..  If so, might get a new case
for it.</p>

<p>Might get a new wireless keyboard as well.</p>
