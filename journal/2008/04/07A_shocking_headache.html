<p>I haven't been able to sleep due to a shocking headache, that I think was caused by too much
focus on friendsforsale / Facebook / computer in general.</p>

<p>But I just took a hot shower, letting the 45 degree water course down my back for like 10+
minutes, and that seemed to alleviate my headache.</p>

<p>As I arrived back in my room, the headache seems to have come back.  I dunno if it's my room or
computer or what.</p>

<p>Also, the backlight on my computer seems unwilling to turn on.  It must also have a headache.</p>

<p class="date">3:36am JST</p>

<p>I restarted my computer and that fixed its headache.</p>

<p>I'ma try to sleep again.</p>
