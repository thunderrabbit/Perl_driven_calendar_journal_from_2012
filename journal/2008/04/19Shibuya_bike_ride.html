<p>So happy that Ami rode with me to Shibuya!  We made it there in 1.3 hours, and back in a similar
amount of time.  Near the Free Hugs area in  Shibuya Square, I found Levi and others with Jen and
Kazzah rolling in soon thereafter.  Taka and I helped people put 9 signs in their spokes, and I met
Megumi with a flexible camera stabilizer just like the one Travis showed me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know Travis!&quot; she says, &quot;e made this for me!&quot;</p>

<p>Holy coolness; how random that we'd both meet her!</p>

<p>Megumi was actually the reporter on the 53rd PB voyage, so actually I've heard her nae before,
and may have met her,..  but today I sorta fell for her, so I was happy near the end of the day
when she was like, &quot;do you have a Facebook account?  I'd like to hear more about your
traveling stuffed animal idea and something.  I was like, 'wooo hoo!</p>

<p>nice time as all us hippy-types ewere chillin' on the ground with  variety of food items</p>

<p>oops train.  to be continued.</p>

<p>So, it was fun, and fun to get closer in touch with PB peeps; I'd like to staff and sail again.
Man, that sounds fun.</p>
