<p>Dang.. more svn problems, which I don't know how to solve.  While I think it has to do with SVN
versions, I'm not even sure about that.</p>

<p>I don't know what he did, but after a couple of hours, °æ¾å¤µ¤ó was able to fix the SVN issue.
It's not 100% fixed, but it's workable now.</p>

<p>Now that I know how to use trunks, branches and tags, I wish I had created this repository with
a trunk.  I wonder how to switch it mid-stream...</p>

<p>I was able to get the three code bases connected to trunk (after adding trunk to the thing), and
no downtime for the site.  Then I branched and added the big chunk of survey code (that uses
Smarty and Postgres instead of our homegrown MVC and mySQL)</p>
