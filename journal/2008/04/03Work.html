<p>And just got the /home/ directory cleaned the hell up.  We had tons of copies of copies of
copies of code all over the place this morning, but now it's all either been deleted or moved to a
directory called 20080403unused.  I'll be deleting that after a while.</p>

<p>Okay.  Right after I go poo, I'ma create a branch in the repository and see if I can sort out how
they're useful, by actually trying to use it.  svn merge, here I come.</p>

<p class="date">6:34pm JST</p>

<p>Created a branch easily enough, of course, and used switch in my working directory to use it..
wasn't able to get the code changes made, but I'm gonna get outta here and head lesson with ¤æ¤ê¤«.</p>
