<p><a href="/zenphoto/funny/passwords.png.php"><img src="/images/funny/passwords.png" alt="bad
passwords" align="left" /></a> Granted, this is just a test system, and a password is required to
even view the login screen, but I thought this list of passwords was funny (*).</p>

<p>Also funny (!) is that they're stored without encryption, a point about which I ranted some months
ago.</p>

<p>Super Genuine thanks to <a href="http://supergenpass.com/">supergenpass.com</a> for making it
easy for me to create good passwords.</p>

<p>(*) not like funny haha, but like funny uh-oh.</p>

<p>(!) not like funny haha, nor funny uh-oh, but funny whoops!</p>
