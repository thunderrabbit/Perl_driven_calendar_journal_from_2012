<p>The good news: we got the live system moved to svn.  That's good.</p>

<p>The bad news: fucking guy didn't follow the instructions I gave which specified the use of asvn
so that the directory permissions would be set along with the file download.  I think that must be
what happened, but I don't know yet, because we are &quot;too busy&quot; looking at a different
directory permissions issue.</p>

<p>There's some code in one of our php files that's something like</p>

<pre>
if(!isfile($dirname))
{
    mkdir ($dirname);
}
</pre>

<p>And we need to add code that changes the directory permissions.  Although I don't actually know
why it's suddenly a problem *now*, given that 43 directories had been created with the old code,
and they apparently worked just fine.</p>

<p>One way to test the code by making it trigger the mkdir code would be to mv the current directory
somewhere and run the code.  That would be pretty fast.</p>

<p>Another way would be to add an else</p>

<pre>
if(!isfile($dirname))
{
    mkdir ($dirname);
}
else
{
    $crapdirname = &quot;/tmp/monkey&quot;;
    mkdir ($crapdirname);
    chmod ($crapdirname, 0777);
}
</pre>

<p>And then move the code once we know it works.</p>

<p>Or, and this is the way that's been suggested, we'll upload 62 (sixty-two) files until the
existing directory reaches capacity and triggers the next mkdir.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But that's not what's got me all riled up.  One of my key personal triggers is being ignored or
people not listening when I speak.  This keeps me quiet a lot.  So when guy apparently didn't
follow the instructions I sent, that triggers me.  Fucking why did I spend all day yesterday
writing up that shit if you're not going to use it?  I could have just wanked off all day and we'd
be just as well off now, and I wouldn't be pissed off.</p>

<p>AND, trying to speak Japanese, and repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly always not fucking being
understood is a nice way to trigger me.  That keeps me quiet as well.  I need to get to the bottom
of this issue.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There was a time in my I-group that we were looking at this, in regards to Allen the dork at my
ex-ex-...ex-ex-job not listening or something, and I flashed on a scene where I was in the war and
my buddy didn't listen as I told him he was incorrectly loading a bazooka or some shit and when he
fired it, something blew out the back as well and ripped him in half dead (or as dead as one would
be when ripped in half, but with brain still working, going &quot;oh shit that hurts; what am I
doing on the ground?&quot;).  The scene was quite vivid; I remember it even now though it's been
ten years since I had the memory.  Only weird thing about it: I was never in a war with army
buddies, etc.  wtf was that?</p>

<p>Anyway, there's obviously more work to be done in this department of my mind.</p>
