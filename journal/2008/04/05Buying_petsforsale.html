<p>I recently started playing with Friends For Sale on Facebook.  Just this morning I learned how
to really start making money at it, and I wonder if taking risks here will change my risk aversion
with &quot;real&quot; money.</p>

<p>Francois recently made $1400 profit by buying someone for $23,994 who was then immediately
purchased for $26,874 by someone else.</p>

<p>Now Francois is back down to $508 after some purchases, waiting for them to be purchased
by someone else else.</p>

<p>I had bought a lot of my friends from YRUU and PB, so I didn't have as much cash, but I just
bought someone for $13,616, so I now have only $585 (total $14,201)</p>

<p class="date">9:55am JST</p>

<p>And now I just bought someone for $14,073, leaving me with $381 (total $14,454)</p>

<p class="date">9:57am JST</p>

<p>And now someone just bought him, so I have $15,298 in cash.</p>

<p>Just did a few quick buys and sells of people so now I made some quick cash on some girl, whose
price was quickly raised from like $600 to $19000</p>

<p class="date">11:00am JST</p>

<p>I'm out of the markets for now; all my money is tied up in various places.</p>
