<p>I'm feeling way better now.  I was able to explain that asvn shoulda been used instead of svn
this morning.  I fixed the directory issues with a semi-risky technique that worked well enough:</p>

<pre>
# cd /home
# mv livedir livedir.old; mv livedir.new livedir
</pre>

<p>And I just now figured out how/why to use trunk and tags, though I'm not necessarily clear on the
value of branches given that they don't actually rejoin the trunk, but I can live with that for
now.  I created a tag called はじめまして, but using romanji to represent the word.</p>
