<p>Just got back from meeting my reiki master Mia for level 2 reiki attunement.  One of the times
she touched the top of my head today, I felt a dull linear pain through my right eyeball bone, which
receded as soon as she removed her hand.</p>

<p>She gave three symbols that correspond to physical-etheric, astral-spiritual, and time-space
related work.  That's pretty dope.</p>

<p>I'm excited about this training, and I fell in love with her a couple times during the session.
The nice thing about us both doing personal growth work: I was able to tell her that I fell in love
with her, and we both knew it's actually me resonating with something I see in her that is
repressed in my&nbsp;self (*).  (*) space and lowercase s intended in &quot;my self&quot;</p>
