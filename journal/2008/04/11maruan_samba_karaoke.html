alt="Maruan and birthday plate" class="left" /></a>Great times at Maruan's party...  and to think
they've got half nekked samba dancers jittering on stage every night!  Fortunately for me, the stage
was right next to me, and only a single step off the ground.  I wiggled in my chair until one of the
dancers pulled me up and Ami filmed me doing a gentle version of Rob's Crazy Dance on stage.  Great
fun.</p>

<p>Smugmug version of <a href="http://thunderrabbit.smugmug.com/gallery/4712025_c9f9g#278826465_QkfqT">Maruan Party pictures</a> (no login required).</p>

<p>Near the end of the meal I met Takashi as we showed off how flexible our hands/fingers are.
Basically I won, but he can bend his thumb back almost as far as I.</p>

<p>Then to karaoke where Maruan and I busted out a couple of Eminem songs and Nax and I helped
Maruan with Just The Way You Are.  Met his friend Julia as we were leaving karoke (she sang
Wuthering Heights wonderfully, and a few other Japanese songs which I had never previously
heard).. Maruan and Kyoko sang a song that was like &quot;You¤ÏShock&quot; several times, which
prolly means you are shocked, but I didn't understand the other lyrics enough to make sense of the
context.</p>

<p>The night was in celebration of Maruan's birthday (actually today); at the end I mentioned my
14,000th day party is coming up on July 11th i think.  Need to confirm and start pimpin' the
date.</p>
