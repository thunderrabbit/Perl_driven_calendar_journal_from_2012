<p>Fun times hanging out with Ami in Mark City in the *other* half of Afternoon Tea cafe.  This is
the night she told me her dad was like, &quot;if you're going to spend so much time at Rob's why
don't you move out??&quot; when Ami thinks what he really wants is her to stay home more.  I don't
want to move and my crib ain't big enough to hold all her stuff (still her same room from
childhood, so she still hasn't done a move-out-purge).  I suggested that Ami stay a bit longer (so
she can keep her expenses down), and then move out in about 1.5 years.</p>

<p>Hahahaha this is the night that Ami put her nose on my finger.  Three times.  I love Ami.</p>
