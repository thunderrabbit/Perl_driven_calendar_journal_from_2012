<p>Hahah fun times on FriendsForSale.  I was browsing the random girls who were recently active,
and three times, came across one who was way- undervalued, and in a friendzy of friend feeding, for
some reason a few other guys found the girls at the same time and we just bought and bought and
bounced the price up 50-fold in like three minutes.I can see how this would be equally fun with
real money</p>

<p>Got a snapshot of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=824736&id=591084578">Francois
owning the most beautifulest girl</a> of the day.  I even made a new photo album in expectation that
there will be more FriendsForSaleFavorites.</p>
