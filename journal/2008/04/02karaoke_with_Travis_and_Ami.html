<p>Fun times tonight with Travis and Ami in Shibuya.  First I opened a ещере═ bottle the wrong way
(I knew the right way) and Travis asked about it, so I showed him the right way and then turned it
upside down and shook it on his question and suggestion, respectively.  Squirted unceremoniously
and a bit wastefully; we shoulda gotten it on video!  I had my camera right there, too.</p>

<p>Oh, he showed me a dope flexible tripod he has; actually it wasn't his idea originally, but it's
cool.  Basically a camera on a string that can be made taught to keep the camera steady.</p>

<p>I watched the girls around us as we ate.  One girl had on busies with busies with busies!
Shirt, skirt and stockings were three different color patterns!  Cool.</p>

<p>Then to karaoke where and hour and a half went by like zooooom!  I sang some Eminem, Nas, Fatboy
Slim, and others I don't remember.  Travis was more rockin', but had a couple of hip hop hits in
his set.  Ami sang all Japanese songs, but didn't sing any I knew.</p>

<p>Ami and I joked around on the way home; it was fun.  I like Ami.</p>
