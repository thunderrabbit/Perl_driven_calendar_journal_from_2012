<p>Good learning with Yurika today.  She did a great job on her homework, and had good questions.
I asked her a question about something over which she had glossed, and I knew she didn't understand
it as well as she could.  I'm pretty pleased with how I was able to gently tilt thoughts her way
until she got the answer.</p>

<p>I had randomly decided to go to Pink Cow today, so after the lesson, I invited Yurika to join if
she wanted to go.  I wondered what the Cow would feature tonight... For 1000 yen cover that included
a drink ticket, there were movie presentations including a woman named Katee (pronounced Katie)
who's from Philly, has lived in Glasgow for 6 years, but was just in India for 3 months, all for
some research on various forms of dance.</p>

<p>AND, at the entrance was a little setup to video people for the World Wide Wave; they were
recording individuals doing the wave in exchange for a free drink, so I was like, &quot;word,&quot;
and Yurika did her own wave as well.</p>

<p>We happened to sit beside Katee and her sis-in-law AnneMarie and chatted with them a bit between
and during the other presentations.  AnneMarie has been here for a year with her husband, and Katee
will be here for 5 more weeks.</p>
