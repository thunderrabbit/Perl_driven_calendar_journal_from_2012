<p>I was having a little painter's block on the blue striped canvas piece, but I broke through today with
some light blue, brown, and red.  They all were traced along shadows made by: the white towel with
which I've been keeping the canvases clean, the edge of the big marker case, and my left hand.  I
think it will turn out rather well.</p>
