<p>I'm on the train headed home from Shibuya; Ami just called me; I apparently just missed her in
Nakameguro.  I shoulda let her know my precise arrival time.</p>

<p>Dammit; there's that &quot;shoulda&quot; and desire for perfection.</p>

<p>At PB, I basically bisected a couple thousand sheets of paper.  We're keeping the yellow halves,
and the white halves are going to be used as scrap sheets.  PB is careful to reuse and recycle a lot.</p>
