<p>Got this shizzle pretty much sizzled.  I've got the survey page visually incorporated into the
blosta themed CSS, but there's a bit of a hiccup for the user as they do the final submit for the
survey, but still have to do the final final submit for the mission.  It should be a single finish
for the user, but I've got it split up because the surveys are in one DB (postgres), and the
missions are in another (mySQL).</p>

<p>One solution would be to automagically submit this form (with data filled in from their
$_SESSION, but this is ripe for attack because it's just hidden forms in which they could insert
any ol' data.</p>

<p>SO, I need to more carefully link the final survey submit to the final mission DB write.</p>

<p>But first, I gotta go send a number 2 message to the President.</p>
