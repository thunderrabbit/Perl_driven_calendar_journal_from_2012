<p>On the train ride home I wrote this, with the intention of sending a Rob Update tonight</p>

Hey everybody!

I'm just writing to say HI! and to mention a couple of websites

I got the idea after losing Francois back in February..  basically thinking if Francois had my
information on him, then I'd be more likely to get him back!  That idea morphed a few times until I
got the perfect plan:

Give each 

Put 

Let stuffed anmals travel wherever they like, and let whoever finds them write about them onthe
animal's wiki!

I bought isfuzzywilltravel.com so I could make domains like  jacquesrabbit.isfuzzywilltravel.com

AND SO

I'm inviting people to find a stuffed animal that would like to travel with its own wiki!

Some people on this list (HI Mom!) have never actually written on a wiki, so here's a great reason
to learn how!  Wikis are cool in that they basically let anyone with internet access make changes to
the site!

I've been working on uncle.cow.isfuzzywilltravel.com, and expect to send him on his own adventure
after the summer!

Hmmm maybe I'll post some flyers

Have you seen me?
Let your animals travel free with their very own wiki!
