<p>Pretty interesting morning; Ami came home late (as expected), but pretty much hungover, which I
didn't really expect.  I mean &quot;tired,&quot; sure, but I wasn't impressed with hungover.  To
Natalia, who I met synchronistically in the kitchen (after I went to the conveni, with intent to
photograph the Three Rocks, but turned back without a picture because I had left my camera's memory
card with my computer), I said, &quot;why do people get drunk???&quot; and Natalia was like,
&quot;dood, you have to realize that when you are drinking, you don't think about the consequences;
you just think about right now.&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;*I* think about the consequences, and so I don't drink!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, most people...&quot;</p>

<p>And then she went on, &quot;and it's only one day,&quot; meaning some people get drunk every
night, ... and I was like, &quot;yah; it's not very common that she does this..&quot;</p>

<p>Natalia cooked me breakfast, and I &quot;helped&quot; her clean the range (by offering that the
rubber gloves Ami and I have are too small for my hands, but they'd fit Natalia perfectly), and I
showed her that the top of the range can be removed, and I help move the entire range when she
wanted to clean under it.</p>

<p>To be clear, Natalia did *all* the cleaning, and I just moved shit around and bought her some
yogurt while she was cleaning.</p>

<p>Ami joined the living during the range cleaning process, and we hung out</p>
