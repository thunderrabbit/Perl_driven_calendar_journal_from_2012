<p>I excised the extra array definitions quickly enough.  Now I'm &quot;testing,&quot; but more
like hitting refresh on my FriendsForSale window while semi-testing without much heart in it.  I'm
pretty sure the code is okay; I think I'll move it online.</p>

<p>update: I didn't move it online; I'm gonna keep making changes and do better testing (involving
other people).</p>
