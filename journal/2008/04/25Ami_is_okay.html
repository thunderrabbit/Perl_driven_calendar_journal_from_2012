<p>Ami called; she is okay.  I told her I was feeling anger after she told me one thing then did
another, esp. without letting me know the change, not answering my calls, and esp. since it's when
she was drunk.</p>

<p>I'm recalling the difficulty in controlling my own brain with I'm drunk with the desire for sex,
so I can sorta understand her situation, but not completely.</p>
