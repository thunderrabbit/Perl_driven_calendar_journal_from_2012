<p>And now, it's time for a</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p>by Rob Nugen.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Just this morning I have been fartin' around on FriendsForSale on Facebook.  It's fun when
cash is rolling in, but boring when all the cash is tied up in investments.</p></li>

<li><p>Outside, the sky is overcast, with inconsistent wisps of breeze bringing chilly air.  My
window is open, but perhaps overly optimistically so.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.jasoncollin.org/">Jason Collin</a> put his old Mac up for sale,
which is basically a nicer version of my old Mac, and arguably equal or better than my current mac
in everything except CPU speed, so I'm gonna buy it after next payday (25 April).</p></li>

<li><p>I've been doing my reiki meditation things (I don't have a name for them, but Èþ°¡ said they
get my body used to the reiki energy) every day for the past 2 weeks.  For the last week or so, I
found that my legs really wanted to squirm while I was doing the meditations.  Slighter version of
the same thing this morning, but only in my left leg, focused on my inner thigh.</p>

<p>Also I have noticed some differences in the warmth of my hands.  Or maybe not.  But I'll keep
going with this and see how it manifests.</p></li>

<li><p>I am the proud (?) owner of eight (8) domain names, though most of them are not really being
used.  Active ones: robnugen.com, thunderrabbit.com.  Inactive: chatbotchats.com, chatforest.com.
In between: ctbriefs.net, pekoneko.com, isfuzzywilltravel.com, airplaneday.com.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been slowly working with Dave from English Adventure to get a shopping cart set up on
his website, but have had trouble because I don't have any experience with using Yahoo! Small
Business accounts, and I don't have full access to the account (i.e. his password).  It seems like
it should be possible, but I don't know fo sheezy.</p></li>

<li><p>chatforest has seen no activity in the past several months.  Basically I went away to the US
for a month and haven't done shit on it since.  I imagine Tariq is working his ass off as usual,
but just on other things (his specific business)</p></li>

<li><p>I'm quite interested in getting back involved with PB again.  I've attended a couple of PB
related things, including Maruan and Kyoko's wedding, and the GET Hanami fest, plus a party at Jen
and Taka's afterward, and tomorrow going to meet Natalie, although she is basically retiring from
PB quite shortly.</p></li>

<li><p>PB is doing a big conference: <a href="http://whynot9.jp/index_en.html">Global Article 9
Conference to Abolish War</a>, and I'll be helping with that.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently bought a gorilla grip tripod for my camera.  Used it at Jen and Taka party,
including the grip functionality to get it to work on the back of a chair.</p></li>

<li><p>I sent an update to Kim Sawyer yesterday or so:</p>

<ol class="katakana">

<li><p>I'm in a good space here.  In about 4 days the final bank transfer will complete and I'll
officially be out of debt, including all credit cards, and all loans from my family when I broke my
shoulder.  And now I have health insurance through my work.</p></li>

<li><p>For a couple years, I had put off going to the dentist because I had
no health insurance.  Soon after writing "Dentist" on a big white
poster (along with other things I want to do / have), I made a dental
appointment (even before the insurance had been approved).  I now see
the wisdom in going more frequently.</p></li>

<li><p>I've begun to connect with a friend named Travis, who I met in Houston
back in late 1990s; he moved to Japan some time ago, and now he lives
in Tokyo.  He was actually part of the influence that brought me here.
We both don't drink, don't smoke, like computer programming, like
painting, like singing karaoke.  Having friends who share my interests
feels good.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm reading one of the Clairvision books:  _REGRESSION: past-life
therapy for here and now freedom_, by Samuel Sagan, the founder of
Clairvision.  The book describes an excellent model to explain the
variety of selves in my mind.  Sometimes I say, "part of me wants to
do this; but part of me wants to do that," and now I have some clarity
for what could cause these disparities.</p></li>

<li><p>Through Reiki and this non-reiki book about subtle bodies,
I have a couple more techniques for building my spiritual awareness
through meditation and having a language to understand what's going on
subjectively in my mind.</p></li>

<li><p>Also regarding romance, I recently re-read The Five Love Languages,
and will be looking for a Japanese translation soon.  (what the hell
does "soon" mean???)</p></li>

<li><p>Work is good, but not super-great.  No news on business fronts, though
I do have an interesting(?) internet idea that's not doing anything yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I bought <a href="http://isfuzzywilltravel.com/">isfuzzywilltravel.com</a> and will make URLs like
<a href="http://jacquesrabbit.isfuzzywilltravel.com/">jacquesrabbit.isfuzzywilltravel.com</a> so
that stuffed animals can be tracked as they travel around the world, either with their owners or via
postal mail.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>After reading the regression book, I'm definitely more interested in doing ISIS work.  I
think.  Perhaps the different astral parts of me are going to fight for further control.
Interesting to see this as it's happening.</p></li>

<li><p>I've basically finished five of
my <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Art:Nine_F0s%2C_early_2008">nine F0 paintings</a>.  The 6th and
7th are started, and the 8th was used specifically for Ami (I'll need to buy another so I can put it
in the show in July), and the 9th is still blank white.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm getting more proficient at using SVN; I'm glad because I can remember less than a year
ago I didn't know the second thing about it.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently re-discovered video tapes from PB voyage.  I've slowly been importing them and
putting them up online.  So far I haven't done many, but perhaps I will get another up
soon.</p></li>
