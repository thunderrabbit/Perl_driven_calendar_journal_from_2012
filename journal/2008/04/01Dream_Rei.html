<p class="dream">One of the girls with whom I was flirting was about to become an astronaut of
sorts; she had to get her makeup and gear together before going to climb aboard a rocket that was
more like an amusement park ride with seats on the outside.  All white, with three seats (the other
two women were already seated), the rocket ride was being rolled out of a garage on the corner of
Methil Drive.</p>

<p class="dream">Feeling quite genki and when I saw Rei at a party at our house on Methil, I climbed
on top of her for a hug and then we chatted for a bit.  I told her I still missed her and felt sad
about the way she had broken up with me.  We tried to ecall the language and came up with &quot;I
would date anyone but you,&quot; which wasn't quite right, but we stilll laughed about it.  I told
her I was a bit nervous about being freinds with her because I didn't know if I could switch to that
mode.  Ton was there and his bithday party started so I took pictures and Rei walked away (gah!) and
I took pictures of Tony and then they all vanished leaving me alone outside.  I put on a fake smile
and went inside to the party area.</p>
