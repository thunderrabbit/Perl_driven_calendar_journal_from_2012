<p>Benjamin Fulford is a cat who's lived in Japan for a while (15+ years), and wants to stop the
secret government run by the Rockefellers.  I didn't know about him until I
saw <a href="http://www.projectcamelot.org/benjamin_fulford.html">Benjamin Fulford interview on
Project Camelot.</a></p>

Hey Travis

I suddenly had an epiphany: why don't we go do a followup interview of Benjamin Fulford for Project
Camelot?  Carrie and Bill of Project Camelot may appreciate it.  I'd basically ask them for
direction in the interview (what Qs they would like to ask, and get my Qs approved by them (if the
interview is going to be published on their site))...  Would you be interested in working on this?

   See you!
    - Rob!

<p>Hahhaha.  Funny: now that I've
watched <a href="http://www.projectcamelot.org/george_green.html">Project Camelot's interview with
George Green</a>, I'm nearly anti-interested in the Benjamin Fulford thing.  I see his (Fulford's)
plan as a lost cause before I even know how it's going.</p>
