<p>While in the loo, I texted Ami today in English.  Something like</p>

<pre>
I am meeting Hideo ton
ight at 8pm, so I migh
t not see you if you c
ome get your glasses.
</pre>

<p>Because she had left her glasses in my room on Sunday.</p>

<p>She replied back</p>

<pre>
My boss is angry to
 me.So I will
finish work at 9 or
 10pm.
I will finish call
you.
I want to your
hug...
</pre>

<p>So, I'm chillin' at Motosumiyoshi now until she arrives in 8 minutes.</p>

<p>During the time that I've been waiting, I finished my reiki charging for today.</p>

<p>Nice.  I've got an internet connection here next to Cafe CUTE.</p>

<p class="date">7:12pm JST Wednesday 16 April 2008 (day 13902)</p>

<p>Ami didn't realize the cafe was inside the station, so she walked to the escalator before she saw
me (&quot;hiding&quot; behind a bench behind which I couldn't really hide), so I'll have to save
that joke for later.</p>

<p>She cooked a lovely dinner after I gave her lots of hugs and massaged and reikied her shoulders.
I don't know if they're reikier than they used to be, but I just wanted to use that palindrome.</p>

<p>She made me lunch for today as well, so that was really nice.</p>
