I read a lot of news in between chatting with Fred, printing some files, correcting Yurika's
homework, talking to a monkey, taping the printouts together, reading more news, breaktime, looking
for new email..</p>

<p>And in the last few minutes, I scoped the files that I printed, and figured out what changes
need to be made.  I assure you and myself and future me, if you're reading: I am *not* being used
to my full potential in this job, but for now, I'm enjoying the free internet and free time.</p>

<p>Now going to help Hideo with his website.</p>
