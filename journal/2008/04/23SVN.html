<p>I had had the great idea of versioning all the image files for our website, but it just clicked
that these depend on the DB, and therefore on the working copy.  Each working copy will have a
different set of images, so I can't just put them all in the same repository.  Or at least I don't
know how.</p>

<p>SO, I copied the image directory to /tmp/, svn removed the image dir from ~, then used two sweet
commands: find and xargs to kill all the .svn directories from within the image directory tree
(about 60 different dirs)</p>

<pre>find . -name .svn | xargs rm -rf</pre>

<p>Hmmm.  I made the change in a branch, and now I need to make the same change in the trunk (cause
if I merge it back, I know it will just kill the images directory).</p>

<p>But what I don't know is how subversion will handle two identical merges.  I guess it should
work well enough.  Nothing else to do but try it.</p>
