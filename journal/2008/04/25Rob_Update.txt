Hey everybody!

I'm just writing to say hi, and to give updates on the latest haps for me here in
Tokyo.

HI!

My latest greatest idea developed after I lost Francois back in February.

(for the short version, skip down to "AND SO")

After losing him, I thought how smart it would have been had I written my contact
information on Francois somehow.  I imagined that my domain name is least likely to
change, so I should use that.

It would be even cooler if Francois had had his *own* domain name; that would be
guaranteed not to change for the life of Francois.

I pondered this over some days and basically discarded the idea of getting a unique
domain name just for Francois, or in the present case, Jacques Rabbit (my planned
leporid replacement for Francois). Because then if I got even *another* animal, I'd
have to get another domain name, etc...  I don't want my stuffed animals to get
jealous of each other!

Then I wondered what I would actually put on the domain besides just my address.  

       "This animal belongs to Rob Nugen (robnugen.com)"

What a silly waste of a website that would be!

Then I realized was simply hoarding my future stuffed animals.  If they actually
have their own website, they should be their own owners!

Wait!  That's it!

I can get a travel website for stuffed animals!  I'll call it fuzzytravel!

Oops.  That domain is taken.  Okay, how about isfuzzywilltravel.com so I could make
domains like jacquesrabbit.isfuzzywilltravel.com and put a wiki on that website so
if anyone finds Jacques Rabbit, they can find his wiki and write about his
adventures!

The only detail: Jacques Rabbit hasn't yet been purchased: I asked my friend Kris
if she'd do the
honor, but rumor has it there are no perfect Rabbits in Canada, but she has her eye
on a giraffe!

I realized I could start any number of new animals myself, so I went to the local
Donki (the full name of the shop is donkihote, which certainly came from Don
Quixote, but the abbreviation is Donki), a crazy cramped chaotic capitalism center
where I bought a plush cow that looks like a headrest.  (Good thing I didn't buy
one of the neighboring giraffes!)

The cow is shaped like a U, so I call him U Cow, but his real name is Uncle Cow.

<a href="http://uncle.cow.isfuzzywilltravel.com/">http://uncle.cow.isfuzzywilltravel.com/</a> will lead you now quickly to U Cow's new
wiki.

I also created <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">http://u.cow.fly2.nu/</a> which is way easier to type.

AND SO

I'm inviting people to find a stuffed animal that would like to travel with its own
wiki!

Some people on this list (HI Mom!) have never actually editted a wiki, so here's a
great reason to learn how easy it is!  Wikis are cool in that they basically let
anyone with internet access make changes to the site!

Visit <a href="http://fly2.nu/">http://fly2.nu/</a> to read more, and email me back if you'd like to join the
fun!

Each wiki takes me a bit less than an hour to set up, so I've decided to set up
wikis for the first several (25?) animals free of charge, and then ask for a
donation, so hurry hurry! click right up!

In other news, I've been attuned to reiki level 2, and doing the associated
energy-meditations each morning.  I'm enjoying using this with massage!  I plan to
be reiki 3 attuned next month, and hopefully level 4 past that, but it's up to my
reiki master.

Interesting dynamics regarding cashflow these days: I'm officially out of debt with
credit cards and from my shoulder surgery, so to celebrate, I plan to buy a new
computer today!  It's actually a well-kept used computer from a local friend of
mine.

And Ami and I plan to visit Hong Kong this June (and need to pay deposit today).

BUT my company has asked if they can pay us all on the 30th instead of the 25th!

I believe everything will work out soon, but it's interestingly annoying.

Back to fun topics, I'm getting more involved with PB again; I'll be
volunteering at the Global Article Nine Conference To Abolish War
(<a href="http://whynot9.jp/index_en.html),">http://whynot9.jp/index_en.html),</a> and I'm considering teaching for PB
again (on land), so I can be teacher coordinator on the ship!

Ami and I are considering actually doing a PB voyage as passengers; that
would be quite a trip!


I hope you're happy and filled with love!

    Blessings
     - Rob!
