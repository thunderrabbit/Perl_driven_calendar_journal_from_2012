<p>My current, official quick answer for people interested in teaching / working in Japan.</p>

<pre>
I don't remember if you've visited Japan before, but if not, and if you have a few thousand dollars,
you may benefit just be coming to see how you like it and look for a job while you're a tourist.  I
imagine you'd certainly find work if you put effort into looking.

Teaching through the JET program will get you involved with a tightly knit group that teaches in
high schools around Japan.

If you teach through JET, you'll prolly work in a small city, far from
the hubs like Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, etc.  Downsides: super long preparation time (like 9 months), and
they only import teachers once per year.  I know some peeps who've done this, so you can talk to
them if you're interested.

Big language schools in Japan (bring in new teachers all the time):

(NOVA went bankrupt last October, so it's no longer an option.)

I'd say the big schools here are Aeon, Berlitz and Geos; and Gaba seems to be up-n-coming.

I've heard Berlitz has the best training, and they have schools around the world.
