<p>Gotta get back to work, but just wanted to post some links I found via
an <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Google+Street+View+Catches+Folks+in+The+Act/article11243.htm">article
in Daily Tech</a>.  The actual images they mention have been culled from Google, but there are some
similar images still available as I write this.</p>
