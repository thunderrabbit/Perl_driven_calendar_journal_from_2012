<p>Despite the previously written reasons for mass panic, today was a normal work day.  I got a bit
of a headache, though, which is not completely normal, as in, I don't get one every day.</p>

<p>My computer got two (2) headaches; I had to restart it twice.  <em>Could</em> be because I gave
20% of its CPU to Boinc! for Seti@home and Einstein@home (and LHC@home, but there are no work units
now).</p>

<p>Today was the day I considered an aspect of &quot;taking responsibility&quot; as not throwing
away any inorganic waste.  By about 3pm, that idea went to the astral waste bin.</p>

<p>In the end, I got the skeleton of a survey added to our process, and at the very end, I broke it
so that I could move it to SSL directory and split between user and admin sections.  The change
seems like it will be easier than I first guessed.</p>
