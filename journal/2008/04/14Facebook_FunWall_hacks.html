Hello

I'm reporting two distinct, yet related events.  The first is an email I believe was sent by a bot
of some sort, so I have included the original message and all headers below (see "begin first
message").  Basically it's a FunWall post announcement, but the content of the FunWall video is not
something I think my friend Paige would send.  (It's a few second clip of two Chinese (?)
newscasters.)

I then received a message from a different friend of mine, which I have pasted below (in richtext);
see "begin second message."  She claims she didn't send a FunWall message that came from her
profile.  I personally did not receive the message to which she's referring, but apparently some of
her other friends did.

I'm no bruce schneier, but I know a fair bit about web (in)security, so please don't reply with a
canned message about how I can protect my password.  I hope the messages below help you guys; I like
Facebook and hope it stays healthy.
