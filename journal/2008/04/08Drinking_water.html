<p>WTF</p>

<p>I used to drink 2 liters of orange juice every morning, usually before noon.</p>

<p>Then the store stopped carrying that product, so I switched to 1 liter OJ.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I bought a 2 liter bottle for water, which I would refill at the water
cooler here at work.</p>

<p>A bit over two (2) weeks ago, I got shocking news from Mia when she did my first reiki
attunement: Stop drinking orange juice (eat oranges instead), and glug glug glugging water is not
beneficial.</p>

<p>Shocked, (*) I stopped glug glug glugging water that moment, and subsequently for the
more-than-two-weeks, have been drinking about 1 liter of water per day, max (and only in small sips
at a time).</p>

<p>I still have the 2 liter bottle; I'm not going to throw it away just to buy another
container.</p>

<p>This morning, 中谷さん saw me refilling my water bottle, which I had finished the previous day
(though it had started the day perhaps half full).  He asked, in the most polite of ways,
basically, &quot;it would probably be better if you drank less water.&quot;</p>

<p>I sarcastically (#) asked how much he thought would be appropriate.  He suggested maybe one (1)
two-liter bottle per day.</p>

<p>Now, I like 中谷さん, and I don't actually think he came up with the great idea of saving money
for the company by asking Rob to drink less water.  But what pisses me off (I don't care that he
didn't &quot;protect me,&quot; from whomever initiated the request (and maybe it <em>was</em> his
idea,) but) what pisses me off is that I had already lowered my consumption OVER TWO WEEKS AGO, and
no one noticed/cared/etc.  Of course no one noticed the actual consumption rate; they just see my
big bottle and remember my old consumption rate.  If it was an issue at one point, fucking tell me
at that moment, not two+ weeks later after it's already fucking resolved. ($)</p>

<p>(*) she basically said it makes the body cold, and when she stopped glugging water, her hands
remained warmer throughout the day.  I want warmer hands as well, so I was happy to try something
tangible to warm 'em up.</p>

<p>(#) sarcasm isn't taken as such in Japan; so it's one way I can piss on people who piss me off,
&quot;oh thank you very much,&quot; in a voice that says, &quot;oh, fuck you very much,
asshole,&quot; and they think I'm thanking them, and I feel better, and then I immediately wonder
how it's perceived energetically. </p>

<p>($) Overall, the lovely part is having gotten a carrot-reason for reducing my consumption,
instead of a stick-reason to stop drinking so much.</p>

<p>Also interesting: I've recently read a couple of articles from a study saying drinking tons of
water per day doesn't enhance one's health.</p>
