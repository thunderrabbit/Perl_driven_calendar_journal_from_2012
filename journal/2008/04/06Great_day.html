<p>Yesterday was a great day, starting lazily for Ami, and reikily for me, then we headed off to
Yoyogi at the crack of 11am.  I looked for Francois under the Yamanote platform (not sure why I
didn't think of looking while in the front car of the train, but that's what I did, including
videoing it.  I may put it online, but it's the least interesting vid in the world, given that it
didn't locate Francois).</p>

<p>Met Will and Jesse (sp) who consider themselves brothers; they basically grew up together in
Pennslyvania.  They were basically hilarious; I was glad to get to hang out with them.</p>

<p>I developed and discarded a small crush on Will's girlfriend Naoko, which is convenient because
she has a boyfriend.</p>

<p>The party was hosted by Natalie, with tarp secured from 9am by Lyn and a couple others.  I
shoulda gotten a pic of them two alone on this huge-ass set of four tarps, whereas all the other
tarps were like 1 tarp with several peeps on them.  Funny.</p>

<p>Also good to meet Rob, a guy who's been in Tokyo for 15 years.  We have similar pasts in terms
of our choice of name, and return-home travel histories (basically non existant).</p>

<p>Great to chat with Jen and briefly with Nat.  She and I are going to have a Æó¿Í dinner sometime
soon.</p>

<p>Funniest moment was Will and I wearing our cameras on our heads (using our gorilla tripods).  He
was pretending to be Robocop for a bit, then dramatically showing his hands in the frame as he
spoke.</p>
