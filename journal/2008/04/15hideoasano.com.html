<p>Met Hideo at The Apple Store at 8pm, and his German friend Karl (sp) explained the status of the
domain transfer of <a href="http://hideoasano.com/">hideoasano.com</a> (as of this writing it's just
parked) from GoDaddy to the provider Carl (sp) set up in Germany.  The new site looks
relatively great.  Kahrl (sp) said it's old school, but validates as HTML 4.01 (or whatever is the
latest standard before 5).</p>

<p>Carle (sp) had the great idea of hanging out, but I declined in order to meet Ami.  Turns out
that Ami is still working, but I didn't go back to find Karul (sp) and Hideo; I hope they had a
nice chat.</p>
