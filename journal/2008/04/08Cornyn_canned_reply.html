Senator Cornyn

I imagine you'll never read this, as your "reply" below is obviously a canned message as it has
nothing to do with what I wrote to you.

It's too bad that our once great nation is falling to bits as people are being brainwashed to
believe we have to fight a non-existent foe called "Communim," er, "al Qaeda," oh, I mean
"terrorism."  The word may have changed over the years, but the idea is the same: we have to fight
fight fight to stay alive or they'll come destroy our peaceful way of life.

Oh, wait a second, I guess it's not very peaceful of us to obliterate country after country,
Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and those are just since I've woken up to what's going on.

STOP killing the world.  STOP supporting Bush Inc in their plan to destroy the world.  For fuck's
sake, just stop.

Do something that takes courage: speak the truth: there were no WMD in Iraq; there are no terrorist
cells in the US; there is no global terror network, unless it is the United States.  I see through
the sham and I'm helping to expose it.

   Sending you love and light, so that you may do the same
    - Rob

&gt; Dear Mr. Nugen:
&gt;  
&gt;  Thank you for contacting me about the threat that Islamic radicalism poses
&gt; to our nation.  I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this
&gt; important matter. 
&gt;  
&gt;  On September 11, 2001, our nation was the target of terrorist attacks that
&gt; sought to undermine our freedom and way of life.  Instead, these attacks
&gt; revealed a strong nation.  Since that time, America has marshaled all of its
&gt; available resources-diplomatic, law enforcement, intelligence, economic, and
&gt; military-to wage a global War on Terror.  We have had much success in
&gt; striking at the heart of terrorist organizations and state sponsors of
&gt; terrorism.  Indeed, since the September 11 attacks approximately
&gt; three-quarters of the senior al Qaeda leaders and operational managers have
&gt; been apprehended or killed, and terrorist havens in Afghanistan and Iraq
&gt; have been eliminated.  We must continue to be vigilant in fighting those who
&gt; seek to undermine our people, way of life, and our homeland. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Away from home, we have partnered with the international community to wage
&gt; this global war.  In Afghanistan, the United States and allied nations are
&gt; continuing operations against al Qaeda and Taliban elements, while helping
&gt; to rebuild a county emerging from two decades of war.  In Iraq, Iraqi,
&gt; American, and coalition forces continue to valiantly fight against those who
&gt; fear democracy.  We are striving to replace terrorism, despotism, and
&gt; oppression with freedom, and we will fight the enemies of freedom wherever
&gt; necessary.  America and her allies will not cut and run in the face of
&gt; danger.
&gt;  
&gt;  As a member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the
&gt; Senate Armed Services Committee, I am working to secure the safety of our
&gt; nation and our citizens abroad against the threat of terrorism.  You may be
&gt; certain that I will keep your views in mind as my colleagues and I consider
&gt; relevant legislation during the 110th Congress.  I appreciate having the
&gt; opportunity to represent the interests of Texans in the United States
&gt; Senate.  Thank you for taking the time to contact me.
&gt;  
&gt;  Sincerely,
&gt;  
&gt;  JOHN CORNYN
&gt;  United States Senator
