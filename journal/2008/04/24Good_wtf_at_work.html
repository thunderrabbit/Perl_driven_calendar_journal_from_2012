<p>I just got a call from my boss' boss, asking if they an wait until the end of the month to pay
me.  I'm supposed to pay Jason 12Ëü tomorrow, and 4Ëü for me-n-Ami's air tickets.  Ami can split the
4 with me, but I still asked for 16 tomorrow and he said the rest can be paid at end of month.</p>

<p>Muy interesante...</p>
