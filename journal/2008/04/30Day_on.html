<p>Work work work today, chasing the almighty dollar so I can chase the all nighty holler.</p>

<p>Today fukin' around with DB's that were written in a crap manner so I can output a CSV file.
Hmmm; actually I can change the DB structure.  I wonder how fruitful that would be.</p>

<p>And at 7pm I'm going to be in some dumb little PSP ad.  I'd rather gtf out of here so I can
volunteer at PB, cause my time with the PSP shit is volunteer.  I invited Maruan to model for it
(my work asked if I knew of any non-Japanese peeps who could do it, so I ask Maruan) and
fortunately for him, he got 10,000 yen.  I don't see that I'm getting jack shit except being
anxious to go to PB where I'd rather be.</p>

<p>A pissy part of this is the dude with whom I'm working is pissing me off by speaking to me with
his sorry ass English in an attempt to communicate with me.  My Japanese is better than his
English, so as he's like, &quot;your friend phone please,&quot; I have to sort out that he means
for me to give him Maruan's number.</p>

<p>Yes my Japanese is shite, but damn I do know some basics.  I wish I knew enough that I could do
the equivalent of repeating his question to confirm his intention.  &quot;Would you like me to give
you Maruan's phone number?&quot;  (I mean I can say that, but even moreso: &quot;Are you trying to
ask me to give you Maruan's phone number?&quot;  or some shit like that.)</p>

<p>ANY</p>

<p>WAY</p>

<p>The other pissy part: they're just using my ugly mug for the video because I'm not Japanese.
Fucking racist crap.  &quot;We're trying to show that PSP can be enjoyed by people around the
world.&quot;  Grrr.  I don't want to be used for my looks and not get paid for it.  fuckers.</p>

<p>I'm ready to get the fuck out of here, and I can only imagine this bullshit is going to run later
than 7:30.  fuck.</p>

<p>&quot;What's with all the f*** bombs, man?&quot;</p>
