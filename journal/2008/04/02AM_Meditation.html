<p>I woke up without an alarm at 6:30am or so and then proceeded to do all three of my 24-minute
reiki things right in a row.  Actually I did two, then took a shower and did the last.</p>

<p>Interesting to notice the ideas come up in my head like, &quot;oooo damn this is a great idea I
should do it right now!!!!&quot; and then reconnecting to my meditation and then yet another great
idea!!!</p>

<p>What's super more interesting: though I've seen countless times before, (in all sorts of
situtations, esp. meditation or when I &quot;should&quot; be doing homework or work work, or simply
being aware of where I am...) I've nearly finished reading a book that explains what could be causing
these huge and hugely distracting GREAT IDEAS that are really just little nothings.</p>

<p>The book, _REGRESSION: past-life therapy for here and now freedom_ by Dr Samuel Sagan (ISBN
0-9586700-0-5), uses the (ancient) term &quot;samskara&quot; for the little sources that balloon
into fantastic ideas and plans that can disrupt me for hours or years.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to catch these right after they balloon into great ideas, but *before* they catch
my brain on their runaway trains of thought.</p>
