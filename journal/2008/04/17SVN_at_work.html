<p>Aight; that worked well enough.  I needed to put our live directory into subversion, but without
versioning the session directory, and without disturbing users.</p>

<p>/home/livedata/ needs to be put into an SVN repository.</p>

<p>We'll do stuff in the /home directory, so</p>

<pre>cd /home</pre>

<p>First, copy the live data to some temporary location</p>

<pre>cp -r /home/livedata  /home/tmplivedata</pre>

<p>Now remove files / directories that should not be versioned.  In this example, it's just
session.</p>

<pre>rm -rf /home/tmplivedata/session</pre>

<p>Tell ~/.subversion to ignore the files we just removed, so when they are replaced, it will
ignore them.  (See <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html#svn-ch-7-sect-2.3.3">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html#svn-ch-7-sect-2.3.3</a></p>

<p>do the initial SVN upload</p>

<pre>svn import tmplivedata   https://svn.repository.goes.here/trunk</pre>

<p>Now check the data out to a new location.</p>

<pre>svn co https://svn.repository.goes.here/trunk  newlivedata</pre>

<p>Now this is the trick that worked well for me: rapidly moving the current session information to
the new versioned directory, and then moving *that* directory back to the live location (after
moving the live location out of the way).  Three moves, linked by semicolons:</p>

<pre>mv /home/livedata/session /home/newlivedata/session; mv /home/livedata /home/oldlivedata; mv /home/newlivedata /home/livedata</pre>
