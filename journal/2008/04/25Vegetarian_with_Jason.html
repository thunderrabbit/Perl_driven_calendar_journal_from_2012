<p>I've not played with it a lot, but I briefly scoped my new machine at Jason's house before he
took me to an Indian restaurant nearer Shinjuku station than his crib.  It was a nice restaurant;
Jason sad it won an award like best in Tokyo or some such.</p>

<p>Mostly I talked, telling him about PB (whether he wanted to hear or not (but he did have good
questions)) an finished with my shoulder break to end at the beginning of my story which talked
about money as related to my shoulder break putting me in temporary debt.</p>

<p>Jason got some extra work for the next day (proofreading), so he had to roll out early; I enjoyed
the rest of my meal (and the rest of his) in meditative silence.  Actually, not so meditative, but
mostly silent.  Thinking about where I was, enjoying the food, listening to the Pakistani guy in
white robe and red-n-white hat-thing speaking Japanese quickly.</p>

<p>The machine is basically in perfect condition considering its age.  Two batteries, original box,
original styrofoam blocks, including unopened dongles, thin styrofoam sleeve, untouched screen.
Quite beautiful.  I wonder how long it will last in my chaotic room.</p>
