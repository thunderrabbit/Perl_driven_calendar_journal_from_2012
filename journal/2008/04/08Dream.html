<p class="dream">&quot;Who wants to see a fight?  I don't want people to fight because someone
always ends up a 'loser.'  My preference,&quot;  I continued, &quot;is that people speak more
carefully to each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Yeah, but it's a waste of time if people are always nice.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I didn't say nice, I said careful.  We can still be direct without being
hurtful.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Okay, well let me be direct: <q>you, are, an, ass, hole.</q>,&quot; he said
slowly.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Good!&quot; I shouted encouragingly.  Now, is that <em>literally</em> true?
What is it about me that makes you say I'm an asshole?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;You try to control people and not let them act naturally.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;and?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;and so you're an asshole.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Hmmm.  Okay, I was almost with you on the control part; let's go back to
that.  What people do I try to control?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;You're standing there telling me I shouldn't fight, so you're trying to
control me.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Good!&quot; We were getting somewhere. &quot;You believe I'm trying to
control you, is that right?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Right, and everyone else the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Okay, we'll get to everyone else in a moment.  You said you believe I'm
trying to control you.  What did I do that makes you say that?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;You said I shouldn't fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Perfect.  Now, let's rewind the dialogue,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">We rewound it, and he was right, I had said &quot;should,&quot; but I meant to say
&quot;want.&quot; How did that happen?  I was sure I hadn't errored, but there it was.</p>
