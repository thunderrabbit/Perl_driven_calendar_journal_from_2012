<p>My volunteer modeling session was decent enough.  I semi enjoyed having all attention on me, and
no one unduly told me how well I was doing.  (*)</p>

<p>I mean, I can appreciate compliments and encouragement, but when they're unfounded, they piss me
off.</p>

<p>Anyway, I played a stupid PSP game under a table for the shot, and then look at the camera and
say かりにでようぜ！ in various manners (fast, slow, loud, whispered, etc).  Went into the studio
after the filming part and just did whisper versions of the line.</p>

<p>PS: Monster Hunter (or whatever it's called) is stupid, despite my modeling for the shot; don't
go buy it.  I &quot;had&quot; to do it for work.</p>

<p>(*) (e.g. though I've lived in Japan 5 years, and my Japanese is crap compared to where it could
be, strangers are like, &quot;oh your Japanese is so great!&quot; after I say a single word.
Though I've used chopsticks since I was 11 going to vietnamese restaurants with my parentals,
people are all like, &quot;oh, you're so good with chopsticks!&quot;  Come on, people.  Chopsticks
are not that hard to use!)</p>
