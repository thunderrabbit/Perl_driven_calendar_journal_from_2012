<p>I think I'm going to buy a different animal (other than Jacques, who will be bought by Kris) and
start another wiki and send his ass out into the wild.  I'll keep an eye out for the perfect
thing.  Perhaps a critter that is its own envelope would be cool.  Like the invertable pillows;
this would be a dragon or something that could invert into a package that could be mailed!</p>
