<p>Last night in our small meditation group (Helma, Èþ°¡, me) I kept being overcome by sleep.
Helma thought I said I *did* stay awake, and was happily like, &quot;I knew it would happen!&quot;
but I was all, <q>no, I said, <q>how do I stay awake?</q></q>  She went on for a bit about something
that I can summarize as, <q>practice makes perfect,</q> but it didn't seem inspiring at the
time.</p>

<p>Then, when we did a 30 minute or so <q>group meditation</q> I felt all but nothing, and Helma
was like, &quot;wow; that was White Eagle at the end there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?  I didn't feel shit.&quot;</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This morning, I decided to try a new technique: drive adrenaline into my brain; force myself to
stay awake.  I don't know how I do it, but it's the same kind of technique that one should probably
not use while driving a car (but should instead stop and sleep).  Good thing I don't drive a car
here in T-town (not Tomball, (nor) Texas, but Tokyo); anyway, I stayed awake.</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>Afterward, while chowing choco flakes, I realized something: only as an adult (which I mean in
the loosest sense of &quot;someone with 'responsibilities',&quot;) have I sometimes not wanted to
get out of bed in the morning.  Now, this is quite a subtle distinction here, and it may turn out
to be a buncha hooey, but basically I'm making the distinction of staying in bed for the goodness
of the bed vs staying in bed for the &quot;badness&quot; of getting up and going to work or going
to school or mowing the lawn or doing some something that I don't really want to do.</p>

<p>SO: some solutions come to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get back in touch with inner child wanting to embrace the day</p></li>

<li><p>Have something exciting to do to excite me out of bed</p></li>

<li><p>Enjoy whatever I have to do even if I don't want to do it</p></li>

<li><p>umm</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, anyway, I thought that was interesting.</p>
