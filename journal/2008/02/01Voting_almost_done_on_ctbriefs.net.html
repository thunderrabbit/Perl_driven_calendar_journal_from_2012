<p>Though it's only on the test server, I've almost got the voting aspect of ctbriefs.net done.
Well, actually I've almost got the logging of votes, but not yet the totaling of votes nor when to
declare something as spam (something like if 10 users say it's spam before 10 votes are logged, it's
spam).  If an admin or theory-writer deletes a theory, it's deleted.  If an admin clicks spam, it's
just voted as spam and not change_status to spam.</p>

<p>Actual vote votes for admins count the same as users.  That's already done.  But if an admin
clicks spam, it's instantly spam like bam!</p>

<p>Naptime for a bit.</p>

<p>Nice.  I slept diligently through 40 minutes of my vibrating phone alarm every five minutes
which I had set for 6pm.</p>
