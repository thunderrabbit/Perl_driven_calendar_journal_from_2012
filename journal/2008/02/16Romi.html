<p>Met Romi today; I had wanted to do an energy work session, but we just went to a coffee shop
with nice glass-walled balcony in Shinagawa station.</p>

<p>She gave me a book after I poohpoohed the website that advertises the book.  The site is all
dramatic &quot;this is the NEW thing!  This is it!!&quot; and I was like, &quot;whateva&quot; and
closed the window without reading further.  I trust Romi, though, so I scheduled today's session,
and I'll read the book.</p>

<p>I told her that in addition to starting to write my AUThO_Biography, I painted today, and showed
her some pics of my four E4's.  She said they seemed bright and cheery as opposed to the outer
version of me which she sees as darker.</p>

<p>As I was figuring out how far back to rewind my story to tell her, she asked if I had something
to tell her, so I explained my version of Ram Das' version of needful model of living vs living
within universal love, and how I was all &quot;serious&quot; during our Helma sessions because
otherwise I would be all hugging on Mia, Romi, and Helma.</p>

<p>She seemed to think I haven't done much spiritual growth work, which ... I thought I had, but
maybe I haven't.  I'm a bit less advanced (whatever that means) than I'd like to be (whatever that
means), but.</p>

<p>Went to a bookstore afterward and, after Romi's recommendation, I walked out with a book that
will &quot;prove&quot; the existence of multiple spacial dimensions.  I hope it does.</p>
