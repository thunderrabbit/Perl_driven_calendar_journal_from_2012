<p>Um, not so productive at work in terms of work, but I did upload two (2) new versions of the 4th
of <a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Art:Nine_F0s%2C_early_2008">9 small
canvases</a> on which I've been working.</p>

<p>I got into a bit of a hurt-feelings miscommunication with a woman I met in Jerusalem back in
2005.  I thought I noticed something in her ways with dealing with people and gave some feedback,
but I noticed wrongly.  I guess that can happen when we're working with this mere whisp of a
communication method (email vs talking while sitting facing one another with full visual/aural/etc
feedback)</p>

<p>Given that was the most emotionally difficult moment of my day, I'm quite blessed.  Most emails
bounced back and forth were lovely, including a nice surprise or two.</p>

<p>Was considering trying to install another php framework so I could add it to
my <a href="http://php.robnugen.com/">log of PHP frameworks I've installed</a>, but never quite got
that far.  Now I'm going to head home.</p>
