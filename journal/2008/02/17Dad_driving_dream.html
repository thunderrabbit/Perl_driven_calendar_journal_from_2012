<p class="dream">In a van(?) with a few of my friends as my dad was driving, I was over on the left
with my legs up in the air, sitting in a relatively dangerous manner with no seat belt.  Basically
my upper back was where my butt should be sitting and my legs were up on the seat in front of me.  I
noted that though I was naked, no one noticed and I wasn't concerned.</p>

<p class="dream">I was concerned, however, when I looked up to see an 18 wheeler cab encroaching on
our lane from the right.  I was like, &quot;dad!&quot; and he was like, &quot;what??&quot; and I
wondered if I had been wrong; my point of view didn't allow me to see the road as a reference.  I
sat up as dad slowed down, for the truck *did* turn to the left in front of us at an intersection
where dad charged the wrong way up a highway exit ramp and headed straight for another 18 wheeler
(actually a 10 wheeler dump truck) and as it had the green light Dad turned sharply to the right and
fishtailed the back of the van toward the dump truck and then and rolled in to a parking lot.</p>

<p class="dream">I realized he had just saved about 5 minutes by not going all the way around the
highway to come down the right direction to turn left into this street.</p>

<p>In an earlier segment:</p>

<p class="dream">A guy rolled his bicycle into the house, hoping to keep it safely inside.  The
house owner (head resident?) said, &quot;you can just park it at Starbucks,&quot; which meant right
outside, at the adjacent parking lot for customers of the cafe.  &quot;But that's for customers
only???&quot; &quot;I can get you a key.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I noted one of the U-locks on the ground; he must be referring to that key.</p>

<p>in an earlier segment</p>

<p class="dream">I was looking for the correct pants and shirt to attend this wedding; I had just
been outside and came back as the wedding was starting.  I ducked into the food pantry where my
stuff was kept and tried to find my black slacks in the dark.  I wasn't so successful, so I crackd
the door open a bit and could see everyone carefully ignoring the sound coming from the pantry..</p>
