<p>Finished the beta version of <a href="http://ctbriefs.net/">Conspiracy Theory Briefs</a> today.
The last step was getting the pagination to work.  Though it's not yet visible, it will be as soon
as the 11th entry is entered.  Next steps are allowing people to set the number of theories per
page and to allow admin to ban users, and oh, I need to add the code that will automatically mark
theories as spam if enough people vote them that way.  It should be easy to write that code; I just
need to decide the numbers.  Perhaps I can make it as simple as 10 spam votes = spam, but I also
want to take into consideration the number of non-spam votes.</p>

<p>something like, if the number of spam votes is at least 6 *and* more than double the number of
actual votes, then it's spam.</p>

<p>That works, so at minimum there would be only 2 Y/N votes and 6 spam votes.  I guess that would
be pretty clearly spam.</p>

<p>Plus, I'll be monitoring during the early stages, so I can tweak the numbers as appropriate.</p>
