<p>Not sure that I did much good at work.  A little bit, perhaps.  But I did watch all ten parts
of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zSc8M5N-78&feature=related">William Cooper revealing a US
alien coverup</a>.  Woah.  I wonder when that was recorded.</p>

<p>Going to meditation thing now.</p>
