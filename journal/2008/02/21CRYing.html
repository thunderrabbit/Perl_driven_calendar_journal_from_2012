<p>I thought last night I had a great solution for staying alert during meditation, but I just
couldn't drive adrenaline into my brain this morning; just pointless stupid meditation; crying
crying, why can't I do this?</p>

<p>I cried, slept, dreamt that I was approached by my taxi driver to star in a porn movie, and then
tried meditating again around 7:30.   Pointless.</p>
