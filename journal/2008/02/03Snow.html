alt="Ami and Francois and snow" align="left" /></a> It snowed for a lot of the day today.  The temp
was just around 0 to 1 degree C, so the snow was blucky mushy messy mush.  This pic was taken as
Ami and I walked to the grocery store near Hirama station to get some veggies and stuff for foodage
today.  Francois hadn't seen snow before, so he was quite excited, I'm sure.  Somehow he was able
to sit long enough for the pictures.</p>

<p>Other <a href="/images/home/tokyo/2008/sakura_house/snow_3_feb_2008/">snow pictures</a> are
available on my site, though they are nothing much to see.  Ami asked if it snows in Texas, so I
dutifully explained that Texas is way bigger than Japan, etc, and she shifted her question to ask
about Houston.  Perhaps I should be more forgiving of this type of question, but I used to get them
all the time in class.  &quot;Is Texas hot?&quot; &quot;What is Texas like?&quot; or the bane of my
career as an English teacher in Japan: &quot;ooooh cowboy!&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry; got a little sidetracked there.  So, um, yeah, so we went shopping and loaded almost
everything into my backpack, probably saving two bags for the earth.  Got a box of 6 bottles of
water instead of just one because it was easy enough to carry them home since I wasn't on TJ
Bike.</p>

<p>Was going to try to get a pic of my sliding down the bicycle ramp in the middle of the steps, but
my camera battery died.  Probably just as well cause I still don't have health insurance and such
silly antics could lead to a broken body part.  At least we would have gotten it on video for
youtube.</p>
