<p>Karen, who lives across the hall from me, seems to live by her own rules.  She locks her door
when she goes down to take a shower; she noisily checks the lock on her door when she leaves for the
day; she almost never talks to anyone in the house, though she's quite proficient in English (so she
could talk to me, Mario or Natalia), Japanese, and Portuguese (so I bet she could shift to Spanish
and talk to Natalia); she often leaves her laundry for hours (often overnight) in our house's one
washer; and I've never seen her using the kitchen except as a walkway to the shower.</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>Today, while I was enjoying watching leaves and bits of trash collide with the rocks' collection
of bits and bobs, Karen walked by on her way to work.  I said HI and she said HI, then she said Bye
and I said Bye, and that was fine and that was that.</p>

<p>I didn't expect (nor try) to catch her, but once I got to the station, the train was about to
leave, so I zipped down the steps and just happened to see her as she was getting into the same door
as me.  She said, &quot;HI Rob&quot; and stepped out of that door and went down to a different
door....  wow.  I was secretly glad because I preferred to read my book than have our first
conversation in 6(?) months (when I first moved in to the house, we talked and she showed me the
short cut to the station, plus a couple of cleaners for my shirts, etc... but after that,
nothing).</p>
