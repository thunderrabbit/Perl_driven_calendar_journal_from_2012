<p class="dream">A virtual meeting was taking place inside a large hall.  Each person connected to
the meeting was just disconnecting from the meeting in a strict order: the order by which their
physical connections were arranged along a street.  As each person disconnected from the meeting,
it caused a little spark outside as they disconnected.  I watched them all disconnecting in lawful
sequence, and then had a flash of a (guy dressed in a) skeleton (suit) walking along the street
along the sparks, making it look like he (the skeleton) was causing the sparks as he walked.
People were running away from the apparent chaos..</p>
