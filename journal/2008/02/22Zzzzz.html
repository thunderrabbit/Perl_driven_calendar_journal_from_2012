<p>Tonight is the night I came home after Nobu's byebye party (chowing in the stinky Shibuya bar
(talking to Enda, Brian, and Mark) and then moved to HobGoblin (my first time to be there; chatted
with Brian)) all stinkin' like smoke, but found clothes in the washer.  I knocked on doors up here;
they weren't Natalia's nor Mario's.  Karen's light was on, but she didn't answer.  I heaped the
clothes up onto one of my hangers and then did my laundry underneath.  Read for 45 minutes and then
slept for 20 minutes and the clothes were done.</p>

<p>Hung them up and now going to sleep.</p>
