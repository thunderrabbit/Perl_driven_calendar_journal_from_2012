<p class="date">3:02am JST Friday 22 February 2008 (day 13848)</p>

<p>Zonked out sleepin' at around 11:11pm and didn't wake up until 2am when Ami woke up all,
&quot;oops; it's 2am,&quot; and headed home.</p>

<p>I actually don't know how close to 2am it was, but I've been not sleeping for a while, and
finally got up cause I couldn't sleep.  These are some of the things that have crossed my mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My art will be shown in the bar of The Pink Cow for a month (July 2008), which, unfortunately
means it will smell like smoke at the end of that month.  If I'm correct about this, I'm sure won't
want to take any of it back into my room at that point.</p></li>

<li><p>I bought 9 little canvii today, but they are canvas on panels of wood instead of canvas on
frames, so it will be harder to hang them unless I get frames for them.   Oops.</p></li>

<li><p>I should
send <a href="http://digg.com/politics/Maverick_Republican_Drops_WC_Bomb_on_Bush_war_criminal">plans
to impeach Dick and Bush</a> to Jen (from NH) and facebook.</p></li>
</ol>
