<p>Arrived home around 9:30pm and set laundry in motion and then enjoyed a lovely romp with Ami and
then talked for a bit about the possibility of going to Italy this summer to meet Fred, who will
extend his stay there after some sort of conference involving his PhD material.  I fell asleep
during the discussion (I blame the horizontal positioning, which was Ami's suggestion), and woke up
when Ami was hanging the laundry at 2am.</p>

<p>Awwww, so sweet!</p>

<p>Moved by her boundless love, I sat up in bed and grabbed the remaining two T-shirts... and held
them up for her so she wouldn't have to bend down to pick them up.</p>

<p>Awwww, so sweet!</p>

<p>Smooches, and then she left for home.</p>
