<p>Went to Helma's for my second ISIS session.  Didn't &quot;feel&quot; anything physically, but I
definitely came across something interesting.  Apparently I disconnected from a perception I had as
a child after being unable to explain it adequately and being scolded, &quot;don't be
silly.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow.  Huge tears; gasping; crying; limitless.</p>

<p>Then back into relaxation and enjoying painting as a child. &quot;what kind of painting?&quot;
Finger painting.  &quot;do you like it?&quot;  Yeah.  &quot;Why?&quot;  Touching colors....  <em>don't
make a mess.</em>  and then crying crying crying I have to go outside and I can't paint any
more.</p>

<p>Damn.  More tears though no gasping.</p>

<p>I can climb trees outside.</p>

<p>Let's hear it for the inner child!</p>

<p>More painting, less computers.</p>

<p>The grammar mistake bugs the adult in me, but that's how it came out.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I colored while sitting here at the Indian restaurant to the tune of undulating
dancing bodies on Bollywood TV here.</p>
