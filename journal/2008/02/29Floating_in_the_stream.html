<p>This past weekend, after/during some surprisingly intense winds, the stream near my house was
filled with more leaves and rubbish than normal.  There's a particular point where three flat-topped
rocks sit in a semi-random looking triangle, plus a slight widening of the stream around them.  I
bet these were placed as a bridge across the stream, although now the stream has been embanked and
blocked with a fence so only fence climbers can get in.</p>

<p>On occasion, this triangle of rocks catches an errant stick, which catches a leaf, which
catches something else, until, like a pyramid scheme, there's a whole slew of bits and pieces stuck
behind these rocks.</p>

<p>I decided to take a picture each morning, and put them into some sort of ... something so they
can be viewed like a slideshow or a movie.  I've only got like 5 days worth so far, and after two
days of clearish waters, today was a big cloggy day.</p>
