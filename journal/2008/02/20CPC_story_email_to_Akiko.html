Hi Rob, how are you doing?  Is everything all right after the clinical
trial?

Your name came up during the lesson with Preston today.  He was amazed to
know that you hope you'll create a home with a girl and more...   He sends
his regards to you and says you can get in touch with him at his e-mail
address

Ciao!

Hey Akiko!

There is great news and not so great news regarding the clinical trial, though the not-so-great news
is not related to the trial per se...........

The great news: I had a lovely time and no effects from the drug; I am sure I was on placebo.  (6 of
36 people were on placebo).  The great news continues with me getting a stack of fifty 10,000 yen
notes at the end of the trial.

The not so great news began when I was unable to deposit the cash while in Kagoshima.  I guess I
could have found my bank somewhere in town, but Francois and I decided to join our friends on a trip
to 指宿 (can you pronounce that?)...  with 500,000 cash yen in an envelope in my pocket.

The trip was great!  We visited a hot spring heated beach and basked in the sand.

Headed back to Kagoshima by train, back to Haneda by plane, back to Hammamatsucho by monorail, back
to Shibuya by train, and got off the Yamanote Line in Shibuya, and waved buh-bye to my friend with
Francois in my hand.

Went out of the station to meet Ami.  Reached down to check my 500,000 yen.  It was there.

Hugs to Ami and went home our separate ways.

Next morning, taking a picture of souvenirs from Kagoshima, I went to put Francois next to them.

あれ？ "Where's Francois?"
