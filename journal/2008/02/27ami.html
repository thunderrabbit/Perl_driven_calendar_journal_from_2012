<p>So giggly fun with Ami tonight.  I painted upstairs while she cooked and then she called me and
I was just so happy to have her cook for me, and living so much in love, that it was just great
great great.</p>

<p>I asked her like, &quot;how can I repay you?  this hardly seems balanced...&quot; and she
pointed out some things I do for her.  I was like, &quot;but that's nothin'..&quot; and she goes,
&quot;aight, well cooking is nothin'.&quot;   awwwww.....  so happy!!!</p>

<p>Upstairs, she was like, &quot;aight; gimme a massage&quot; in a seriously joking way.  I go,
&quot;well, you didn't cook all that much tonight....&quot; even more jokingly.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;I love you I love you I love you!&quot; and thought about popping the
question, but I was like, <em>eeeek!</em> and didn't do it.  Need a better...... something.  manner
of presentation, AND a better assuredness that this is what I want!</p>

<p>After the massage, I showed her the postcard from Francois.  Ami at first was like, &quot;who
sent this???&quot; and I go, &quot;as far as I know, Francois.&quot; We hugged and after a bit I
realized she was crying.  I held her longer and was happy both that she needed to cry and that she
was able to cry.</p>
