<p>For about 25 or 30 minutes after being woken up by the sounds of ECG machines beeping to life
and nurses flittering around us in sequence, I meditated on keeping my dream in my brain.  To a
degree I was successful; normally I would remember nothing of this morning's dream (it was so
innocuous so as to make no lasting impact).</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  I took pics of the ECG (as much for Fred (who's nearly an MD in
this arena) as) for my journal here.  Heart rate 48 BPM.  Nice.</p>

<p>For some reason, when I enhanced these pics they doubled in size to 5 megabytes each.</p>
