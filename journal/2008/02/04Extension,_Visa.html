<p>I got my visa extended <em>and</em> changed from teachin' to programmin'.  Now I'm eligible for
most any computer job in the country.  Sweet.</p>

<p>On the extension thing, there was a little blank for how long I wanted to extend.</p>

<p>I jotted down three years to see what they would say.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But even more interesting than that (at least in the short term): I turned in the paperwork and
sat down to wait and shifted to meditation.  During my meditation, they blocked off the windows for
their lunch time.  I was like, &quot;hmmm; should I go for lunch as well, or
just <del>wait</del> <ins>meditate</ins>?  Decided to stay, and within a couple minutes, the guy
came out and explained:</p>

<p>&quot;Blah blah blah blah (see ya in three years)&quot;</p>

<p>word.</p>
