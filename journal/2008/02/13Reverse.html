<p>usually I have my entries in a close to ABC order as I can, so the day unfolds top to bottom as
presented in my journal.  For some reason I started with nothing today, so now Reverse.</p>

<p>Today is the night I had a revelation in the shower.  We humans are a sort of an experiment in
putting boundless souls into these bounded bodies.  The experiment has gone a bit awry, as we are
cought in the fear of dying and loss, and therefore strike out against each other to take energy
from each other in order to keep our animal-egos satiated for the time being.</p>

<p>We can choose to connect with cosmic spirit / God / angels / Love / Gaia / whatever we perceive
as highest energy goodness to see how we can help ourselves and each other out of this mess.</p>

<p>This evening, I met <a href="http://www.writerasano.blogspot.com/">Hideo Asano</a> at The Apple
Store to help get his blog tweaked.  For some reason the prices on his Buy Now buttons were all at
$20 instead of the prices he wanted: one book at $24.95 and two books at $29.95.</p>

<p>The funniest thing: he's the guy who harassed me twice for giving FREE HUGS, but he apparently
doesn't remember.  Buy his books anyway; he's a good egg.</p>

<p>Oh, and I put a bunch of pics up from my last trip with Francois.  And by last, I mean most
recent, and final.</p>

<p>There's a bit of frontal nudity in this version of the album:
