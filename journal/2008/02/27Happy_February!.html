<p><b>Happy February!</b></p>

<pre>HI everybody!

I hope this email finds everyone happy and well.  Generally speaking, I'm happy and
well in Tokyo, working on about 3 new projects since the last time I wrote a Rob
Update!

First Project, and an invitation to those who live in Tokyo: On Saturday, March
15th, I'll be hosting a screening of the movie Zeitgeist at The Pink Cow in
Shibuya.  There will actually be two screenings: 4pm and 10pm, *and* the Amazing
Pink Cow Buffet in between!  Please make your buffet reservations at
cowmail@thepinkcow.com so Traci will know how big a herd to feed!  The movie
screenings are free (and we'll have some movie DVDs to give away) so come on out
for one or both!
Directions: <a href="http://www.thepinkcow.com/">http://www.thepinkcow.com/</a>
Oh, PS if you can't come, you can watch the movie online at
<a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">http://zeitgeistmovie.com/</a>

Second Project: Painting!  I've been painting and drawing with reckless abandon,
though this time on canvases and not on walls and clothing as during childhood.  I
will have my first show in July! Though the opening party date is not yet set, it
will also be at The Pink Cow!

Third Project: meditation.  not sure if this is a project exactly, but i've started
meditating fairly consistently each morning.  also joined a group that has been
meeting weekly.

And, finally some bittersweet news.  Some of you know I haven't seen Francois for a
couple of weeks now.  Well, I just got a postcard from him last night.  I was moved
to tears!  So sad that he's moved on without me, but even more happy that he's
okay.

   I look forward to hearing what's up with you!

    Love Love
    - Rob!
