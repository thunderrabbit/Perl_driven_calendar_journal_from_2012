<p>After looking for Francois, we went shopping at ドンキー (&quot;donkey&quot;), which I believe is
short for Don Quijote.  It's basically a cramped Japanese Wal-Mart, selling tons of stuff cheap as
chips.  We bought two shirts for me, several pair of underwear (though some are too small; I might
just get some pictures of me in them for fun), ice cream (only 88 yen though I always see it for 103
yen elsewhere), some 140 gram chocolate bars for 98 yen (I had thought 105 was a great price (I can
get 90 grams of chocolate covered peanut clumps for 110 yen)), and perhaps Ami got something else,
but I don't remember.  We looked at some sexy one piece body stocking things, but she was like,
&quot;no way,&quot; when I ogled the package with her in mind.</p>

<p>Ate my ice cream as we walked to Tokyu Hands, which similarly sells tons of stuff, but
definitely not cheap as chips.  I hadn't finished my ice cream before we got to the store, so I was
standing next to some hip hoppin' speakers to finish when a store employee was like, &quot;c'mon
down&quot; as he went past me and down to flights of steps to the little shop of hoodies, jackets,
jeans, plus some hats and shoes.</p>

<p>After turning down all the jackets (I wanted a zipperless hoodie), I ended up with a new gray
hoodie with black sleeves and INDIGO THIRTY stylized logo on the front and back.  7000 yen; I woulda
bargained harder, but I appreciate that the guys are embarking on their own business venture with a
tiny little shop 2 floors below street level.</p>

<p>In Tokyu Hands, we got a frame for my laundry bag.  I've been wanting one for a while; I'm hoping
it will help keeping my room clean; strewn laundry is a big culprit.  Good thing I got it; I can't
blame things on Francois anymore.</p>

<p>Bought foodage at Freshness Burger and then went looking for a love hotel to celebrate our
relationship via physical connection.  Took a long time to find a place that would offer more than 3
hours during the day, (and inadvertantly stepped into a few places that were *not* for couples, but
for either Daily Health or something else); we finally found a place that offered 5 hours, which is
not all night like I had hoped, but would get us to basically midnight so we could go all night at
the other locations.</p>

<p>But, after a shower+bath and three romps in 5 hours, I was happy to head home.</p>

<p>We walked outside and discovered strange weather: it was raining, but there was snow on the
ground!  I wonder what coulda caused it to warm up from 6pm - 11pm while snow was falling?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We stopped by the conveni to get some foodage and I decided to get an ice cream.  88 yen.  Hmmm;
I guess the great price at ドンキー wasn't their normal price.  I bought 4 cups.</p>
