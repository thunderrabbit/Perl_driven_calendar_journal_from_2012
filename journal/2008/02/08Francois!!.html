<p>I'm in a bit of a panic; I can't find Francois.  I did a quick meditation which resulted in me
thinking <em>I dropped him</em> on the Yamanote platform in Shibuya, and that he's now in the JR
lost and found.</p>

<p>I remember quite specifically that we took pictures of him with an ad on the train, and then
when I got off the train in Shibuya, I banged him on the window as the doors closed (to say bye to
my friends) and then waved with him as the train rolled away.</p>

<p>Then I simply have no memory of what happened to my beloved Rabbit.</p>

<p>I'm <em>shocked</em>.  He &quot;should&quot; be in my pants pocket where he always rolls with
me, but he's not there.</p>

<p>I was a bit distracted on the phone as the train rolled away; I was talking to Ami.  Could I
have forgotten to put him in my pocket?  How could I have dropped my Rabbit?</p>

<p>Once I found Ami, we were immediately talking about whatever, and I never pulled him out to say
HI.</p>

<p>Before meeting Ami, I walked out the gate by RanQueen RanKing, and then turned left and went
down the stairs and outside to the Moai lookin' statue (it's fake).   Waited for Ami there, but I
don't remember checking on Francois.  I was more concerned about the 500,000 yen in my pocket.</p>

<p>I gotta take a shower now.  There's a 20% chance he's downstairs; I dumped some stuff there when
I got home and ate some pizza while reading, ironically, _Sleeper Awaken_.</p>

<p>This is not cosmically funny!</p>

ありがとう。昨日山の手せんFrancoisを持てました、でもそのあと分からない。

今仕事は忙しいので、

I talked to the lost and found guys on Toyoko Line and Yamanote Line.
They didn't have him.  I checked along the Yamanote platform, but
didn't see him.

I remember I waved bye to my friends with Francois in my hand when the
Yamanote train rolled away.  I was on the phone with you at the same
time, and my brain just lost track of Francois; I can't remember
seeing him after that.

<p>I've been thinking about Francois a lot today.  I hope to find him in my room, somehow where I
didn't look before.  Perhaps I will go to the koban near Shibuya station and see if he was turned
in.  Retrace my steps from last night.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>This has given me a business idea, but I'm not sure how viable it would be, plus the karmic part
of it smells weird.  The basic idea is to tag stuffed animals with a unique URL so they can be
tracked and returned to their owners.</p>

<p>I don't like the idea from a spiritual sense because it encourages people to be tied to physical
objects, which will necessarily go away with time.</p>
