<p>When the next train arrived, I turned around from my Spiderman dreams and met eyes with Andrew
who used to live in Millennium House with me back a couple years ago.  Down at the end of Bremen
Dori, he's living with Yuki (who used to live across the hall from me in MH), and still doing
&quot;the same old thing as before,&quot; for work, which I don't remember, but assume is teaching
English.</p>

<p>I told him about my upcoming Zeitgeist screenings (Pink Cow 15 March.  Be sure to mention the
movie when you make reservations for dinner
at <a href="mailto:cowmail@thepinkcow.com">cowmail@thepinkcow.com</a>.)  He said he might be able
to make it, and I'll be happy to see him if he does.</p>
