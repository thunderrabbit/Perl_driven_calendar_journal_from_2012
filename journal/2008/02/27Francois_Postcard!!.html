<p>I received it last night, and thought at first it must be a card from Joana, as she said she
would email me soon.  Then I noticed it was partially written in French, so I was surprised Joana
would suddenly start using French with me.  I saw &quot;Francois&quot; at the bottom, and was glad
she gave her condolences, and then I realized it was <em>from</em> Francois, and that was his
signature, and I just started to cry. and cry.</p>

<p>Went up to my room with tears starting, then bawlingly gasping crying in a lump on my bed for
probably five minutes.</p>

<p><b>So</b> sad that Francois is really gone.</p>

<p><b>So</b> happy that he is okay and traveling as he wishes.</p>

<p>But mostly so so sososo happy that he is okay.</p>

<p>gasping bawling crying crying crying: so good for soul cleansing.</p>

<p>I have the card beside me, but I'm a bit hesitant to read it again; I don't really have time to
bawlingly cry again this morning.  Oh wait, actually I do.  I leave in an hour and a half, not in
half an hour.</p>

<p>But first I gotta go peeee.</p>

<p class="date">7:39am JST</p>

<p>I read it again.  no bawling, nor even a tear.  I guess I got it all out last night.  (all for
now, at least)</p>
