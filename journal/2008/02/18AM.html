<p>I woke up around 5:30 this morning, lolled around for a bit refusing to embrace the cold.
Finally got up around 6am and meditated for about 30 minutes, and then..  fell asleep for 30
minutes.  Bah.  I didn't really want to have done that, but the irresistable pull to slumber was
irresistable!</p>

<p>I got an email from Yurika asking if we could change our lesson to Wednesday or Friday.  I
sent confirm Ami would be busy on Wednesday.  For breakfast I ate the food Ami made for my lunch, and I made a change to ctbriefs.net admin
page.  Read some of book 3 of Atlantean Secrets, got the answer from Ami and replied to Yurika and
missed my appointed time to leave.  Ah well.  Still made it to work just after 10.</p>
