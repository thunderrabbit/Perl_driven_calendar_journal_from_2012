<p>I just accidentally hit #C-xs instead of ##C-xs, and as a result I'm locked out of my screen on
robnugen.com.  Basically # is my escape character to talk to screen, and I have to hit # twice to
actually send a # character to the process.  In this case, the process is emacs editing a .php file,
and # would be the start of a comment.  More specifically, commenting *out* a line because it's
causing an error, and I'm trying to get the code to run.</p>

<p>So I intended to hit ## to comment the line, then C-xs to save the file (in this case C- means the
control key), but instead I hit #C-x which immediately locked the screen with nothing but</p>

<pre>
Screen used by Rob Nugen &lt;thunderrabbit&gt;.
Password:
</pre>

<p>And I'm like, &quot;shit,&quot; cause I don't know my password.  I only authenticate with a
passphrase and ssh keys.</p>

<p>So, I just reset the password to something ridiculous and am writing this entry as a way to pass
time while the change goes through.  (not sure why it takes more than a second, though)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh; nevermind.  I can get back in by killing the local window that's attached to that screen and
then reattach and it's cleared up.</p>
