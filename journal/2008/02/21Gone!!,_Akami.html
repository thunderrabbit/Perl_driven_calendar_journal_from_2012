<p>I just went to Lawson in Shibuya to show Akami my shirt (she said she could make me a
shirt)....  and Tsunashimasan said she doesn't work there any more!!!!!</p>

<p>Gah!!  She's been transferred to the store in Kabukicho (part of Shinjuku), which isn't all that
far away, but farther than I can make in an hour.  If I knew exactly where it was, and knew the
route (including which train doors would stop closest to the closest station exit to her store), I
could probably get there and back in one hour, but with no room to chat with Akami.</p>
