<p>I'm really glad to hear about some high
level <a href="http://www.opednews.com/maxwrite/print_friendly.php?p=opedne_dan_dewa_080220_maverick_republican_.htm">calls
to begin impeachment hearings for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney</a>.</p>

<pre>
[Vaillancourt] was fairly thundering by the time that he pronounced that not only should Bush and
Cheney be impeached, but also they should be tried as war criminals in a Nuremburg style trial for
crimes against humanity. He flatly stated that the war in Iraq has provided grounds for war crimes
charges against the President and Vice President. And there was not one word of protest from a
single committee member. They may or may not support this resolution to impeach, but there seems to
be no one left with a credible argument to defend Bush/Cheney.
