Just a little update for me:

I've joined a meditation course given by a ClairVision trainer named Helma.  I dunno if you've heard
of the organization, but it seems to be a scientific approach to understanding humans' spirituality.
<a href="http://clairvision.org/">http://clairvision.org/</a> I've started reading a Tetralogy called Atlantean Secrets.

I recently got my visa updated from working as a teacher to working as a programmer.  (the visa
statii basically say what type of work we are allowed to do.)  At the same time, my visa was
extended to Dec 2010.  Wow.  That doesn't mean I have to be here that long, but it means I can if I
want.  My work company here will put me on their insurance plan soon (right now I'm on
prayer-insurance), *and* put money into retirement plan for me.  As a foreigner, if I leave the
country, I can request that money back.

Work is a good balance between working on work stuff and working on my own stuff.  I recently made a
website <a href="http://ctbriefs.net">http://ctbriefs.net</a> for people to write and vote on conspiracy theories.  No one has logged
into the site yet (perhaps because it requires an openID, and that isn't yet mainstream, but it's
coming soon, I am sure) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=openid">http://www.google.com/search?q=openid</a>

Today I'll be flying to Kagoshima (just for a night) to do a final checkup after doing a ten day
clinical drug trial that ended last week.  (I'm pretty sure I was on placebo) The pay will be a bit
over 500,000 yen, which is basically US $5000.  With that I will be able to get out of financial
debt with my last credit card, and mostly pay off Fred and Ma for helping me with my shoulder
breakage a couple years ago.  Nice.

I hope you're well.

   Love Love
    - Rob!
