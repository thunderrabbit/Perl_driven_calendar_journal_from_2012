<p class="dream">Kevin was going to do a presentation before an assembled audience of a few hundred
people.  I asked him jokingly if I could help, and he said seriously, &quot;I would love that, but
we'd need to coordinate at least once beforehand, but there's not enough time right now, as the show
is just about to start.  One of the things we'd need to do is use the same terminology when
referring to the government offices in Houston.  While you were saying the 'neighborhoods,' I think
it's moe ccurate to say the 'administrative wards within the county.'  There are some other things
that I don't have time to go into right now, but I will be happy to next week when I see you
again.&quot;</p>
