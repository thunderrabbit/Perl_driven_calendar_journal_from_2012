<p>Lovely Valentine's evening with Ami last night.  She made gyoza!  I had thought lasagna because
I saw spied some lasagna noodles (like a kid spying Christmas presents), but those noodles are
still crispily in their packaging.</p>

<p>Not just gyoza, but Ami made soup, genmai (brown rice), and potato salad as well!  So so so
delicious and so much food!  I packed my lunch box full and safely stored it in the refrigerator for
lunch today (and forgot to bring it this morning)...  But dinner tonight is handled and Saturday as
well!</p>

<p>We hung out upstairs after discussing meanings of the phrase &quot;hang out&quot; while in the
kitchen.  First I gave her a back massage and then many silly tickling games
before <del>h</del><ins>b</ins>anging out (and in) several times before sleeeeep.</p>
