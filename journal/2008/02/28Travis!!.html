<p>Today at work I got a reply to my Happy February email... from Travis!  He's a cat I've not seen
in *years* since back in Houston at KTRU.  He's also in Japan, and has been here for years..  I
think a couple more years than I.</p>

<p>Anyway, he was like,</p>

For me, the first two weeks of every month are the busiest.
I have no plans for tomorrow night, though...  By chance you
want to meet up then?  How about dinner?  If so, your GF is
welcome too, of course!

I will be at the Pink Cow tonight, by the way, for the Vegan
Meetup monthly dinner.  I love the food at the Pink Cow! :)

<p>Wot???  *I'm* planning to go to Pink Cow when I meet Dave tonight!!!</p>

<p>So, I met Dave and we headed to Pink Cow, and sure enough Travis was there, and I gave him a hug
and got the news that they were completely booked for the vegan meal that night, so Dave and I are
at RESPEKT, some kind of coop restaurant maybe.</p>
