<p>Okay, the voting is done.  I finished it a few hours ago.</p>

The delta version (pre gamma, pre beta, pre alpha) of
<a href="http://ctbriefs.net">http://ctbriefs.net</a> is up.   (Jesse, it's different than when you saw
the epsilon version an hour ago)

The next thing to do (in anticipation of the huge onslaught of users
(more like "nonslaught")) is to limit the number of theories that are
displayed at a time.  Right now the front page displays *all* the
non-deleted theories in the system.

Once I get that done (hopefully this week), I'll call it the gamma
version and tell a few more people.

<p>Since then, I have been working on the development server to set a default date_format for users
who are not yet logged in, give feedback to the user when they log in (or when they don't), and to
allow sorting of theories.  The sorting mechanism is in place, but the UI isn't working yet.</p>

<p>Okay, now bedtime.  I just wanted to upload a picture of my stuff that I gotta pack tomorrow.</p>

<p>Wake up is at 10am.</p>
