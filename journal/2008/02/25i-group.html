<p>Good ひさしぶり I-group today.  Recently it's been me, David and Takeshi; today it was me, Kevin,
Enio and Jacob.  Due to his travels, Kevin had only been to our new location once before, so he
called me to get directions from the hotel (which we had used as a landmark before).</p>

<p>My work after the meeting: contact Jesse to see how he's able to be so outgoing.</p>

<p>Oh, and contact Traci to set a date for my art show opening party.</p>
