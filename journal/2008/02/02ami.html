<p>Great to see Ami again.  She met me at 4:15pm at Hirama station.  We came back to my house and
chatted a bit, then she cooked while I showered.  She's a bit sick (coughy) so we didn't go out for
an overnight love hotel adventure, but quickly got to know each other again and took a nap.</p>

<p>We woke up around 10pm and I heated some water to make Korean ginger tea (thanks to Reiko at EV
for telling me about it) for Ami.  She didn't really like it, but I encouraged consumption in the
name of health.</p>

<p>THEN, I worked on <a href="http://ctbriefs.net">ctbriefs</a>; we can now sort by various
columns!</p>

<p>I need to add sort to mypage.php (should be trivial), and then add LIMITS to searches.</p>
