<p>Laura got me involved with the Knighthood game on Facebook.  It's fun at this point (just
starting); I wonder how long it will keep my interest.</p>

<p>My Castle is now size 3, and being expanded to size 4.</p>

<p>But that ain't nothin' compared to

<p>Hmmm; I wonder when I'm ever going to work on that again.</p>
