<p>Ami called me at 7:58 while I was in meditation and she was walking to the station.  She got home
via taxi last night so her bicycle was at the station.  It's 9 degrees C outside, so I suggested
that she get a taxi this morning as well.  She said none were available.  What about a bus?  They
are slower than the train.  But they're faster than walkin' right?  Not really?</p>

<p>Basically I want her to be healthy and happy.</p>
