<p>Have almost finished &quot;Alone on the Alien Highway,&quot; which is the first of nine F0
canvases.  Actually started and finished #3 of nine.  It's called &quot;Party.&quot;</p>

<p>I've been taking pictures of the progress.  Started #4, but haven't decided where to go with
it.  #2 is progressing, though I don't have a name chosen for it.  I've considered
&quot;Aligns,&quot; and &quot;Four Easy Mazes&quot;</p>
