<p>Damn.</p>

<p>I just found out that while trying to figure out wtf was happening with the live server (why was
it timing out???), I sent up to 22,000 emails (one for each of our users) <em>each of FOUR times I
tested</em>, with subject and body</p>

<pre>
SUBJECT: live monkey

live monkey
</pre>

<p>Gah.</p>

<p>The good news is, I know *exactly* how it happened, and I likely won't do it again.</p>

<p>The bad news: we still won't have any checks in place to make sure a different human error
doesn't make a similarly daft mistake.</p>

<p>But, I just wanted to declare my mistake for the benefit of sending a few giggles to people who
read this.</p>
