<p>Well, I was going to start with Prado, but three of the four &quot;show off your example Prado
websites&quot; that I checked were in various states of broken.  Nevermind, Prado; good luck with
all that brokenness.</p>

<p>Hmmm: here's an interesting
idea: <a href="http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/38-The-no-framework-PHP-MVC-framework.html">no-framework
PHP MVC framework</a>.  I like what he's saying about not going through a central command
structure; I've got ctbriefs set up with individual files for home, admin, write, mypage...  I'm
going to go through his toot.</p>

<p>Hmmmm. <a href="http://php.net/pdo">PDO</a> sounds neat; I wonder if it's what I think.  I
<del>wonder if</del> <ins>confirmed that</ins> it's available on the ctbriefs server.</p>

<p>I've gotten pretty sidetracked and not very far along here.</p>
