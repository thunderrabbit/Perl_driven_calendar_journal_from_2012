<p>And now I'm going to take notes while I install some PHP frameworks to see if I find one I
like.</p>

<p>PS: despite my grand plan and <a href="http://php.robnugen.com/">php.robnugen.com</a>, there is
almost no chance that I'm going to install more than a couple frameworks.  Many people have
compared frameworks before.  The only thing that begins to distinguish my installations: I'm going
make sure the date and version are prominently indicated.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://php.robnugen.com/cake_2008feb22,_1.1.19.6305/">Cake, version
1.1.19.6305</a>.</p>

<p>Summary: 52 minutes to get up and running.  Once I'm up and running, I have nothing to show for
it. Docs are available, but not unless I look for them.  Also, there were some links to
documentation on the front page, but the page vanishes if I create the very file the suggest to
create.  Not sure how to get it back unless I rm / mv the file they said I should create.</p>
</li>

<li><p><a href="http://php.robnugen.com/symfony_2008feb22,_sandbox/">Symfony, sandbox (can't find a version number)</a></p>

<p>Summary: 66 minutes to get just the front page up, but no customizations; I couldn't figure out
where to go next; I got errors when I tried to run the command line.  Dead in the water.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://php.robnugen.com/zend_2008feb22,_1.0.3/">Zend, version 1.0.3</a></p>

<p>Summary: 11 minutes to find the archive is nearly 4Gigs, which means it's fully featured, but I
couldn't figure out how to get anything to work.  Not even a front page.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://php.robnugen.com/akelos_2008feb22,_0.8/">akelos, version 0.8</a></p>

<p>Summary: 27 minutes to find I actually liked this one; it gave me a wizard to enter the DB
information in an easy step-by-step manner.  I like the setup: they have space for 3 DBs:
production, development, and test.  The test DB is copied from development via a simple command.
However, I chunked it cause the code gives tons of warnings when run with PHP version 5; it's using
some deprecated code styles (run-time call by reference).  Oh, and cause I couldn't get past the DB
setup, despite ignoring the warnings.</p>

<p>May want to try this again once they get to version 1+ and work with PHP 5.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://php.robnugen.com/kohana_2008feb22,_v2.1.1/">Kohana, version 2.1.1</a></p>

<p>Summary: 10 minutes to get something up-n-running, including having selected options on their
download page as to which modules I want included.  Kohana is based on Codeigniter, and has a
similar (identical?) directory structure.  I liked the small size of Kohana, but I didn't see how to
get started once I got the hello world screen up.</p></li>
