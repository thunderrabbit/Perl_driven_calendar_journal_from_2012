<p>Not sure how much I'll be able to write before lunch ends here at work.</p>

<p>I'm reading
some <a href="http://www.clairvision.org/ckb/ckbe/ckbl/fol_0000_0001/cat_0000_0001/tid_2003_0000_0102.html">definitions
in ClairVision</a>, and at first it began to smell like a religion, but now I can see that it's like spiritual
science, and beginning to encroach on a lot of the things I had already determined 'must be true'
about &quot;reality.&quot;</p>

<p>So, I sorta wanna capture my personal spiritual beliefs before I'm swayed much by this system.</p>

<p>Oh, and it's a new month, so this is a perfect time for a state of my life address.</p>

<p>I'm going to change this entry name from Before ClairVision to Before ClairVision soml</p>

<p>Okay, I think it will now show up in SOML type entries.</p>

<h1>State of my (Spiritual) Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I discount Christianity and religions with teachings from an old book because if God is real,
then God can talk to me right now, and doesn't need a book.  I just need to tune in to God
directly.</p></li>

<li><p>I ignore any religion that says I must &quot;bow down before God&quot; or whatever because
&quot;God is so much better,&quot; etc.  I anti-believe the concept that God wants me to believe I'm
a sinner and kiss God's ass for God to accept me into Heaven.  To that, I say,
&quot;whateva.&quot;</p>

<p>BECAUSE, if God is God, then God doesn't need to be praised.  God has no ego to be stroked.
Equating God to an old guy in the clouds who is watching earth with infinite knowledge and jotting
down everything we do wrong is just silly.</p></li>

<li><p>God, being &quot;-<em>infinitely</em>-&quot; grander than we can possibly conceive, leaves a
lot of room &quot;between&quot; us and God.  By that, I mean what's been quoted as something like,
&quot;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,&quot; (and by that
token, &quot;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a Miracle&quot;) implies
that any sufficiently advanced civilization could masquerade as gods, and we humans wouldn't know
the difference.</p>

<p>Therefore, why should I think that the &quot;miracles&quot; of 2000 - 3000 years ago were
anything but aliens teasing / taunting us?  There are humans who can go into states
of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=yogi+no.pulse+no.breath">no pulse and no breath</a>
for extended periods of time.  Why not for three days chillin' in a tomb?</p></li>

<li><p>With a quietening of my mind/brain, I can reach states of consciousness that I equate to
being able to communicate with my angels.  For example, I ask questions (basically simply formulate
questions) and have the answers immediately.  The voice of my angels is one of utter patience,
utter love, utter wisdom.</p>

<p>I don't know that it's really an angel or my angel, but the resulting information has always led
me away from dangers and toward goodness.</p></li>

<li><p>Once I asked how long I would be alive in this body, and I got the answer of multiple
hundreds of years.  Hmmm.</p></li>

<li><p>Good and Bad are relative terms.</p></li>

<li><p>We humans are running around on earth, basically trying not to die and trying to figure out
what's going on.</p>

<p>Here are some things that I've thought were going on:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Around high school, I realized that emotions must be important.  They stick with me until I
experience them.  Even if I don't remember <em>what</em> caused the emotion, I can experience the
emotion years and years later with perfect clarity.  After that experience, the emotion is
(partially) released (until I experience the whole emotion).</p></li>

<li><p>Later, I came across the concept that we are bits of God inhabiting these monkey bodies,
pretending that we are not part of God <em>so that</em> we can have the experience of fear,
aloneness, worry, etc.  God can't experience fear because God is pure love.  But God may wonder,
&quot;hmmm; I wonder what I am, but I can't know if I don't know what it's like to be what I'm
not.&quot; and here we are, little experiential agents of God, taking notes for God to collect when
we're done.</p></li>

<li><p>I anti-believe in the concept of sin.  But I do believe in a concept of karma.  I think that
if we kick/scream/fight/kill our way through life, we tie ourselves to each other.  If I maliciously
kill you, I attach part of myself to you and have to find you later to apologize.  I think this
happens automatically in the etheric/astral realms, without intervention from God, who loves us no
matter what we do.</p>

<p>Along these lines, I came up with a theory: love is slippery / releasing, and fear is sticky / capturing.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Space is far too big for just the inhabitants of earth.  There's got to be myriad other
civilizations, at all levels of maturity and in all variety of forms.</p></li>

<li><p>Because of karma, civilizations not on earth ought not get involved with our evolution.</p>

<p>But certainly there are civilizations that don't care about karma, and why not civilizations
that are unaffected by karma?</p></li>

<li><p>I've heard that Buddha reached a moment in meditation where he became aware of 99,000
lifetimes, and they were but a fraction of the whole.</p>

<p>I think I heard Ram Das (sp) say that we live enough lifetimes that if a bird holding a silk
scarf were to fly past a mountain once for each lifetime, the abrasive action of the silk would wear
the mountain down by the time we are done.  (sumpin' like dat)</p></li>

<li><p>Quite recently, I heard that &quot;life on earth is addictive,&quot; which tends to have
souls get stuck here time after time, trying to get things right.</p>

<p>It's an interesting idea, but I don't have any &quot;proof,&quot; except, of course, that I have
a huge sense that I'm going to achieve spiritual perfection <em>this</em> lifetime.  (hahaha. (no,
really.))</p></li>

<li><p>I've read some alien conspiracy theories that aliens faked all the bible stuff to make us
feel inferior to God and &quot;behave&quot; (in a way that makes us fight over resources (which
would be infinite if used wisely) and produce negative (emotional) energy which the aliens collect
(for food or currency))</p>

<p>Not sure I believe that <em>per se</em>, but it can explain a lot of what I see around me.</p></li></ol></li>

<li><p>I have had the experience of consciously existing outside of my body (all except
for my head) so I therefore believe I am more than this physical body.  For this reason I don't fear
death (though perhaps not looking forward to the pain if I have a painful experience leading to
death).</p>

<p>(also because of the multiple hundreds of years of life thing mentioned above.)</p></li>

<li><p>I broke my head in 1995 or so.  Rebecca told me that while I was unconscious, my angels told
me what I should be doing this lifetime, and though I don't consciously remember it, when I'm ready,
I can go into meditation and ask them to tell me again.</p>

<p>Because I didn't die from that head breaking moment (the doctors said I probably would die, (and
then over a period of 4 days changed their prognosis from death to coma, then brain damage, then
inability to walk, then nevermind)) I surmised that I must be here to do something.</p>

<p>Within a year (?) of that injury, I met Diane who said on  that coming Friday she was hosting a palm
reading party.  At the time she told me, I knew I would be at the party, though we didn't say
anything at the time.  That Thursday she called me saying there had been a cancellation and invited
me to join (at no charge).  The palm reader (Richard Unger) told people &quot;you're here to be a
good parent,&quot; &quot;you're here to be a psychologist,&quot; &quot;you're here to learn how to
control perception of other people's emotions,&quot;.. and then to me he said, &quot;your job is
to build something for the world.&quot;</p>

<p>I started to cry, because I knew he was going to say something big, but not quite that big.
;-)</p></li>

<li><p>I did the Gateway Voyage at Monroe Institute in March 1996.  I expected I would be a pro,
floating outside of my body, chillin' with other spirits, etc.  I had nothing like that as a
conscious experience (though at one point I did cry over the plight of a under appreciated grain of
sand in the sidewalk).</p>

<p>I got back home and told Char (who would always watch my crown chakra as we talked).  I told her
what had happened, and she read my crown chakra saying, &quot;oh you will be able to astral travel;
in fact, that will just be the beginning.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Recently, I told the above stories to Helma in terms of my driving desire to be
&quot;perfect.&quot; She agreed that I was taking on a great deal of pressure by locking on to those
stories, and so, though at one level I want her to continue feeding my ego, she added nothing to
these predictions.</p></li>
