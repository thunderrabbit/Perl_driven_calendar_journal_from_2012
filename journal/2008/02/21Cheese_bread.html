<p>Went downstairs for breakfast of bread with cheese (real bread, fairly real cheese) and Mario
(from Austria) came down (from Juergen's old room); he was like, <q>omg where did you get that
bread??</q> and I went upstairs and got the bag, which I gave him.</p>

<p>My three slices of bread were in the toaster at the time; I woulda given him one, but they
weren't ready yet.</p>

<p>Then he was like, &quot;are you in a hurry or can I use the shower?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;no, no problem; use it.&quot;</p>

<p>When he came back down, the toasted melty delicious bread was waiting.</p>

<p>&quot;Rob?&quot; he crept slowly into the kitchen.</p>

<p>&quot;This is Sachiko...&quot; he was carrying his um, friend on piggyback!  hahahahahahaha</p>

<p>I think she was embarrassed to be seen, but I'm quite happy to see her here; for a long time, Ami
has been the only visitor this house has had.</p>

<p>A bit later, Natalia (from Spain) came down and she jumped a bit when she saw me in the kitchen.
She was funny, &quot;Wow, I didn't expect to see you, like the daddy of the house, you are should
be still sleeping...&quot;</p>

<p>hahha; I told her about my recent sleep schedule: asleep at midnight the past two nights; awake
at 6:30am yesterday; 5:30am today.  Didn't tell her about the crying, though.</p>
