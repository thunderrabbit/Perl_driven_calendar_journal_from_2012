<p>Last night meditation workshop thing with Helma, Romi, Mia began a bit late due to me being 2
minutes late.  I was feeling depressed/sad after having watched William Cooper's thing about the
USG all in cahoots with aliens.</p>

<p>My first pairing was with Helma, and then twice with Mia.  With Helma, I briefly saw a cat/fox
image in her face.  Mia correctly (and without prompting) identified pain in my left shoulder,
which was interesting (not the pain so much as the identification).</p>

<p>Afterward, Helma</p>
