<p>Good day overall, though.  I sent $3500 back to the US; I paid my rent through May; I hilariously
used white ink (paint) to circle Will Attend on Maruan and Kyoko's wedding invitation RSVP; I got
some good shizzle done at work; I tweaked the admin page
for <a href="http://ctbriefs.net">ctbriefs.net</a>; I added a
new <a href="http://ctbriefs.net">Conspiracy Theory</a> to ctbriefs.net (regarding Diana); ummmm, oh
and I've been reading the second book in the Atlantean Secrets Tetralogy.  The series is *awesome*.
I'm speaking from experience of only the first book and 50 pages of the second, but I'm totally
loving the stories.</p>

<p>And, I'm leaving well on time to make it to Otsuka well on time.</p>
