The main guy arrived and walked onto the rugby field as the crowd looked on with
great anticipation.  This began a new era, in which the nfinal season would be determined by fate.
He waved his arms in a way that meant nothing to me, but the rugby announcer said, &quot;this means
the seasons final wil last six weeks from here on out, and depending on numerous factors, those six
weeks may include just two games, or as many as 20, which would be a repeat of the main
season.&quot;

The crowd went bonkers; some happ

drunk with excitement ad some drunk with outrage at this decision.  But then the final question was
answered: the sason would start tomorrow.

As thousands in the crowd shifted from their previous state to unsupportive of such a decision, for
it would mean theeir faavorite games would not occur, there was a hush among the crowd: would the
players simply refuse to play?

Despite the weight of the crowd, a few plyers began to move out of the crowd and into the field
proper.  From three large groups of people they came,  and when the third goroup began to take
longer than expected, I went down to check on them, but it turned out they were late just because
they had had a longer way to walk.

As they came aound the corner and walked past me, I greeted them &quot;hello boys; glad you could
join.&quot;

They, too were glad; they would be making history.  I wodered how well I would be able to help
them; I was to be the coach.  Or perhaps just their spiritual coach or cheer leader..  They had an
actual playin g coach who would teach technique, and I would teach connection and spirit and such.

The time for the first game was already upon us, so we went into the stadium and tossed our 3D
numbers into the corner which was actually the endzone, marked wit chalk.
