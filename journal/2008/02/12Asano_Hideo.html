<p class="date">1:08am JST Tuesday 12 February 2008 (day 13838)</p>

<p>After I-group, I went to McDonald's, where I was approached by a man to whom it took me a bit to
warm up, but in the end I bought a book he self published.  He's
<a href="http://www.writerasano.blogspot.com/">Asano Hideo</a>, traveler, journalist, author.
Apparently he overstayed his visa in the US and lost his home/car/life when he got kicked out.  At
least that's my short and butchered version of the lowlight of his biography.</p>

<p>To promote his work, I'll put it at the top of tomorrow instead the bottom of today.</p>
