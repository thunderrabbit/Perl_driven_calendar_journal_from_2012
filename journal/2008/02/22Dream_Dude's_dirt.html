<p class="dream">At Dude's house, which was a bit like a cabin in the woods, I came in without
aksing and opened up some kind of old musty pillow that had been discarded so long that its contents
had turned to soil.  I put the soil in some sort of container and was just about finished when I
heard Dude coming home.  I was like, &quot;oops!&quot; hoping he wouldn't mind that I had just
walked in, but happy to see my friend again after so long without.</p>
