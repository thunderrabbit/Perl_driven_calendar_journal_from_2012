<p>many many dreams, but the most personal:</p>

<p class="dream">I got Francois back!  Wende had found him and returned him.  He had fallen into a
flooded gutter and was floating downstream as she found him and brought him back to my mom's house.
I remembered I had emailed her last night, which was *after* she found Francois, but before I knew
about it, so I wondered if I should email her again, but it turned out I was able to go thank her
personally, and the first thing she did was wipe her dirty hands on my shirt and say, &quot;take
back the pain you gave me,&quot; and I was all too happy to do that, just so I could talk to her
again.</p>

<p class="dream">She was living in a large house with three relatively grown children (oldest was
age 12, and youngest was 7) and after he got home from work, I was able to meet her husband Peter.
He shook my hand and went on about his wind down from work as I chatted with Wende.  It seemed she
was happy to chat with me after getting the dirt off her hands.</p>

<p>I didn't see Peter nor Tinkerbell, however.</p>

<p>Not as personal dream:</p>

<p class="dream">Watching a brand name monster truck on its last hydroplane run along the beach.  It
was completely skimming on top of the water, but unable to steer; it had fans blowing air down to
keep it aloft, but not in an easily controlled manner: all the thrust was pointing straight down,
except for a little bit which was pointing back in order to move the truck forward.</p>

<p class="dream">At the end of the run, I was given the option to own / direct the marketing of
this particular model of truck.  The personified truck gave an announcement on TV saying it will
decide in one minute if it would continue or not, and then I realized the desicion relied on my
answer!  I had zero interest in doing this type of project so I had decided to say NO and woke up
at that point.</p>
