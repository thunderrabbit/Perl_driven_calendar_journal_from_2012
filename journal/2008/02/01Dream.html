<p class="dream">With Laura (Guennie) and trying to remember the door code to get into her house.  I
had heard it once years and years before, and remembered it as 693-3, but then I carefully overheard
her telling a friend and it was significantly more complex like 64693-52 or something.</p>

<p class="lucid">I recognized that I was dreaming and tried hard to lock the numbers into my brain,
knowing that symbols like that tend to flitter away (as they seem to have done)</p>

<p class="dream">A sense of traveling somewhere, but I've waited too long to type.</p>
