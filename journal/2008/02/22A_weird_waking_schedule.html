<p class="date">11:06am JST Friday 22 February 2008 (day 13848)</p>

<p>This morning I was awake from like 2:30am to 4:30 or 5am (5:30?) (which included a shower, and
eating three (3) bowls of cereal while reading the first 20 pages of the Fourth (4th) volume in
Atlantean Secrets), and then slept again until an alarm at 8:30.</p>

<p>During that sleep, I dreamt (*), and then woke up and did a waking version of the same thing:
went outside to collect some dirt and then made a bit of a mess in the trough-sink to transplant my
little plant!</p>

<p>Now I'm at work.</p>
