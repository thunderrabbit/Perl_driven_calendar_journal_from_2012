<p>There was a party after work today, I guess celebrating the arrival of three new faces with a
feast of raw oysters and, separately (thank gods), several semi cold and dry pizzas.</p>

<p>I chowed on pizzas after gagging down an oyster (and Ami's; she's disgusted by them as well).</p>

<p>We stayed for a lawfully decent amount of time while people shucked and slurped oysters, beer
and wine, but basically headed home as soon as fashionably early arrived.</p>

<p>As planned, though unnoticed by me until too late, in Musashi Kosugi our train stopped and kicked
everyone out.  I said bye to Ami who went to Nambu line to get her bicycle and rendezvous at my
apartment.  Looked down at Nambu line platform and wondered if I could conceivably climb down from
my line to Nambu line and surprise Ami on the platform.  Although such an adventure would be against
several rules, both explicit and implied by social custom, not to mention a bit dangerous, it would
feel great to finally do, *and* have the added bonus of pleasantly surprising Ami into delightful
laughter.</p>
