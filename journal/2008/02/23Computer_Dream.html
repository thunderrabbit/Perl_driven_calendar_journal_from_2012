<p class="dream">At work, writing something for personal use (while I should be working), someone
kept asking me if my mouse was making weird RF interference when I moved it.  I was basically not
using my mouse at all, so I unhooked it and assured him, &quot;no; it's not producing any RF
interference.&quot; I continued to work for a bit, and then I realized when I unhooked the mouse, my
electrical input changed from the square magnetic type to a round type, so my charger could no
longer plug in.</p>

<p class="dream">Hmmmm, so I was going to shut my computer down before it died from low battery, but
I had to eject a disk first, but it was still booting some sort of Japanese study material game.  It
first went through a startup screen, like &quot;can you hear this?&quot; but it was all spelled out
phoetically so the computer could read it properly, though very slowly: &quot;kan U here
theis?&quot; or something.  I clicked the &quot;too slow!&quot; button and it fixed it.  Then it was
like, &quot;okay, I'll say a word and you type it in Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">First word, &quot;degenerative&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;what???&quot; cause I had less than no idea how to say that in
Japanese; I could barely explain it in English.  I knew it was a lost cause, so I ejected the
disc.  I was surprised to see it was a nin broken disc, but then realized it was just a sticker.
But even more strange: the CD had holes burned through it in four corners, including some of the
places where code was written!   I aksed why, and he said he had had to use rubberbands to hold the
sticker down while the glue dried, and without the holes, they kept slipping off.</p>

<p class="dream">I couldn't really figure out how the holes had helped; topologically, it would have
been hard to get the rubberbands to go through the holes *and* across the face of the sticker.</p>
