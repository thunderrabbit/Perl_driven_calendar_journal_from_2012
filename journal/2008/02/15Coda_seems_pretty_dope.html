<p>I'm not likely to replace emacs (gotta have the date and day counter), but I'm pretty much ready
to replace <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/faq.html">SEE</a> and nearly replace
<a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">CyberDuck</a> (though CyberDuck still has its place in doing big
transfers)</p>

<p>Coda crushes Cyberduck for re-establishing connection.  At least on the version of CyberDuck
that I have (2.8, while they are at 2.8.4 or something).</p>

<p>A big thing that Coda needs to make me supa happy is ability to use public keys to connect to my
site.  I don't use username / password.  Just public key.  I don't even <em>know</em> my password
(it's like 30+ characters of madness).</p>
