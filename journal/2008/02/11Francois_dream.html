<p class="dream">With my dad and Fred in Austin, stopping by UNcommon Objects to see janette (who I
had seen walking into the store); she saw me as well and turned back around, happy and surprised to
see me.  I was going to tell her I had lost Francois, but then I pulled Francois out of my pocket
and was so happy to have him back!  I realized it was a dream, so I spent some time just peering at
his fuzzy bluegreen fur, enjoying the moment.  I woke up before I could tell everything to
janette.</p>
