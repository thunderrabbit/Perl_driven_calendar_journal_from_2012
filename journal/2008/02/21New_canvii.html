<p>Busted out of work at like 6:45 and met Ami at 7pm on Yamanote platform in Shibuya.  Funny thing:
as I arrived at 6:55pm, she was already there, reading her book.  I snuck carefully by to the very
end of the platform (246 side, so the end of the train as headed toward Harajuku) so she couldn't
see me.  Then, when the next train came (happened to be right at 7), I noted she checked her watch
and prolly wondered why I was all but late, I joined the crowd coming off the train and was
all, <q>HI!</q> to her as if I had just come off the train.</p>

<p>She was like, &quot;what???  where were you??&quot;</p>

<p>I told her the truth, and then lied that I had been in Shinagawa - no, Hammamatsucho - no,
Kagoshima.  Funny.</p>

<p>We went to Shinjuku and got several things at Seikaido: a 10% cash back card for 500 yen, 10
little canvases, and even thinner markers than the ones I used to draw &quot;dr cutie&quot;</p>
