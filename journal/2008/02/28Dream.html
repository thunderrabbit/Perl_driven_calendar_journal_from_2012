<p class="dream">Going to a party type thing with Audrey, and she handed me my boarding pass for
the 69th PB voyage!  I was like Woohoooooo!!!  and super hugging her and stuff.  Later whe i looked
down at it, the pass was blank, and I realized it was a dream.  I tried various things to get it to
come back, but no luck.</p>

<p>later:</p>

<p class="dream">Climbing arund in a hotel, up and down elevators and eecalators,  while being
pursued (in a bad way) by a team of women, led by one power hungry woman from some movie production
company.  I had to climb through less and less well known staircases, and sneak around rooms that
were forgotten, including tip toeing over where a guy was mopping; he didn't want to let me through
but I told hi I could se the water streaks so I would be sure not tostep in the water.   I tip toed
over somme obstacles and got to the doror and heardthe bad girl behind it talkeing some strategy,
so I locked the door quietly and snuck to another stairwell where a woman was posted, but she
didn't do anyting cause I was going *down* the stairs, and then I jumed out to the main area and
then to the main levator, but then again didn't get stopped as I was jumping *down* the outer wall,
and then around the back of the elevator (hey 've been here in other dreams) and then saw a guy
with a motorcycle going into the eelevator, so I figured I could go up with him and it would be
unusual enough that he wuldn't be stopped as they wouldn't have been told what to do in case of
motorcycles in the elevators.</p>
