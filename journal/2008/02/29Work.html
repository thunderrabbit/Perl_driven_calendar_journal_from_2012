<p>Today at work I 

<ol>
<li><p>emailed Travis and scheduled a hang out on Monday and another on the 13th.</p></li>

<li><p>emailed Dave and thanked him for meeting last night and good wishes for getting his Yahoo!
Small Business site upgraded with a shopping cart.</p></li>

<li><p>installed two shopping carts on my server to see how they work/look.. basically wanna put
them on Dave's site if we can.</p></li>

<li><p>chatted with Fred a bit while I signed up for Google Site, which turns out to only work on
their server, .. so it *works*, but ain't as cool as having their stuff work on my domain.</p></li>

<li><p>chatted with Calder about getting other people to start knock knock jokes</p></li>

<li><p>enjoyed setting up some dominoes on
the <a href="http://www.enigmasand.com/games/nphys/">physics toy</a> that she found earlier this
week or so</p></li>

<li><p>helped 丸山さん carry a box of raw oysters after まりえ took a picture of them with her
cellphone camera.</p></li>

<li><p>am now going to work on ctbriefs.</p></li>
