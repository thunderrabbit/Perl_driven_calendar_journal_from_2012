<p>I've got the sort worked out... I think I may have mentioned that last night.  Today I got the
core of the pagination worked out.  I know how many records are in the original query, discounting
the LIMIT clause.</p>

<p>For the sake of free software, here is code for using mysqli to get number of rows with limit:
(this code is snipped out of the middle of a method in my object, so it will require some changes
around the $this-&gt; parts.)</p>

<pre>
		$query = "SELECT <b>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</b> * FROM theories as t left join users as u using(uid) " .
			{$where_clause} . 
			"LIMIT " . $min .  ", " . $per_page;

		if($statement = $this->mysqli->prepare($query))
		{
		
			$statement->bind_param(&quot;dd&quot;, $var, $var2);
			$statement->execute();
			$statement->bind_result(&lt;snip&gt;);
			while ($statement->fetch())
			{
			    stuff;
			}
			$statement->close();

<b>
			$statement=$this->mysqli->prepare("Select FOUND_ROWS()");
			$statement->execute();
			$statement->bind_result($num_records);
			$statement->fetch();
</b>		
			$num_pages = ceil($num_records / $_SESSION['theories_per_page']);
			
			print_rob($num_records, "num records");
			print_rob($num_pages, "num pages");
		}
</pre>

<p>Ah, cool.  Now I know how to send the user's choice to the program.  Now I just need to get the
current DB query to feed back to the UI which page of how many they are on.</p>
