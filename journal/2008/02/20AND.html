<p>Afterward, while chowing choco flakes, I realized something: only as an adult (which I mean in
the loosest sense of &quot;someone with 'responsibilities',&quot;) have I sometimes not wanted to
get out of bed in the morning.  Now, this is quite a subtle distinction here, and it may turn out
to be a buncha hooey, but basically I'm making the distinction of staying in bed for the goodness
of the bed vs staying in bed for the &quot;badness&quot; of getting up and going to work or going
to school or mowing the lawn or doing some something that I don't really want to do.</p>

<p>SO: some solutions come to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get back in touch with inner child wanting to embrace the day</p></li>

<li><p>Have something exciting to do to excite me out of bed</p></li>

<li><p>Enjoy whatever I have to do even if I don't want to do it</p></li>

<li><p>umm</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, anyway, I thought that was interesting.</p>
