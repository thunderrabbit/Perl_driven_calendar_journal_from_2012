<p>Chatted with Colleen for a bit tonight.  Two main points:</p>

<p>(one) <em>Carnaval</em> starts today and goes through Tuesday (I thought it was longer, but maybe
that's just in Brazil (she's in Portugal)); Colleen &quot;got a long blue wig and a pimp hat and
will be Chris' pimp tonight because he found a "well endowed nurse" costume and also a wizard
hat. so he's a "well endowed wizard nurse"&quot;</p>

<p>(two) We've known each other for 11 years!!</p>
