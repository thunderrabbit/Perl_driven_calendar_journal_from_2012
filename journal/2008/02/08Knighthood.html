<p>I had just logged in as Francois and accepted my invitation to play Knighthood.  Invited some
random people (friends of Francois whom I've never met??) so Francois would have some vassals with
which to produce gold in his marketplace.  I think I'll just keep him producing gold for the good
of my kingdom.</p>
