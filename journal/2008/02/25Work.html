<p>I got stuff done today!  In fact, I finished in one day what ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó thought would take me more
than a day.  Word.</p>

<p>Basically I just copied a bunch of code and changed some names, but it wasn't just a pure copy;
I had to insert some other copied code, but it all works together nicely.</p>

<p>And I even fixed a bit of a reporting bug in some old code and moved that online.</p>

<p>And all the while, I kept listening to <a href="http://remix.nin.com/">remix.nin.com</a>.  It was
funny: at one point everyone suddenly looked at me.  I was jammin' in my headphones, so I was a bit
surprised.  I took my headphones off like, &quot;what?&quot; and heard Ami's ring coming loudly from
my phone in my shirt pocket.  It was leaning away from my body so I didn't feel it.</p>

<p>haha oops; sorry!</p>
