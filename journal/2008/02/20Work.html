<p>Work has included nice chats with Colleen, Gene, Ryan, and Dude.  Also a little email volley with
kT.  I &quot;finished&quot; my F0 size canvas, figured out how to use Gimp well enough to white out
the canvas, and put it on a maternity T shirt for sale at cafepress.</p>

<p>Work has not included anything that could really be considered &quot;work&quot;</p>
