<p>Ami and I just finished a few hours of shoppin in Kawasaki.  Got a white shirt for Maruan and
Kyoko's wedding, new pants for me (snow pants like the ones I wear all the time (which Hitomi bought
for me) (one pair of which had pockets so small that I paid the same price again to have the pockets
enlarged), and ice cream after not being able to contact the Segway place in Ebisu.</p>

<p>I thought it would be cool to roll around so I was trying to get directions to their office
without telling Ami what Segways are.  We finally determined that it was probably an office
building more than an outlet, so they'd be closed today (a holiday in Japan).</p>

<p>When I was coming to grips with my genius idea being thwarted, Ami was like, &quot;you wanna get
some ice cream??&quot;  Awww yeah.</p>

<p>Oh, we also looked at oven/microwave combo things, and found a range of prices from $250 to
$1000.  The one we liked features a pizza stone, which would be nice.</p>

<p>The oven was priced at $1000 so it better be nice.</p>

<p>AND, we looked for <a href="http://eye.fi/">eye-fi</a>, but they are not yet being sold in
Japan.  Gah.</p>
