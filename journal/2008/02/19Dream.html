<p class="dream">On vacation with Ami, sitting nakedly on the floor and gazing out the window of our
cabin on the beach, two flight attendants walked by and glanced inside.  One stuck her tongue out
flirtatiously and then they reappeared at the door on the adjacent wall.  They came inside and
chatted a bit, asking me where I'm from and then asking specifics about Texas, and specifically
about &quot;hispanics,&quot; which had me a bit confused; I was like, &quot;that's a term generally
given to people who were born in Mexico and have come to live in Texas.&quot; Ami came in for a
brief second to say HI and then went back into the other room when she saw everything was okay.
They asked why they wanted to live in Texas; I was like, &quot;the US has forced the Mexican economy
into rubbish so it can be easily taken over by
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amero">Amero</a>.</p>
