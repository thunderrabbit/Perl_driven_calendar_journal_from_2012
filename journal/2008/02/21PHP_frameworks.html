<p>I imagine this will be yet another unfinished idea of mine, but for the past several months,
I've been looking for a PHP framework that I like.  (It used to be that I wanted a Perl framework,
but I've grown fond of PHP.  I still feel icky about it though; PHP is so loosey goosey!!!)</p>

<p>Okay, so anyway, I just set up <a href="http://php.robnugen.com">php.robnugen.com</a>, at which
there is currently *nothing*, BUT I want to install several PHP frameworks and see if that gives me
a better sense of which one I want to use for the next couple of web projects I do.</p>

<p>But first, dinnertime.  Ami is making ramen; I'm sure she will be done sooooon.</p>
