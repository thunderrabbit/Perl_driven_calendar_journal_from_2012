<p class="dream">Making a set of copies, we worked out a system using low grade paper: Starting
with Yumiko, she would take two blank sheets and two written shets and merge them into the copier.
Then I would hit print and do something to make all four sheets have content.  Then the two boys
would staple them ogether or something and put them in stacks.</p>

<p class="dream">The printing was a bit off when we used the brown paper, but I was like,
&quot;it's okay; do it for reals,&quot; and explained that the softer cheaper paper wasn't cut to
the same dimensions, and it stretched a little bit in the printer.</p>

<p class="dream">We tried this a couple of times, and it worked fine once we reminded Yumiko that it
started with her.  She'd have to take the initiatie to grabe the two blank seets of paper.</p>

<p class="dream">Finally I was all, &quot;aight we need to do 40 total, so let's do 38 more all at
once so we only have to get her started one more time.</p>
