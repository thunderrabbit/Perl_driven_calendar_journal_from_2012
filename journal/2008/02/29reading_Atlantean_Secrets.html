<p>I tried for a bit, but didn't fall back asleep, so I read several pages of Atlantean Secrets,
which I *love*.. It's such a great great great series!  I'm just near the end of Volume 4 (of 4),
and the pace of awesomeness has kept up for the entire series.  During a denouement, I finally was
getting a bit sleepy and didn't want to miss a drop of the next climax so I decided to write these
past few entries and go to bed.</p>
