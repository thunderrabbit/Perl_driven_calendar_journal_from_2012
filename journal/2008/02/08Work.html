<p>sigh</p>

<p>I just mirrored the test sever to match the live server, but they aren't working in the same
way.  I'm not sure what to do/check next.  The good news: the live server works properly.  The test
server is working, but *says* it's not working.</p>

<p>This is in regards to sending emails to users.</p>

<p>Fuck.  I'm stuck at work for some shit I don't know how to do.  I wanted to go to a CS
CouchSurfing party where Ryland (from CPC) planned to go, but if I go *now* I will be late, and
ironically it feels better to *not* go than to go late.  But fuckit' I'm going to try and roll
outta here now and see what happens.</p>

<p>Let's just say rolling out did *not* happen.</p>

<p>I did it.  Solved it.  Now I'm heading out, but over an hour late certainly means I missed the
eating part of the thing tonight.  I need to eat.</p>

<p>I'm going to call Ami and invite her out somewhere.</p>
