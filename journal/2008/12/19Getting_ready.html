<p>I woke up pretty early due to sleeping early, visions and memories of war war war in my head.  I
traced it back to BK and someone talking about their military experiences (boot camp more than
battles) while we were on the bus headed from Kagoshima downtown to its airport.</p>

<p>I did some email; I'm getting swamped in emails.  150 in my inbox at the moment, but to about 50
of them I don't need to respond.</p>
