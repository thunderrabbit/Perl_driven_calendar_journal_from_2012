<p>Good to see Kanae after three years!  Honestly I didn't *really* know her on PB, but I certainly
had a crush on her.  After she spotted me in her neighborhood during her jog, we sent a couple
emails and finally met up at <a href="http://www.thepinkcow.com/">The Pink Cow</a>
for <a href="http://vegan.meetup.com/389/">vegan night</a>!</p>

<p>The place was a bit uncrowded, like the front area had only three of us, though both tables were
reserved for vegan night.  Kanae, a dude from London named Chillin (sp) and me.  Why didn't anyone
show up?  Man, that's weak.</p>

<p>But we had a lovely swell time, and I was happy to hear Chillin's perceptions of Tokyo (he's
been here just a month), and share some PB story telling with Kanae.  Talk shifted to our
respective countries, and I went off on a bit of a tangent about WTC,
especially <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wtc7">WTC 7</a>, and assured them they should
start their research there.</p>

<p>I chatted with Traci for a bit, and coordinated a massage/reiki for food exchange with her.  I'll
give her an hour of reiki and massage and have vegan night buffet on the house next month!</p>

<p>My friend (and comedian) Dave arrived at our table while I was talking to Traci.  He described
some of the theory behind comedy, about developing a connection with the audience: the comedian's
job is to present his or her own view of the world in a way that's entertaining for the audience.
Talked a bit about Japanese vs American humor, and then shifted to an old conversation about porn
when Traci came by to say bye.  Apparently the most famous porn star in Japan is a 72 year old guy.
Who knew??</p>

<p>Hugs and bye to Traci and then we adjusted our conversation to fetishes (not in the clinical
sense): braces, ear biting, tight jeans, stockings, that kind of thing.  Other topics included
Prince, Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, Ghost Ride the Whip, and more.</p>

<p>Headed out around 11:40.  Bye to Chillin' at the bottom of the hill, then bye to Kanae at
Fukutoshin Line, and bye to Dave as he headed past my line to Yamanote.</p>
