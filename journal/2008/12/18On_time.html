<p>You know, I was just thinking how nice it is to be sitting on the train, relaxing, <em>on
time</em> being the key phrase here.  When I feel late for things, I get all grouchy and pissy, and
fearful, sorta panicked.  I like to be on time to things.  The importance of being on time was
taught to me when I was an Amway distributor, and from my men's group.  It's part of &quot;do what
you say you will do.&quot;</p>

<p>So, I try really hard to do what I say I will do.  &quot;I'll be there at 8,&quot; and I mean
I'll be there at or before 8:00:00, if at all possible, sometimes, perhaps, causing others some
discomfort on my way.  <em>Outta my way, people, don't you know I'm late?</em></p>

<p>So, chillin' on the train, totally on time, happy, etc, I came to realize that I could choose to
be on time more often, by doing things like, not waiting until the last moment do leave.</p>

<p>Yep, a real shocker there.  Sheer genius.</p>

<p>But what will it require?  Usually it's related to work; I work late, later, later, oh snap I've
*got* to go.  Maybe it's simply valuing my time as <em>*my*</em> time, which I can choose to spend
in ways that keep me happy.</p>

<p>I had that little realization around 6:40 (as written above), but I didn't actually write until
now (9:55am); I wanted to continue enjoying the moment instead of writing about it.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Taking time for myself so I can be on time.  Hmm.</p>
