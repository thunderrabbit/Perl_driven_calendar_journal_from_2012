<p>Just had a meeting with Malek and Sho to show them the billing system.  Everything is cool; just
need to make one-off invoices strong enough to withstand their master-billing-record having a
contract (and not succumb to the contract's sytem-clients) (hopefully today), and write the payment
system tomorrow after Sho finds out which way we should go with payments.</p>

<p>But first, I gotta go &quot;teach&quot; Mr Komatsu.  Hopefully he studied, as he promised he
would 10 days ago.</p>
