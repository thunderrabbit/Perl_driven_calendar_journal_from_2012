<p>My phone says the weather is 80% intent on raining tonight.  So I'm taking an umbrella with me to
Kagoshima and back today, which will include several places to forget it: a train, another train, a
plane, a bus, the clinic, another bus, another plane, yet another train, and the last train.</p>

<p>The goal is to remember it, and not have to buy a new umbrella when I get home (if it's
raining).</p>

<p>On the first plane, now, and I've still got the umbrella.  I forgot to mention my option of
forgetting it on the platform while waiting for the train, or in the airport while waiting for the
plane.</p>
