<p>Chatted with Dude a bit about the new project on which he's requested my help.  He's done way
more than me so far, but I did point out an issue with his planned DB structure.  We suggested some
adjustments to make it simpler, yet extendable, and ended up choosing one that will be quite easy
to code, and simply be a rewrite when it's time to re-code.</p>
