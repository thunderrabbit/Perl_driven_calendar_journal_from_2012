<p>Long conversation with Ami, which I thought would end in breakup, but seems to have held
together at the very end with a hug.  Basically I sent an email to Hitomi today:</p>

<pre>
HI Hitomi

I just want to say thank you for making my blue knitted hats.  I started wearing them today because
of the cold weather.  Even though you and I don't see each other, I think of you whenever I wear
these hats.

I hope you are well.  I'd love to hear from you if you have a chance.

    Love Love
     - Rob

<p>And I mentioned it offhandedly to Ami when I was getting full at dinner, and she started to
wonder what would happen if Hitomi wanted to get back with me, and I fully lost my appetite, and Ami
got mad that I didn't eat everything, and it spiraled down from there for a bit, and I thought she
might pack up and leave right there, in which case I planned to warn her, &quot;if you leave now
(without talking), you're never coming back,&quot; but she didn't leave then, but she also didn't
really talk, but I told her how I felt: sad that she wouldn't tell me what was going on in her
brain, and I gave her time and time to think/brood/whatever, but still nothing forthcoming, and even
less likely to talk so I was like, &quot;I think it's time for you to go home,&quot; meant literally
and a bit figuratively, and then she was like, &quot;what?&quot; and I go, &quot;I'm wondering if I
should ask for my keys back,&quot; and did a bit of quick triage to make sure she understood I was
just thinking, and not asking, but fortunately, and finally, that question brought from her mind
all the things she was thinking:</p>

<p>I'm selfish and chase girls and don't think about the future and all these other terrible things
which are certainly true 100%, but not necessarily on the To Be Changed list.  I told her that I
didn't want to marry her, and she was like, &quot;zero percent?&quot; And I didn't appreciate the
all-or-nothing answer so I was like, &quot;yeah zero percent&quot; and she was like, &quot;I'm
shocked; why would you say that?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;well you asked, so told you I don't want
to get married.&quot; and went on to explain that I always give her my truth and that's all I want
back.</p>

<p>more talking talking, mostly in Japanese, 50% vaguely understood, blah blah and then I was like,
&quot;so what do you want to do now?&quot; which I felt was like, a time crossing; her answer would
imply a great deal toward our (non)future.  She was like, &quot;you?&quot; and I go, I want to hug
you, and she's like, &quot;me too,&quot; so we hugged and she headed home with good wishes and
tidings, despite the gentle cold rain.

<p>She called me when she got home (at my request) and I told her I want to talk more about this,
like what will we do from here.  She's like, &quot;but you don't think about the future..&quot; and
I don't know if she meant it in a joking teasing way (I really hope she did, because it would have a
great implication for her level of communication / maturity in this topic) or not, but I was like,
&quot;well, see you Wednesday,&quot; and played the &quot;you hang up first&quot; game for a bit
until I got tired of it and hung up.</p>
