<p>While I was standing at platform 4 waiting for the Toyoko Line in Shibuya, the woman next to me
struck up a coversation: &quot;are you getting used to the trains here?&quot; or something like
that.  I was like, &quot;yeah.  And you?&quot;</p>

<p>·ÃÈþ»Ò is from San Francis»Ò, and is here visiting her peeps for the holidays.  Will be here
until the 29th.  She told me she's a bio genetics assistant (I think she said) and is working to
make plants hardier in extreme conditions, and assured me that her company is not like Monsanto. I
thanked her for her help toward the world.</p>

<p>Gave her my card; confirmed we can meet up via Facebook; asked if she had been to The Pink Cow, a
great place to meet foreigners, &quot;where you can just talk to people like you did to me.  Thank
you, by the way.&quot; She scoped the pics of Ami on my phone and then was telling me she used to
live in Saitama as we arrived in ÃæÌÜ¹õ where I had to cut our convo short to meet Ami.</p>
