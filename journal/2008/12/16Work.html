<p>Yesterday work was a bit more relaxing than on previous days (for the past 2 or 3 weeks) because
I arguably finished the billing project enough that we can start entering data.  In fact, I started
entering data for a club called Life, going back to when the contract was started in 2007.  I
entered the data a bit wrongly though, or the billing system could be (way) more intelligent and
unapply payments from old invoices and reapply those payments to new invoices if an invoice is
dated between the original invoices and the payment.  But it doesn't even make sense to say, much
less program the system to handle that.</p>

<p>But there is one tweak I plan to make to the GUI today: when creating new invoices, optionally
specify for which month the invoice is being created, overriding the automagic calculation that
takes today's date and adjusts it according to the contract (do they pay ahead of time, behind time
or for current month of service?)</p>
