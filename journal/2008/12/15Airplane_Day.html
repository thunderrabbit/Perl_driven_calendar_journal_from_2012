<p>NIST has acknowledged that WTC 7 came down at freefall speed (for at least part of its demise).
I dunno if this will ultimately be a step in the direction of <a href="http://www.911truth.org/">911

change</a> in their claims
of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=nist+extraordinary+event">extraordinary events</a>,
but I hope we'll have some convictions soon.</p>
