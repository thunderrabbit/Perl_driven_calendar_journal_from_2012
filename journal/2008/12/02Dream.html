<p class="dream">During the middle of the day, I walked by a spooky door in a huge tree which I had
seen before, but hadn't realized it was unlocked!  I pushed it open warily, as it was the entrance
to a haunted house (of the carnival variety).  Using my umbrella as a proxy, I waved it around
inside, the entrance, trying to set of any motion detectors that would be used to shout loud noises
or monsters at the visitor.</p>

<p class="dream">Nothing happened in the entry, so I opened the door fully and stepped inside,
seeing two doors on either side of the entry where monsters were certainly hiding.  I whapped the
doors loudly with my umbrella, but still no reaction.  Shook it all around and finally found a
switch that turned on a light, though it was a mere few watts.  I was surprised to think that this
little bit of light could actually scare someone, but at night, those watts would have much great
effect against the darkness than sunlight.</p>

<p class="dream">I turned around to see a huge frankenstein head looking in the window of the front
door where I had entered, and I waved my umbrella at it to say 'I see you!' and the guy took off
the mask and was like, &quot;hey how's it goin?&quot; cause he could see I could see and wasn't
particularly scared.</p>

<p class="dream">He suggested I look more closely at the human heads sticking up from the walls on
the doors I had been whapping before.  I inspected one of them: a female face with perfect hair and
beautiful features.  I was like, &quot;it's totally beautiful,&quot; and then the head began to move
and the woman whose head I had complimented stood up out of her position in the haunted house.  I
jokingly continued to refer to her as &quot;it,&quot; &quot;OMG how did you get it to sit there so
long?&quot; and she was like, &quot;HI,&quot; and he second girl was like, &quot;don't you think I'm
beautiful too?&quot; and I said, &quot;HI&quot; then &quot;I'll get to that in a second,&quot; and
then back to the first girl, &quot;I'm so sorry I was banging so loudly with my umbrella, but I'm so
impressed that I got no reaction from you whatsoever!&quot; and she looked over at her friend who
was getting up from her position as well, &quot;yes, I think it was your turn to spook the
visitor...&quot; she said casually, and I sorta got a sense of what it must be like to have this as
a job.</p>

<p class="dream">Wondering how I should say, &quot;no I'm not really attracted to you,&quot; to the
second girl, but who was generally speaking an attractive woman, just not for me, I realized she
had just been joking with her commment, so I didn't say anything.</p></p>
