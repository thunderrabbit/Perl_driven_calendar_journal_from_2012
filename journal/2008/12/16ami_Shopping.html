<p>Went shopping with Ami last night: we met at Hachiko and I bounced around on the
energy-generating footpads before walking to Tokyo Hands.  The big digital display says we've
accumulated 7023.0453 (or something that can be rounded to 7 X 10^3) kWS of energy.  It must be
measuring in kilowatt seconds.  Wow!  In just 3 or 4 weeks of these 6 squares being set up (4 of which are in a main
path of foot traffic) we can power a 50 watt energy saving light bulb for 14 seconds!  We only
need, let's see:</p>

<pre>
6 squares/14 seconds = X squares/3 weeks

6 squares/14 seconds = X squares/(3 weeks * 604800 seconds / week)

6 squares/14 seconds = X squares/181440 seconds

X squares = 6 squares * 181440 seconds / 14 seconds

777600 squares
</pre>

<p>777600 squares and we can power a 50 watt light bulb continuously!!! Woooooo!!</p>

<p>I'm hoping (seriously hoping) that my math / assumptions are flat wrong, and our walking energy
could be more effectively put to use.</p>

<p>Aight; I'm in Shibuya now (have been writing while on the train headed to work).  Peace!</p>
