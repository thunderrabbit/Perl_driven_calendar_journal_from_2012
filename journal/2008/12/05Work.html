<p>Have some functions written that will apply outstanding balances to the new invoices, though
they don't quite work correctly yet.  Basically I'm having some item_type conflicts; I already have
item types called amt_paid, and the tax adds that to the apparent amount due and is like, &quot;oh
hey there's no tax due!&quot;</p>

<p>So I basically need to either redesign how amt_paid is handled, or create new item_types for the
historical balances.</p>

<p>I'll check the number of times amt_paid appears in the code; if it seems intractable, I'll do
the add item_type method of fixing this.</p>

<p>Let's see if I can fix it now:</p>

<p>This is basically what I want:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
amt_due
</dt>
<dd>
amount due on most recent invoice
</dd>
<dt>
amt_paid
</dt>
<dd>
amount paid on most recent invoice  (could be plural)
</dd>
<dt>
previous_balance
</dt>
<dd>
balance(s) from old invoices' amt_due and amt_paid (combined)
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Hmmmm; I have the code open in <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>; though I can't
save it (I never could get local copies to work correctly), I can search through it, and it appears
that I can adjust the way amt_due is used in the system with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>save yer old code</p></li>

<li><p>completely rewrite definition of get_overview_amount_due()</p></li>

<li><p>in get_invoice_items_for_output(), include amt_due in the $output_array[items] array</p></li>

<li><p>remove <em>AND item_type != 'amt due'</em> from next query's where clause</p></li>
</ol>
