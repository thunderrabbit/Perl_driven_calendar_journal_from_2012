<p class="dream">Decided to give to <a href="http://jasoncollin.org/">Jason</a> some of the pins I
had because he said he liked them and wanted to get some.  I collected a few and then was looking
for a way to wrap them.  I opened a refrigerator and found a cake box with a cake that had been
largely eaten, so I figured I could stab the pins into pieces of cake and give them to him that way.
I started to pull the cake apart, but it was really sticking to my fingers more than breaking apart,
and then I noticed a hone bee inside the piece of cake.  Then I noticed it wasnt cake at all, but a
honey comb!  There were bees all through it, and a couple of them were still alive!  I wondered how
the had made a comb with stripes of grass instead of wax, for that's what the comb looked like.  One
of the bees stung me as it had gotten semi crushed against my finger as I was pulling the cake
apart, so I was trying to unstick the sticky bits from my fingers and repair the comb and undo the
damage I had done to it, and put it back in the refrigerator because it was obviosly *not* the
remains of a cake as I had suspected.  One of the bees flew away, but I chose not to try to recover
it.  I wondered if the bees would be better of being left outside, and if it was better to respect
the bees needs or the human who had put the comb in the refrigerator.</p>
