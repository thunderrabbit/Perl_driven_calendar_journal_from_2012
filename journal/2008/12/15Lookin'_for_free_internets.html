<p>I've been wandering around Shibuya station in search of free wireless so Fred can email me when
he gets here.  Instead of free internets, I found some pay phones.  I also found a wireless signal
called GoogleGuest which appeared unencrypted, but didn't seem usable once I connected.  I may
contact my &quot;friend&quot; who works at Google to see if she can tell me how to connect to that
signal.  If I can remember her name, that is.</p>

<p>If I can't remember her name nor otherwise work out a connection for Fred, I'll suggest the pay
phones.  They're pretty close to both Yamanote Line and Tokyu Toyoko Line, and they're inside, next
to an area featuring foodages.</p>

<p>Ah.  I know!  I have in my wallet a phone card that can be used for pay phones in Japan.  I'll
tape that card under the phone in question so Fred can use it when he gets to Shibuya!  That will be
like a personalized version of geocaching or me-bro stashing or something.  I've wanted to place
secret notes in the Eiffel Tower so I could tell my Paris-trip-planning friend to find the note.
Not sure what happened with that, but I can vaguely remember looking for a place to stash such a
note (behind one of the pictures on the way up the stairs was my best idea).  Anyway, I'm pretty
sure this will work so Fred can call me.  And it'll be fun!</p>
