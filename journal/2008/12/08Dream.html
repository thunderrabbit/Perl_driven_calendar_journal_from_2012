<p class="dream">Diane was leaving, and I kept wanting to hug on her.  She was like, &quot;if you
wanna stop by tonight, you're welcome,&quot; and my eyes widened a bit like, &quot;um, yeah!  I've
wanted to for a long time!&quot; She goes, &quot;exactly, that <b>that</b>'s why I'm inviting you
tonight.  My boyfriend won't be home until tomorrow night, so..&quot; She tugged gently on my
shirt.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Um, yes, but, oh man I really can't.  I shouldn't.  But it's really
tempting.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't realize it was a dream.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;But you see I'm with Ami now and we have an agreement.  Next time, yeah?&quot;</p>

<p>and I began to wake up</p>

<p>&quot;oh snap!  It's a dream!  go back to sleep go back to sleep and do it!&quot;</p>

<p>dang</p>
