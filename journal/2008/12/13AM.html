<p>Woke up around 6am with an answer to my coding problems.  I know this will help simplify it.  I
had been trying to read the data and do all the processing in arrays.  But it will be easier to
mix-n-match some bits if I put them in temporary tables.  I think.</p>

<p class="date">1:20pm JST</p>

<p>Have lulled around a bit, including visiting <a href="http://nin.com">nin.com</a> and chatting
with Fred, inspired by Skype wanting me to &quot;save&quot; my Skype credit by spending it.  Called
him; his phone died due to office-mate induced water spillage; just did text chat.</p>

<p>And, just now, I have drawn 2.5 pages of stuff that summarize what I <em>know</em> will work to
solve all the billing woes.  The code will be simple and not all that long.</p>

<p>Sweet.  If only I could work from home.  <em>ahem</em>.</p>

<p>I guess it's good that I can't code immediately; I should tighten up this flowchart and write out
the comments.  Then I can piece together bits of code that should work perfectly.  (For the record,
I had all the right logic, but just in a mixed up way, trying to work without using a temporary
table.  The temporary table makes everything easier for my brain to think about, and I think it
makes the problem actually easier to solve.  Basically giving the work to mySQL instead of PHP
arrays.)</p>

<p>Going to take a shower now, redraw what I've got, then need to head to Pink Cow soon thereafter.</p>
