<p>Sho was busy preparing for sbstrm lounge today.  He headed out around 7:15, and then I headed out
around 7:30.  He called me soon thereafter and asked if I was still in the office.  Headed back to
the office to get his business cards: both his and his upcoming artists list (or something).  He
paid for my taxi plus 110 yen bonus and I headed back to Shibuya one stop on Ginza Line.</p>

<p>My total cost for learning Sho's phone number and the location of sbstrm lounge: 50 yen.</p>
