<p>Argh.</p>

<p>Actionscript frustrates the fuck out of me!  I know what I want to do, but am just not familiar
with how actionscript wants me to do it.  I know this programming shit.  I know this OOP shit.
Just not the actionscript semantics (if that's the right word).</p>

<p>I just want some nice pure code that's not all broken up into tiny frames and layers and shit.
fuck!</p>
