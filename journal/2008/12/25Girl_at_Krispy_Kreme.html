<p>About 10 minutes after Tariq left, I caught the girl looking over at me, so I smiled back, and
when I left, gave her a U-Cow card, though U-Cow was left chillin' at work, so no pics of her with
Cow.  I didn't even try to explain the card / cow, but wrote &quot;Merry Christmas! ¤Þ¤¿¡¡Ï©Éð&quot;
on the bottom.  She was like, &quot;Thank you!  Very very thank you!&quot; I smiled inside and
smiled &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;bye bye&quot; to her as I left.</p>
