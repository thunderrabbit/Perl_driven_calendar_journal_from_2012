<p>Karen, who lives across the hall from me, will soon be Karen, who used to live across the hall
from me.  No more &quot;dunk kadunk kadunk kadunk wak kadunk kadunk kadunk&quot; in the morning
when she makes sure her door is closed.  I was hoping Fred would get to hear it.</p>

<p>I've got my bed moved to one side, and a space cleared for Fred's bed on the other side, with my
clothes rack in the middle like a wall for minimal privacy.</p>

<p>Also today, I was playing with a text game
called <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/21324">Fiction!</a>, which I found when searching
for <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/863">text adventure game engine</a> and was trying to write a bit of
a more complicated adventure.txt for the game.  I got stuck trying to make the conversations differ
based on the status of people in the game.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Even though I got the game from a wiki, I think I'll make a wiki entry for it on my site,
just to mirror the code.</p>
