<p>Typing about yesterday while on the train today.</p>

<p>I pretty much finished coding to the degree possible without trying to recreate on my server the
DB tables we have at work.  I logged my hours with a note like, &quot;99.7% sure this will
work.&quot;</p>

<p>I worked on Marble Track 3 (adding perhaps 20 frames), where the gluer guy and the placer guy
both fall at the same time.  The placer drops a popsicle stick on his foot while the gluer is
startled to find a pipecleaner snaking across his foot.

<p>Ami came for a visit and cooked some yummy pumpkin stew for dinner and for my lunch today.  We
romped twice and had a little tickle fight after our second nap.
