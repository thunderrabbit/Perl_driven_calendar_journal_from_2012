<p>First order of business after a quick recap at the green phones: bought Fred a train pass from
Motosumiyoshi to Shibuya.</p>

<p>Ate a snacky dinner in Dotour while watching people pouring out of the trains.  Lots of people.
Lots and lots of people.  And more people.</p>

<p>Not so many people.  This is Shibuya.</p>

<p>Ami came over for a bit and brought food!  Bananas, apples, oranges, granola and soy milk!  Bless
her.  She couldn't stay for long, but said HI and bye as Fred arranged presents under my desk.  (R:
&quot;But where will my feet go?&quot; A: &quot;On your bed!&quot; F: &quot;It's only 2 days; you'll
get over it.&quot;)</p>

<p>Fun fun fun chattin' with Fred.</p>

<p>To keep him awake for a bit, I had Fred play Tokyo2 (text adventure game) as I took a few more
snaps of MT3.</p>

<p>Fred's snorin' like a walrus.</p>
