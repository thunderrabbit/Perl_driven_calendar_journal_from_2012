<p>I wish it were a slide, but maybe we'll make those next!  In Shibuya Square, I saw a couple of
new &quot;exhibits,&quot; that look pretty permanent (as in the bricks were replaced with asphalt);
four squares with foot prints on them are connected to some sort of electrical cable; with all
kinds of information about how they've just discovered this amazing concept of helping the earth by
generating power with renewable resources!</p>

<p>There were several sponsors' names on the thing, with a shoe company near top of the list.
Walking = making electricty = YES!</p>

<p>I saw some peeps playing on the electric thingies on my way to the station from work.  There was
a big display &quot;651.042434 Kwh&quot; or so, but I
couldn't tell which Kwh it was measuring.</p>
