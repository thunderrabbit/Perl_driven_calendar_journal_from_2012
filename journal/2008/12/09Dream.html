<p class="dream">The tornado siren began to sound, but then an announcement was made,
&quot;introducing the greatest dancer in the world,&quot; or something and I went out onto the
balcony and a dude started dancing with the bestest bumpin'est music and I was dancing way up on
the balcony, and I think he saw me, then sure enough the elevator behind me dinged and one of the
dancer's crew had come up to bring me downstairs and back stage to meet the guy.</p>

<p class="dream">A man was throwing coins into people's hands in the audience as both his skill and
his generosity of giving away money.  I wondered if he would throw any to me so I help my hand out,
but had to be different so I held it behind my back.  He was like, &quot;??&quot; and I opened my
fingers a bit more.  Then he threw the coin like a frisbee and and it nearly slipped into the cuff
of my sleeve, except that I moved my hand to try to catch it, and it missed.  I picked up the coin
and inspected it briefly.  It appeared to be a fake Amero, so I threw it back to the guy, trying to
match his skill in throwing.  I did pretty well, considering the size of the disk.</p>

<p class="dream">The show ended, and the guy asked some members of the audience if they would buy
him a drink, considering he had given away that much money, and I was like, &quot;where's your
hotel?&quot; and he said something which might have meant the hotel right next door.  I was like,
&quot;did you walk more than 10 seconds to get here?&quot; and he said, &quot;yeah, 30
minutes&quot; but then I recognized it *was* the hotel right there, so I go, &quot;yeah, but it
took me a long time to get oriented in Tokyo..&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Started helping clean up, and found some marbles on the floor; collected about 10
marbles for him, looking under chairs and such.</p>
