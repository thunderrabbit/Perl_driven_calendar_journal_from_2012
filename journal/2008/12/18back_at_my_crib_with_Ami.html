<p>At home.  Already ate dinner with Ami.</p>

<p>I happened to see Ami reading magazines at the 7-11 near Hirama station and snuck up beside her
after I paid my 15,000(!) yen phone bill.  I was inappropriately close to her (for a stranger) when
she looked over and was like, &quot;Waow!&quot; with her mouth shape, not making any noise, perhaps
because she had on her earphones at the moment.</p>

<p>We walked back to my house and had dinner, sex, and a nap until perhaps 11pm when she headed home.</p>
