<p>I was alone at work for a significant portion of the day.  During that time I cranked up my
music and had a nice groovin' workplace.</p>

<p>Workwise, the invoice payment screen now can accept payments of any size, and apply them to
invoices as needed, although when creating new invoices, neither the credit nor balance due of past
invoices is taken into consideration.  That's the main task for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Another task may prove a bit more tacky to tackle; there's a bug in the way I display payments; I
tried to write some sweet code that handles three different cases, including
&quot;backtracking&quot; while only looping once through the list of invoices, but it doesn't quite
work yet.  2.5 of the cases are good, but one of the cases doesn't work half of the time.</p>
