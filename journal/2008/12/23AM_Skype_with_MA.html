<p>Just finished chatting with Ma on Skype.  It all started when I was roused from bed by the music
from the garbage truck.  I knew that Karen had left some bags of bags (some of which I used to wrap
presents to Fred and Ami), and they needed to be taken out.  Went downstairs and found the
trash <em>already</em> taken out.  Must be Ulrike, the lovely German woman who lives next to me,
because there's no one else living in the house at the moment.  Rooms have been vacant for like 2
months, 1 month, and 2 days, respectively.  Anyway, I was like, &quot;I need to get Ulrike
something for Christmas!&quot; and then realized that I outsourced that request to Fred: &quot;Can
you get some Strawberry Quik for the nice German girl who lives next to me?&quot;</p>

<p>Found that Fred was online, and asked him about more pressing issues first.  Basically, &quot;do
you have all the pics and info you need to get to the pay phones next to GREEN FARM?&quot;</p>

<p>Then, &quot;did you deposit $1.50 for me?&quot;  (not just no, but &quot;shit no&quot;)</p>

<p>Then, &quot;did you get Strawberry Quik?&quot; (not just no, but &quot;shit no&quot;)</p>

<p>And somewhere in there we determined he hasn't gotten Glide brand dental tape.  Hmmm I wonder if
he got a deodorant stone.  I wonder if I should just try harder to find these things in Japan
instead of having them imported.</p>

<p>Anyway, I emailed Ma to see if <em>she</em> could deposit $1.50 into my account, and then I
decided to just call her, and then switched to Skype cause it's free!</p>

<p>Ma sounds a bit like Jon; her voice has gone all hoarse from being sick.  I showed her the
latest haps in my life (in my room): bed for Fred, painting for Colleen, Rabby and the set of
Marble Track Three construction.  Neat to surprise Ma that I still have Rabby, my well-loved
stuffed rabbit from when I was but a wee tyke.</p>

<p>This is the rabbit that (according to my brain), spent a month outside in a bush</p>
