<p class="dream">Telling a story about Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I was standing outside
with several of my friends watching raptly from the makeshift audience in a driveway.  I loved that
they were so intent on listening to the story as I told it, even though they had all read HHGTTG
and had all heard the story before.  They cheered me on, and when someone arrived a bit later, I
told the story again, trying to make it a bit different</p>
