<p>Went for a bit of a walk down the hallway that basically goes along the Ginza Line looking for a
free WiFi signal so Fred can email me when he arrives.  Didn't find one.  But right now, as I'm on
the train waiting to leave, I've got full strength signal.  I had hoped to find something in that
hallway because it's not super crowded like most of Shibuya station.</p>
