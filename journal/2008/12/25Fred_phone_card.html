<p>I adhered Fred's phone card to the bottom of the leftmost green phone near GREEN FARM on the way
out of ½ÂÃ« station just a moment ago.  Well, several moments, most of which were filled with
walking briskly to Krispy Kreme to meet Tariq, and the last one of which (before starting this
entry) were spent saying &quot;HI~!&quot; with a flirtatious smile to one of four girls at my
preferred table (it's near an electric outlet) who was overtly smiling at me as I walked in. </p>

<p>But, in the 4 minutes that it took to write all that, not another word nor glance has been
exchanged.</p>
