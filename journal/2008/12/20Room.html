<p>Chilled in my room mostly all day today, partially cleaning, and partially working on Flash,
and partially getting hungry.</p>

<p>I called Keiko while on the way to the Indian restaurant in ∏µΩªµ», hoping she could join me,
but she said she was headed out to œªÀ‹Ã⁄, and invited me to join her!  Oh man, I was so tempted,
but I knew it would be frustrating/impossible to keep myself to myself, so I declined.</p>

<p>Meditated some while in the restaurant.  Andrew (from the apartments formerly known as Millenium
House) came in when I was nearly finished with my foodage, and I invited him to join me.  We
gossipped a bit about MH peeps; he says Kumi is coming to town soon for about a week.  Wow!  It
would be nice to see her!  I have no real hopes that she'll contact me, even though I told Andrew
to tell her to do so.  We'll see!</p>

<p>Ami came over around 10pm and we had a bit of a Talk regarding my &quot;almost&quot; having gone
to œªÀ‹Ã⁄.  In the end, I was like, &quot;I want both you *and* Keiko&quot; (and an endless string
of other women)</p>

<p>Ami was like, &quot;next year, let's move out of Japan.&quot;</p>

<p>Really?</p>
