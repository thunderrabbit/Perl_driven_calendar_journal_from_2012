<p class="dream">In Houston, enjoying a chance to chill out with Arial'a / Diane Perry, on whom it was well
known I had a crush, basically getting to see her in her element, with hair tightly bound to  keep
the wind from blowing it everywhere, though we were inside by the mantel, looking at some little
carvings.  I was cleaning my room, and throwing away , or recycling a bunch of rocks, including
some little cat figurines.  She saw one with its paw in the air, and she was like, &quot;oh!  cute
raccoon!&quot; and I was like, &quot;it's a cat,&quot; totally surprised that she thought it was a
raccoon.  I then brought up a new topic, talking about Ami, saying matter-of-factly that it may be
the case that we need to break up, and I wondered if that happened, I'd be able to do some coaching
sessions with Arial'a to help get things sorted out between me and Ami.  Before I got an answer,
though, I added the little thought that it may be better to *not* do coaching sessions with a woman
on whom I have a crush.  I might instead do the sessions with Kim Sawyer, my old coach.  Diane
goes, &quot;oh yes I know him; in fact he's having a workshop today in the other room, and it
turned out that we were in Kim's house.</p>

<p class="dream">i went outside to see if I could find him, but instead I found some guys lifting
the garage and staircase  and adjacent building wall as one big unit with some large cranes and many
cables.  They were actually just putting the whole thing down, and I watched as they lowered it the
last five feet or so.  I wondered if I could have helped, perhaps getting paid by the footstep for
my efforts, but I realized the guy wasn't really walking anywhere, so it wouldn't be very much pay.
Perhaps if I had come a bit earlier during the setup I could have made more money.  And why wasn't
Kim just *not* having his garage and staircase lifted ; it seemed like a big waste of money.  I
wondered also why he hadn't offered the work to me, and I guessed maybe because I was too smart
for doing such low wage work.  I walked around the other side to go back inside, and I found myself
slightly bared in on a room full of people, including Kim showing some sort of video presentation
to several people, who were sitting on the floor and desks and everywhere because the room was so
full.</p>

<p class="dream">The video, I knew, was a presentation of the personal growth work training classes
Kim leads and I was glad to already be doing that kind of work, and not have to sit in on a
beginner level class. I walked quickly through the room so as not to disturb anyone too much, and
back into the main room where I found Arial'a preparing to leave.  I asked her to stay and bid her
adieu, and welcomed her back anytime as I opened the door for her to leave.  I found Fred was
sleeping on a chair in the next room, and he had come with another one of my or his male friends.
They were both zonked out from jet lag, and I wondered about waking him up because it was now morning
in Japan, but he usually sleeps late, so I didn't know if it would be better to wake him up or let
him sleep in.  Kim Sawyer came into the room and I was like, &quot;how'd the meeting go,&quot; and
he looked at me with passive aggressive face, saying &quot;why didn't you come watch as well?&quot;
I began to stammer, um, er, I was in a meeting with, but I didn't say anything because I couldn't
remember her name, and then Kim went on to say, &quot;Kevin was in the video talking about the guy
saying the pledge of allegiance backwards,&quot; which Kim had told to me in confidence, and I could
not believe I had told it to anyone, but that was the only explanation as to how Kevin would have
known the story, and I couldn't figure out why Kevin would have said anything because I *know* I
would have told him it was confidential, and I couldn't remember even talking to him about it
anyway, and why was it on a video that Kim showed to his class, but hadn't previewed the video first
to see what was on it?</p>

<p class="dream">Nothing made any sense, and I felt guilty and confused and didn't know what was
what..</p>

<p>and then I woke up.  Oh man so that explains what happened!</p>
