<p>Met up with Akiko at Hachiko at 5pm and chowed at a nearby Okonomiyaki shop, where Akiko assured
me that we did *not* eat monja-yaki with Rimi in Shinjuku.  Fred flirted a tiny bit with the girls
right next to us as they were tilting their heads like dogs over their food.  The dudes at the table
before them had been smoking pretty effectively, but there was a nice draft sending the smoke away
from me, so I didn't complain.  The two ¥®¥ã¥ë at the table near them had been semi-chatting,
smoking, and sleeping at the table.</p>

<p>We had a couple okonomiyaki, monjayaki, and another okonomiyaki.  Fred had umeshu (at my
recommendation (I wanted one, but chose to continue my non-drinking campaign)) and really liked it.
Ordered another.</p>
