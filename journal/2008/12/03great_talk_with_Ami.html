<p>First I told Ami I was continuing the conversation from last time (Monday?).  Then I kicked off
the conversation by saying basically I don't want babies, I don't want to get married, and I want to
stop dating Ami exclusively.  Three choices: either we break up, or you let me date other people, or
you say no and I break up with you.</p>

<p>I could see the tears well up, and I stood firmly in my resolve that this was the right thing to
do; I have to have freedom to be happy, etc.  And of course if she loves me, she'll set me free.</p>

<p>Ami, somewhat crying, was like, &quot;so basically it's not a choice at all; you've decided to
break up, and you're forcing the &quot;choice&quot; on me.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Hmmmm; well.</em></p>

<p>And she was angry for a bit, but still speaking her truth (major plus-points there), and then she
asked an important question: &quot;why do you want to date other people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a good question,&quot; I said.  <em>That's a good question,</em> I thought.  Damn.
That's a really good question.  Cause I like the thrill of the chase?  Cause I like to fuck?  Cause
I am afraid of commitment?  Cause because?</p>

<p>&quot;Um, because I think it would be fun.&quot;</p>

<p>And then she was like, &quot;Despite your wandering heart, I have stayed with you because I
trust you.&quot; and she explained several different times in several different ways, but they all
ended with &quot;I trust you.&quot;</p>

<p>And I started to cry.  I realized the truth, which I told her: &quot;I don't trust myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Lots of crying.  I outdid her crying by a longshot (tears and snot everywhere), though, to be
clear, she had been shaking as well.</p>

<p>(all of the above took at least 30 minutes to play out)</p>

<p>Then, or around that point, she was like, &quot;before you broke up with Reiko, you kissed me,
right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And at the same time you kissed that other girl (I forgot her name), right?&quot;</p>

<p><em>Yurika.  (best not to mention that she's the Yurika I teach every other week)</em>
&quot;Right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And we've been together for over a year and a half, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And except for one slight peck on the lips to Keiko, is there anything else?&quot;</p>

<p><em>Nice that we don't have to lie.</em> Steady eyes, &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See?  You've *been* doing it!  You're in a committed relationship.  You <em>are</em> doing
it.&quot;</p>

<p>More crying.  <em>I guess I am, but (just a moment)</em> more crying.</p>

<p>&quot;亜美ち、もう一つがあるんんだけど、あまり話したくない。&quot;  (But Ami, there's one more
thing I have to tell you, and I don't really want to say it.)</p>

<p>&quot;なんでしょう。&quot; (What is it?), spoken with a voice like, &quot;if you have been lying,
so help me, you will die.&quot;</p>

<p>I paused to cry more, knowing it would just build up the drama, but unable to do anything
else.</p>

<p>&quot;時々、&quot; pause, &quot;時々亜美と英語で話したい。&quot;  (Sometimes, sometimes I want
to speak English with you.)</p>

<p>Ami looked equal parts relieved and saddened, &quot;I know,&quot; she slumped.  &quot;I'm sorry.
I know.&quot;</p>

<p>(more to come?)</p>

<p class="note">Now it's the next day.  Lemme read this again and see if I'm inspired to write.</p>

<p>So I told her how very much I want to talk with her, and sometimes I just want to slap her
(verbally) and say &quot;you wanna go to the US, but you don't wanna study English?&quot; &quot;you're
talking about getting a degree as a paralegal, but you won't study English???&quot; but I explained,
if I were just her friend I'd be more likely to tell her she's actin' a fool, but as her bf, I
don't really wanna say it.</p>

<p>She was like, &quot;because you're my bf, please tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>I mockingly slapped her, &quot;study English!  You'll never be able to live in the US if you
don't.&quot;</p>

<p>And then I told her clearly that I hate to study; I hate Japanese; it's horrible and terrible
and I know how you feel and you don't have to study, but for your own sake, ifn you want to study,
you just gotta study.  That's why I've started studying again.</p>

<p>Plus, I just want to talk to you.....</p>

<p>After that bit of the conversation, I went back to the dating idea.  &quot;I know why I want to
date other women.&quot; and went on to explain that during sex, if I can give her (many) orgasms, I
feel powerful.  I love to make her shudder with blissful waves and uncontrolled ecstacy and blah
blah blah cause it makes me feel powerful.  So if I can do that with Ami, it's great.  If I can do
it with Ami and Miyuki and Deborah and Sheri, that's gotta be four times better, right?</p>

<p>But the problem, Ami; that power is not real; it's fleeting; it's dangerous; it's unfair;
etc.</p>

<p>So, what to do?  Meditate.  find the bliss within myself that infinitely outshines the power.
Create my own power; live, be, love, me me me.</p>

<p>(I didn't say all this; I'm just kinda rambling)</p>

<p>But then I *did* say, sticking my proverbial neck out, hoping for the best, &quot;sometimes I'd
like to play-act like I can do other girls when we have sex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just imagine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay!&quot;</p>

<p>woot!</p>
