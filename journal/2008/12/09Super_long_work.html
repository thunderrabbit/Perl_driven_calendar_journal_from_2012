<p>In the same kind of gotta-finish excitement as in university with Maggie, I used the same feeling
to keep me programming all day today (including designing during class with Komatsu).  Including
that time perhaps a bit liberally, I logged 12 hours of work today in the Tracker app that Malek
wrote recently.</p>

<p>The good news for me today was having my headphones, so I could spend a bit of time correcting 
¤æ¤ê¤«'s audio-transcription homework, and then *not* have to listen to the bit of griping going on
between Malek, Andrew, <em>and</em> Sho.  Often it's just Malek and Andrew, but they were all at it
today, and I was glad to be excluded.</p>

<p>I think I'll be able to largely finish coding tomorrow, but it may take another long day, in
which case I'll have to choose between Ami and work.  Usually I choose Ami, but tomorrow I may
choose work if things don't go as quickly as I hope.</p>

<p>For the record, this is the third iteration of how to handle carrying partial payments forward,
taking into consideration payments getting split across invoices, and invoices being unpaid, and/or
paid with multiple small payments. </p>

<p>I'm 99% sure the current technique I'm doing will work the way Sho has requested, and I'm 99.1%
sure that this is the final design before I show it by the end of this week.</p>

<p>I'm 100% sure I should keep copies of the code for posterity, but not sure where I can keep
it.  Can't open-source it.</p>

<p>On the way to Shibuya, a woman with a great smile connected shoulder to shoulder with me and was
like, &quot;would you like a massage?&quot; and... man.  a bit dangerous for my little brain to see
such a nice smile and be so tired tempted.  She was pretty persistent, too, though my gentle series
of &quot;no&quot;s and &quot;no thank you&quot;s prevailed.  Soon as she peeled away from me, I was
like, &quot;ah dang; I should have complimented her smile.&quot; It was really really nice, and her
line of work doesn't seem all that easy to me.  (but programmming 12 hours is?  wtf?)</p>
