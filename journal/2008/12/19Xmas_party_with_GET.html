<p>Great time with GET and peeps from PB.  Man I want to sail again, *and* I got an inside tip
saying that there have been no repeater teacher applications for the voyage that leaves in April.
If I *don't* get the Kagoshima thing, sailing on PB would be an awesome way to not have a stable
job.  Wow.</p>

<p>Pania is the coordinator for the trip.  But maybe I should stay in Tokyo and study Japanese for
an intensive course and then sail as a paid coordinator.  Hmmmmm</p>

<p>Great fun meeting peeps, and then greater fun when we cleaned up and chowed a gingerbread house
and then hula hooped for basically an hour.  I could hula with my legs and arms and neck, but not
with my waist.  Weird!  Yumi was doing great; she and Jonathan (sp) could do a booty bouncy hoop,
and Pania put on Funky Cold Medina which fit the booty dance pretty well.</p>
