<p class="dream">I was Hancock, impermeable to bullets, able to fly, able to fly through walls of
buildings, living up in the attic of an Italian restaurant.  While on the streets, I came across
three women who were out for lunch or something.  One of them asked me out on a date.  In a not
exactly patronizing voice, I was like, &quot;okay, give me your business card and I'll meet you for
lunch tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">She gave me her card and I flew away before she could even ask, &quot;where shall
we meet?&quot; and I answered her back (from 200, 300, 400 meters away and counting), &quot;I'll find
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I knew the card was my only link to her, and that I had a tendency to forget
things while in this dream state of consciousness so I had to try really hard to focus long enough
to remember and maintain enough control of the dream to find her again the next day.  I got into a
fight with some bad guys and almost lost the business card; it had gotten ripped into two pieces,
each of which were close to ripping into two pieces each.  I had to stop fighting these guys and
get the business card back without letting them know what was important to me.  I saw it on the
floor, so in a surprise move (as I was hovering by the ceiling), I flew straight down at the floor,
catching the business card and crashing through floor by floor of the building at an angle until I
exited the building.</p>
