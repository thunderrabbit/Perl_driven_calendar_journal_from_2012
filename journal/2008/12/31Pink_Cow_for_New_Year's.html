<p class="note">(I'm actuallly writing this 12 hours later)</p>

<p>I intentionally didn't bring my computer last night, and for some reason I didn't bring my camera
(it's busy with MT3), though I brought U-Cow, and I forgot to bring either my or U-Cow's name cards,
but I didn't forget to bring Fred and Ami as we headed to The Pink Cow for Happy New Year Number
2009!</p>

<p>Ended up chillin' with some peeps from OZ: Zsofi and Rob (who I can uniquely identify in my
worldview as Dr Rob) sat in the chairs across the table from me, Ami, and Fred as we sat on the
low-rider green couch with blue fuzzy on it.  Zsofi's sister sat to Fred's right (I forgot her
name).</p>

<p>Zsofi, who's just finished law school, and Dr Rob are visiting Japan (Tokyo) for about 2 or 3
weeks (hard to hear in the bustling party atmosphere) and will be here for a few more days.  I
assume the same for Zsofi's sister.</p>
