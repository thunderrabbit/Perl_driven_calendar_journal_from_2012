<p><img src="/wiki/images/7/79/Bush_v_Shoes_2008_Dec_15.gif" alt="Bush v Shoes" /></p>

<p>I snagged this image and put it in my wiki for safekeeping.  But, haha, I just realized that any
shmo can overwrite the image.  I'll put a copies on smugmug, facebook, and airplaneday.  Anyway, I
believe the reaction from the crowd proves that box cutters could not have been used to hijack
airplanes.  The logic goes basically like this:</p>

<p>Though the shoe-thrower is obviously angry (and therefore likely dangerous), at least two people
immediately react to stop him.  They immediately &quot;risked their lives&quot; to stop the guy who
was a possible danger to the people in the room.</p>

<p>Now, switch to an airplane.  A commercial jetliner, if you will.  If three or four dudes jump up
with boxcutters, it's unpossible that they woulda been able to get into the cockpit.  Other
dudes woulda jumped up just as fast as they could take off their seat belts.</p>

<p>If three or four dudes sneakily stealth themselves to kill a couple of people without being
noticed, they would be noticed before that tactic would get them into the cockpit.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now, I can think of some arguments against this logic:</p>

<p>* Perhaps people were more keen to stop an attack on the President / in Iraq.</p>

<p>but</p>

<p>Given that Bush's own body guards didn't even enter the room before those two guys had reacted, I
doubt the guys who actually brought the guy down were trained to save the US President.  They were
saving their own asses.</p>

<p>Even though they're in Iraq, the entire roomload of people would die just as easily as an
airplane, so that doesn't actually make a difference.</p>
