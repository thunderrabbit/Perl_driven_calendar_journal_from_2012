<p>After work yesterday, I called Megumi (as planned), and we went to The Pink Cow (as planned).  We
hadn't planned exactly where to meet, which ended up being at the base of Tower Records, just a four
minute walk to the aforementioned Cow</p>

<p>Greetings and Megumi-introductions to Traci and HI to Derrick (sp), who knew Megumi(!), and who I
had met at a vegan night buffet (but didn't remember his name).  Derrick and I chatted a bit about
how Megumi knows *everyone*, or everyone knows Megumi; it's pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Megumi and I were there to chat and see the Comedy Go Go, stand-up improv-comedy fest.</p>

<p>Chatting was nicer than I expected, or perhaps nicer than I remembered it would be; it had been
some months since I had spoken with Megumi at all (she went to New York for a couple months (4?) to
work on a film project (an &quot;American drama&quot; they say in Japan).  Anyway, I told her a bit
about my recent concerns with Ami, and we were both essentially like, &quot;へーーー&quot; and
&quot;なるほどー&quot; (not sure how to spell the ending of that one for sure), though we did it all
in English.  I was happy to hear some of her recent stories as well.</p>

<p>We chatted some about our PB connection (though we didn't sail together, we're in the same family
of friends) including a couple of our favorites, Levi with lovely blue eyes, and Rei, over whom I
required a long time to get.</p>

<p>I quite enjoyed when Megumi asked genuinely, &quot;is there anything else?&quot; when I told her a bit
of my sadness / confuzion (regarding Ami), with no expectation of a yes nor no.</p>

<p>Before the show, I invited Derrick to join us for the show, and was essentially happy to honor
that invite when he came down to say HI, though naturally the nature of the conversation
changed.  Megumi hopped up from my left to give Derrick a hug, and sat down on my right so we could
make a Megumi sandwich for the duration of the show.</p>

<p>The show was comedy, and improv, and funny in several more places than it might have been had I
been playing all the roles on stage.  Basically five guys (including David from The Pink Cow) played
several improv games, including freeze (which I know as &quot;improv tag&quot;). (I was hoping stage
two would involve people from the audience being invited to join. (Though I know that wouldn't work
*at all* in Japan, I thought it might at Za Cow, but apparently not.))</p>

<p>Other games were similar overall: give us a relationship / location / color / famous person /
murder weapon / household item / first name / etc, and then a rule or two for the game itself.</p>

<p>One game was an alphabet game, where each line had to begin with the next letter of the English
alphabet.  Man...  Fred and I would have <em>ruled</em> at that, and I so so wish he coulda been
there.  I asked about the next planned comedy night, but it won't be until Fred's back in the US
getting over jet lag, and I'm back in Kagoshima getting poked and prodded for cash.</p>

<p>A couple of the alphabet game lines were flubbed. K after I, W after U..  I was the first to
&quot;ブー!&quot; them (same spelling as &quot;boo&quot; but it's not a descending tone
&quot;boo&quot; as in &quot;you suck!&quot; but a flat tone &quot;boo&quot; as in the onomatopoeia
of a buzzer).</p>

<p>I was the first to volunteer when they needed a volunteer from the audience.  My job was to give
lines to a player on stage when he tapped my shoulder.  I kept my lines appropriate for the skit at
hand, but I wonder how things might have progressed had I tossed out random lines..  Would it have
been funnier?  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Megumi also starred on stage (during the second half of the show).  She was 1/3 of a slide show,
where each slide had three people in it.  Dave (not David, who was also in the slides) who I know
from vegan night, was the guest star comedian/actor.  He played a Russian scientist, using funny
English like, &quot;when the Soviet Union fell down, ...&quot; and the topic was toenails.  The
slides were all similar at first, but then he was like, &quot;yes yes, but this next slide will blow
you away, you'll think, <em>how did they do that?</em> and <em>why would a man put himself in such a
way?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>I took several pictures which Megumi asked me to delete, though I haven't yet.</p>

<p>Ami arrived after the show finished; we chatted a bit, and then headed home.  I'm being quick
here cause I gotta board my plane.</p>
