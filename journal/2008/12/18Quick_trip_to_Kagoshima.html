<p>Sitting next to a guy named John who's &quot;done a lot of these,&quot; though not in the past
couple of years.  I surmised then that he's been in Japan for a while.  Yep.  10 years.</p>

<p>Now chillin' in the clinic.  But now have finished the blood sample, EKG, urine sample, and have
money in hand.  Not much, but enough for a week of food.</p>

<p>Interesting that while we were waiting, I decided to do a bit of meditation just as a guy was
like, &quot;so, __opening question__, oh were you meditating?&quot; and then he and another guy were
asking questions of me about meditation.  Hmm.</p>
