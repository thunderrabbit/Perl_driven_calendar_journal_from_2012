<p class="dream">Cold in bed, so trying to get organized with the puppy to keep us warm.  Puppy was
a long daschound maybe four feet long and a foot in diameter.</p>

<p>when I woke up from that dream, the emotional feeling was quite gentl and lovely.  I didn't want
to get out of bed.  I adjested my covers a bit and went back to sleep, despite having noticed that
I forgot to brush my teeth last night.</p>

<p class="dream">Just finished with work,  in a new part of the city.  I  was outide with papers
all around; my work mates had just left sortof surprisingly, I was suddenly free to do whatever.
Still had papers on the grud, but I called Sarah from Perth and was like, &quot;where are you
guys?&quot; and wanted to meet up with whoever she was with.  Actually I just wanted to meet up
with her, but she's a social animal, always with people around.</p>
