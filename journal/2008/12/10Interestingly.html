<p>Though I stayed up with FFS and 4chan/hc until 2.5am, and I already have a seat on the train
headed back to work after Ami called me just a bit after 9am because I didn't return her 12:29am
phone call back to me last night when I noticed it at 1:15am, I feel rather genki, connected to my
higher self, and quite gently walking with the crowds of people, whereas usually little intrusions
in my fast-walking course rile me up.</p>

<p>(hahaha that sentence took me fully 10 minutes to write.)</p>

<p class="date">10:02am JST</p>

<p>I just tweaked two instances of &quot;to be&quot; to make the sentence an example of
e-prime.</p>

<p>When I noticed that Ami had called me 11 minutes after I had called her to say お疲れさまです！こ
れから帰ります。, I guessed her call came while I gently discouraged the woman from leading me back
to a love hotel.</p>

<p>I took a shower last night, so this morning I skipped it, didn't even put on my contacts, and
just grabbed the last bowl of stew Ami cooked on Sunday for my brunchfest at work.</p>

<p>I'm down to dregs for clothes, so I'm wearing Ami's sweatpants as underwear, my same socks from
yesterday, and my G hoodie (ひさしぶり！) because my Indigo Thirty hoodie has gotten a bit stinky.</p> 

<p>Aight; the train has arrived in Shibs; headed to work now, with the intention of gently engaging
the crowds.</p>

<p class="date">10:39am JST</p>

<p>Perfect!  At work now, chewing a spinach cheese corn bun thing from the French bakery, ready to
go.</p>
