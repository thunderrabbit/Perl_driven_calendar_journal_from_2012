<p class="dream">In a building, in which a war was being planned, we good guys were building our
own economy and resources of art and paper.  People were all pitching in, and I was in some sort of
leadership position, but at the same time encouraging others to find their own soverignity.  In the
room, we were safe, and the doors on each side sometimes had activity behind them, but we didn't
always know who was there.  Good guys or bad guys were equally likely.</p>

<p class="dream">In a war battlefield, though it was a forest not a field, and the hull of a burning
jet had just crashed through the trees and to the ground next to me.  The tree through which it had
come started to burn, but stayed upright, and then caught the nearby trees on fire as well, filling
the forest with smoke.</p>

<p class="dream">In trying to escape the smoke, I went down the hill and came to a road, where I
dared not show myself, so I backed up to the edge of a clearing where the bad guys were there with
guns and one of them saw me.  He said sneeringly, &quot;well there's the piano man,&quot; and
pointed his rifle at me.  He missed the first time and I tried to scramble away backwards, and he
kept shooting and I realized I should be able to fly, but wasn't able to as I woke up.</p>
