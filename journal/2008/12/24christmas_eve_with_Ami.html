<p>After work yesterday, I met Ami under the giant spider statue in Ï»ËÜÌÚ and we went to one of
her favorite local restaurants, a pizza place where we chowed a yummy yummy yummy yummy four cheese
pizza!  Its crust didn't compared to Star Pizza in Houston, but I certainly enjoyed the cheeeeesie
cheese.  Wow!</p>

<p>After that, we successfully navigated past all the club owners who were ushering people into
their clubs on our way to ¥É¥ó¥­¡¼, where I wanted to buy toothpicks for Marble Track 3.  For MT3 I
ended up with toothpicks and some little bamboo skewers.  For my teeth I got some new brushes for my
electric tooth brush (a damn ripoff, though: $20 for two (plus a ton of damn packaging), whereas the
brush itself is sold for $19, including one brush) (Ami tried to explain the cost in terms of the
company not making much money cause they won't sell a lot of the electric parts compared to the
brushes.  But can't the brushes be the same price as a toothbrush?  Yeah it's got a moving head and
stuff, but I can't see that it costs more than about 20 cents to make one.)</p>

<p>Ahem, anyway, also got some chapstick which was in a more appropriate price range.</p>

<p>Headed home on ÆüÈæÃ« line to ÃæÌÜ¹õ and then my line to ¸µ½»µÈ.  Ami walked home with me and
had a last adventure before Fred arrives (and then I'll be in Kagoshima), but I'm sure we'll sort
out a time or two to interact.</p>

<p>Because her bike was still at Ê¿´Ö station, she had to walk there.  I surprised her at the top of
the hill over the tracks with TJ Bike, ready to roll her quickly down the hill and to her bike
area.  &quot;Merry Christmas, °¡Èþ¤Á!  This is your first present.&quot;  and then somehow we
worked out that it was her third present.  Me riding to get her, a couple of smooches at the top of
the hill, and then giving her a ride to the station, were 1, 2 and 3, respectively.</p>

<p>At the bike area, we both wanted the other to leave first (I honestly don't give a rat's ass, but
it's fun to try to make her go first).. so that was her fourth present: that I left first.</p>
