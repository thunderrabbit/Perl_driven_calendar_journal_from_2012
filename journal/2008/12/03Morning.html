<p><em>Just</em> missed the 10:03am train leaving ¸µ½»µÈ, which kinda sucks because, even though
I'm 8 minutes earlier than normal, those eight minutes are all-but wasted waiting for the next
train that goes straight to ½ÂÃ«.  BUT, I am able to take the next train that leaves the station
(ÆüÈæÃ«Àþ) and get an express train to ½ÂÃ« that I normally wouldn't be able to get, so I'll be a
bit earlier than normal, but won't get to sit down all the way there (just 80% of the way).</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>I left work late last night, and actually went directly to bed.  No FFS, no journal, no email,
nothing except floss and brush teeth and meditate and sleep.  I'll write about the meditation now
(in an entry that will be appear on yesterday's journal list).</p>

<p>This morning I did another almost 20 minutes' meditation (like 16 minutes) before I couldn't
stand any more.  I went through four mini-lessons (10 words, some repeated)
in <a href="http://iknow.co.jp">iknow.co.jp</a> and chatted a bit with Colleen, who may be headed
out to another oil rig tomorrow.  I painted on her painting about 15 minutes as well.</p>

<p>ÃæÌÜ¹õ now; I gotta change trains.</p>

<p>this is a reminder to write about work yesterday.</p>
