<p class="note">(written 10:11am JST Wednesday  3 December 2008 (day 14133))</p>

<p>Meditation last night seemed to bring a unique experience.  In the past I have found a way of
quieting my brain that feels a bit like relaxing the muscles in my temples and then all thoughts
cease.  If I focus on keeping my temples relaxed, I can detect and release thoughts before they
fully manifest into some focus-grabbing thoughts or images.</p>

<p>Recently, while reading _Eat, Love, Pray_, in the part about &quot;give your mind pure
love,&quot; I tried this, and the same relaxed feeling resulted.  Basically like &quot;oh, another
way to say what I'm doing with this temple relaxation is giving my mind pure love.&quot;</p>

<p>maybe</p>

<p>But, in any case, it seems to work, and last night as I focused on the idea of giving my brain
pure love, I felt the relaxation <em>and</em> a bit of a deeper relaxation, like my muscles were
happy to slide off my face if only my skin would let them, or perhaps my consciousness could just
fly away if only I could release the thought that I need to find some way to do this.</p>

<p>I was nearly able to maintain this state of awareness for the fully twenty minutes I had planned
to meditate, and then I began to get some visual images that I previously have associated with
&quot;dreaming,&quot; and more recently have noticed corresponded with my 'forgetting' my
meditative consciousness, but last night were nearly visible *while* I was aware of my meditative
consciousness.  Sortof a forget-see-images-remember-images-go-fuzzy, like if I tried to look at
them they became fuzzy, but if I just experienced them, they were clear.</p>

<p>Sumpin' like that.</p>

<p>Then by the time 20 minutes was up I was flat ready to zonk out.  I lay down and was surprised
that I couldn't bring up the temple-relaxation/love/consciousness at all.  Just awake or zzzz.</p>
