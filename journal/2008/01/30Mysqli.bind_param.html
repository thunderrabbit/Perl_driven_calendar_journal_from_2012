<p>Hmmm.  Strange problem with mysqli->bind_param().</p>

<p>Sweet.  I figured it out.  Not just now, though; I figured it out some hours ago, went off to
watch some of the guys play Grand Theft Auto, called Ami, and came back to ctbriefs...  On the
development server, it can display a LHS box with spaces for ratings and delete buttons as needed
depending on whose theory it is compared to the logged in user.</p>

<p>I was just looking at the code I wrote to do that, and bit the inside of my cheek.  I must be
pretty tired...</p>
