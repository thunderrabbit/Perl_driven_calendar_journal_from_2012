<p>And my reply:</p>

To: Dude

The most incredible quote on the page:

"Only after the evacuation did the heat melt the new steel away."

The evacuation would have taken at least 5 minutes.  However, the
fireball from the officially released Pentagon tape lasts 5 seconds.
 How much new steel are they talking about?  For steel to "melt away"
would require a lot of heat.

There are reports that they couldn't get near the site for an hour due
to intense heat, but there are clearly pictures of firetrucks close to
the site before the wall collapsed.

The "evidence" that snopes gives is all computer created graphics.  Or
saying "we can't see anything cause it's obscured by smoke / water."

Dude, you always aks "where's the evidence?" when people make
outrageous claims.  So I'm aksing you, where's the evidence that a 757
hit the building?   757 wings don't fold back nor vanish.

Why won't the pentagon release the tapes they confiscated?

<p>I seriously can't believe he believes the disinformation on this.</p>

<p>Dude's reply:</p>

<pre>
I am not certain that tapes were confiscated.  I have heard this claim, but I know that I saw
footage of the plane hiiting the pentagon on 911 or 912.  The footage that I saw was from a bank
drive-through that happenecd to capture the plane flying because the plane flew so low.
 
>>where's the evidence that a 757
there was a photo on that page of a part of the plane on the ground at the pentagon.
 
I agree that evidence is importnat, so I will ask you: where is the evidence that it was something
other than a plane?  Note that I am not asking for evidence that its *not a plane*.  I would like to
see specific evidence of what it was.  ie: a photograph of a missile (or something else),
eye-witness account of someone saying they saw a missle (or something else), etc.  I remember seeing
interviews on 911 of people who were standing nearby and saw the plane.  Not one of them said it was
anything other than a plane.
 
here are 3 questions that keep me from saying it was something other than a plane:
 
1.  It is easy to say "It wasn't a plane", but if it was not, then what was it? ...and where is the
positive evidence of such a claim (positive evidence, such as "they found explosive material at the
pentagon" [or whatever the evidence is], not stuff like "planes don't do X").
 
2.  one reason for saying that there was no plane is that there is little or no debris (despite the
photogrpah) at the crash scene.  However, we all have seen the footage of the planes hitting the WTC
yet there is no debris left over from those crashes.
 
3.  how does one account for the interviews and footage that I saw immeditaley after 911?  I know
what I saw/heard.  also, there were litterally thousands of people who saw the plane flying low
through the city on that day and the media outlets were combing the city trying to get eye-witness
accounts.  Why were there not dozens and dozens of people coming out of the wood work to say it was
something other than a plane?  I understand that theer are some people who have come forth
afterwards, but why not on that day?  the FBI/NSA/CIA could not have contacted every one of the
interviewess and told them what to say.  its impossible because there were thousands of people in
the street, looking out office windows, in cars, walking, riding bikes, jogging.  ...and they all
saw a plane flying 200ft above the ground.  that is something you'd notice!!
 
lastly, in doing a tiny bit of research, I googled for that pic of the pentagon where the plane
crashed.  I thought that the dark spot on the right was where the engine went through the wall, so I
started looking for a better pic.  During my search, I found two conspiracy theory sites that
suggested that it was not a hole, but was "just soot".  I kept looking and found this pic that
CLEARLY shows that it is a burned up tree!!!  here:
<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/DODCMSShare/NewsPhoto/2001-09/010914-F-8006R-002.jpg">http://www.defenselink.mil/DODCMSShare/NewsPhoto/2001-09/010914-F-8006R-002.jpg</a>

To me, if these people are not even willing to do the slightest research to actually find out what
that dark spot is before calling it "just soot", then how can they be trusted?
