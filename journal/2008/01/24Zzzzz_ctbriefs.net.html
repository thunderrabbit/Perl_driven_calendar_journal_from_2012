<p>Man.  That G2 code is spacey.  So many layers of abstraction I can't begin to use it.
Fortunately, as I was looking at the code we use at blosta, I thought to look up the php docs for
some of the functions, and I came across mysqli, which my PHP install happens to include.  Sweet.
I'll be using that fo' sho'.</p>

<p>Bedtime now: intravenous catheter at 6am tomorrow.</p>
