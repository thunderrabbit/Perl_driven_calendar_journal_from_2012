<p>Got a cute email from janette once I got home this morning, commenting on my <a href="/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=all&date=2008/01/07#ISIS">coversation with my
god</a>:</p>

<pre>
isn't it funny that god has your same sense of humor?
:~)
</pre>

<p>I wanted to really talk to her about the conversation with my girl last night, but I just made a
passing reference to the mysterious future.</p>

<pre>
Haha yes; She's a real riot!

I'm hoping, however, that you will enjoy my sense of humor in the next
couple of days.
</pre>

<p>Plus a little bonus of my recent janette-related news:</p>

<pre>
I finally (!) stitched up three (3) spots on my lovely lovely quilt.
This was in preparation for meditation workshop this weekend.  I took
the quilt to the Awakening the Third Eye two day workshop, and the
next day went back for the above mentioned ISIS thing.  Good stuff.

Hopefully I'll be taking lessons in Reiki starting this month or so.
Definitely by next month.

It's 2am here; I would write more, but I'm too tired to get it
straight.  In the end, I think of you often.

   Love Love
    - Rob!
