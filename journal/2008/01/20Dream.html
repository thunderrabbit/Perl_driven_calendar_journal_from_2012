<p class="dream">In a university dorm housing, with some of my youth from YRUU who were doing
extended school programs.  Like they had finished university but had only done one quarter of their
total studies.</p>

<p>I seem to have dreams of university probably every night.  Always a different situation,
different buildings, different people, sometimes KTRU, sometimes registration... actually maybe
often times registration..  And now, I'm suddenly wondering, &quot;perhaps this is my angels' way
of telling me to go back to school.&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, angels; I'm finally listening.  Can you be a bit more specific?  Which school? what
studies? which language? that kind of thing.</p>
