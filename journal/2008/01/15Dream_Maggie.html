<p class="dream">Alone at Maggie's house, using her Macintosh.  I noticed the machine seemed quite
modern, but it was connected only to a tiny little computer screen.  I wiggled the mouse around the
screen a bit and then later noticed that two TVs had turned on next to the computer screen.  The
computer was outputting to those screens as well!  I moved the mouse further toward the right and found
that ctually, I could wrap around the entire room with all the computer screens turning on on on on
one after another.</p>

<p class="dream">Except for one particular screen; it stayed on as a TV, emitting something from
the media giants.</p>

<p class="dream">Maggie came home and I was delighted to share with her the story above and we
laughed and laughed.</p>

<p class="dream">The scene switched so that I was in a government type clinic type place in Japan
and some guy was trying to get an alien registration card but didn't know where to go.  I helped
him get sorted and that was good, but then I noticed that I hadn't spent proper quality time with
Maggie and I felt so so sad.</p>

<p>Huge hugs and love to Maggie and Jane and Bill and Molly and Will and Anna and Rachel and
everyone I've ever known and don't yet know, etc.</p>
