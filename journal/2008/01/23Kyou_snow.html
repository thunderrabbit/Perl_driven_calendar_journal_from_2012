<p>It's snowing today here in Tokyo.  Just enough to stick to non-concrete surfaces.  But it's not
all that cold; I still wore my sandals.</p>

<p>Aw dang..  I had thought of several puns on this, but not an obvious one that Doug has as his
status:</p>

<pre>Snow-kyo</pre>

<p>(for the record, this entry is &quot;Kyou snow,&quot; where &quot;Kyou&quot; is for º£Æü, or
today, but Snow-kyo is better.)</p>
