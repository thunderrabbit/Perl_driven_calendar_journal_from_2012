<p>Last night up until 2am; way later than I wanted.  Ami happened to be in Nakameguro when I
finally headed home around 10.5pm, so I stopped by the bar (her friend Lupan's) where she was
chillin'.  Told her about the email from and to Nat and didn't quite get the response I had
predicted.</p>

<p>Ami seemed to see it as the end of our relationship because I fall in love with girls all the
time (and back out just as quickly).  Basically Ami was like, &quot;I'll be worried for the 3
months that you're gone.&quot;</p>

<p>I had (though couldn't necessarily explain) several responses:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>don't worry; be happy</p></li>

<li><p>I don't even know if I'll be accepted</p></li>

<li><p>the voyage wouldn't be until a year from now</p></li>

<li><p>I can stay faithful to you for the 3.5 months.</p></li>

<li><p>I want you to want me to chase my dreams</p></li>

<li><p>all we have is *now*; so be happy now.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It took 2.5 hours to go through the process, most of which was done standing by her bicycle near
Hirama station, after which my right knee was a bit stiff and felt swollen on the inside, but I
couldn't feel anything weird on the outside.</p>
