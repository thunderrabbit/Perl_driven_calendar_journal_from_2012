<p>Man this is weak.  I can't figure out where is the &quot;proper&quot; place to make changes to
the main menu on my new website featuring FreakAuthLight on code_igniter.</p>

<p>The documentation is full of misspellings and doesn't really make a lot of sense to me.  Gah.  I
may have to ditch it and find a different PHP framework.</p>
