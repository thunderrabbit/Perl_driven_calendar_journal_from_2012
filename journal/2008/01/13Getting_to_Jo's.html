<p>Ami woke me up with a bit of a start at 11:30 or so; I dunno if I woulda woken up on my own (with
my angels' help), but Ami was my angel this morning.</p>

<p>Ami heated last night's stew for my breakfast while I took a shower.  Got back upstairs and Ami
was looking for her pills; she said she took them the night before, but then they just seemed to
have vanished; we nearly took the room apart looking for them.</p>

<p>I headed out to Jo's a bit later than I had planned; I got semi-stuck on email (got a reply from
Peter of <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com">Zeitgeist</a> and I was going to reply when I realized
the time.  Zoomed out and perfectly arrived at the bus stop as the bus was arriving (this is as rare
as it seems it might be; the window of opportunity is like a minute (though today it was down to
perfect, like I didn't run, didn't wait; just walked and got onto the bus as the door was opened for
me walking on just after the girl who had been waiting for the bus to come.</p>

<p>Anyway, this got me back on time to meet Jo and I made it up to Ikebukuro and checked my computer
to see which line to take next.  Shizah, I had effectively closed the window by replying to Jo that
I could bring headphones, so the previous message from him had scrolled up so it would require an
HTTP request to view it.  No free internet signal = no directions.  Dang.</p>

<p>I was able to find the destination station on a different window, so I got the correct line, but
I still didn't have directions from the station.  Called Ami, and blessedly, she was able to log in
as me on gmail (my password is not trivial) and forward the directions to my phone.  I'm debating
changing my gmail password now.</p>

<p>(( Oh stupid me; I could have used my phone to log in to gmail.  idiot.  Ah well. ))</p>

<p>Got to his house 20 minutes ahead of time and was a bit hungry so I walked to the nearest
convenience store and got some fruit jello type stuff.</p>

<p>Joked a bit with the counter girl by pretending to throw the jello thing to her.  It's about the
size of a raquet ball; I said, &quot;大手玉&quot; (juggling ball).</p>

<p>As per normal, I requested no bag, and surprisingly, she understood immediately (I usually have
to ask twice (or three times)) and said thank you.  Then she went to get a spoon for me and then
stopped herself; &quot;あっいらない、ね。&quot; (oh, you [therefore] don't need [a spoon]).</p>

<p>Actually, I was counting on a spoon since I don't have one with me (though sometimes I do)..  But
I took this as a blessing from my angels, <em>encouraging</em> me to slurpily suck the jello out of
the dish.  Awesome.  This I did happily and arrived back at Jo's with 12 minutes to spare.</p>
