<p>Via <a href="http://bookcrossing.com/friend/thunderrabbit">bookcrossing.com</a> I got a message
from a woman(?) named Chandanie from Sri Lanka.</p>

Hello thunderrabbit,

My name is Chandanie and I'm writing you from Sri Lanka to ask if you might, please, be willing to
send me your copy of this <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/5678711">Bill Bryson book</a>??

I love his books but they aren't available here so if you would send it to
me I would really, really  appreciate it.

If you are willing, please let me know and I'll send you my address.

Hope to hear from you soon. Have a nice day!

Cheers,
Chandanie

<p>Cool; this will be a good way to reduce the number of books I have laying around my apartment.</p>
