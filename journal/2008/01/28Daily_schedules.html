<p>The busy day (Friday) and not as busy day (Saturday) and not particularly busy day (Sunday) have
each gone to memoryland.  This is our daily schedule for today through Wednesday:</p>

<p>7:00 wake up (optional)</p>

<p>9:00 prohibition of water consumption (until 11am)</p>

<p>10:05 (*) Blood sampling and vital signs measurement, after which we go to drug administration
room and sit across the table from the pharmacist</p>

<p>10:09 (*) pharmacist opens the numbered vial (my number is 2127) comes to my side and gives it to
me at 10:09:20 (*), saying &quot;please wait.&quot;</p>

<p>10:10 (*) drug administration, followed by 200 ml water, then open mouth to prove consumption.</p>

<p>11:10 (*) breakfast, plus we can now drink all the water we want until 9am</p>

<p>14:10 (*) blood sampling</p>

<p>20:00 dinner</p>

<p>22:00 lights out (for the room, but we each have a bed lamp)</p>

<p>(*) these times are for me and a guy named Brady.  Everyone else's times are different by
multiples of five minutes.</p>

<p>No other food is allowed, and no exercise.  But plenty of reading, computering, video gaming,
wandering, and sleeping.</p>

<p class="date">10:34am JST</p>

<p>I just took pics of the four pages comprising our schedules.  I'll post them.....  after I
finish allowing ctbriefs.net theories to be saved.</p>
