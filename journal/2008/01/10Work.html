<p>Finished fixing a couple of changes that should have been fixed before, but no one had noticed
them during the initial project specs.  I fixed those, and then I remembered I needed to copy the
production server info to the test server because someone (probably sitting across from me now)
wrote changes directly to the production server.  Gah.</p>

<p>Going over the specs for the new project with ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó and it turns out we had some pretty
different visions of how this would work.  They were going to give a one time bonus, and I was
thinking it would be a recurring bonus.  Both ideas have merit, so there will be a meeting tomorrow
to choose the winner.</p>

<p>Actually I'm the winner cause I can just read comics and work on my new program ideas until the
answer is decided.</p>
