<p class="dream">At y dad's house, at a dining room table near the kitchen (actually in the game
room) with a Japanese yamamba girl to my right who had just happened to sit there.  I didn't want to
dissuade her nor openly attract her, but I was happy to share food with her.  I noticed behind me,
Wende was standing against the door frame, watching without comment.  I was like, &quot;eep&quot;
and didn't know if / what she had seen, but she acted like she saw nothing.</p>

<p class="dream">On the large TV screen in front of us, someone threw a frisbee, which I caught, but
the new girl did not notice even though the disc had almost hit her.</p>

<p class="dream">Later, I tried to apologize to Wende, but she was like, &quot;no, *she* is your
new girlfriend now.&quot;</p>
