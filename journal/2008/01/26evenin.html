<p>I wrote this little
<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Passwords">thing on passwords</a>, basically so I could upload the
pic and get it off my machine.</p>

alt="note to Tsunashimasan" /></a><br/>Now, this is a bit embarrassing in a way for me to
show; I guess it's cause I feel a bit uncomfortable with the high level of たってまえ that seems to
be poured through the email.  Plus the Japanese is pretty bad.  BUT, I just want to capture this
note I wrote to Tsunashimasan (not his actual name, but it's my nickname for him) at my favorite
Lawson's.<br/><br/>I had written it to him with gmail, but his phone couldn't read the characters, so I made a
screenshot and sent him that, which he was able to read on his phone.</td>

This happened when I tried to install a pane from myPhoto.  Even though I've got this picture in an
directory called osx, I don't really think it's the fault of the OS as much as the software running
on it.</td>

Sometimes that's too much going on for its own good.</td>

bit further off than they look!</td>

alt="bookcrossing bad UI" /></a><br/>As I'm already a member of bookcrossing, it's not easy to click on a link sent by someone and create
a new journal entry for that book under my existing username.  But it's pretty difficult to explain,
so I bet it's quite rare.</td>

of <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion's documentation</a>.  It's on version 2866 as I
post this.</td>

<p>Today, in addition to uploading the pics above, I added the ability to search by けいたいアドレス on
bloggerstation.</p>

<p>I wanted to get ctbriefs to allow creation of theories, but maybe tomorrow or Monday.</p>

<p>Okay, bedtime.</p>

<p>Wait, actually time for an episode of Family Guy I got today.</p>

<p class="date">12:56am JST</p>

<p>Hahaha; yeah that was funny.  I think my favorite part was the Red team checking in.  Or maybe
that was just the most recent funny part so the one I remember best.  I did laugh several times.</p>

<p>Finished just in time for 1am blood letting.</p>
