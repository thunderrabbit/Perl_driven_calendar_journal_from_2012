<p>Ami slept until fully 4pm or so today.  I was a bit suprised, and began to guess that she was a
bit depressed or some such.  Any time she seemed to stir, I directed some outward attention her way,
&quot;good morning&quot; in Japanese or settling down on the covers next to her or on her.</p>

<p>She didn't really respond, and I kept careful notice of my emotions; part of me wanted her to be
元気 happy and thought about getting mad/sad/defensive when she wasn't.  I released this need to
react and just pet her like a big sleeping bear.</p>

<p>After she became a bit more conscious, I asked if she wanted to eat or talk or be left alone or
what.  No to all of the above, and eventually I asked if she wanted to go for a walk.  I certainly
wanted to escape this room, and do so before it got dark.</p>

<p>She perked up at this idea, so we headed out within a few minutes.</p>

<p>Hand in hand toward the bridge leading over the tracks to her house, but directly to the fence
next to the tracks and not over the bridge.  Turned right and then right again and then left and
over the mini river. (She wasn't willing to climb down into it, perceiving it as dirty even though
it's paved and dry.  I see it like most young boys might, a place we are obligated to walk on
occasion.)  We found a parking &quot;garage&quot; after a bit and *did* go to the upper level (only 2 levels)
and walked around a bit.  She made a game of walking only on the braces holding up the second
level, which I certainly appreciated and supported as soon as I noticed.</p>

<p>On the way down the ramp of the parking structure, she asked if I was getting hungry.
Definitely.  We found the next main road that was big enough to cross the tracks, and we crossed the
tracks, whereupon I noted with happy anticipation a かいてんずし restaurant.  Awesome. (*)</p>

<p>While we waited for our turn to chow sushi, the answer came.  She asked politely if she could
make a request, then took about a minute to formulate her request: when we are together, pay more
attention to Ami than to my computer.</p>

<p>&quot;Easier done than said, Frog!&quot;</p>

<p>We ate and headed back to my crib by way of the conveni next to 平間 station to get snacks (ice
cream for me, and in a rare display, ice cream for her as well), and then chowed and enjoyed an
after dinner romp and nap.</p>
