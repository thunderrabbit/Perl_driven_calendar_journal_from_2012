<p>I've just been snoozing / meditating / dreaming while listening
to <a href="http://remix.nin.com">remix.nin.com</a>.</p>

<p class="dream">I finally decided I should sleep, so I looked for a way to turn the device OFF.  I
found what I thought was the switch and clicked it, and the animations stopped, but the music kept
playing.  Then I realized the device I had ws actually two units connected by a simple sliding
together interface.  One was the portable music player (actually about the size of a CD Walkman,
and the other was the connection to the internet.  Holy moly!  That is so cool!!  I looked at how
the inteface worked; as I pressed the units together, two phone wires would extend out from the
player side and connect with the internet connection side of the device.  The inteface was actually quite complex to do all
that, but worked flawlessly each time.</p>

<p>I realized a bit later that in a different reality, I was still able to hear the music because I
was listening to it on &quot;headphones.&quot;  They connect with a simple connector (not as cool,
but equally flawless in operation) to my internet side, a &quot;laptop.&quot;  The only bad thing
about <em>this</em> system is that the headphones don't download the music.  I call dibs on this idea!!!
I'll email it to myself and see if that works as a patent protection.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.   <a href="http://remix.nin.com">remix.nin.com</a> is really
sweet.  I think this kind of mass collaboration has a definite place in the <b>evolvernet</b>.  I call
dibs on this word!!!</p></p>
