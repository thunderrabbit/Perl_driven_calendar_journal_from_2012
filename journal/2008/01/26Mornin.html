<p>I'm not really sure why I haven't written yet today; I've been on my computer a lot.</p>

<p>Mostly doing shtuff for work, still trying to get the SQL queries set up the way I want.  For now
I have given up on that part and will try to do the next / different part, of allowing admin to
email to user's cellphones and not just to pc mail addresses.</p>
