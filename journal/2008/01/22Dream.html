<p class="dream">I just got onto the public transportation and realized I hadn't brought my
Ami-made lunch <b>again</b>.  I was quite bummed because in C1 reality, I hadn't brought it
yesterday either.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;oh, how much time do we have?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And before my friend could answer, the bus doors closed.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;not much&quot;</p>

<p>I was really happy to wake up and realize I still had a chance to remember it!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>for the record, my Ami-made lunch is sitting on my back pack, so I'm quite unlikely to forget
it.</p>
