<p>The doctor came around to insert the catheter; I recognized his technique as he was tapping on
the vein near my wrist.  Dang.  I had wanted the nurse whose technique is much less painful than
the doctor, but he, the nurse, was just for prep today, and fortunately the doctor wasn't as
painful this time as the first time.</p>
