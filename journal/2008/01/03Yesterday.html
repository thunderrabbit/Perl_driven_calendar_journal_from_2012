<p class="date">2:11pm JST Friday  4 January 2008 (day 13799)</p>

<p>Spent most of yesterday at Ami's house, semi helping her clean up the place after our days of
chillin'.</p>

<p>I got sick of my computer and slept a lot.  I think I slept from 7am to noon, and then another
nap during the day and then when we got home, we went to sleep pretty quickly.</p>
