<p>On Friday I did literally nothing work related while at work.  I had finished all of my part; I
needed to get some translations done for the Japanese content, and I simply didn't ask 中谷さん for
help.  Instead I just scooped up loads of free internet.  I worked on ctbriefs.net, my nin remix,
and other stuff I don't recall at the moment.</p>

<p>Today I've actually done some work related stuff, including getting 中谷さん to do the
translations.  Now I'm about to look for a way to present a list in columns instead of just one
list.  HTML is well suited for listing items across:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><td>00</td>
<td>01</td>
<td>02</td>
<td>03</td>
<td>04</td></tr>
<tr><td>05</td>
<td>06</td>
<td>07</td>
<td>08</td>
<td>09</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>14</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>19</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>23</td>
<td>24</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td>
<td>26</td>
<td>27</td>
<td>28</td>
<td>29</td></tr>
</table>

<p>but not going down first.</p>

<p>I gave up trying to figure out how to do that; the need is very slight in that it hasn't been
requested by anyone but me, and it's only for the few users who will have a bunch of friends
joining them on the site, which as of now is zero.</p>

<p>Mostly today I got ctbriefs.net to allow logins via openID, so I'm pretty much thrilled with
that.  Tomorrow I might refigure out how to set up a new SVN repository; I did it easily enough for
the first version of ctbriefs which used codeigniter, but I'm not using that code for this
version.  Even though it's pretty dope, I couldn't get the hang of it so I'm giving up.</p>

<p>Dang, that sounds dumb, or old-man-ish, but it's basically the truth.  I can revisit it for
the <em>next</em> version of  ctbriefs.net, if ever I make one.</p>

<p>If ever I finish this one.</p>
