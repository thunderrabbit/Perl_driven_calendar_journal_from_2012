<p>Now theories can be saved, but only on my test server.  I'll move it online after I fix a couple
of problems: the UI displays the (non functional) new theory form if the user is not logged in, and
after they are logged in, it leaves the user guessing what happened when it saves.</p>

<p>Okay, though no one else has logged in, theories can now be saved.  They can't be viewed (beyond
[Preview] when creating them, but they will be saved to the DB.</p>

<p>I'll work on displaying theories tomorrow.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://ctbriefs.net/">ctbriefs.net</a>, state your theory and sit down.</p>
