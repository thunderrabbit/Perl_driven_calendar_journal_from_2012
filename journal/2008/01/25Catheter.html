<p>One dude (John, who gave me a copy of Futurama movie) suddenly stared snoring hardcore like
middle of the night ZZZZZZ ZZZZZZ like crazy.  The explanation was that as the catheter went in, the
brain is like, &quot;uh-oh, ou bloode pressure is too high,&quot; and turns the blood pressure down,
decreasing oxygen and zonk out into ZZZZZ land.</p>

<p>Before five thirty AM I woke up and could only remember that I had two dreams.  After one, I woke
up as from a bit of a surprise, and could only remember the last snippet of a scene, but then
remembered </p>

<p class="dream">Fred and I were driving somewhere on a highway.</p>

<p>but I haven't remember past that, and now I don't remember the surprising scene.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At 5:30am, they woke us up and and advised that we go have a whiz.  I came back and the nurse put
a warm gel thing on my left arm.  Then after a bit of a rest while I tried to recall the dreams, a
lovely catheter was inserted.</p>

<p>In this ward room (pictures forthcoming), I'm in the third bed, so as they process all of us, I'm
the third in line (there are some other rooms and I don't know in which order they are processed
compared to this one).  John is about the third to last, so I was resting gently when suddenly he
started snoring and didn't even wake up for at least 2 snores when the nurse tried to rouse him.  By
the third snore the doctor and another nurse were attending, and he become conscious enough to say
he was okay.  Later, though, he said when he was first woken up he had no idea where he was.</p>

<p>Everyone else seems fine, and John seems as fine as anyone who has just been kicked out of a
chance to make $5000 in ten days of chillin' punctuated with needles and nurses.</p>
