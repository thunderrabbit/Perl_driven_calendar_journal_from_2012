<p>Ami and I went to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyuba">Lyuba</a> today.  Definitely
smaller than I had expected, but so was the price (only 800 yen).  The line was only a couple
minutes long.</p>

<p>Most people just breezed by the mammoth, which was displayed laying on its side at about a
45 degree angle in a freezer at -18C and visible behind two panes of glass, the inner of which
featured a sprinkling of dust.  The lighting was dim and a bit wonky; I had to block the light
coming up from the bottom of the tank so I could see vaguely properly.</p>

<p>But none of that is why I'm writing.</p>

<p>None of the staff could explain why there was a slice of skin flapping off the bottom of the
mammoth's back left foot.  The staff girl at first was like, &quot;oh, it's not cut,&quot; and then
when I had Ami spell it out, the girl was all, &quot;oh it must be from an animal back in the
day,&quot; and then I was like, &quot;no way&quot; because</p>

<ol>
<li>the wound looks white on the inside</li>
<li>the cut is perfectly smooth</li>
<li>the skin woulda been chewed off just like the ear and tail</li>
</ol>

<p>And then the girl was like, &quot;oh, it must have been an accident when they were transporting
it.&quot;</p>

<p>And I was thinking, &quot;have you seen wtf I am talking about???&quot;</p>

<p>An accident while transporting would be to break the trunk off.  Not to accidently get out a pen
knife and slice open the bottom of the foot!</p>

<p>In the articles I've read, I've seen a reference to a specimen of the mammoth being tested for
DNA clonability, so maybe it's from that.</p>

<p>I'm pretty anti-impressed that the girl wouldn't even come look to see what I was talking
about.</p>

<p>And dammit but we weren't allowed to take pictures, or I'd *definitely* have a picture up by
now, by golly.</p>
