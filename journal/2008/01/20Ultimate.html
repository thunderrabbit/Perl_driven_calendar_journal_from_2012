<p>Gennie with a G's last day at ultimate today.  I tossed with her a bit before the game started.
She told me she might get an internship at some sort of wildlife ranch in Texas.  She said there
would be rhinoceroses and ocelots.  I wondered about the plural for rhinoceros.</p>

<p>My dictionary says it's either of the two spellings above, but I would choose rhinoceren.</p>

<p>We had about 6 on 6 for most of the game, with a couple of subs.</p>

<p>Notably missing was everyone except Jei, Juri, Gennie, Canadian Mike, Shaggy, Myong Fa, Wakana, Aki,
Rob, the other Rob, Jeremy, Vince, Koki, Geoff, Doug, and I think that's it.   (feel free to
comment if not)</p>

<p>Wakana had some excellent blocks and fore arm tosses.  Gennie was not at the top of her game,
with higher percentage than usual drops and earthbound tosses.  I wasn't at the top of my game,
though I can't admit that I really tried; I enjoyed chatting with Mike, Doug, Jei, and Vince as we
covered each other.</p>

<p>I didn't know Shaggy drives such a huge motorcycle!</p>
