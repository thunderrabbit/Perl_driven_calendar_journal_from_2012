<p>My meditation group has just started their meeting without me.  I thought about calling them in
the shower but chose not to rush out.  I had remembered to call at 5:40 or so and then forgot
during the 6 o'clock hour.  That's when we're allowed to arrive (physically or by phone) and then
they started at 7pm.</p>

<p>I'm now going to meditate with them.  Just from over here.</p>
