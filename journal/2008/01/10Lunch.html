<p>Went to Akira's office for lunch.  He's the owner of several companies including the one that
owns the one that owns the one for which I work.  I'm not sure wtf he has done to do all that, but
he said he just started small.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Basically he said the most important thing for a new company is the team that will do it.  The
first thing is the idea, but the most important thing is the team.</p>

<p>He suggested I be thinking of ideas and we can make companies for them.</p>
