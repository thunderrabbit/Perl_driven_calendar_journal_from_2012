<p>Okay; I got a bit distracted on Wikipedia reading about my main man TNH, and then on wikibooks
reading the section on <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Formal_Logic/Preliminaries/Sets">Sets
in Formal_Logic</a>.  I remember most of this from Mr Reagh's class, I think.</p>

<p>Oh, so at work, I uploaded three sets (haha) of changes to the production server.  One was a
union of two sets of changes, with 6 and 8 changed files respectively, resulting in 10 files
uploaded.  The other set was a pair of files.  This was a quick and easy change: adding just a pair
of changes, where each change was a set of 5 lines of added code.</p>

<p>Then ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó gave me the outline of the next mission: allowing people to get credit for inviting
their friends.</p>
