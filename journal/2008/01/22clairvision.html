<p class="date">11:54pm JST Tuesday 22 January 2008 (day 13817)</p>

<p>Starting tonight, and for the next fie Tuesdays, I'll be attending a Clairvision style
meditation class aat Helma's place in Ootsuka.  Miya, omi, Kevin and I were there tonight.  I wo'nt
be there next week (due to Kagoshima).</p>

<p>We did a feedback session and I skipped all the third eye biznass and just started downloading
from wherever I've always downloaded spoken information.  Helma said later that it seemed right on,
but I didn't gt feedback from Miya at the time.  (nor yet, but)</p>

<p>Perhaps I'vebeen too tied to the idea of what the information is &quot;supposed&quot; to look
like.</p>

<p>Kevin said, &quot;yeah, it took me a long time to get past that.&quot;</p>

<p>That helps.</p>

<p>Also, I'm glad to be participating in a workshop with Kevin as a co-participant.</p>

<p>Kevin, Helma and I ate at the Indian restaurant after the session.  I could see this turning
into a pattern.</p>

<p>In fact, I'd be glad for that.</p>

<p>(( he says now ))</p>
