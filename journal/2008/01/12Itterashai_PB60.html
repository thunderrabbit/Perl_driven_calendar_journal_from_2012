<p>Ami and I are on the train headed back after waving bye to Topaz embarking on the 60th PB voyage
in the chilly nasty wet weather.  On the ship I saw Greg from 49th on his second voyage, but no one
else that I recognized, except I think 52nd cruise director Yuki gave the departure speech and 52nd
Ai did the translation.  Not sure though; I was too far away.</p>

<p>Took pics of signs blowing in the wind; I may have gotten a good shot or two.</p>

<p>Helped a guy on our side hold a sign as it slowly blew apart in the wind and rain.</p>

<p>After the ship was about 80 or 100 meters from the port, I heard a woman behind me saying
&quot;I can't see,&quot; to her husband, so I backed up and pulled her in.  I talked to her
husband, &quot;who is riding the ship?&quot;  He didn't say much, but did a gesture that I knew
meant his child.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;your kid?&quot;</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;life changing&quot; in English and then in messed up Japanese, &quot;a
different person will come back.&quot;</p>

<p>I wanted to say &quot;you're a good father,&quot; but I was about to cry and I'm guessing he was
too.</p>

<p>Rie from 49th and 52nd voyage saw me and said HI, along with her new husband Naoki (I think she
said); they got married on Sunday!  I couldn't remember her name for sure, but she was on both
voyages I was on and I chatted with her several several times during the voyages.</p>

<p>Saw a tall non Japanese guy next to two other non Japanese; I assumed they were previous
teachers, and I was 1/3rd right.  Jamie was on 58th voyage and his two friends were Gabe and
Natasha.  Then two others came up who knew him, but I could only pronounce their unusual-to-me
names; didn't have time to lock them to anything in my visually oriented brain.</p>

<p>Saw Jen and Taka outside in the cold; we headed in and met up with Ami who had already gone in.
Chatted a bit and then they went toward the exit and we caught up with them talking to Levi and his
um-friend Natsa, whose name either I mispronounced and she agreed twice, or it's not actually a name
that can be made with Japanese characters.</p>

<p>Natsa was on 47th voyage (with Auds, Kris, Natalie, and Angie), and then on part of 56th I think
with Natalie and Levi, but it may have been 58th.</p>

<p>I saw Chief from 52nd voyage, and said HI to him on behalf of Petra, but I just remembered his
nickname now and why he got it; I was his chiefly representative when we did the GET exchange in
Paupa New Guinea!  Dang that was awesome.  We drank so much of that semi-bitter semi-gritty
drink...  wow wow wow.  Good times.  That's where Tomoe did a cool Okinawan dance in her Okinawan
pants and cool hat.  I was well-impressed with that.</p>

<p>Jen and Taka were all chatting with paying passengers from previous voyages and Levi was talking
to a few such passengers but indicated he didn't know as many as before (after I said, &quot;you'll
know more than I do,&quot;)... but Ami and I were getting hungry, so we headed out: we're going to
Shakey's for pizza buffet!</p>
