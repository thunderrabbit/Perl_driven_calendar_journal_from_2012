<p>Some months ago, I split a big hairy query into a temp table and tossed an index on that.  This
sped the query up by quite a bit.  The resulting query still had a subquery in it so I pulled that
out today, after I noticed it was causing a bit of a problem with calculating the number of users
(we want that instead of the number of websites they have).  The counting problem is fixed, but even
with an index on this temp table as well, the overall query is not any faster.</p>
