<p>Helped Juergen for about an hour getting his self-written letter of recommendation.  Interesting
that he characterized German as focusing so much on nouns and English on verbs.  I guess that's why
German capitalizes nouns and we have E-prime.</p>

<p>Found some issues with my myPhoto setup, worst of which is getting it to synchronize with my
website; I can use rsync or some such, but I don't want to keep the files here locally; I want to
offload them to my site and delete them locally.</p>

<p>Trying run FPA (free perl album), but getting a 500 Internal Error even when I cull the entire
program down to nothing.  The permissions are set as best I can tell; I have the problem with many
new perl programs, but for some reason I can't find/remember a consistent solution.</p>

<p>Bedtime now; going to meet Jo Sato tomorrow for a neurofeedback session.</p>
