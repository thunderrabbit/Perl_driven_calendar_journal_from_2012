<p>After the session, I wondered what to do.  Just wanted to go home, feeling a bit disappointed in
the uninteresting results of the session.  Cosidered stopping by Shinjuku, but decided against it
because Ami suggested it as our plan for tomorrow.  Wandered into the 7/11 again cause I was hungry,
but ended up just getting an ice cream (my favorite in Japan: vanilla ice cream bar with white
chocolate center and white chocolate shell.</p>

<p>I pretended to toss it to the girl behind the counter, and she pretended to catch it, so I
really threw it and she really caught it.</p>

<p>Considered chatting a bit with her, but decided there was no point and just walked to Ikebukuro,
stopping for a bit at a mini train line; basically a glorified trolley cause it got its own path,
but had to stop for larger street crossings.  For some reason, I didn't take a picture.</p>
