<p>Really enjoyed connecting with I-group in Ben's Cafe in 高田馬場.</p>

<p>But I especially enjoyed lstning to Kevin and hearing about his experience after the Gnan Dvidi.
I think I'm going to do it.  My sense is that it's not going to negatively affect my meditative
practices It seems unrelated to those, but I can still practice them if I so choose at that time.
and he said (after I worried out loud that I might lose interest in relationship with Ami) that
&quot;I've always found that when the man in a relationship gets his shit together, the woman always
rises up to match.&quot; Or something to that effect.</p>

<p>Listened to his story of meditating in the King's Chamber of the pyramids.  Pow straight to
Sirius.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>He said he looked it up later and found the Egyptian religion was all about how to get back to Sirius.</p>
