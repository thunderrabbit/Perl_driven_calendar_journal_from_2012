<p>I got permission from ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó to mess with the live server all this weekend.  I told him on
Monday it will either be better or the same as today.  I'm hoping to get the User List thing
working way faster and with more functionality.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS isn't working as promised.  Perhaps it's cause this query
has nested SELECTs, but that seems strange.  Without SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS, this query returns 25k
records.  With SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS, it reports a return of 55 records.  wtf?</p>
