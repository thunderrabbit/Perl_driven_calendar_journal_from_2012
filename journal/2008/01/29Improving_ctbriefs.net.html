<p>Toying around with catastrophic errors in ctbriefs.net.  Basically want to have it gracefully
recover from the DB going down.  This is a rather unlikely scenario, so if it's not easy to handle,
I may not worry about it.  I haven't given it a thorough inspection though.</p>

<p>Next steps are to handle users going to the template files directly instead of the main files.
Like I have admin.php which includes admin.template.php.  If they visit admin.template.php, it will
croak.  So I need to have it automagically refresh to its parent.</p>
