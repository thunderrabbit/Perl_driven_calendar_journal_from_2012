<p>Going through the Cocoa toot for building a currency converter in XTools; I'm not sure if I'll
make it through the whole thing til I get to the holy grail of having an actual OS X lookin'
program written by me, BUT the idea that started all this is to get iPhoto to write directly to my
website.  It's been done writing to Facebook and Smugmug and certainly others.  Maybe I should look
a bit harder to see if someone has already done it.</p>
