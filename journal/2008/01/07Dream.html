<p class="dream">In some sort of aquarium with people performing with some of the larger animals.
My friends and I were invited to meet the performers so we went past the crowd into a tunnel.  I was
engrossed by the fish-filled water flowing on either side of the tunnel floor, with brightly colored
fish flapping about; the water wasn't very deep, but deep enough that they could live.  I watched
them for a bit and looked up to see my friends had gone ahead and I was left not knowing through
which tnnel they had gone.  I continued forward and came across a wild display of fish swimming in
the air, inluding a shark that could spit lobsters out of its mouth as an attack mechanism.  I was
totally fascinated yet totally scared to be attacked by it so I was taking video of it and even
though I knew it was a dream so I wouldn't be able to take the video out of the dream, I could show
it to my friends *in* the dream, and I ran out of the room to a different tunnel that had fewer
fish; in fact it had so few that I guessed that last tunnel must have been taken over by fish and
given up as a route for humans.  I found the performers and ostensibly found my friends as well, and
I told them what had happened and showed them the video with the crazy lobster attack shark and they
laughed.  &quot;Yeah; he's pretty dangerous alright.&quot; Woah.</p>
