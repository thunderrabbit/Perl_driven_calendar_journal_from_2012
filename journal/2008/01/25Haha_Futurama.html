<p>Sweet.  I just watched Futurama, Bender's Big Score!  I liked it enough that I'm considering
buying the DVD for the extra DVD features the DVD features.</p>

<p>You know, the funniest bit about Futurama was AND INTRODUCING XYXJSD whatever that name was, but
the character only was onscreen for less than a second in about the least important role, just
shuffling through the line..  Hahahahah I didn't realize it until later.. I saw the intro
&quot;Introducing&quot; and I was like, &quot;what??? why??&quot; and then saw the character shuffle
by and was like, &quot;aight; here it comes..&quot; and then it didn't come and I forgot until the
whole movie was over and I just found myself giggling in bed when I thought about it.</p>
