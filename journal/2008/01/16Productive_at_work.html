<p>Got a lotta shit done at work today, almost all work related, so that's a bonus for Da Man.
I've nearly got this friends program thing finished...  Well, the skeleton at least.  Just gotta
write Japanese instead of English and do a bit more cosmetic stuff, and it will be done.  Oh wait,
except for the admin paying users for inviting people, but that shouldn't be too hard.  Oh, and the
payment history; that should be almost equally easy.</p>

<p>BUT today when I showed ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó, he was like, &quot;awesome, uh, can you add one detail
though?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;d'oh!&quot; cause it will be messing with a big smelly mySQL
query with subqueries in it.  I've been writing queries with just a bunch of LEFT JOINs cause I
like them, and I'd like to think they are faster.</p>

<p>Okay, the very bottom of
this <a href="http://www.raritanval.edu/departments/cis/full-time/Schwarz/sql/lesson6.htm">high
level info on complex queries</a> says though joins are easier to understand, there are advantages
to subqueries, but doesn't specify what.</p>

<p>Interesting.  Here are almost opposite responses to
the <a href="http://forums.devx.com/showthread.php?t=24593">question of Joins vs Subqueries</a>.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>
