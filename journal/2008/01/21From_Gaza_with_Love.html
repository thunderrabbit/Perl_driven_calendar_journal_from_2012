Dear __Representative, Senator, Vice President, President___

Some of my friends are trapped in Gaza by Israeli blockade, which is a violation of the 4th Geneva
Convention (relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War).  (*) full text linked below

As Israel is occupying and slowly crushing the Palestinian region, we must not sit idly by.  Please
tell Israel to stop killing my friends.

      sunday 20th of january 2008

      in a hurry iam writing to let you know that in less than 2 hours the last turbine of the Gaza
      power plant , will stop working , the power plant fuel , is to finish in 2 hours , i hurried
      to recharge my laptop , mobile and to wash the cloths , i checked my candles and rechargable
      lights !!!!!!i telephoned the hospital , was realy paniced to learn that we have fuel for the
      electrical generator, enough only for 4 days !!!!!what more shall i give of details , no
      electricity lead to no pumped fresh water , no proper swege system and more diseases and more
      rationalising of diffrent surgical operations , and later on no emergency operations can be
      conducted in our hospitals ,
      
      israel has sealed the Gaza strip completely and strictly on friday , even the UN food supplies
      are not allowed to enter Gaza, 80% of the population(1.5 million ) at the moment depends on
      the UN aid and diffrent international aid agencies .the UN staff are not allowed to leave or
      enter Gaza .while Israel is sealing the Gaza strip ,and at the same time , intisfying air
      raids and land military operations against Gaza , where in the last few days 37 people were
      killed and 120 were injured ,most of them are civilians , in a desperate trial to stop the
      projected rockets from Gaza against the israelis villages , where the Israeli citizens
      complains of paniccing attacks, the response with such overreacted operations agianst Gaza is
      unjustified ,power and fuel cut off is frank collective punishment

      THIS TIME I AM WRITING TO TELL YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING FOR US IN GAZA
      1.5 million of Gaza are dying slowly
      they need your help and support , tell the world israel search for peace and security , will
      not be acheived by this collective punishment against us
