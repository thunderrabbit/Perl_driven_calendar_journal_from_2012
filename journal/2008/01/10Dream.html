<p class="dream">go up a creek and saw a pair of twin women doing some kind of sexy commercial or
movie or some such.  I put my hand up on the side of my face so I wouldn't see them naked, and they
were like, &quot;pshhh whateva,&quot; like they knew I wanted to watch.  I looked up stream and saw
a big huge fish tank being moved across the bridge and the truck stopped so the water sloshed like
crazy and gushed out and was flooding the little creek.  I yelled toward the women like, &quot;look
out!&quot; and we were basically okay, but it was iffy for a bit.</p>
