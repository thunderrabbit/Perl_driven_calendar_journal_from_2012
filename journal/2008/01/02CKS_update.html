HI Kim

I am glad to report that I completed my goal of 50,000 words on my novel by 30 December.  I actually
reached 50,015 words.  I'm working on spell check now and then will be doing a rough cleanup to get
the chapters in an order that approaches final form.

I have reduced the number of days that I spend working super late at work; this claim is actually
just my sense of it; I haven't kept track of my hours per se.

Each time I leave way-earlier than my co-workers, I have some conflicts in my brain:

1) Perhaps I should stay about as long as they do
2) Perhaps I should encourage them to take care of themselves by going home as well
3) I can't presume to know what they need to take care of themselves
4) As per culture, should I be apologetic when leaving before the rest?
5) It feels good to be part of a team effort and really putting forth my best
6) I can do better work when I'm better rested
7) etc

They don't deride me when I leave early, but they stay probably 3 to 4 more hours than I do each
day, and I wonder what they are really thinking.

I'm working on a website for myself that I hope to leverage in two ways.  I'll have the code for my
own site that can hopefully make some money (through ads) and use the same code on a site with
Tariq.  The project that we worked on together has been (for our purposes (including Tariq's),)
stopped, but we will use the work we did on the project on the new website.

The idea of looking for other jobs slash sources of income is crossing my mind a bit more
frequently.  Three basic ideas are there:

1) a different IT job
2) modeling in addition to IT
3) IT projects on the side

I will also be taking 10 days off including the end of this January to make $5000 (by participating
in a drug trial) that will put me totally out of credit card debt and well into paying back my mom
and brother for loans after I broke my shoulder.

I am beginning to look into places to show my paintings in Tokyo.

Ami and I are doing well; I've gone through phases of thinking it would be better to date a woman
with whom I have a common language, but when I mentally step back a bit, I see it's not all that
important.

I have haphazardly been meditating more.  I'll be taking a meditation course this weekend
(&quot;opening the 3rd eye&quot;)
