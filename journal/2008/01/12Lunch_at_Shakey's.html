<p>Had to wait a few minutes to get inside, but we chowed at Shakey's; I wish they had an ice cream
bar and it would be <em>perfect</em>.</p>

<p>Zzzz all the way home; I am certain I would have missed Motosumiyoshi except that Ami woke me
up.  i was like, &quot;already???&quot;</p>

<p>Which is funny because when we had gone just a few stations, I thought we had been going for a
long time.  I woke up at Toritsudaigaku thinking we should have arrived by now.</p>
