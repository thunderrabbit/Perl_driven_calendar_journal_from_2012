<p class="dream">I was swinging huge swings in a really huge swing and a semi noisy girl was doing
something over to my right. She made a mistake and flew up in the air, like hoveringly floating just
next to me and then back down and I swung through the bottom of the arc, but she had no swing and went WHOMP on the ground and
*immediately* was like &quot;I'm okay&quot; and got up.</p>

<p class="dream">I was glad to see her okay, but
dang, so I stopped swinging and took her over to some water outlets near a cabin and was like, &quot;you need to wash
your face,&quot; cause I wanted to kiss her but I didn't want to kiss her with dirt all over her
face.</p>

<p class="dream">I led her to this outdoor fountain type thing and she and her friend both washed
their faces.  The water pressure was low; I and everyone else who had lived in the area knew this.
When they turned it up here, it took pressure away from the cabin nearby.  Guys inside the cabin
started to yell gruffly so I went in to defuse their hostility.  They were complaining cause they
had to smell Marcus and it was worse with no water pressure, as he was taking a big dump in the
toilet with no water pressure to wash it away.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;hey fellas, I understand your situation,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">They interrupted like I was being offensive, &quot;what situation?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I continued, &quot;having Marcus as as a roommate,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">and we laughed a bit; &quot;I had him over in that other building over there, and I
know this building has really bad water pressure, so I'm about to tell these girls to turn down the
pressure; I didn't know they would be all turning it way up and stuff, so I'm sorry about
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I was just stalling for a bit to give the girls some time to wash off and then I
went out and they were just finishing up.</p>

<p class="dream">I decided to engage the guys one more time in a non-quiet kinda way, so I yelled
from outside, &quot;aight they' already done&quot; and then I went back in just to have that final
personal touch and maybe get to be friends with these rough guys.</p>

<p class="dream">The main leader guy was already half running out to catch up with me and was like,
&quot;hey, how big are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He was a bit shorter than me, with short glistening black hair and a bandanna.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;excuse me?&quot; I was thinking, I am as big as me; here I am; look for
yourself...</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;how big are you?  I'd put you at 600 or 700..&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">But at the same time I was saying &quot;I'm 5 foot eleven, but I don't know what
you mean by 600 or 700,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And he said &quot;well, you're big,&quot; and then he kinda grabbed my left hand
and at the same time put some (insect?) into my shirt and pushed my arm down from my hand to catch
the insect in my under arm and I tried to struggle away and I realized he was trying to perhaps
catch me and see how my body would react to this insect's poison, and I fought against falling
unconscious but I could already feel it making me pass out in my dream, and I suddenly entered my C1
waking consciousness</p>

<p>exactly five minutes before my alarm to get up.</p>

<p>Was he trying to help me wake up?  Did I get some sort of entity stuck to my body?   Are these
questions just silly?</p>

<p>The group reminded me of a Latino gang, whatever that means.</p>
