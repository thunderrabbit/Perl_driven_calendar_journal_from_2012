<p>Wow.  I expected to fall asleep, but I maintained consciousness through nearly the entire thing,
with just slight losses during the 25-22 countdown, and again from 19 - 16 or so.  Interesting to
see colors when crossing through to perhaps 27, or was it elsewhere?  Anyway, no real plan for this
one once I reached the park, so I just relaxed and enjoyed feeling my body breathe and my heart
beat.</p>

<p>Also interesting: I could *easily* feel and hear a train going by, though the tracks are about
500 meters away, and I basically never hear them while awake.</p>
