<p>Sweet.  Now <a href="http://ctbriefs.net/">ctbriefs.net</a> displays the theories in the DB.  It
displays *all* the theories in the DB, so a malicious user could post a bunch of theories just to
jam up the server.  But since no one else has even logged in to the site yet, I'm not too
worried.</p>

<p>Next steps will be to tweak the where and limit of the theory fetchin' mySQL query so I can show
users only their theories on mypage.php, and to limit the number of queries on the front page.</p>
