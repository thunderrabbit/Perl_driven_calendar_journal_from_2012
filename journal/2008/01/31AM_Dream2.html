<p class="dream">I got tired of waiting for the nurse to come back in and insert the catheter i my
arm, so I got out of the warm bath and went out to the information desk to ask for directions on
how to get to a certain area indicated on a map.  The map was in the Metropolis magazine I have
here and had folded backwards, but I had changed the page from tat one. Thanks to my careful
backwards fold, I was able to find the correct page easily, but not fast enough before the nurse
came back and I quickly ran back to the warm bath and jumped in with Ami and the warm water kept my
arm warm.  Then someone said, &quot;there is a storm outside, but no rain,&quot; and I was like,
&quot;how can hat be??&quot; and then a huge cloud of dust hit the window beside me and then
flipped the tub upsid down over me as the house collapsed around me.  I was safe inside the heavy
iron tub, and quit glad to be there.</p>

<p class="dream">Eventually the storm subsided and </p>

<p>I woke up relieved when the nurse came back and I was safely not in a collapsed building.</p>
