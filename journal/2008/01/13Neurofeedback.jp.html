<p>Dialed Jo's apartment number at 1:50pm by my phone clock. (I specify the chronograph because for
some reason, this phone does <em>not</em> get the correct time from the network!)  He asked if I
was ready to sit for about 30 minutes.  I peed, refilled with water and was ready.</p>

<p>As he stuck three little tabs   to my head (one behind each ear and the other on the top right back of
my skull), he told me a bit about the process.  Said that I would hear music which reflected my
brain activity, and that I would reach a different state of consciousness, and perhaps even go out
of body.  &quot;I don't know where you go, but you might go somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;awesome! I'm ready.&quot;</p>

<p>He got the music track set up and plugged my headphones into his computer.</p>

<p>I basically heard 4 things.  One was a recording ostensibly from a beach: I could hear seagulls
squawking and waves crashing.  One was a recording of chanting that I couldn't recognize except that
it sounded like it was done in an echoey area.  One was a semi-background white noise, which I
assumed was supposed to put my brain into an interesting state of awareness, perhaps like hemisync.
And the last was the &quot;music&quot; based on my brain activity: basically beeps and bloops of
varying pitch that happened with such infrequency that I would have to label it as
&quot;sparse&quot; if I were reviewing it as a song for <a href="http://ktru.org/">KTRU</a>.</p>

<p>I found the seagulls quite too squawky, the contrast with indoor chanting and outdoor beach
quite strange, and the repetition of those to tracks to be distracting.  (they lasted perhaps 4 or
5 minutes before rolling back around, including a brief silent gap between the end and the
start)</p>

<p>Despite this, I was able to occasionally focus on my breathing, and after about 30 minutes, able
to actually sleep a few times (sometimes with but usually without awareness of my body)</p>

<p>Except I was pretty much aware that my neck started to hurt, but I set myself to relax as much
as possible while sitting upright in a chair (not a normal meditation posture; especially in a
chair that tilts!) and finally, finally he came back to the room and clicked off the sound, which
was quite an abrupt, but welcome end to my &quot;meditation.&quot;</p>

<p>I was pretty sure it had been more than 30 minutes.  He mentioned it had been 45.  That would
probably explain it.</p>

<p>He asked how it had been.</p>

<p>Um, well,</p>

<p>He asked if I saw any visuals.</p>

<p>Um, well, no.</p>

<p>He seemed a bit surprised and explained that most people do.  He suggested that perhaps I will
have very vivid dreams tonight.</p>

<p>Well, I have vivid dreams every night, and when I am thinking towards it, I have lucid dreams
that I would consider quite vivid.</p>

<p>He showed me the alpha wave and theta wave graph on his computer.  For most of the graph, my
alpha was way up high and my theta was about a third to half as high.  A couple of brief times,
brain activity seemed to be super low.</p>

<p>He did something and the graph disappeared.  Thanks to ahem, buggy software that happened to be
running on Microsoft Windows, the 45 minutes of data was lost in an instant.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes it does that,&quot; Jo agreed.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;well, let's do it again;&quot; I was ready to do it with different (no) music,
and perhaps while *watching* my brain waves on the screen so I could get more immediate and constant
feedback.</p>

<p>I asked him about the beeps and boops; he said those are uncommon; that they are points of high
delta activity.</p>

<p>Rare?  Wait, where was the &quot;music&quot; based on my brainwaves?</p>

<p><em>[bing bong],</em> his next client.  One of the paying variety.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'd be interested in doing this again, but perhaps with a bit more careful selection of music,
etc.</p>
