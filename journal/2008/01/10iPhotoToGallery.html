<p>I found <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">http://zwily.com/iphoto/</a>, which looks quite close

Subject: are you using Xtools to build iPhotoToGallery?

HI Zach

Your extension looks quite promising!

I'd like to tweak the code a bit to get it to output to my own
directory structure; I don't want to use Gallery...  I downloaded the
source and opened it with Xtools 2.5.  I clicked Build for both the
iPhotoToGallery and iPhotoToGallery Install targets..  I got several
warnings, but it said it compiled.  BUT I don't see an executable
anywhere.

If you can help me get it to build, I'll be happy to write it up as a
How To on your wiki.

  Thanks!
   - Rob

ps: I should be clear about one thing; I just downloaded Xtools 2.5 today
so I can compile your code, but I haven't actually used Xtools before. :-)
But I'm still hopeful!

<p>His response was fast (3 hours later):

It generates a .iPhotoExporter bundle and puts it in the Build
directory by default I think.

<p>But I don't find the bundle he's talking about; I'll prolly look for another solution.</p>
