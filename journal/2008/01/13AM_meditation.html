<p class="date">4:58pm JST Sunday 13 January 2008 (day 13808)</p>

<p>This morning slept, meditated, including having my brain alert while my body fell asleep.</p>

<p>This was only after several several several times of falling asleep (basically forgetting to
maintain awareness of my physical body and focusing entirely on my outer mind of blah blah blah and
some visuals) and recalling my plan to stay awake and do the meditation.</p>

<p>I was following (my version of) the Clairvision technique: awareness of the larynx, then
awareness of the area between eyebrows, and then awareness of visuals and then sleep.  no dang not
sleep, I'm supposed to become aware of darkness, so I would go back to awarenss of larynx and try
again.</p>

<p>and I would repeat the cycle.  I got to an almost well-defined experiential state in my brain;
awareness of larynx, awareness between eyebrows, awareness of visuals, and <em>as I began to
consider the shift</em> to awareness of space / darkness, I would succomb to my busy outer brain of
distractions.  It happened at least 10 times before I got to the point of mind awake, body
asleep.</p>

<p>I don't know that this counts as becoming aware of the darkness, but I counted it as a success
in my persistence of meditation and subsequently let myself consider my meditation finished.  It
had been easily 30 minutes.</p>
