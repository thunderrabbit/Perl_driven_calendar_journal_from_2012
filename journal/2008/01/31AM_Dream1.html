<p>This dream was probably 2 hours ago:</p>

<p class="dream">In a tour bus, driving precariously close and quite fast along a beautiful canyon,
deeper than Niagra Falls, but more beautiful than  the Painted Desert; the ice cold water was pouring
through the canyon torrentially and beautiful rock structures whisked in and out of view as the bus
careened around corners.  I felt scared that we would got flying over the edge, but I  realized th
bus diver had a license and as a profesional would keep us safely on the road, until we tipped off
the road.</p>

<p class="dream">The bus toppled slowly sideways to the left, and we slowly plummetted toward the
chilly water below, but sorta coasted along the water.</p>

<p class="dream">I got out of the bus somehow and went climbing quickly using trees growing up
through the snow to climb out of the canyon.  I went to tell somebody about the incident or
something, and something about UFOs after that.</p>
