<p>_Blood to breakfast_ could be the name of a movie, but it just means we give a blood sample and
then go eat at 11am today and the past two days.</p>

<p class="date">10:12am JST</p>

<p>Okay, I just gave blood (and took my 3 tablets (placebo?) administration).  For my blood to
breakfast break, I'm going to skip ctbriefs and get back to working on work stuff.  I intend to
work as much today as I normally do at work.  (and intend to get paid for it)</p>
