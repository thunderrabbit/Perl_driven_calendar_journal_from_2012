<p>Waaaaah!!!!!!</p>

Hi everybody,

Hope you all had a great new year! Everything is starting to get back to normal around the office
and we are all busy with the 60th orientation.

Along with 60th voyage preparation we are currently preparing for the next term of Tokyo GET, which
includes post voyage classes for students wanting to continue their studies with GET after the
voyage, and also pre-voyage classes for those wanting to get ahead before the voyage.

We are in need of an English teacher for the next term of Tokyo GET and also are looking for
repeaters for the 62nd voyage. Thus, we are offering a position of around 6-7 months which will
include teaching one term of Tokyo GET plus a repeater teacher position on the 62nd voyage. The next
term of Tokyo GET will begin on the 29th of January and will end on the 18th of April. You will then
assist the coordinator with pre-voyage preparations until boarding the 62nd voyage from May 14th to
August 25th, 2008. You can check out the itinerary for the 62nd voyage at
<a href="http://www.peaceboat.org./english/voyg/62/itinerary.html">http://www.peaceboat.org./english/voyg/62/itinerary.html</a>.

If you are interested in this position, please email us asap, or by Friday the 11th of January, and
we will provide you with further information on how to apply. We are sorry for the short notice,
however this position has come up unexpectedly given the number of Tokyo GET students increasing.

If you are interested in only the Tokyo GET teaching position or only the 62nd repeater position,
please email me. We are however, particularly interested in applicants who are able to do the TOKYO
GET term.

Thank you and hope to hear from you soon,

Warm regards,

Nat

Hey Natty Nat Nat!!  (and everyone else who comes across this message!  :-)

As I just mentioned, I'm in a contract here at work so I am unable to accept your lovely offer to
help get some GETs speaking English around the world!!

BUT, I was just thinking: my contract ends in August, and the 62 Voyage sets sail in August, SO the
person who fills the position NOW will be leaving the office THEN.

I would like to apply for the 7 month teaching adventure that starts August 2008.  Woohoo!

By that time, i will have finished my contract here, and if all goes as planned, have gotten a
"degree" in Reiki healing.  So I can help people's µ¤ on the boat.  :-)

   Love Love
   - Rob!

<p>I just noticed the lowercase i in there.  The san serif font doesn't show up well enough for me
to notice in gmail.</p>
