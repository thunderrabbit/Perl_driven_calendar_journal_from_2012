<p>I just read this in an email I got a few days ago.  Interesting stuff
from <a href="http://www.cosmicparadigm.com/">http://www.cosmicparadigm.com/</a></p>


<pre>
Now for an overview of what you will see during your calendar  year 2008
as undeniable evidence that the patterns of behavior and systems  of the
old ways  are  tumbling  to make  way  for   the   new.   Disclosures in
mainstream  media--where  truth  still  is  sparse   in   the plethora of
omissions and misleading information--are only  the  tip  of exposures so
plentiful that when they come out, it will seem more  like  an  eruption
than an emergence as peoples demand an end to  pervasive  corruption and
oppression. Yet, be mindful  that  what  is transpiring  is reformation,
not revolution, and although changes ultimately will  be  profound, they
will come within the just laws and orderliness  of  a civilized  society
and not the untenable disarray of anarchical upheaval.

All happenings are due  to  the frequencies  Earth  has  reached  in her
ascension. The raising of consciousness and  spiritual  clarity  enabled
by these higher vibrations is reason to leap with joy, but in  the short
term, some effects may be unsettling.  Physical  anomalies,  depression,
fatigue and confusion may be due to bodies adjusting, but please  do not
assume  that  is  the  cause  of  discomfort.  Proper  treatment  may be
necessary,  so consulting  trusted  health  care  specialists  and using
natural remedies is sensible, but chemicals prescribed to calm  you down
or  cheer  you  up will  only  create  more  havoc  with  your  systems'
electromagnetic currents, which are incompatible with  those  chemicals.
Assist your bodies by drinking a lot of pure water.

Another noticeable effect of the frequencies  is changing  attitudes and
behavior as  all characteristics  and emotions  are  being  magnified--in
easiest terms, "good" is getting better  and  "bad"  is  getting  worse.
Positive  outlooks   and  characteristics   are  blooming   beautifully,
enhancing  relationships  in families,   workplaces   and   communities.
Conversely, the veneers of acquired traits like  diplomacy  and  feigned
philanthropy are wearing thin and the  less  admirable  basic  nature is
showing,  just  as will  all  instances  of  falsity  and  self-service.

In a similar vein but from  a different  source,  hearts  and  minds are
stirring with sensations that changes are needed in personal
relationships,  type  of  work  or living  environment,   or   perhaps a
complete change of lifestyle.  These  usually  derive  from  strong soul
level nudgings to get on with other choices in the pre-birth  agreements
that require different circumstances  from  those  already  experienced.

Planetary  cleansing  via  earthquakes  and storms  will  continue until
Earth is rid of the negativity amassed over  the ages  of  brutality and
bloodshed, thus  it is  wise  to  be prepared  with  sufficient  typical
emergency supplies to weather these kinds  of  events.  Please  remember
that soul contracts are what govern physical safety and  survival--do not
let fear be the motivator for moving to a "safer"  location.  Do not let
fear into your  lives  at all!  This  is  a good  place  to mention that
"global  warming"  is  Earth's  return  to the  predominantly   moderate
climate that once prevailed worldwide.

From a variety of obvious causes,  many,  many  souls  will  continue to
transition from Earth to spirit life,  and with  each  one's  departure,
grief and missing the physical presence will befall family and  friends.
One day not too distant, when  telepathic  communication  again  will be
commonplace on Earth, everyone will  know  that  the  leave-taking is by
the  soul's  choice  in agreement  with  all  primary  persons   in that
lifetime and LIFE is an unending cycle of incarnations,  then  residence
in a spirit world, within eternal love bonds.

Despite the highly publicized war-mongering rhetoric that is  meant more
to arouse fear than to  undertake  action,  armed  conflicts  will ease,
then cease as bellicose national leaders are  ousted  and  lighted souls
step in to govern in peace. Peoples will start  enjoying  the  liberties
and better living standards  so  long  denied  them,  and  a cooperative
spirit of working in harmony for the good of all  will  replace  current
conflict,  anger,  jealousy  and  ruthlessness.   This   too   will be a
transition, not godliness blanketing the planet in one  fell  swoop, and
patience a bit longer will serve you well.

The unconscionable inequality between rich and poor is coming  to an end
as the global foundation for  financial  dealings  that  has caused this
disparity  is coming  apart  at  the seams.  The  largely   unrecognized
bankruptcy of the United States unavoidably will  have  domino  effects,
and the economies of many other  nations  already  are in  tatters. When
all of this stabilizes, you will have  a sound  basis  for  commerce and
banking, the lives of billions now in bare subsistence  level  countries
will be greatly  improved,  and the  vast  coffers  of those  who earned
their fortunes dishonestly will be fairly distributed to end
impoverishment wherever it exists.

Contrary to reports that  benevolent  members  of  our universal  family
will make mass landings to evacuate  peoples  of  Earth,  that  will not
occur because there will be  no need.  However,  their  ongoing  massive
assistance in a variety of ways will continue, and when  it is  safe for
those living among you to introduce  themselves  and  those  surrounding
you in spacecraft to land, they will. Not only will  that  be  a time of
unequaled celebration on Earth, but  all  lighted  civilizations  in the
universe will be cheering when that monumental day arrives!
