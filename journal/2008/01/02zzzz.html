<p>Good news on the website front; I got it so I have an SVN repository of my website and can just
do an svn co on the path and have a working website like *snap*.  SO now I have *two* working
websites: a test system and a live system.</p>

<p>I will likely use this technique for any future sites I make.</p>

<p>I just watched <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">zeitgeist</a> and highly recommend it to all
humans.  I'm coordinating with tracy to do a showing at Pink Cow
on <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/zday.htm">Z-Day</a>.</p>

<p>But right now it's bed bed bedtime.</p>
