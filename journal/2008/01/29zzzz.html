<p>I'm tired, but want to do a bit
online.  I guess it's silly to try and program on ctbriefs.  Perhaps I can upload some pics or
check email.  OR I can start pictures uploading and then check email.</p>

<p>Okay; they are uploading now.</p>

<p>Dang.  I tried to use my thumbnailer to make thumbnails, but it's not working for some reason.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Cool.  I just added a bit of CSS to <a href="http://ctbriefs.net">ctbriefs.net</a></p>
