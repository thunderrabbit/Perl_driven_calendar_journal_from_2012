<p>Today I finalized the promotional deets for
showing <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">Zeitgeist</a> at the Pink Cow:</p>

<pre>
=======================

March 15th is Z-Day!

The Pink Cow is opening early on March 15 to host a Zeitgeist movie
screening (4:30-6:30pm).  From the Zeitgeist website (<a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com">http://zeitgeistmovie.com</a>):

Zeitgeist is a movie to inspire people to start looking at the world
from a more critical perspective and to understand that very often
things are not what the population at large think they are.  Who was
behind 9/11?  Who started Christianity?  Who controls the world
currencies?

The movie will certainly spark many mini Zeitgeist discussions during
the amazing Pink Cow Buffet dinner for 2,650pp (7-10pm).    Make a
reservation for dinner at cowmail[X]thepinkcow.com to get a guaranteed
table and a guaranteed DVD of the movie!

Free Zeitgeist Movie DVDs for everyone who makes a reservation.

Can't come that early?  Watch the movie now at
<a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com">http://zeitgeistmovie.com</a> and join the Pink Cow Buffet to feed your
face and share your intellect for only 2,650pp.  It's all happening
March 15th!

For the night owls, a second Zeitgeist Movie screening after dinner
can spark discussion during the spinology of DJ Cool Cucumber from
midnight to late.
