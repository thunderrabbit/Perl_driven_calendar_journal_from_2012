<p class="dream">I had a heavy crystal tube given to me by janette and filled it with oysters.
There was a cat trying to get a snack, so I set the tube outside and it began to roll away and about
to drop off a step onto a brick surface, so I was afraid for a bit that it would break.  I went out
to get it, but I was just too late.  It hit the brick surface with a thunk, and the I picked it up,
dumped out the oysters and brought it inside to wash.</p>

<p class="dream">There were still a couple sliced mushroms stuck to the inside of the tube.  As I
washed them out, I noticed a little chip on one end of the tube, and a matching one on the other
end.  I hoped janette was too fond of this tube, and I woke up.</p>
