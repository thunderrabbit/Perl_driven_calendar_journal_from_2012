<p>Okay.  I <em>think</em> I've got a beginning of a start on allowing logins via openID.  After
countless attempts at downloading various things, I eventually
used <a href="http://openidenabled.com/">openidenabled.com/</a>, but only the (Auth and) consumer
part of it.  I commented out all the PAPE stuff, cause I can't figure out what that does, so I don't
care about it.  (( but I left the code there, just in case I figure it out later ))</p>

<p>Given that several of the big websites support OpenID, I've basically decided that for
ctbriefs.net, I will only allow openID logins.  I don't gas who they are exactly; I just want to
uniquely identify users.</p>

<p>I even got the little icon to show up inside the login text field.</p>

<p>Sweet.  Now I've gotten $_SESSION going so I can tell who is logged in.  Next is to allow them
to log out.</p>

<p>But first, I'm going to meet ¤æ¤ê¤« for an English lesson.  She was sick when we were last
supposed to meet.  I wanted to get our lesson in before I zoom to ¼¯»ùÅç for 10 days.</p>
