<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>I've wanted to do this for a long time, but just never knew how.  Now I'm the proud owner of a
bit of code that is logged on to AIM as rabbitrobot.</p>

<p>It will eventually be more fully featured than currently.  Right now it just replies with
&quot;You're not the boss of me.&quot; unless you are logged in as my brother or me.  PS: if you log
in as me, please let me know my password; it's locked in my local computer, but I can't remember
what it is.  I wanna change it so you can't use it anymore. hahahhaa.</p>

<p>Oh, the robot is named rabbitrobot.</p>
