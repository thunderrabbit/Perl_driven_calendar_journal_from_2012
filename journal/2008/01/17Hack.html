<p>Very interesting.  I've set up a bit of a hack to let me edit files locally with Emacs and have Cyberduck ssh them to my site.  Okay; here goes my first test save.</p>

<p>crap.  I couldn't do it.</p>

<p>I was trying to let cyberduck "edit with SubEthaEdit" and then edit that file with Emacs, but SubEthaEdit seems to not revert to the version I save with Emacs.</p>
