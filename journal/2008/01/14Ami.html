<p>Ami arrived while I was composing a reply to Dude's reply.  She read her book for a bit as I
typed, and I realized I should pay some attention to her but she was snuggled in for a nap already.
I tried to cutely wake her up, basically being a wiggle worm, but we zonked out for a bit and I just
woke up and wrote this dream.</p>
