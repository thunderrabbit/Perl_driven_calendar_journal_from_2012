<p>I'm going to install gallery on my site.</p>

<p>Eeeep.. but I just now remember the filenames are mangled beyond recognition..  Does it matter?
Argh.  I'll still do it just to see how I feels about it afterward.</p>

<p>Frack.  For some reason I can't export to my new gallery using iPhoto_to_Gallery.  Bah.  That's
the only thing I wanted to do with it.</p>
