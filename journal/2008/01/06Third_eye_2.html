<p>In Shibuya now on the train to head home after the second day of the two day Awakening the Third
Eye workshop a majig.  Generally good times for all involved and I got a picture of Francois with
Francois.  Surprised to find out that Èþ°¡ is a reiki master and said she can each me!  And the
bigger bonus is she can teach in English!  Woot.  So, I am going to be in touch with her quite soon
and again wtih Helma who led this weeked's workshop to do some work  that has been vexing me for a
while, specifically regarding women and anger and stuff.  Vexing for *years*, like since 3rd
grade.</p>

<p>I've been interested in Reiki for a while, so to meet someone who can teach is quite lovely.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if °¡Èþ would be interested in getting into this kinda stuff.</p>
