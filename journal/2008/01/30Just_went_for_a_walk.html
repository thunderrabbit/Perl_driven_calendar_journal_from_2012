<p>We just went for a walk for nearly an hour.  There's a lot of energy available in us given that
we've been chillin' for days and days.  Things got a bit rambunctious so Robert had to call a halt.
I had slipped while playing soccer with John's little tiny squishy ball; David and tripped while
trying to jump a hurdle; I got hit in the face by the little squishy ball.  It's not *that* squishy
at 10 m/s.</p>

<p>We had fun; the red blotch on my face is no longer visible.</p>
