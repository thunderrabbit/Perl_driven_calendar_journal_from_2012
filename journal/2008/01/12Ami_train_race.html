<p>Ami and I are going to Nihon-Oodori to watch Topaz set sail.  I think it will be faster to take
the supa-express (on which I am now) than to wait for the local.  This is due to the supa express
will stop at the *next* station after Nihon-Oodori, and I can just walk across the platform and take
the local train back 1 station, but Ami will wait four (4) minutes, and then have to stop at four
(4) extra stations.</p>

<p>Lunch is on the line.</p>

<p>This is good; I've had this question for a while.  Arriving already at the end.</p>

<p>Shit.  The train I will take back doesn't leave for another 2 minutes.  Dang.  This will be close.</p>

<p>Ami won by about 30 seconds.</p>
