<p>I don't know what's wrong with the email thing at work.  It was used a couple days ago to send
20,000 + messages to people, but it doesn't seem to be working now to send a single email to me,
nor on the test system at all.</p>

<p>Not sure what the problem is, but I know the solution for now: stop working on it.</p>
