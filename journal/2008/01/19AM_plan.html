<p>On the Yurakatcho (sp) line now, headed to Higashi-Ikebukuro to do another neurofeedback session
with Jo Sato.  I hope this time is a bit more inclusive of feedback.</p>

<p>This morning I meditated and made a list of things to do.</p>

<p>I don't have that list handy, but it was something like, write to Koichi about brndt's business
plan to make sure he got it; write to David about Castle in the Forest; clean out N + 5 messages
from my inbox, where N is the number that have arrived since I last chcked.;  do laundry; create an
A3 size poster for Zeitgeist Movie</p>

<p>I won't be the one doing the reating in the case of the poster, but I want to get one to post in
Pink Cow.  I do'nt know anyone local who does graphic design work..  perhaps Abe does; I've been in
touch with him recenlty.  Hitoshi does fo' sho' but he's been slow about replying to emails.</p>

<p>I got sidetracked on this last point in that I started reading a form of people who were like
&quot;this movie is bunk!  I have only watched the first 6 minutes and it's bunk!!  and by bunk
they mean the movie hasn't actually started yet.  A couple of them actually watched id and were
like, &quot;yah; same ol' crap about [Airplane Day], and the others I don't care about.  One dude
watched it and seem affected.  Another had already watched it and was like, &quot;why don't you
guys watch it before debunking it??&quot;</p>

<p>oh shit I gotta go.  something like that.</p>

<p>I missed the train I wanted to take, but I had given myself plenty* of time so that I could
actually walk from ikebukuro station, but no time for that now; I'll arrive clser by his house via
Higashi-Ikebukuro station.</p>

<p>Hmmm..  Again not exactly what I had hoped, but perhaps better on the communication side of
what's going on.</p>

<p>He told me about the Peniston Kullosky Protocol (sp), which I'll be reading soon.  It's
something about reducing PTSD, and since I am pretty sure I don't have that, I wonder if </p>
