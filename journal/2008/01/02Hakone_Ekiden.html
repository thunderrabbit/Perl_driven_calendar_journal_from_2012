<p>There's a collegiate marathon from Tokyo to Hakone and back, run early in the year.  Today was the first leg, and Ami was watching it on TV.  Interesting to recognize some of the areas through which they ran; &quot;<a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2005/04/14">I rode TJ Bike there!</a>&quot;</p>

<p>I wondered about the race and looked it up:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hakone_Ekiden&oldid=181536797">Hakone Ekiden on Wikipedia</a>.  The entry didn't include deets about the endpoints nor distance, so I added those.</p>
