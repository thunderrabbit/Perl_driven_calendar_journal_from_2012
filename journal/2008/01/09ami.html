<p>Ami and left work around the same time and met up in Jiyugaoka on the Limited Express (actually
more like supa-express) and then walked to the bottom of the stairs (escalator) in Kosugi station
before parting for her train to get her bicycle and some groceries, and me to walk home and buy and
carry water, respectively.  On the way home, I walked mindfully a
la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thich_Nhat_Hanh">Thich Nhat Hanh</a>, and made it to my
house around the same time as Ami. She cooked lovely yakisoba and some vegetable soup, including
enough for my lunch tomorrow.</p>

<p>After dinner, she asked me to clarify some of the points in my journal entry from yesterday.  I
watched my brain carefully; I may not have explained how I don't appreciate being grilled over
information I post, but she wasn't grilling as such, but it just sorta felt like it.  I *am*,
however, happy to answer questions about whatever, just not &quot;why did you write <em>this</em>?
and <em>this</em>?&quot; etc.  The answer is basically the same, &quot;I don't remember; fuck
off.&quot;</p>

<p>But I didn't really have that feeling with Ami, so it was all good.  In the end she was satisfied
to be sad, and I held her and said it was okay to be sad.  (( This was after I quickly fixed a
mistake on my part: I had been like, &quot;how are you?&quot; (no answer) &quot;are you happy?&quot;
&quot;no.&quot; &quot;are you angry?&quot; &quot;no.&quot; &quot;are you sad?&quot; &quot;yes.&quot;
&quot;why are you sad?  shit, wait, no; scratch that.  It's okay to be sad,&quot; and )) I just held
her.</p>

<p>After a bit, we slept platonically for a bit, and she went home a bit ago.</p>
