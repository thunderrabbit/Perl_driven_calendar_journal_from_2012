<p>My biggest, meanest, hairiest, scariest mySQL so far (with some table names changed to imrove security):</p>

<pre>
(SELECT up.uid, up.status, up.request_date, up.expect_date, up.amount
 FROM (SELECT r_recs.uid, r_recs.status, r_recs.request_date, r_recs.expect_date, sum(r_recs.amount1) as amount
       FROM   (
	SELECT up.uid, ur.status, ur.request_date, ur.expect_date, (ur.amount + ur.bonus_amount) AS amount1
	     FROM Upper_Remun AS ur
	     LEFT JOIN User_Publish AS up ON ur.publish_id = up.publish_id
	     WHERE ur.status =4
	     AND up.uid =5 
       UNION ALL SELECT
	      fo.blogger1_uid as uid
	      ,fp.status
	      ,fp.request_date
	      ,fp.expect_date
	      ,fp.amount as amount1
	      FROM
	      Find_Peyton as fp 
	      LEFT JOIN
	      First_Off as fo
	      USING (firstoff_id)

	     AND fo.b1_uid =5 
       ) AS r_recs 
       GROUP BY r_recs.uid, r_recs.status, r_recs.request_date, r_recs.expect_date
 ) AS up)
    UNION (
    SELECT uid,
    STATUS , request_date, expect_date, amounts AS amount

    )

<p>Before I started messing with it, it already had the second union.  It took me a while to add the
second select to top via the UNION ALL, but now that I've done it, I can call my project complete;
just need to fill in Japanese where I have English.</p>

<p>ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó helped me with about 80% of the Japanese translations, but then had to go do other
stuff.  I'm left to play online!  I think I'll work on one of *my* websites.</p>
