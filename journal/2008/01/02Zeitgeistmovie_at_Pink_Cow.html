Happy Moo Year!!

Have you seen Zeitgeist?  (<a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">http://zeitgeistmovie.com/</a>) It's an awesome
world-government-alien-conspiracy movie that encourages us to love each other as fellow
humans, respect our diversity, know that we are one people.

The makers of the movie are proposing Z-Day on Saturday 15 March, having as many screenings
of the movie as possible around the world.  I'm looking for a venue to do that, and Pink Cow
is my first choice!  If you and your schedule are open to the idea, I look forward to
organizing it with you!

   See youuu!

Hey Rob,

Happy moo year to you too:)

Of course we would love to have you and sounds like a film right up our alley! Our only problem
is that as a restaurant, and Fri/Sat being our prime-time and the time we need to pay our bills,
anything between 7-10pm we can only book people in for buffet dinner. Also, in order to do a
special event during dinner you would need at least 60-70 people for dinner otherwise it would
disturb other regular customers.  But, we have done it a couple of ways before by either
starting before and finishing by 7, inviting anyone who wants to stay to reserve for dinner or
inviting people to reserve for dinner before (for guaranteed tables) then show the film after 10
when dinner finishes, anyone who just wants to come for drinks only can come from 9:30 and we
can start the film after dinner. We could have djs after that and make a night of it if you
want:) How long is the film?

Please let me know what you think!  It would be great to do!

Cheers!
Traci

Thanks for the fast reply!

I've never really promoted anything so I don't have a sense of my ability to get 65+ people to come,
so for now I'll shy away from doing it during dinner (unless we just ran it in the background or
some such).

The movie is just under 2 hours long (1 hour 56 minutes), so it would have to start right when you
open to finish by 7pm.  That would be a great way to let early birds have a chance to watch it.

Hmmm; I'm now wondering if we could show it both before *and* after dinner!  That way we can support
both early and late customers with an after dinner movie until midnight and then DJs to kick it from
midnight.

The movie producers will support our showing with free DVDs to give away so I'm sure that would
bring some people in to check it out and buy a couple drinks.  I believe the movie is great, and I
would love to watch it twice and get tons of people to see it.

So in answer to your question "before or after dinner?"  both!  :-)

  Thanks!
    - Rob
