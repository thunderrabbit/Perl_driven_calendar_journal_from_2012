<p>Pretty nice lazy day today.  We watched the DVD features on Evan Almighty; I am happy they did a
zero-carbon-footprint overall on the movie.  And the making of the ark was phat.  I'm SO glad they
didn't use solid wood for it.  Wood coated steel is much mo betta.  And donating to Habitat for
Humanity.  Good job.</p>

<p>Returned the movie and got Simpson's movie shorts and some movie in which Ami is interested.  It
looks like quite a girl flick, but we'll see; it could be funny.  I forgot the name.</p>

<p>Now we're watching some sort of individual sports thing.  Some stuff that I would like to try.
One is called Monster Box, another is Shot Gun Touch, and the first we saw was The Cell, and I
wanted to do it, but after seeing these last two, I'm way more interested in trying them.</p>

<p>I'm gonna look for Wikipedia entries on them.</p>

<p>nothin' on the English site, and no pictures on the Japanese site; sorry.</p>

<p>We watched Phat Girlz; I actually liked it a lot more than my sneering comments above might
indicate.  I actually wrote to the actress Mo'Nique who played the lead role in the movie.</p>
