<p>What's the opposite of &quot;blind&quot;?</p>

<p>The workshop today didn't leave me reeling in my newfound magic sight, but I did have some
interesting experiences.  I am interested in the Isis work she was talking about.  I had never
really understood the need to unlearn everything; the deconstruction of belief systems before
enlightenment process can begin.</p>

<p>My ability to wind up or down my emotions surprised me.</p>

<p>Going back tomorrow.  I plan to be at least the opposite of 2 minutes late.</p>
