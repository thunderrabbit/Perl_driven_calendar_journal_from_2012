<p>On the way home, I stopped in Shibuya for 1.5 hours of free hugs, including being
video-interviewed by a guy who got a decent amount of footage with a high rate of huggage.  The guy
seemed to have a french accent and a translator to help him communicate with Japanese, which came in
handy for everyone but me, I guess, including the two girls I joined for free hugs that day, which
by the time he arrived had turned into four girls.</p>

<p>It was freeeezing, and despite a hand warmer given to me by one of the girls, I was too cold to
happily give hugs so I gave myself a break, them each a hug, and went home.</p>
