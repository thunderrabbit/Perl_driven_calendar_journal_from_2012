<p>I'm going to post a vid to youtube (it's old news to me, but not everyone).</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yiRIdlb88tg"> </param> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yiRIdlb88tg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"> </embed> </object></p>

<p>Oh, I suddenly remember something I thought about in the shower this morning.  The insurance
companies paid jillions of dollars (I can't remember if it was B or T, but I sure know it was more
than most people would need to retire), so shouldn't they be driving the investigation?  They've
got the cash to do such an investigation; why don't they???</p>

<p>I've put some stuff I've collected up on my site; I think I'll buy airplaneday.com now.
(actually after the vid is done uploading (which means after breakfast, cause my timeslot for
breakfast is coming soon)).</p>

<p>Uncompressed version of above vid is 59MB: <a href="http://airplaneday.com/documentation/videos/lectures/Jeff_King_on_demolitions.mp4">airplaneday.com:
