<p>Natalie just called me from the GET Handover and I got to talk to Greg and Adriana!  Great to
hear their voices after two (2) years!!!  Adriana just finished a voyage and Greg is leaving
*tomorrow*..  wowowowowwowwoww</p>

<p>Interesting; I just noticed that the poster I've had up in my room for almost a year is for that
voyage.  I think I'll give it to someone from that voyage's GET team once they get back.</p>
