<p>Got an email from Jackie looking for information about Japanese theater, about which I know less
than Jackie.  But I do know Satoko probably knows more than Jackie, and probably knows people who
know more than Mr Theater about the topic.</p>

<p>But I hadn't written to Satoko in a while, so I'm starting with &quot;HI! is this still your
email address?&quot; and will move forward from there.</p>
