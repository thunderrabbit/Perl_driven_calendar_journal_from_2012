<p>(*) I love the food just passing by in front of us for the taking, though at this particular
restaurant, it passes by along the side of each booth, using the otherwise unusable space of that
magic partition between booths which allows us to sit within inches of the other customers and
completely ignore them.</p>

<p> <a href="/images/art/drawing/2008/sushi_shop_map/sushi_shop.jpg"><img

every so often, so I decided to figure out how long it should take them to get around, based on just
counting the number of seconds they took to go by our booth.  I counted that time at 15 seconds.
So, with 48 booths, it should take 12 minutes to go past all the booths, and I estimated 2 more
minutes to go past all the sushi chefs, and added 1 more minute to go around all the corners.  Grand
total of 15 minutes.</p>

<p>But, I had a feeling that I was seeing the plates more often than that.  Timed it and found the
plates came around in approximately 8 minutes.  WTF?  How could I be off by a factor of 50%???</p>

<p>I checked my math again, checked my timing again, and everything seemed correct.  Except for just
one thing.  My answer was plainly wrong.</p>

<p>I hypothosized, then theorized, then confirmed my theory (as we can just barely see through the
glass to the chefs' area.  There are actually two (2) conveyor belts that don't intersect, but come
very close to touching just in the middle of the chefs' area.  Perfect.  My calculations and math
were vindicated.</p>
