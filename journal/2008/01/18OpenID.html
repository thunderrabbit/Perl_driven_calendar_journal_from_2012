<p>Bluh.  I imagine there exists a few simple php modules that will let me log in with OpenID.  I've
created two openIDs: thunderrabbit.robnugen.com and thunderrabbit.myopenid.com.  I've tried to
create two different things that will log in with openID.  Ironically I can log in with
robnugen.com, but not with the other, which seems to be more strict about the &quot;return_to&quot;
URL.</p>

<p>I've seen some sites that seem to implement this quite easily.  How do they do it?</p>

<p>Later, after <a href="http://remix.nin.com/">remixnin</a>g my song a bit more, I'll start with
this search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=php+openid+consumer+code">php openid
consumer code</a>.</p>
