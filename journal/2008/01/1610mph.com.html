<p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=DdR41fe9Zeg">10 MPH</a> is an inspiring video of these two
dudes who quit their corporate jobs and documented their trek across the US on a Segway.</p>

<p>You can see 10 MPH on

<p>I can confirm I haven't gotten any spam from ourstage as a result of signing up.</p>

<p>Why am I suggesting this call to action when there are bigger calls to be done?  Because
supporting people who quit their corporate jobs will systematically take down the corporate machine,
and the corporate machine is the reason for all this war nonsense anyway.</p>
