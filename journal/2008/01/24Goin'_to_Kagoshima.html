<p>Well-ontime for departure.  I just cleaned up the above dream journal entry after arriving here
(at the same computer spot as last time I went to Kagoshima around 27 December) at about 8:28am.
Was supposed to get to the airport by 8:20 (which I did); the flight is at 9:20.</p>

<p>Had the slightest of interruptions going through the security gate, behind, by the way, an old
guy in a wheel chair, whose was pushed through by one of the security guys (actually girl).  He
could have a bunch of knives inside the chair or it could be transformed into a thing made of
aluminum tubes and things that can fit inside such tubes, plus four wheels!</p>

<p>He wasn't the cause of my delay; something beeped when I went through the first time, but then I
emptied my pockets further (gloves, book, trash) and when I and they went through separately, no
beeps.</p>

<p>Okay; getting off my computer now; this location isn't conducive to good posture, especially in
my neck.</p>
