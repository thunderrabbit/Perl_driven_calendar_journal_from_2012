<p>Saw three lost-lookin' guys at Yamanote Line gates; I was like, &quot;do you need help?&quot; and
they did.  The needed to go to Hanzomon line (which is four or five levels down and over there).
But they also needed to go to an ATM that would work.  We tried three but no success.  Therefore,
unfortunately (?) when we got to the Hanzomon Line, the last train had passed.  D'oh!  They will be
able to go as far as Nagatcho, but then will be takin' a taxi to their hotel.  They said they hadn't
eaten since 7am, and I was about to give them some cash, but they were like, &quot;nonononono we
still have 10,000 yen,&quot; so I was like, &quot;aight&quot; and they went on their way.</p>

<p>They told me their names, but I instantly forgot.</p>
