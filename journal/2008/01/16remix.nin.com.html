<p>I'm really enjoying <a href="http://remix.nin.com/">remix.nin.com</a>.  I think I'll try my hand
at shredding some beats.  Just not right now.</p>

<p>My favorite song today was <a href="http://remix.nin.com/play/mix?id=4307">The Twilight The
World Went Down</a>.  I flubbed up my comment on the song though; pretty funny:</p>

Dude that was hella dope

<del>BUT</del> I was like, Oh Shit!!! in a great way when the last
song kicked in

but then I was like OH NOES!! when it faded out!!!

Do you have 100G<del>e</del><ins>i</ins>gs of RAM to mix it a bit longer???
