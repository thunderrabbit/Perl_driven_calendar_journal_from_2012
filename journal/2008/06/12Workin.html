<p>Been actually sorta busy today working on the wiki once I got the email crap sorted out enough
that °æ¹ç¤µ¤ó could send the emails that she's been wanting to send for a while.  Basically I added
a search by userid because the SQL query that I fixed (it was timing out before) is still not good
enough to select *all* the users JOINed with various tables to get the data we need for sending.  I
believe that the tables could have been organized in a way that would be much closer to 3NF so they
could actually do things like, work.</p>

<p>Anyway anyway, close to heading out; I was going to write about Megumi in this entry, but I'll
give her her own (and pre-date it).</p>

<p>I also emailed Akiko and Kaoru to see if they'd be interested in paying for time featuring my good
English talkin' skillz.</p>
