<p>Been focused on job search at work today; I updated my pics of small canvii in my wiki, got my
Rob Update sent out, set up a meeting for Friday with Petya for a possible part time job doing
newsletter editing, and blabbed a bit with Dude, Jesse, Fred and James... based on a thread that
Jesse sent about the problem of having too many old/unproductive people burdening social
security.</p>

<p>Now: worktime.  I'll prolly stay late today as well.</p>

<p>But still planning to visit Kevin and pick up some books in the evening.</p>
