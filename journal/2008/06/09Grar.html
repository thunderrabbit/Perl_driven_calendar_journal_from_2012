<p>I've been asked to make a little change to something.  Basically someone hardcoded 50, and now we
want more.  In two seconds I can bump the limit to, perhaps 500000, which should last a function of
that many orders of magnitude longer than however long 50 lasted (1.75 years).</p>

<p>Then I pointed out that the top of the output and the bottom of the output were not actually
related, including not with the 50.  (bottom limit had already been bumped to 100000, which
exceeded system memory (which of course makes moot the proposed &quot;fix&quot; of boosting 50 to
500000.))  They were like, &quot;oh, yeah, so can you split them?&quot;</p>

<p>Sure.  What corresponding change would you like done to the interface?</p>

<p>I can't say that in Japanese, but I did ask, &quot;when you want this, what do you want to
click?  and  when you want that, what do you want to click?&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, it's simple Japanese, the core concepts being &quot;if want, what click?&quot;</p>

<p>They didn't understand what I was trying to ask.</p>

<p>So, yes, I could have gotten pissed at them for not immediately intuiting the obvious question.
I mean, what do they expect?  mind-reading computers?  ((Sure, that may come soon enough, but the
technology doesn't exist yet in Windows XP, and there are no interface hooks for it in PHP, though
perhaps we could rewrite this in Perl and find something useful on sourceforge, but I digress.))</p>

<p>So, I did get pissed, but held it back (?) behind measured slow Japanese trying to explain,
&quot;yeah, so until now, if you click this, you get both.  From here on, you want to click this
and sometimes get that and sometimes get this.  What change should be made here?&quot;</p>

<p>Still didn't get it.</p>

<p>Finally, I *think* she sorted through the concepts and realized oh, well, if I .... (no time to
waste on this entry; I've gotten the point across)....  and I was like, &quot;そう、ね&quot;
(basically a form of agreement, like, &quot;yep.&quot;)</p>

<p>And she suggested adding more options to the bottom of the list (we want to allow either option
for any of the 5 options; we need a different dimension) so I was thinking, &quot;look I'll fucking
read your mind and give you what you want before you know you should already know you need
it,&quot; but I'm not sure how to say that in Japanese.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm just pissy about this income stream going away soon.  Gah.</p>
