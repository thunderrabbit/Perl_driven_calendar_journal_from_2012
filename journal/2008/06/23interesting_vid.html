<p>Describing physical earth changes coming soon to a planet near us, and that the answers we need
can be found within us.</p>

<pre>
As the linear mind tunes out, and the psychic mind comes in, most people will no longer be with it.
They will try to function in the logical straightforward linear way, when really everything becomes
psychic. There's a higher level psychic mind of the earth, of the stars coming in, and most people
will simply lose it in this because nothing will make sense.  And so those who are completely tuned
in will be able to go with these changes.
