<p>Jen is in town!!  So great to see her, Liv, and Aiko again.  We met up in Shinagawa and ended up eating at Denny's after every Japanese option was overflowinly booked ('cept that we did enjoy an appetizer at Lawson's).  Liv is back in Japan cause she likes her Japanese boyfriend..  She passed the Level 2 Japanese test!!  Wowowowow!!  I'm so impressed.  Jen's sissy is preggers, and Jen is hard at work on her degree, which she should finish this spring (in OZ).  Aiko is an English fluent salaryman who likes to quaff a few brewskies now and again.  She didn't say much during our chat.  Nor did I, but I think I got more words in than the old-Rob of yesteryear.</p>

<p>Meeting Jen tomorrow morning to show her Motosumiyoshi and go check out Tsunashima.</p>
