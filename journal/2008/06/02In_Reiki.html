<p>&quot;In Reiki&quot; doesn't mean anything per se; I just wanted something in the early end of
the alphabet.</p>

<p>Each time I do my reiki energy work, I set my alarm for three minute snooze, and when it goes
off each three minutes, I move to the next chakra to charge.</p>

<p>Each time the alarm goes off, my brain has invariable gone to some new topic, and often seems to
have a significance as its interrupted by the alarm.  Random silliness  Probably.</p>

<p>The most recent <del>two</del> <ins>three</ins> I remember:

<ol>
<li><p>ask Teddybear Tomoko to help me make Jacques Rabbit</p></li>

<li><p>the ringing in my ears seems like several tones all mixed</p></li>

<li><p>invite Megumi to meditate</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, now I've got my computer on the floor so I ....  Why not just jot them on a piece of paper
so I don't have to flip over each time to type?</p>

<p class="date">8:19am JST</p>

<p>Okay, these were from earlier this morning:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>listening to ringing / embarrassed to say I ahve a crush on Megumi</p></li>

<li><p>what if I had had Tokyo I-group before TJ Bike ride?</p></li>

<li><p>dream girl buy bread with no money:</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I think the cashier is going to sort me out.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I doubt it.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>dream watching someone put a new filter in the fish tank</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;The fish only eat real food, not wait for tapes.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Wait - did I miss one?</p></li>

<li><p>Dream</p>
<p class="dream">resetting the alarm for the next time</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="date">8:23am JST</p>

<p>The final two seem to be examples of simply knowing the alarm will go off right about that
moment.</p>
