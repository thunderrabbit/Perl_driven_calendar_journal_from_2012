<p>Today's been great, and we're only halfway done...  It's included getting contacts for me to wear
while bungy jumping tomorrow, taking pics at
the <a href="http://www.orientaltravel.com/province/city/area/Macau_Ruins_of_St_Pauls.htm">ruins of
St Paul's Cathedral</a>, visiting a Daiyo (Japanese store that sells all kindsa stuff), with the
distinction that this store is bigger than any Ami has seen in Japan.  (I had never heard of it.)
Then we got lovely foot/calf and back/arm/head massages, then went to a great Vietnamese restaurant
where I enjoyed overhearing the accent of a woman who I'd bet is from New Zealand.</p>
