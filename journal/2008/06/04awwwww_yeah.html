Hey Uncle Ian!

I just got your email address from Jen who said you plan to start up
business again in Tokyo.  I didn't hear details from her, but she said
basically that you'll be here in July and looking for a runner and
computer person.

I'm looking for work starting at the end of June, so hopefully we can
sort something out.

  Talk soon
   - Rob!
