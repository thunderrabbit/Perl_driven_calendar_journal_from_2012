<p>Been pretty sorta busy at work, adding pages to the wiki, revamping old pages.. this is great
practice at making documentation; it's way harder than I even suspected, and I thought it would be
difficult.  Well, I thought it would be tedious, but I started documenting without having drawn out an
overview of what I wanted the documentation to look like, and in some ways, that's been
difficult.</p>

<p>BUT, I don't know what a documentation map would do except be a map already, so I didn't make
it.</p>

<p>I gues the real issue is having started with the wiki, where image filenames are not easily
changed, and everything I enter just vanishes into the black box of the DB.  I don't always know
what all has been entered and what all needs to be entered and how new things compare to ones that
have already been entered.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>Just about to go take a bit of a break.</p>
