<p>Nice. Just had an interview with a guy named Malek, who's got a company quite close to my
current job in Shibuya.  Nice to hear that I gots the skillz fo' which they be searchin'; we may
sort out a situation whereby I can work with them on a by-project basis, the by-product of which
would be that I'd have some free time to do some of my-projects like u.cow and meditizzle and
reiki and shiatsuのやつ. (*)</p>

<p>Malek seems quite cool; he knows peeps from Peace Boat, including Emily, Mariko, and maybe one
other person he mentioned.  He didn't know Jen, but she's pretty new school in the PB world.  I
shoulda mentioned Nat, but it's allll good.  Malek apparently isn't hyper-fluent in Japanese, which
I appreciate in a way, but he was nodding his head toward some spoken Japanese that I wasn't
getting.</p>

<p>As 中谷さん and Sho were chatting in Japanese, I looked up at the walls which featured big white
panels which had been used/designed as whiteboard panels, on which some meeting presentation had
been presented, and also featured some funny cartoonish stuff.</p>

<p>Looks like my kind of environment.</p>

<p>(*) のやつ is pronounced noyatsu, の indicates possession, やつ means stuff.  So shiatsu's stuff,
or &quot;stuff having to do with shiatsu,&quot; or in English we'd just say, &quot;shiatsu
stuff,&quot; but shitastu noyatsu rhymes.</p>
