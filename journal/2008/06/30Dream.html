<p>I remember a bit of my dream from this morning:</p>

<p class="dream">riding bicycle quickly down the street, and unsafely so a cop tried to stop me,
but I blew past him and even tried to grab on his hand and drag him along as I went by as sortof a
punishment for trying to stop me.  Arrived at the hotel where Mark lives and found out that a guy
at my new work is leaving and he was crying a tearful farewell to his coworkers and then he told me
something positive about my new job.</p>
