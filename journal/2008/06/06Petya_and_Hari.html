<p>Met Petya and Hari (a man named by a man from India (*)), who'd like to put their monthly
newsletter online.  The system they're using has some issues, and I've assured them they can take
control of the newsletter and it will be all great.</p>

<p>I requested 3000 yen per hour, but better than that, I met these two who are doing the exact
type of work I'd like to be doing.</p>
