<p>Woke up early to play with Jen, meeting at Musashi-Kosugi and
seeing her happy shock expression as we rolled into the new-to-her
Motosumiyoshi station on the new-to-everyone Meguro Line extension (to
Hiyoshi).</p>

<p>Walked down good ol' Bremen Dori through all the nanners and past all the bananers, reminiscing antics of all manners, until we arrived at our old manors, now featuring carpet, including the bannisters!</p>

<p>We snuck like sneaks around the house, getting happy snaps of the new kitchen where the fridges used to be, the old boxes where the kitchen used to be, the new tiny couches where the huge ones used to be, and the new tiny table where the big one used to be, and the new heated toilet seats where DO NOT USE signs used to be!</p>

<p>Upstairs we had a peep, then a peep peeped out of his room and we regailed him with all our antic-adventure stories as he politely smiled through it all.  He's Robin, and has been in the house for two nights, the most recent of which was spent *not* in his room because he locked himself out!  He's from England and has been in Japan for a week.</p>

<p>Got his digits just in case they come in handy, then strolled back to the station and rolled back to ol' Tsunashima, and strolled back to the rolling waters of ghetto river, where I slurped ice cream and remembered the good times, good times.</p>

<p>The sidewalk over the river is wider, which we noticed on the way to our original building back in 2003.  Then Jen was delighted to find Shake-n-bake on the same bus to Kawasaki as she mimicked the overhead speaker and recounted to dread of the ride to dreadful NOVA each day.</p>

<p>Rezona in Kawasaki where we looked for the least appropriate gift for her sister's baby (still in the oven):  a single piece of train track? scissors?</p>

<p>Then popped around the shortest escalator in the world, then to the candy shop, then back to the station and to Shibuya via Shinagawa, and I had to say bye to head to my meeting with Malek.</p>

<p>Great great great day.</p>
