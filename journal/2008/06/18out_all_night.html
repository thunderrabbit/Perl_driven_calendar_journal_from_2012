<p>It's basically 6am in Macau; we've been up and out chillin', playing with Mark.  Great fun at
the most recent bar, preceded by a tour of MGM casino, preceded by chillin' at MP3 near his
apartment, preceded by chowin' at a Thai restaurant also near his apartment, preceded by arriving
at his apartment.  It's sweet and huge compared to my crib in Tokyo!  Hmmmmm...</p>

<p>Great time but I'm so tired.</p>
