<p>At breakfast with Natalia a bit ago: we split the melon that had been left by Suzuki-san, and
she gave me some yogurt plus bread and olive oil, while I supplied zatar (given to me by Yuuka from
PB) and we chatted about randomness.</p>

<p>for some reason I can't find the shavin' part of Dan's green shaver; I take it off after each
usage to let the inner part dry, but this time they didn't seem to stay near enough so that I could
find them again.  I was planning to shave my beard and hair before heading out, but looks like that
will have to wait.</p>

<p>Plans for Macau include doing the highest bunjee jump in the world.  I hope I can do it
barefootedly, but if barefoot won't do, then I bet flipflops won't either, so I'll need to bring
some real shoes.  I tried looking for the list of rules online, but didn't find it.</p>

<p>I'm wearing the Kenyan shirt I bought from Gordon; I'll have to email pics to him.</p>
