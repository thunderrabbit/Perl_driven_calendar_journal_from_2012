<p>Today at work I finished up the Test Call (correcting transcription of a quarterly report phone
call) and sent that back to callstreet.. then I met Yumiko, the secretary for the company that owns
my company; she and I are going to work on a Japanese version of my resume.</p>

<p>Got back here and watched the video I've embedded below, and then have been clearing out my
inbox, and I've actually cleared it to pre-Hong Kong levels.  I've got 67 messages in my inbox, two
of which are unread and 23 of which are starred (basically means I should (have) look(ed) at these
(a long time ago)), so I guess that's good.</p>

<p>Oohh I need to create Marcus Lion's website.  brb.</p>

<p>And I need to create a facebook group for my upcoming parties...  eeek!</p>

<p>I'll do Facebook first cause for some reason that seems more difficult for me.</p>

<p>hmm; arguably that was more difficult: it took nearly 2 hours to create the group, invite
everyone (11 people got personalized invites), and then create two associated events!</p>

Live in Japan? Want to attend Rob's first art show *ever* ??? Rob's art will be up the whole month
of July at The Pink Cow!

<a href="http://www.thepinkcow.com/">http://www.thepinkcow.com/</a>

I will specifically be there on Sunday July 20th for my Art Show Party, (pics of most of the pieces
are here <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5hsqlj">http://tinyurl.com/5hsqlj</a>)

But there's MORE!

I will *also* be there on Wednesday July 23rd for my 14,000th Day Party!!

To the untrained eye, the parties may seem similar:

1) they're both at The Pink Cow
2) both will feature my art
3) both will feature me

But actually they'll be quite different! One is on Sunday and the next is on Wednesday!
wowowowowww!!!!

But the best part: both parties are FREE, so feel free to come to both!

By FREE, I mean all 15 of my art pieces will be on sale, and The Pink Cow has a lovely menu of
drinks and food to sip and chew!

Ami will be there, U-Cow <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu">http://u.cow.fly2.nu</a> will be there, AND his new friend 
Marcus Lion will be there as well!

So come on out for a lovely great time!
