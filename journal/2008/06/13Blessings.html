<p>On the way to work, I was like, &quot;aight God, gimme a sign; perhaps 10,000 yen toward our HK
trip would be nice.&quot;</p>

<p>Got two emails in a row from Helma: one talking about an astrology course that I'd ostensibly
like to take, and one talking about working as staff for 3 months in Lynnskill, just before 3
months working as staff in Hidden Valley (total would be July 3rd to February somethingth)</p>

<p>Wow!  Staff?  Income?  6 months in Australia doing intense personal growth work?  Sign me
up!!!</p>

<p>I called Helma to verify my Qs and she said, &quot;oh, it's volunteer staff,&quot; and then
later, &quot;well, remember Lynnskill is in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>[blink]</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Nevamind!</p>

<p>So I'm still interested in the Hidden Valley staffing thing; I hope that can be sorted out after
working for OM and then Jen can cover for me in November when she comes back to Tokyo!</p>
