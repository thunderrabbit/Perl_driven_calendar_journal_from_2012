<p class="dream">I had a pretty intensely emotional good dream this morning.  Basically a big
breakthrough in self-growth..</p>

<p>Man, I shoulda written about it when I first woke up, but basically the sense was of me leaving
behind the old me and old beliefs, like stack of old papers I had been carrying around for a while.
In order to do so, I had to challenge a guy of authority, and I did so despite fear, and with
conviction; I did it and felt all good. </p>

<p>And, normally after such an emotional exchange, I wake immediately up, sometimes as an escape
from the dream.  But in this morning's case, I stayed sleepingly conscious of the dream feelings,
basically cause it had turned into a good dream.</p>
