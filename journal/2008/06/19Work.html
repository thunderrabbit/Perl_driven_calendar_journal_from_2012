<p>Well, the day was more than half over.  Ami zonked out and I chatted with Mark as we surfed
until he zonked out, and then I worked for about 3 hours on a question 中谷さん asked me.  His
question is one I had answered a couple days ago for 井合さん, but this time I answered it on the
wiki, with screenshots and links to source code and such.  Then I answered his actual email and it
should be all good.</p>
