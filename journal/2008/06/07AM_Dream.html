<p class="dream">Had just withdrawn $600 from an ATM in an urban part of the US.  A young
tough-lookin' man was walking in front of me through an underground tunnel sidewalk, but turned
around like to ask questions; he was asking qestions of his other friends, and when I got outside
and climbed up the outside of a jungle gym to get away from him, he was suddenly like, &quot;I just
broke my nose!&quot; to his friends, although there had been no scuffle / shout-of-pain / nor
anything like that.  I believed he was lying to make a diversion in which he could relieve me of my
cash, but I woke up before he could.  Haha!</p>
