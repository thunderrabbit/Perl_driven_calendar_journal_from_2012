<p>James sent us (me, Dude, Fred, Jesse), as a red herring, an email saying illegal aliens are a
blight in the US, etc.  (Here's
a <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/taxes.asp">copy of the email in
Snopes</a>)</p>

<p>Not knowing (at first (*)) James was just trying to see how we'd react, I composed my reply:</p>

<pre>
You guys remember The Sneeches, by Dr Suess?

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sneetches_and_Other_Stories#.22The_Sneetches.22">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sneetches_and_Other_Stories#.22The_Sneetches.22</a>

I believe that the details of who moved across which borders with what
skills are ultimately of no consequence, just like stars on Sneeches.

What I see in the world: a bunch of humans who are being taught by a
disruptive minority that some humans are worth more than others.  As a
result, those who are "worth more" try to keep the disparity (even
though it's a sham), and humans who have been taught they are less
valued want to become worth more.

For example, there are a low percentage of humans are using up a huge
percentage of the world's resources.  (so called 'first world
countries')..  And there's a tiny percent of humans who loudly claim
(through media) that the first world humans are more important than
the other humans.

We are also taught to discriminate based on monetary wealth,
education, body size/shape/color, beliefs, etc.

I will readily admit that I've succumbed to some of these false
beliefs.  I've got prejudices against people who I see as "fat" and
"uneducated."  As a result, I all-but-panic at the idea of becoming
fat, and I shame myself around only knowing English.  (I know some
Japanese, but I think it's "not enough," etc.)

Several enlightened beings have suggested that we are all human, and
would benefit from loving each other equally.  I tend to agree with
this idea, but sometimes I'm at a loss as to how I can do this.

I think, "man, how can I help the no-star sneeches get stars?"  But I
realize that's too big of a task.  My task is simply to be conscious
and live in integrity with myself and people around me, so I try to do
that as often as possible.

<p>(*) While I was writing, Dude replied with the reference to Snopes and James replied that he was
just looking for our reactions.</p>

<p>Since it turned out my reply was just preaching to the choir, I decided to post it in my
journal.  No need to waste good time spent/wasted at work.</p>
