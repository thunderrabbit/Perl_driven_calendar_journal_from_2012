<p>Last night, lovely Ami cooked lovely lunch and dinner and lunch and dinner for me for today and tomorrow.  I
thought I had brought enough today to stay happily full, but I did not.</p>

<p>Right now I'm at me-n-ゆりか's lesson, and I'm feelin' a bet hungry, or perhaps peckish compared
to people who are actually hungry in this world.</p>

<p>I feel blessed to get a drink *and* a potato curry bread thing; ゆりか usually buys me a drink
(I'm not charging all that much for our lessons), and today I said I was hungry so would prefer
food, and it turns out the drink was free with food purchase plus point card.  So for the same
price as normal (plus point card), ゆりか got me a drink and foodage.</p>

<p>Speakin' of foodage, the vegan night at Pink Cow is tonight.  I specifically didn't reserve a
place so that I can stay a bit better in my money spending plan, but I may zip over there after
this just to say HI and get Uncle Cow pics with peeps.</p>
