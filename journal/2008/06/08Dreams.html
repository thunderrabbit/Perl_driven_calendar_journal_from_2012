<p class="dream">some bad guys were shining lights on buildings to make it look like a plane was
going to hit them,  and I looked over a wall to see who it was and they saw me and had rifles and
were going to shoot, so I ran up the hill and told my youth to get away from the area and we ran
inside this building, but it was all glass windows, and Marcel and I started looking online to see
what we could learn about these guys and I figured out where we should run next if they shot
through the glass from the street and then woke up.</p>

<p>According to my dream</p>

<p class="dream">The 52nd PB voyabe went to San Antonio, where Tony and I rode a drop tower ride
that gave 5 seconds of freefall.  Someone asked me about the trip, and I was like, &quot;you should
ask Tony; I thnk he knows something, and then I saw Tony so I asked him, &quot;have you ever been
to San Antonio?&quot;  he shook his head no.  &quot;Have you ever heard of Texas?&quot;  he shook
his head no.  &quot;Have you ever seen a cruise ship?&quot;  He shook his head no.   And then I
looked over at the woman whom we were tricking, and was like, &quot;we were on the same voyage
together.&quot;  and hen we shared the story of riding the drop tower together.  We were
well-versed at telling shis sotry, and basically in unison described it and mimed falling for five
seconds and ten rolling back onto our backs.  Fun times.</p>
