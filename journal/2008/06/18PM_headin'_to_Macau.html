<p>Everything smooth sailin' so far.  I seem to have plenty of HK dollars (35,000 should be enough
for 4 days I imagine.  I just changed a bit under 40,000 yen, which would be plenty for 3 weeks in
Tokyo, and I didn't think quite fast enough to tell Ami *not* to change any currency, but..  anyway,
we'll be rich during this trip.  My most expensive expenditure will be falling from the TALLEST
BUNGY TOWER IN THE WORLD, which should clock in at about 2000 HKD.  Might jump twice (if I don't
relieve myself during freefall) just because it will be my only chance to do so for a while.</p>

<p>Anyway, we're eatin' fast food, plenty of time until our flight requires our presence for
boarding.</p>

<p>Got a picture of U-Cow during checkin.  Looking forward to a lovely trip with safe and happy
arrival back home.</p>
