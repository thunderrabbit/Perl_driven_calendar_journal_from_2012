<p>Nice irony here on my last day of work.  I was happily working on U-Cow's and Marcus Lion's
websites when °æ¾å¤µ¤ó asked me to update a file in SVN.  Basically he wanted me to change all
occurences of test.ourtestserver.jp and test2.ourtestserver.jp to test.ournewtestserver.jp and
test2.ournewtestserver.jp.</p>

<p>The change was trivial, so, even though it would benefit the company if someone who would be
here knew how to make the change, I made the change and committed it to SVN.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay; I committed it to SVN.&quot;</p>

<p>Two seconds later, I did an SVN status, and it said server not found.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this was directly related to them making the change, but the not-found server
was ourtestserver.jp, on which our SVN server is running.  I told them to outsource it.  I have a
sneaky feeling that they're about to have three disparate working directories and a dead SVN
repository to which they can't connect.</p>

<p>I hope it all gets resolved soon.</p>
