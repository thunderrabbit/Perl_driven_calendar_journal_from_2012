hey Rob- I can't offer you a full time job- but actually i was wondering if you could help me build
or at least give me a days tutorial on building a website. I have some money that I would love to
offer you, as a compensation for your help.

After this weekend, my next availability would start June 23rd..  and as of now, my schedule
starting June 23rd is clear.

  Thanks!
