<p>OFF on the Slashdot Effect:</p>

<pre>
da1l6	the initial URLs are installed in/usr/share/off/initial_workspace/local_URLs.txt
da1l6	they should contain 7 nodes
Kabuto	Hia all! I seem to be having the same problem as plink. All default OFF nodes register as offline, so no way to connect to the network and try it out.
plink	That's right. Those 7 urls were there when I first started OFF.
da1l6	Kabuto, is it an install or self build? what OS?
plink	If the bootstrapping was working, there should be gazillions of online peers. OFF has been mentioned on slashdot.
Kabuto	da1l6: ubuntu amd64 pkg
da1l6	try adding 90.134.11.195:54012 to the nodelist
plink	da1l6: Happened to me on a self-built (cli-version, the gui wouldn't compile) and the gui thing I downloaded from sf.
plink	Ubuntu Hardy AMD64 here, too.
plink	How do I "asknodelist" from the gui thing?
hpj	the faq says "System rules assure that hash collisions cannot be propagated." how is that exactly?
da1l6	plink, this should happen automatically (as long as there is at least one node online)
plink	da1l6: Ta.
Kabuto	da1l6: isn't there some online node list site or smthing for OFF?
hpj	intuitively, i think the excessive use of random data will unavoidably lead to hash collision in a very short time
da1l6	hpj, the propability for 2 random blocks to have the same hash is 2^-80 afaik
da1l6	Kabuto, no there is not
Kabuto	da1l6: so there is no way for newcommers to get connected until any of those nodes comes up?
da1l6	unfortunately yes :(
hpj	da1l6: yes, now use the birthday dilemma and calculate how fast a collision in 2^80 can happen
Spectral_Morning	well, if you consider 50 quadrillion times the age of the universe a "very short time", I agree about the hash collisions.
Andylee	hi
Andylee	spec.
Andylee	there was a suggestion on a forum...
Andylee	to analyse the data of a file... the 0 and 1 and find similar strings of them to reduce file sice...
Kabuto	in that case someone should make those nodes come up fast, because poor slashdotters will get a negative impression of off
Spectral_Morning	slashdot?
da1l6	slashdot?!
Andylee	I think that's silly but I don't relly find the wrong part in it ;)
Spectral_Morning	please tell me, no.
Kabuto	yeah, OFF is/was on /.
mibbit	Sorry, the mibbit client doesn't understand that yet, please email us and request it as a feature!
hpj	well, i believe if you collect all data indexed by google, cut them into 128 KB pieces and hash them, you will likely get hash collision already
Kabuto	<a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/30/1214220&from=rss">http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/30/1214220&from=rss</a>
hpj	and quite a lot of them
Spectral_Morning	oh fuck.
da1l6	omg ,thats propably the WORST possoble timing!
Spectral_Morning	fuck, fuck, fuck.
tonofun	<a href="http://www.p2pchat.net/security.php">http://www.p2pchat.net/security.php</a> is an ivalid url :-(
Spectral_Morning	front page of YRO.
thunderrabbit	I came via slashdot
tonofun	me too
plink	I came via /. too.
Spectral_Morning	fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck fuck.
hpj	now back to the statement "System rules assure that hash collisions cannot be propagated."
plink	(I've been playing with freenet and i2p for a couple of weeks, so off looked interesting.)
hpj	can anyone explain what "system rule" is making sure that collision doesn't happen, and how?
thunderrabbit	I was able to add the IP that da16 mentioned a bit ago, but none of the others listed in the local_URLs.txt file
Spectral_Morning	ok, I'm dePurifying my main node.
Spectral_Morning	it should be more responsive shortly
Kabuto	Spectral, seems to be working :)
Spectral_Morning	oh this is Not good.
Spectral_Morning	this is Not Good At All.
goblin	Hello
Spectral_Morning	we're not ready to scale!
goblin	I've just installed an OFF client and it seems it can't connect to any node
yob	heh
	yob is sensing a pattern
Spectral_Morning	don't tell me, Debian?
goblin	it's got 7 IPs it knows about and can't connect to any of them -- is that normal?
goblin	Spectral_Morning, yeah, the .deb package from sourceforge
goblin	should I build from source?
da1l6	try adding 90.134.11.195:54012 to the nodelist
hpj	well, maybe all p2p projects in its start phase should have a slashdot response strategy in the first place...
goblin	da1l6, yay! that worked :-) thanks! :-)
mad	Is there any way to move the storage directory without changing the install directory of the OFF exe?
Spectral_Morning	yeah, well I've been too busy working on our SEGFAULT response strategy.
hpj	what exactly is the system bottleneck?
hpj	the "search engine"?
thunderrabbit	woah!
thunderrabbit	my node list just jumped to a full page +
da1l6	mad, yes switch the GUI to developer mode and select "Configure Cache locations" from the File menu
mad	da1l6: kk thx
Comet	hi everyone
Comet	anyone here
Comet	?
da1l6	yes
Comet	just got curious about off since it seams to deal with lots of the issues of bittorrent
Comet	but in terms of speed
Comet	is it fast?
Spectral_Morning	right now. no
Spectral_Morning	thank fuck.
CaptainMorgan	hey
CaptainMorgan	who the fuck did that?
Spectral_Morning	I know not.
hpj	"lots of the issues of bittorrent"?
Spectral_Morning	glad the summons worked though.
Spectral_Morning	eye of newt and all that. :)
da1l6	CaptainMorgan, do you run a bootstrap node?
CaptainMorgan	always here for you
CaptainMorgan	It is shut down now
CaptainMorgan	I guess I should put it back up
da1l6	please bring it up ASAP
CaptainMorgan	that machine was being flaky
hpj	i'm not seeing a lot of similarity to bittorrent
CaptainMorgan	firing it now
Comet	not like it
CaptainMorgan	have people been showing up?
da1l6	lots ---->
thunderrabbit	aye, captain
hpj	judging by the size of this channel, i'd say the slashdot effect could've been much, much worse
CaptainMorgan	hey guys
Comet	well on paper from what i can see on the site off has quite some good possibilities to over take other popular systems..
CaptainMorgan	yes, it is a different way of thinking about p2p storage
CaptainMorgan	still working out some of the details though
Comet	does the program allow any sort of file?
Spectral_Morning	yes
Andylee	spec?
Andylee	Spectral_Morning:
Andylee	how is work going on?
Andylee	is the crasher going to be fixed?
Spectral_Morning	I've not found it yet, to my knowledge.
CaptainMorgan	hey Andylee
Andylee	ah, CaptainMorgan :)
Spectral_Morning	I think I might go and live in a cave for a week or two. :)
plink	Seems OFF storage is some sort of distributed implementation of Madore's "random pads": http://www.madore.org/~david/misc/freespeech.html
da1l6	CaptainMorgan, how is your node doing?
CaptainMorgan	it is coming up right now
CaptainMorgan	yes plink
CaptainMorgan	that is very much what it is, but with some additional tweeks.
CaptainMorgan	OFF finishes up some of the details that Madore didn't continue with.
CaptainMorgan	such as how to handle large files, and how to create distributable references to resources.
CaptainMorgan	and also how to manage the system as a whole.
plink	Great work. I'm looking forward to following OFF.
