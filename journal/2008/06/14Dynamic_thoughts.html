<p>Took me a while to think of a name for this entry.  Basically I decided to clean my room; I
would start with crushing all the bottles I had cleaned and had stuffed between my wall and
drawers.  I crushed one, then realized I should take a before and after of my room, and then
decided to do a video version (I've been doing that recently / sporadically, but uploaded none so
far, I think) of a state of my room vid, so I did that and then as I was taking off the lids of all
these bottles, I thought these thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>this is a waste of plastic</p></li>

<li><p>what if, as oil prices go up, plastic prices go up as well?</p></li>

<li><p>what if these bottles become valuable soon?</p></li>

<li><p>that's not going to happen soon enough.  keep throwin' them away</p></li>

<li><p>well, I could just bury them somewhere and then archaelogists in the future could find
them and have like 50 samples of our atmosphere.</p></li>

<li><p>I spent tons of time/money/energy buying, rinsing, drying, keeping these.  it's a waste of my
resources!</p></li>

<li><p>I've wanted to use them as raw materials for an art project.</p></li>

<li><p>maybe someone needs these bottles for an art project right now!</p></li>

<li><p>stop!  don't crush 'em!  put the lids back on and look for an artist who needs them.</p></li>

<li><p>maybe even *buy* them for 100 yen each!  Cause they're all clean and dry!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I put the lids back on and wrote this entry.</p>

<p>My room was a mess; now its worse.</p>
