<p>Tonight was the last night for us to meet at Amy's apartment for
meditation; she's going back to the US so we won't be able to use
it.</p>

<p>During the first sitting (perhaps 30 minutes), I got the dramatic
sense that I can't possibly do this; I just can't sit any longer; I'll
never be able to sit for as long as it takes to make breakthroughs in
consciousness.  In short, I'll never become enlightened (this
lifetime).</p>

<p>And I cried a bit to myself, and I kept sitting.</p>

<p>Also got the sense that this ‚Å‚«‚È‚¢ feeling is due to having died
in a cramped situation, causing fear of super enclosed places
(sometimes I have scary dreams of being enclosed in tight rock cave
and can't get out).</p>

<p>At the end of the evening, Helma announced that there will be a
building crew going to Sydney to work on the Clairvision school this
summer in OZ.  I'm like, "count me in, baby!" though I'm not sure how
I'll get airfare, etc.  But I look forward to going.  Should be
sweet!</p>

<p>And by sweet I mean hella work, both physical and emotional, going
for the spiritual connection.</p>

<p>Also tonight, I cited the goddess character Elyani as my favorite,
and an inspiration.</p>
