<p>Bungy jumping was incredible.  After doing that, I was like, &quot;I can go home happily
now,&quot; but</p>

<p>The Venetian is equally incredible, for totally different reasons.</p>

<p>So so super duper thanks to Mark for hosting us in Macau for the last few days...  we did so
much that is seems like a full week.</p>

<p>But, it's not even over; about to go to MP4 now!</p>
