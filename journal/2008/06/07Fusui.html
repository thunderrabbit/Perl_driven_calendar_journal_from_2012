<p>Chillin' with Kevin in a gently run-down hotel in Hakone after the first half of the Space
Clearing workshop with Karen Kingston.  I personally didn't get all that much out of it, but I
greatly plan to go through the Clutter Clearing workshop handout from last week and clear the
clutter from my crib.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, part of the reason it's been slow goin' stems from the workshop being
translated after every sentence, which is just part of the deal with workshops across languages.</p>
