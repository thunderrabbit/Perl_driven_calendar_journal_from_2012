<p>Special thanks to Levi for backing me up beat box style (he was hilarious) as I performed the
alphabet game rap, thinking of Fred a lot.  Didn't think to record it, but it woulda been a good
thing to have on YT; I don't perfrorm that very often.  I guess Levi and I can do it in studio, but
it's not the same as lve, feeding off the crowd and telling the story of the game creation, etc.</p>

<p>During the end of the show, I went upstairs to chat with Megumi cause it was too loud
downstairs. I wanted to inquire about her spiritual development and told her some of mine.  She
mentioned specifically that spiritually awakened people seem to be attracted to her in this
life.</p>

<p>I tried to remain open and awake uring our chat.  Nice times.</p>

<p>The talent show was ad hoc and lovely, designed to bring money to Burma children's fund or
something.  Jo(Anna) put together the show and is a friend of Megumi so that's how they all got
involved.  Many PB people were there, and a good dose of non PB as well.</p>

<p>Nat and Rose did a merengue spouse slapping dance, and  though I recorded it, it's too dark to
really show up.  I recorded Levi singing two songs; they should turn out okay, though I had my
finger over the mic at first on the first song.  He wrote the second song yesterday, just for Burma
and this show.</p>

<p>He won fourth place in the show (15 performances)</p>

<p>Other performers included Taka on ukulele with Jen on vocals, and earlier in the show (right
after Levi and I (we were first!)) Jamie on guitar with Hazuki on digeridoo!</p>

<p>Talked to Rose a bit, gave her a followup on Clairvision after Kevin did the ISIS 101 classes;
I'm looking forwrrd to doing the same.</p>

<p>Really glad to have met Megumi; she seems like a cool soul in a nice ride.</p>
