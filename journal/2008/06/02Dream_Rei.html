<p class="dream">Nice time hanging out with Rei (from 52nd, etc) in an outdoor park / wooded area.
I watched as she was reading a letter from her grandfather, talking about some historical cultural
stuff like how women were described as the flower of the household, and a certain type of poem had
88 characters because this represented 7.8 * 11, which represented something else.</p>

<p class="dream">Otherwise, no real specific conversation nor activity, but we were alone and
sitting on the ground.  She asked me why I was half dressed; I was wearing shorts and a jacket, even
though it was cold.  I tried in vain to explain something that made sense, but it just seemed like
foolishness when I said it.  I asked something, and she answered she was cold, and I woke up
gently.</p>

<p>I was cold; I seemed to have halfway escaped my sleeping bag.</p>
