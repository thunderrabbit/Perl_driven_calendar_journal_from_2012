<p>Well.  That's interesting.  Two developers at the company where I all-but-had a new job, have
left, meaning they now want to hire someone who has big .NET and VB skillz, of which
all-but-have-not.</p>

<p>So I'm back on the job search.  Woooo!</p>

<p>Ah.  I'm going to call Taka <em>right now</em> to see about workin' at PB.</p>
