<p>Lazy morning, though I did my reiki and even did meditation for 30 minutes.  (Before today, for
some months, I've generally just been doing reiki, and no meditation)</p>

<p>During my meditation I noticed something that I'm not sure I can articulate now, but hang
on..</p>

<p>Along the lines of asking about why emotions stay with us even if they're repressed, thinking
about Megumi's video which describes connecting with heartness and then going out to engage the
world heartfully...</p>

<p>I wondered about inviting both Megumi and Travis to ATE (Awakening the Third Eye) meditation..
Oh I just remembered Travis is officially of the mind there is no God.  Not sure what he says about
soul/spirit, but it would be interesting to invite him.</p>

<p>Anyway, I &quot;realized&quot; that I should write a wiki page of Rob's Thoughts on God, and then
wondered about Rob's Answers about God and a page for Rob's Questions about God, where I would
answer/ask questions that people would ask/answer.</p>
