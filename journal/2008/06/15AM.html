Careful Colorful Chaos

In July, The Pink Cow will feature 15 pieces of art in the bar, created by Pink Cow's newest artist:
Rob Nugen!  Each piece is colorfully freestyled, with as many interpretations as there are viewers
of art.  Nine small pieces will be available to highlight the walls of your room.  The show will
also feature 6 larger pieces, two of which are collaborations with Matt Muirhead!  All pieces will
be for sale between 3,000 and 10,000 yen.

Rob's art will up for all of July.  Meet Rob on Sunday July 20th for drinks and art show party!
