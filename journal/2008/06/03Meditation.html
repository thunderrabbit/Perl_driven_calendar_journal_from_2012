<p>Nice meditation night tonight.  Had a funny moment where I realized I would probably have a crush
on Kevin if he were in a female body this time around.  Similar happy feeling as with Megumi while
eye-contact meditating with him tonight.</p>

<p>Paid Èþ°¡ back the 5000 yen I shorted her at our last reiki thing.  She gave me a reiki
technique for securing a sweet job.  I've just been doing the reiki charging exercises, and had
sorta forgotten the deets of what else is possible.</p>

<p>Going to Space Clearing with Karen Kingston this weekend; I missed the Clearing Clutter thing
this past weekend.  I had known about it, but didn't hear more about it and thought it musta gotten
cancelled.</p>

<p>And last, um,... oh; there's going to be another ATE (Awakening the Third Eye) workshop in late
August.  It'll be bilingual, so I'll invite Ami.  I also plan to invite Megumi, Rose, and perhaps
Travis, though I don't know if he'd get into this sorta thing.</p>

<p>OH; also, we did the neti thing (basically sinus rinsing/cleansing) tonight.  Helma said it took
her a year of daily practice before she really felt the effects, but I'm thinkin' that after that
much time.., well, I have no idea, but perhaps I'm wondering if I could last a year of doing it
without getting positive results.</p>

<p>Talked to Kevin at the Indian restaurant tonight.  I realized I no longer feel &quot;less
than&quot; him because he's done all this traveling and training with shamans and in ashrams and
learned parts of 20 languages, etc.  We were just hanging out and being silly.  Fun times.  He also
gave some good input on my job search.</p>

<p>I'll be rockin' over to his house tomorrow to look at the books he's planning to sell to Blue
Parrot.</p>
