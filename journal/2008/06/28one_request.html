<p>I've told Ami a few times that I have one (1) ultimate request from her:  I want her truth.  I want her to speak truthfully to me no matter what.</p>

<p>I've had to tell her that more than one time, not because she's lied, but because she seems to forget that it's my request, which becomes apparent when I'm like, "yo main, whatchoo thinkin'?" and she's unable to tell me, and I'm like, you can tell me; you can tell me anything.  Do you remember the one (1) thing I want from you?"</p>

<p>no.</p>

<p>Okay, well, yeah I told you I want to know what's true for you.</p>

<p>( but that's not why I'm writing )</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves / fears / issues is when people don't listen to me.</p>

<p>So, I specified my number 2 request from Ami that I'd like her to listen to my truth.</p>

<p>So, just now when she was like, "what are you thinking?" cause we're having a bit of an issue with scheduling, and me not understanding why Ami would invite her friend to one thing, find out I'm not going, and then cancel with her friend to go to my thing.  It's a bit too stalky for me, and as I was telling her, Ami walked out of the room</p>

<p>to go pee, but it's like, <em>wtf?  I'm not just talking to you, but I'm answering your fucking question, and you walk out on my answer?</em></p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>Overall, it escalated to a pretty decent fight; she points out that I've been pretty selfish in terms of asking her to come do all various things with my friends, but I'm not as willing to go do things with her friends.  I cite the reason as basically her friends' idea of fun is to go out drinking and smoking, whereas my PB friends go out and raise money for charity while drinking (and not as much smoking), and my meditation friends go meditate.</p>

<p>I tried to explain why I think meditation is important, but my crap Japanese doesn't get the point across.  I think she thinks it's selfish.  I tried to explain it's only due to my meditation practice that I wasn't yelling at her during the fight.  If Hitomi and I had had the same fight, I would have hit the wall or overturned a desk.  But in this case with Ami and several moments of meditation under my belt, I sat calmly, just <em>noticing</em> the urges to toss shit around.</p>

<p>I thought at one point she was going to break up with me.  I hoped at one point she was going to break up with me.  But she explained what she meant by ëÂêÿÅiÇΩÇ¢ÇπÇ¬Åj, in this case, basically make efforts to spend time with your partner's friends.</p>

<p>We went to Matt's birthday party last night, and I stuck with Mark the whole night, perhaps cause he's the first of Ami's friends who I really liked, plus his wife is hot.  To a degree I have gotten past the initial shell of talking with him into more interesting topics, but not yet with her other friends (Brian and Naoki are two with whom I'd be happy to try).</p>

<p>Aight it's 10:30; I gotta get to work by noon: first day at new job, getting passwords and getting stuff sorted out so I can work tomorrow.</p>
