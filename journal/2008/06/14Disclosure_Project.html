Dear Mr President and my two senators

Thank you for reading the following with open mind and loving heart.
I know this topic may seem outlandish or unimportant, so I hope you'll
be courageous enough to at least send some members of staff to
Turnhalle in the Tivoli in Denver, Colorado - 7:30 pm, Wednesday, July
9, 2008 for a press conference sponsored by The Disclosure Project.

On July 9th, Steven M. Greer MD, the founder and director of The
Disclosure Project, will be presenting a summary of over 500
government, military, intelligence and corporate witnesses to UFO
events and projects as well as other evidence which proves that UFOs
and extraterrestrial intelligence are real.  During this conference
will be a discussion regarding the implications of the issue.

Dr. Greer, who has personally briefed heads of state, members of
Congress, a sitting CIA Director and other senior government officials
on the UFO matter will provide an overview of the subject and expose
the reasons behind the continuing secrecy.

I am asking that you encourage some of your staff to attend this
conference, where they can study this matter and that you call for
open, secrecy-free hearings at which these highly decorated military
and government witnesses may testify under oath.  I know that a
certain level of government secrecy is necessary, but the excessive,
illegal secrecy associated with these 'black' budget projects is a
threat to our way of life, our democracy and now to our national
security. It is time for it to stop.

With so many bona fide top-secret witnesses, astronauts, government
documents and other evidence in hand, a simple denial of the reality
of this subject by the government, NASA or your office will no longer
do.  Please study this matter urgently and sponsor open hearings in
the immediate future.  To receive briefing materials on this matter,
please contact the Disclosure Project office at 301-249-3915.

Thank you.
