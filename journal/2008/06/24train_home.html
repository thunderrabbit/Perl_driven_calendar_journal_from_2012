<p>Just departing Shibuya, and there's a group of youths who are trying to keep their friend
upright in the seat.  I'd say she's dangerously drunk/otherwise intoxicated, but perhaps she's
better than the drunks I see sprawled on the sidewalk from time to time.</p>

<p>They did carry her onto the train, so not much better.</p>
