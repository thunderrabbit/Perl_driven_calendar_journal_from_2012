<p>Ami and I took a taxi to The Peak, where we looked over the overlook and got some pictures of the
critters up there.  I was happy to hear Autobiography of a Yogi was simply out of stock instead of
unavailable.  We tried to take the bus to Star Ferry, but didn't have small enough change, so got
ice cream for me and then took pictures from inside the bus of the animals looking outside, and then
walked around Nathan's Rd after taking the ferry across to Kowloon (I'm still acutually confused
abut the names of which is which, but) we had a lovely time and barely made it back to Sogo in time
to meet Ami's friends Nobu, Keiko, and my <del>three</del> friend<del>s</del> Jenny (Wing couldn't
make it and I dunno about Laura (I lost her phone number and just had her email address, so perhaps
she didn't get my messages), but we had a lovely time eating in a Chinese restaurant where Nobu
accidentally ordered some delicious somethings that he thought were somethings else (and turned them
away when they arrived, but they came back with some stern words from the woman who took the
order); I enjoyed watching the genki group at the next table (wearing mostly orange, which
happened(?) to match the tablecloths and napkins in the restaurant), so I took U Cow over to meet
them and got pictures and handed out cards..  Turns out they are KLM crew, here to support EC Holland
vs Russia, and Wouter even predicted a score of 5 - 0.</p>

<p>THEN, karaoke, which was a bit different style than in Japan; still private rooms, but they were
non-smoking, and non-time limited.  We just sang and sang (I'd like to get better at a couple of
tunes I tried for the first time (Snoop Dogg's (song that includes &quot;party like it's your
birthday, ... maybe &quot;get it on&quot;), and 50 Cent's (song that I tried first tonight, and
remember basically none of it)))</p>

<p>Super incredible thanks to our lovely hosts tonight: Nobu and Keiko for largely paying for dinner, and
Jenny for largely paying for karaoke.</p>
