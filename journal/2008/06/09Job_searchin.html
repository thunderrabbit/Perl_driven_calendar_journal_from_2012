<p>About an hour ago, I felt pretty bleak about this job situation.  The waiting and wondering seems
interminable.  Just wanted to give up and go to China or back to the US or anything besides face
rejection after rejection.</p>

<p>But then I was like, &quot;stfu and buck up, buttercup&quot; to myself and started searching
anew.  Came across Gaba and know that I've applied there before for IT but didn't get it because at
that time I had no visa.  Now I've got a visa that's good until late 2010 so I told 'em that and
sent my ESL resume *and* my IT resume via gaijinpot.com.</p>

<p>Step by step.</p>

<p>See, and the weird thing is I imagine I'm likely to have the OM job in a couple months.</p>
