<p>Nice meditation night tonight.  Kevin was MC (as Helma is in Holland), and Mia was his
counterpart (as Kevin is MC).  I paired with Mia to do heart sharing, and it felt really nice.
Didn't even touch nor say a word.  Just awesome.</p>

<p>Mia and Denise rolled out right afterward, and Kevin and I stayed at Romi's for a bit  Kevin
talked about the balance he's struggling to capture with his book writing, and he shared some
stories of other  adventures that I imagine I would like to have experienced.</p>

<p>The first sitting tonight was for an hour, and I fell asleep about 10 times during it.  Just
crazy how quickly that happens.  I'm open to a solution.</p>

<p>We did a candle meditation, which basically amounts to a staring competition with a candle.
Kevin said after we close our eyes (even after watching for just a short moment), we can see a
little remnant of light (memory?) on our retinae.  He said it's good practice to see how long we can
maintain awareness of that light remnant.  Try to extend it... so I may do that.  (tonight?)</p>
