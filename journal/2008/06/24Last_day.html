<p>Hmmm; this smells like it might be my last day at this work in Shibuya.  I just met with 井上さん
and told him all I know (it's all in the wiki) and during the meeting he was like, がんばります
(I'll do my best) and stuff, and I realized, &quot;oh.... this is me passing my brain cells to the
next worker,&quot; though more realistically the work was just passed to me from him for a bit, and
I've passed it back.  Basically the website has only 20,000 users and very few paying clients; the
software was installed on the system before it was ever finished (or even fully tested)..  I'm not
so sure that this business is going to survive.</p>

<p>Yep.  Last day.</p>

<p>I'm gonna walk over to see Malik (sp) with whom I interviewed a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>In about 2 minutes, we decided to have a chat tomorrow at 4pm.</p>
