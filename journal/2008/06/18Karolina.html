<p>Just met Karolina, a Polish woman who's doing her PhD in Germany on consumer habits of Japanese
and Chinese.  Her Master's was in Japanese, or maybe undergraduate; not too clear on that.  She was
photographed by a Japanese man, cause she's pretty hot.  U-Cow got a picture with her too, just to
um, document his trip (*).</p>

<p>Her smile reminded me of Paige.</p>

<p>(*) actually because she's pretty hot</p></p>
