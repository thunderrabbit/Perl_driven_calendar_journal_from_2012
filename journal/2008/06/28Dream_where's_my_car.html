<p class="dream">With my family (dad, mom, brother) after a huge day shopping.  My dad grabbed a huge case of beer, that by al rights should have shattered cause the volume of beer was so great compared to the size of the bottles.  He hefted it up to the counter and paid for it.  Put it in the car and I was driving with my mom in passenger seat to my right, and dad and brother in the back.  I wasn't happy with the beer; I had wanted something a bit more healthy to drink.</p>

<p class="dream">It was time to leave and they were all tired, so when we got to the parking garage, t was "diriving" a shopping cart, with my family all the the back of the cart, asleep.  I was set on finding the car in the parking lot, but wasn't sure where my dad had parked it.  Went down one aisle where I thought I'd find the car, but it was a bit dark, so I couldn't see it so well, and it may not have even been that aisle.  Went down farther away than I knew it had been, tureed around and came up another aisle, still with family silently sleeping in back.  Got back up to the shopping mall, and then turned back around to go down the first aisle again, but there was a car in the way.  I lifted up the shopping cart, and a woman was like, "wtf are you doing???" and I was like, "look at that car," and she finally calmed down and realized that the cart literally wouldn't fit between the car and the next car.</p>

<p class="dream">So I lifted the cart up over the cars so I could walk through.  Then sat back down on it and rolled toward the end of the aisle, and could hear the car revving behind us; I ducked my cart into a little space, and waited for the car to go by.  Turned out it was just a motorcycle, and he actually stopped sorta next to us, and was all loud, plus stinky exhaust, so I moved my cart a bit and then turned around to check if my family was still sleeping after all the noise.</p>

<p class="dream">They were gone.</p>

<p class="dream">I was horrified, devestatedly sad.  Where's my family?  Had they fallen out while asleep?  Were they then hit by cars in the parking lot?  I saw a woman who worked in the store and was like, "I know I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy; my family was here in my cart, but they're not here now and I don't know where they are or where to look, but I know it will probably be okay."  She smiled understandingly. She reminded me of the oracle on the first Matrix movie.  I gave her a peck on the cheek as I told her, "if you don't hear any more about this, then it turned out okay."</p>

<p class="dream">I went back up to the store area, and thought I saw them, so broke through a security area, but it wasn't them.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter I woke up.</p>
