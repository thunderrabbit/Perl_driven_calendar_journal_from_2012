<p>I might have the spelling wrong, but I stood in front of a guy with a box of Krispy Kremes on his lap, and next to him a guy with two boxes of Krispy Kremes on his lap.  I was like, "are those delicious?" cause I was hungry and wanted one.  My plan worked; I was offered a doughnut and chatted with them, gave them U-Cow cards.  (where the heck is Gleb???)</p>

<p>These two guys work in Krispy Kreme, and said the line is still 3 hours long on weekdays and 5 hours long on weekends.  The line to get doughnuts, I mean.  wtf?</p>

<p>They live in Hiyoshi and at least one of them is going to school at Keio.</p>
