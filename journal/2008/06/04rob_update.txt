Guess what!

I got a job!

Guess what else!

I lost the job before the contract was signed!

My reiki master said that either I would change, or my life around me would change.
Seems that my life around me is changing.  or maybe both!

The job that I all-but-got was retracted because just a few days before I would
start (and add my broad experience to the team), two of the programmers (of 4)
quit, so now the team leader wants to fill those positions with people who know the
language and environment already.

So, I'm back on the job search.

Despite the bumpiness of life, I'm continuing to engage the types of things I
_want_ to be doing for money.  Recently, that's been reiki, meditation and painting
for my art show in July!  (* see below for dates!)

Along the lines of doing what I want to do, I'll be going to a feng shui course
this weekend, put on by Karen Kingston (<a href="http://www.spaceclearing.com/html/">http://www.spaceclearing.com/html/</a>).  I've
asked for the option of bartering instead of paying to attend.  I'll pay if that's
the only option, as I imagine this will be an investment in my spiritual
education.

In other news, Uncle Cow (<a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">http://u.cow.fly2.nu/</a>) is currently in the US with my
friend Gleb, and he should be back soon to get ready for our trip to Hong Kong and
Macau!  Ami and I already bought the tickets (months ago) so despite financial
fears, we are still planning to go at the end of this month.

(*) Okay, get ready to mark your calendars!

I'll be featured at two events in July at The Pink Cow in Shibuya!  These will be
largely the same, so you only need to come to one of them:

Sunday July 20th:  chillin' at Pink Cow with focus on my art!

Wednesday July 23rd:  chillin' at Pink Cow with focus on my 14,000th day, and my
art!

These will be casual and fun times (hence the word "chillin'"), so come as you are
and leave with some art!

I don't know exactly how it will work, but all my art pieces will be for sale, with
proceeds going to my wallet or a charity, depending on my job status at the time!

For those who don't know, I enjoy my age progression on a daily basis, and have
parties every 500 days...  No pesky annual birthday parties for me!  My Day 14,000
is coming on 23 July 2008, hence the party at Pink Cow!

If you're in Tokyo, I'd love to see you there.  Otherwise, feel free to commission
me for a personal painting!

   Love and Blessings
    - Rob!
