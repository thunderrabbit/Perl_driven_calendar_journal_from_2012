<p>I suddenly lurched awake as the train jerked to an emergency stop.  I looked up and saw the next
station was Hiyoshi; I had slept through Motosumiyoshi.</p>

<p>The conductor came onto the intercom all, &quot;uh, yeah, there's a red light, but we're going
to go to Shin Maruko.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;red light&quot; is my translation for しんごる (sp), which for a long time I thought was a
Japanese version of &quot;signal&quot; but is actually a Japanese word.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was like, &quot;<em>what?</em>&quot; cause we passed Shin Maruko; it's the third
station back from where we were!  No one else seemed to notice/care that we would be going
*backwards* on the line for a bit to get there.</p>

<p>Then he changed his story, &quot;oh, we're going to Hiyoshi,&quot; and I was much less
surprised, and everyone else seemed to be equally disinterested.</p>

<p class="date">8:19pm JST</p>

<p>We're in Hiyoshi now, and have been here since 8:11pm, when I got out and came back to the
correct-bound train to get back to my station.  This train is apparently going to Shin Maruko, but
I'm guessing I'm misunderstanding what they're saying.  Maybe he's saying there was an accident
(most likely a suicide) at Shin Maruko.</p>
