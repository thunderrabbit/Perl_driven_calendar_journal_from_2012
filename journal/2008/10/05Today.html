<p class="date">5:58pm JST Sunday  5 October 2008 (day 14074)</p>

<p>Spent most of the day in my room.  Woke up a bit late (10am?) after having been up until 3
something.  Worked for about an hour on the blue blind lines painting; basically I got 2 more lines
drawn.  Then spent maybe a couple hours on Colleen's painting, drawing the colorful part in the
bottom left corner.</p>

<p>An email exchange with Rimi resulted in scheduling a Friday evening painting for cash
exchange.</p>

<p>I called Kumi to see how her ISIS went yesterday, and she said it had been rescheduled to
today.  It was her fourth ISIS.  I haven't been in over a week, so I emailed Helma today requesting
two sessions within the next week.</p>
