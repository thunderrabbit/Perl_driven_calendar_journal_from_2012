<p>Just got a call from Ami crying.  &quot;My mom is....&quot; and then she'd take a breath, during
which I wondered the worst, &quot;My mom is ....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;in the hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>I told Ami to take care of herself and family and not worry about coming to The Pink Cow tonight.</p>

<p class="date">1:40pm JST</p>

<p>Late notice, but I invited Kanae to fill in Ami's reservation.</p>

<p class="date">3:59pm JST</p>

<p>Ami called, no longer crying.  Her mom is apparently stable and had some tests done; they'll
know what's what in a week or two.  Must not be critical... but I wonder what precipitated her rush
to le hospital.</p>
