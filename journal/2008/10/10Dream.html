<p>On the train now, but I just saw a guy with two 1000 yen bills sitting on a counter and wondered
if he'd be able to catch them if a wind picked up.</p>

<p class="dream">Inside a large foyer with glass wall and doors in the center, we could see outside
a tornado was coming.  We had no time to retreat, so I suggested we just hold fast to the railing
on the steps inside the room as the tornado approached.</p>

<p class="dream">It came closer and uder and paused  outside the glass wall.  The glass stayed
intact.</p>
