<p>Noticed that Friends For Sale no longer gives 20,000 FFS$ up to once every 4 hours for being
logged in.  And they seem to have done away with the Bounties (get extra cash for buying people
who've not yet been bought).</p>

<p>I wonder if they are trying to stop inflation within their little community.  Interesting to
imagine what's going on behind the scenes there.</p>
