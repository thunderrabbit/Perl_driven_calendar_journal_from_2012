<p>I'm writing this withou seeing more than just a fuzzy line on the screen  slowly increasing in
length.  I imagine I'm typing the correct letters because I can feel the bumps on the f and j
keys..  I just finished my 14th ISIS session with Helma, during which I  cryingly wondered wtf I am
supposed to be doing this lifetime.  Why am I here?  Why did I survive my skating accident?  Why
did i survive my TJ Bike accident 9cause I only broke my shoulder, that's why)</p>

<p>But I'm here to serve humanity and the world and I can't imagine why individual people are such
TV addicts and sleeping most of the time, and why do I think I'm doing anything different?  I don't
watch TV don't smoke, don't drink, don't do no drugs (don't do any drugs (except sugar (glucose,
not PCP)))))))))))))  but  have my own addictions to porn and eating and is this my station?
shoot because i can't see I don't know if I ust missed my station.  I think now.</p>

<p>
Anyway, part of my crying was from my imperfect body having to wear glasses and not being able to
smell so well no have two clear nostrils. for breathing purposes (I'm at my station now; i hadn't
missed it.)</p>

<p>And I realized that I don't <em>really</em> need my glasses to get home.  It's not like I need
to talk to anyone (except to get my pen back from the restaurnat where I think I left it on Friday)
and with only the slightest vision I can safely navigate the train system (now that I know where
I'm going)  Anyway, so I'm not wearing my glasses.</p>

<p>Before the ISIS session, we talked for quite a while, including shame for not paying her the
full amount, planning my spending for this month, wondering if my room has  has bad energy for
meditation, how my journal sometimes gets me in trouble when I say I'm dating Miss Houston orr
writing xoxoxoxoxox in an email that I post online.</p>

<p>I think if everyone had their iner thoughts posted online, the world would be a better place.
If there were no secrets.  In fact, I'd want this conversation to be transcribed in realtime and
posted; I would love that.</p>

<p><em>That's</em> the only reason I tote my computer around wherever I go.  It's too difficult to
take the time after the fact; I can only capture a mere whisp of the events by writing that evening
or days later.</p>

<p>Otherwise my journal woudld be like, &quot;I broke my shoulder.  I got a job.  I got laid off.
I got a new job.  I'm doing a thing called ISIS.  It's like meditaton, but more directed .  (It's
actually the &quot;opposite&quot; of meditation, but they serve similar purposes.)</p>

<p>Do I &quot;owe&quot; anything to people who read this?  Would anyone care if I stopped
writing?  </p>

<p>I would care.  that's for sure.  The future me would be like, &quot;damn I can't believe I quit
writing.  I hardly remember the cool thing that happened the very next day.   Or was it the net
week?  or the next year?  Hmmmm&quot;</p>

<p>Now in Shibuya on Toyoko Line headed home.  I called Kumi after the ISIS to begin planning an
ISIS 101 workshop.  Helma said sh would do such a workshop for just the three of us.  Me, Kumi and
Mia.  I'd lvoe beyond all recognition if Ami would be abe to join, but she'd have to do the ISIS
101 first, and she won't even contact Mia to ask about that.  She's just like, &quot;oh I can't go;
it costs too much,&quot; but  Japanese culture doesn't try to bargain prices, nor barter.  The
flyer says it costs this much, so that's how much I'd have to pay.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Kumi will contact Mia to see about her availability, and I'll contact Amy, to see about using
her cabin.<pre>
HI Amy!

How are you, my friend in The Law?

And how are you parents, my friend in the Law?

And how is your cabin, my friend in The Law?

And how would you feel about us using it fro ISIS 101?

I just did my 14th ISIS session (13th with Helma; I've done 1 with Kevin).  At the end, I was like,
&quot;when can we doo ISIS 101, oh great and magical teacher??&quot; and added, &quot;I know that as
I'm asking this, I haven't done anything to make it happen.&quot;

So, my clear fountain has inspired me to write to you.  What would it take to use your cabin for
ISIS?  HAt this point, we have three likely students (maybe 4) and one teacher.  I've heard your
cabin is big enough to support four or five people.  Would it be available for a week in the next
few months?  Would it be available for the week of New Year's holiday in Japan?

What would be the cost per day?

  Love and Light

<p>Perhaps that will work as an email to Amy.  I literally composed it here in my journal and would
copy it to an email to her  (would = will_  (copy = copy-edit)</p>

<p>Helmasaid she would talk to Mia about my attendance at the ATE.  It would be my third, and my
second to attend without paying.    Kumi, I found out, offered to be the official support person
for Helma in the circle.  Mia is the official translator, and since I didn't even think to ask
Helma bout being her official support person, I'd just be her official seasoned (?) meditator.</p>

<p>Gah; such self esteem issues steaming from my brain.  This team of meditators would be fine
withouth me; would they be better off with me?</p>

<p>In Shibuya, I went to the restaurant (put my glasses on first) but it was closed.  Dang.  I've
chosen not to go to Shinjku in search of a replacement pen; I still have hopes that I'll be able to
get it from the rstaurant on Tuweday (Monday (tomorrow)) is a holiday.  I've got a few more boards
to paint; I'll probablsart on another one today.</p>

<p>Need to write to Kim as well.</p>
