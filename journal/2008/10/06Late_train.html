<p>Glad my train is late; I'll receive a note that says it's okay for me to be late.  I woulda been
on time, but just barely.</p>

<p>I assume the rain has affected the delay, but, there's not *that* much rain, and it's a pretty
late train.</p>

<p>Got to work two minutes late, but with a 15 minute late pass.</p>
