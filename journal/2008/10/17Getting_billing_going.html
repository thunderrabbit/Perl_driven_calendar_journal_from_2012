<p>Today I imported a slop of data into the billing databases, plus a bit of data tweaking, and then
some more.  Sho has arrived, plus Yuu, and she's activating the companies that need to have invoices
sent out.  At first I showed Sho how to do it via phpmyadmin (not very user friendly, and definitely
insecure if he clicked the wrong button), and then I added a function that would return a list of
inactive companies, and added a form to select 'em and another function to activate them.  Now Yuu
is going through the list to activate them.  There's only about 20 or so.</p>

<p>I'll be quite happy if she's able to get invoices out with little or no changes to the
interface.  I imagine there will be some changes, but hopefully not majorly OMG ones.</p>
