<p>My perfect costume: bathing suit and towel!</p>

<p>Ellie and Nat had been prepping for the party all day, which resulted in black fake spiderweb
forming a low ceiling, below which we had to stoop to get around the house.</p>

<p>I was the first to arrive already in my <del>birthday</del><ins>bathing</ins> suit, because I
changed my hoodie for a towel in the elevator.  I inadvertantly ignored Lin who was crouched on the
floor wearing a backwards mask; I woulda acknowledged him had I known who he was, but I was silly
and didn't realize I had come first; sometimes I get uncomfortable talking to Nat's friends when I
should know their names.  Take, for example, Ellie.  I was like, "are you Nikki?" cause that name
smelled close in my memory.</p>

<p>Ellie.</p>

<p>Ellie.</p>

<p>After people arrived, there were some very genki girls who I found both intriguing and elusive;
certainly no actual potential. But Marilyn-dressed ゆうこ seemed to take more than negligable
interest in my meditation practice, so I gave her and her friend めぐみ Helma's cards.  Subsequently
saw one of the cards on the floor though.</p>

<p>I've developed an odd crush on Yoko, <em>after</em> the party, just by flipping through the 350 +
photos of her on Facebook.  Some of them are great!!  My favorites are from her travels.  One is a
pic of some sheep in NZ, and she and two of her friends names are labeled on three of the sheep.  In
another pic, she and her friend's shadows are labeled.  It's just that I'm envious of the *fun*
she's apparently having, and the creativity with pics on Facebook, while I'm <em>*still*</em>
messing with pictures the old way, just cause I don't want my photos to be spread all over the
internet...  I mean, I don't care if they get copied everywhere, but I want one perfect repository
that is easy to upload, has human-readable file names, easy to choose my thumbnails, has them all
easy to find, clearly labeled, with full stories written for each picture, categorized, tagged,
labeled, cropped, zoomed, etc.  But they're escaping anyway: I can zoom to make thumbnails the way I
want and name the pics the way I want on my otherwise least-functional site: my website; I can
upload easily to my wiki, Facebook or Smugmug; I can tag people's faces in Facebook; I have
boundless storage space on Smugmug; Picasa has automagic facial recognition...  They all have their
pluses and minuses..  which one to use??  yargh.</p>

<p>Oh, and there's a great system at work that can return any image size or type, and again
unlimited space.</p>
