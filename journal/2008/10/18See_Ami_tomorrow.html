<p>Though I'll see her tomorrow, it was hard to say bye to Ami in Kawasaki station.  I asked if she
could spare a few more minutes, and she said yes, but needed to hit the loo.  I started taking her
to a &quot;quiet&quot; area of the station, which happened to have restrooms, so I waited for her
and then when she came out, I took her bag and put it down by mine, asked her to close her eyes and
come close so I could give her a hug.  The hug lasted about 5 minutes, and then I adjusted position
and we hugged about 3 more minutes.  I simply wanted to provide a space where she could cry; I think
she hasn't done enough crying (but maybe she has)..</p>
