Hakone hike was lovely, and only a bit difficult!  I enjoyed
barefootedly walking around on the scree near the top of the mountain.
Only a danger factor of 3, so don't worry!  hahaha

Did you enjoy getting drunk with Rimi?  HAHAhahaa Actually I'm pretty
sure you enjoyed it and did *not* get drunk..  for a wine tasting, you
don't actually "drink" the wine, do you?

Thank you for your continued support of my art!  I've started another
painting as of last night, which is a bit different style than I've
tried before.  (a 'bit' different, but not wholly different!
noooooooo!)

Don't end up eating too much!


    I may be end up eating too much??


And, as you can see from my new tagline, I'm embracing the artistic
and healing parts of me.  I've been trained in —â‹C (not sure if
that's the right kanji) and will be doing Žwˆ³ (kanji?) soon.
Informally trained in massage as well.

    Love and Light
     - Rob!
