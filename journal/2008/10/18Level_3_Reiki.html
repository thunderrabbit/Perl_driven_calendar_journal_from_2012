<p>I've now been initiated into level 3 reiki.  Mia said that level 2 is about healing self and
others, and level 3 is about connecting to higher Self and using reiki daily for doing personal
work.</p>

<p>Good news I'm interested in, and have been doing personal work for years.</p>

<p>The best news: the 4th symbol is easier than the 3rd symbol.</p>

<p>Interesting news: Mia asked if I was aware I had been chosen as the Helper for the next ATE.  A
bit of confusion followed until we (and I) sorted out the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>being the ATE Helper is a distinct position, different than being the second pillar.</p></li>

<li><p>This was not clear to me until today.</p></li>

<li><p>Though Kumi has offered to be the pillar, neither Helma nor Mia have given her a clear
answer yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Though I asked if I can attend the ATE at no charge, I didn't offer to be the Helper. I
didn't even know it was a position.  But, I am happy to help, not even knowing that I could have
title for doing so.</p></li>

<li><p>I'd prefer to pay some money to attend, than to attend free and have Kumi pay money,
especially if that meant losing her friendship, given that she's the one who offered to
support.</p></li>

<li><p>&quot;well, if you'd lose the friendship over <em>that</em>, is it the kind of friendship
you want?&quot;</p>

<p>I *know*; I know; and no that wouldn't be the kind of friendship I'd want, and I know the
friendship is stronger than that.</p></li>

<li><p>Okay, well let's say for now it's undecided.  Kumi should talk to me about it cause I'm the MC.</p></li>

<li><p>Well, it wasn't clear who we needed to talk to about it, nor that there was a Helper position</p></li>

<li><p>Hmmm; that's true.</p></li>
</ol>
