<p>Stuck on a programming problem that will be a trivially small fix, if I could just find what to
fix.  Basically I've got some list items and some javascript code that will convert them into
sortable items, but it ain't workin'.  I think all the code is there; I think all the bits and bobs
are in the right place, but apparently something isn't as there or in place as I think.</p>

<p>Men's group tonight, so I'll be leaving in less than an hour.  Need to get some foodage on my
way there; I've been delaying taking a break because we're so far from any convenis.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Andrew and I will be meeting with a woman named Jennifer, who's a headhunter for some
agency.  We're not looking for jobs, but Jennifer is aka Jen from PB!  I'm happy to help her get her
numbers up for speaking with people.</p>
