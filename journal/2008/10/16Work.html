<p>About to head out.  Sho didn't come in today, but I got the invoices looking pretty sharp.
Malek and Andrew have said they look good enough to go out.  Assuming all the Japanese is correct
(easy fix, if not), then we just need to populate some data and get them out.  If Sho comes in
tomorrow, it should be easy enough.  If not, then I'll be showin' Malek / Andrew how to run this
thing and they can sort it out during the weekend.</p>
