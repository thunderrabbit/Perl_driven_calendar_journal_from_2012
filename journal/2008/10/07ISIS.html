<p>At the end, I paid 1000 yen (not worth her time), saying, &quot;I hope this is the last time to
pay you a small amount,&quot; because of our arrangement that I &quot;pay what I can, (so long as
it's not just coins)&quot; and she laughed a bit like, &quot;wow!&quot;</p>

<p>I sensed I was making a mistake.</p>

<p>After a moment, Helma said, &quot;Well, I must say I felt some anger when I heard you went to the
angelic workshop for 30,000 yen, and I get almost nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>She spoke clearly, and spoke without expressing anger.</p>

<p>Fuck.  She's right.  And I know she's right.  I wanted to make it right, but I only have 3000
more yen in my wallet until Friday.  Oh wait, I have 7000 yen in the bank to last me until next
payday, which used to be far away, but now is in just a few days, so 7000 yen is plenty. I gave her
the rest that I had in my wallet, while telling her I can get an advance from work.  WTF did I lie
to her, I don't know, but I didn't say that the money would be from my bank account, my little
emergency fund to last until next payday.</p>

<p>&quot;But you need to eat,&quot; she started, but I said, &quot;I can get money, and I have food
in my bag; I'll be okay.&quot;</p>

<p>I felt sadness, and stood there feeling the emotion.  &quot;I feel sad to pay you so much money
when I don't value myself to make the same amount of money per time spent; <em>why can't I be worth
that much money?</em>  I don't know what to do (what does that mean?) ...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she offered, &quot;I spend more time than just when you're here...&quot; and
she approached to give me a hug.</p>

<p>&quot;Really?  I didn't know that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>In the middle of our hug, I said, &quot;Thank you for being someone I can trust.  Cause there are
some people (e.g. <a href="http://www.hypno-cafe.com/">Nobue Yazawa</a>) who I can't trust.  I want
to be someone who you can trust.  I want to pay you at least 5000 yen per session, and I want to
come once per week...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;if that works for you; I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah; it's great.  I'm happy you want to do the work.&quot;</p>
