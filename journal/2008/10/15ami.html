<p>At work now; should be working.</p>

<p>Ami came over last night; she cooked a lovely dinner (she's got mad skillz in the kitchen) and
we noted that her 10,000th day will be on 28 December of this year!  Hmmm.  She's quite keen on
going to Disneyland to see the holiday parade, but I seriously couldn't care much less to see it.
I imagine the crowds will be horrendous, so I further imagine I'll need to just turn off all
expectations/desires and just have a nice time.</p>

<p>She was making plans for next year and next next year, and it's sorta spooking me out.  One day
at a time is enough for me.</p>
