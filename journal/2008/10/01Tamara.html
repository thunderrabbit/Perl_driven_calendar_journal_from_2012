<p>Chatted with Tamara, who had a super-great idea (or two) regarding my freestyle healing.  Cause I
know I often remove knots and such from my friends' sore necks and shoulders.  But how to I convert
that into Rob's Freestyle Healing Clinic?</p>

<p>She suggested, &quot;just tell your friends, 'I do this, and since you're my friend I'll offer a
discount for the service,' and that way they can tell their friends and it'll go on from
there.&quot;</p>

<p>Genius!</p>

<p>But where?  Hmmm where to heal?</p>

<p>Silly brain!  Anywhere will be fine.</p>
