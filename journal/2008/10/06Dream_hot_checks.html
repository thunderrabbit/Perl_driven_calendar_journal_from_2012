<p class="dream">In a convenience store in the desert, where I had been before, but not particularly
often.  I happened to be writing a journal entry on my computer (white laptop, and white external
keyboard) when a caravan (mobile home trailer) came up with four prisoners inside.  They were led
roughly into the store, and I was like, &quot;eep; gotta go&quot; but left in such a rush that I
only had my keyboard, and not my computer.  I turned my keyboard over to turn it off and saw
switches that I hadn't seen before which were to change the channel of the keybord, and I finally
got it turned off and wanted to open the door to go out the back entrance and upstairs to the hot
desert and sit in the cabin with four simple beds, as I heard the prisoners being processed for
having written hot checks to the convenience store.  The door seemed to be electronically locked,
with a small glass window in it.  A green light was signalling that the door could be opened.  The
yellow door was flush with the yellow wall (both were pale yellow green) with no apparent handles.
I was a bit frantic, but got the door open.  I was worried about backlash from the interrogation, or
that I would be mistaken as an escapee.</p>

<p class="dream">Got the door open and went upstairs, leaving my computer behind.  Went into the
tent, hoping it was okay for me to be there.  I saw a friend come in as well, and we tried to chat,
as we heard the melee inside.</p>

<p class="dream">They were screaming, being tortured, though I knew not how.  One guy yelling
questions at them, &quot;what does it say about stealing???&quot;&quot;I owe you,..&quot; the
prisoner began,</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;With my <b>life</b>!!!  I owe you with my life!!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">So they were going to kill them for having written hot checks.  I was thankful I
always paid cash and had never stolen anything from these guys.  &quot;Or had I broekn a different
rule ad not known it?  yikes stripes,&quot; and I woke up.</p>
