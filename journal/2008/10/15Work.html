<p>Sho didn't come to work yesterday, so he didn't get to see/guide/support my progress on the
billing system.  But no worries, there's always today to finish it before tomorrow.  Not sure how
we can get it done, but I imagine they can finish it up enough.  (I'll be at The Pink Cow after
lesson with Yurika.)</p>

<p>As I left the office, I told Malek that, except for the PDF output (which works, but isn't
beautiful), the billing systerm is pretty solid.  Basically I changed the navigation to the whole
thing, whereas it used to be driven by choosing a customer to be billed (and therefore show the
contract (as in one (1) contract cause there was no way to choose between them) for that customer),
now we choose a contract to view the latest invoice.  There can be multiple contracts per customer
(I had already built that into the DB), and now we can create multiple contracts per customer, and
display any contract we want.</p>

<p>When viewing contracts, I mean viewing the latest invoice from that contract.</p>
