<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I've been reading <em>Atlantean Secrets</em> for the second time.  Right now I'm
in <em>Volume 1: Sleeper Awaken!</em>  Great series.</p></li>

<li><p>Have recently attended an Angelic Awakening workshop featuring Arteshar Mai Rah, and promoted
by Tamara, after 'recognizing' Tamara at Circle of Light when I was an ISIS client model for Helma's
presentation.</p>

<p>Still haven't discovered my angelic name, but have been doing the awakening exercises each day.
Today I  forgot to do them until I was walking along my river, so I did them just below the bullet
train line.</p></li>

<li><p>During the workshop, I discovered my unique gift to the world, or rather, I confirmed and
articulated it: freestyle art and healing.</p>

<p>My homework now is to make business cards, and begin telling people this is what I do.  The
business cards are designed in my mind, and I made a few prototypes that I gave to Travis, Tomoko,
and Helma on our recent hike (organized by Travis).</p>

<p>Today, because my meditation group will be meeting for the second time (this is the group that
decided to continue with the meditative practice after
my <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Clairvision:ATE_002">second ATE course</a>), I will make some more
cards to give them.</p>

<p>I really look forward to the blessing of Mia, my reiki master.  And by that I mean I hope she
won't mind; I've done level 2 reiki, but not yet 3 nor 4.  Later this month I'll do level 3.</p></li>

<li><p>Tamara let me pay half the amount at the Angelic Awakening workshop, and half the amount
later.  I paid the latter half a couple days ago, after meeting her for lunch at Thanks Nature.  She
didn't have much time, so she watched me eat and told me a bit about NLP, and the overview of goal
setting/getting.</p></li>

<li><p>The biggest growth opportunity for me at the moment is talking to people, telling them I can
do massage, some reiki, careful listening, etc.  I've been practicing massage and listening for over
ten years each, and reiki has been pretty natural over the last year.  But no &quot;formal&quot;
education on the former two, and no diploma for level 2 reiki.  That's got me a bit shy to talk
about it.  But because I've just been letting my hands give healing as appropriate I call it
Freestyle Healing.</p></li>

<li><p class="date">6:22pm JST</p>

<p>Work week has just ended; we (77hz) moved to a new location last Friday, so this was the first
full week in our new place.  It's not particularly close to a convenience store, so conveni runs are
less frequent, and more carefully planned.  Today we had a pizza party.</p>

<p>I have gotten some goodness done on the billing project.  It now can properly view the history of
invoices, display the overview of upcoming invoices, and an overview of recently sent invoices.</p>

<p>The only bad thing is my current salary of 150,000 yen per month.  It ain't much, relatively
speaking.  More than a third of that goes to my rent, and my rent is pretty low, relatively
speaking.</p></li>

<li><p>I drew up some Freestyle Art and Healing business cards today; I'll give them to peeps in
the meditation group tonight (soon).</p></li>

<li><p>Have been in touch with Akiko and Rimi recently; great news = Rimi has basically gotten my
first commissioned piece in Japan!  Colleen's is my first <em>ever</em>, and if this new one comes
through, I'll practically be a professional starving artist!</p></li>

<li><p>Travis has been organizing hikes each weekend for the past few weeks, and plans to continue
for the forseeable future.  I attended last Sunday's hike in Hakone, but probably won't attend
tomorrow.  I'm tryin' to save my yennies.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been meditating daily and nightly, 20 and 10 minutes, respectively.  Pretty respectable
for me, who used to basically just &quot;want&quot; to meditate, but not actually do it.</p></li>

<li><p>Chatted with Dad recently; he seems to be doing well.  His wife Karen was interested in my
having taken the Angelic Awakening seminar.  I think they both have done equivalent processes.
She also encouraged me to get level 3 reiki soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to do it this month, probably on the 18th.</p></li>

<li><p class="date">11:13pm JST</p>

<p>Talking to Kumi now; she's telling me
about <a href="http://lightworkers.org/">lightworkers.org</a>, a site I'd probably like to check
out.</p></li>

<li><p class="date">8:27am JST Monday  6 October 2008 (day 14075)</p>

<p>lazy weekend has been captured in future entries</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Sakura House Motosumiyoshi.  Current house mates:  Fatima downstairs, Karen across
the hall, Curry next to Karen, and Ulrike next to me.  Curry is moving out on the 14th of this month.</p></li>

<li><p>I work at 77hz in Dogenzaka.  Currenly finishing up a custom billing project.</p></li>

<li><p>My finances seem to be on the rise.  Though at the moment I'm getting 150,000 per month from
work (can make 250,000 at an English school; should be at 450,000+ to match my U.S. income from 6
years ago),</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I've been commissioned to do a second painting (Colleen's was the first, which is sortof
closing in on finished; the second one is smaller, a &quot;Blind Lines&quot; style, which is due on
Friday, but I nearly finished this weekend.)</p></li>

<li><p>I've accepted a project
of <a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2008/10/05#cash_for_words">doing a woman's
homework</a> for her, for 120,000 yen for perhaps 15 hours' work (reading two books and writing two
guided essays).</p>

<p class="date">10:08pm JST Monday 6 October 2008 (day 14075)</p>

<p>She cancelled the project.</p>
</li>

<li><p>I'm scheduled to be in another drug trial, which will pay 900,000 yen to go to Kagoshima to
chill in a hospital for two weeks.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>Ami and I have been dating for over a year.  She says a year and 4 months.  I've been
actively pushing her to start doing meditation and stop watching TV, though I know in the larger
picture I can't make her change; I think she will blossom nicely into her self.</p></li>

<li><p>My main computer is my white MacBook with 7 gigs free HD and stickers on it: &quot;Rediscover
the web / GetFirefox.jp&quot; and Shark energy drink lable on the inside, and on the outside, so
that people can see it when I open the lid, a sticker from a funny stage performer I saw at Pink
Cow: &quot;<a href="http://www.mondaiji.com/">問題児</a>,&quot; which I think means 'problem
child.'</p>

<p>Second computer usually stays at home: my brushed chrome PowerBook with lighted keys and OS X
10.5.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access at work is pretty solid.  At home it's sporadic.</p></li>

<li><p>I-group attendance has been waning.  I've been the most attendant of anyone, but we cancelled
last meeting altogether.  Enio lives in Shanghai (though we meet in his place); David has been
working on making a movie; Kevin is looking for a new house and worked in Italy for two weeks
recently; Takeshi usually comes; Jacob usually comes; I usually come.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been doing a lot of personal work.  Daily meditation (haha that sounds like daily
medication), ISIS, Angelic Awakening.  Planning to do reiki level 3 on 18 October.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really volunteered my time recently, though well I have been helping Shama with her
website, <a href="http://angelic-alchemy.com/">angelic-alchemy.com</a>, which as the astute clicker
will note, has all but no content at the time of this writing.</p></li>

<li><p>language study:  WHAT?  Can't hear you!</p></li>

<li><p>Programming in PHP has become my preferred language.  wtf?  I used to be all Perl all the
time.   Wow.   Now I'm like ewww Perl; so messy!</p></li>

<li><p>websites:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://robnugen.com/">robnugen.com</a> is most active.  My <a href="/wiki">wiki</a>
has been getting some action, but one must view recent changes to find out what.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">Castle of Dreams wiki</a> has all but gotten the
formal blessing from Nim.  He was last spotted coming up for air and internet after Hurricane Ike,
which bashed electricity off for weeks in many parts of Houston.  Not sure why it wasn't bigger
news on my radar.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">Uncle Cow's site</a> has been getting pretty consistent
updates.  I haven't been anywhere &quot;new&quot; recently, so he's just been chillin' in my
backpack or on my chest while walking around.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://go.rilla.fly2.nu/">Go Rilla</a> is supposed to be getting his pictures uploaded
soon.  Kris is busy moving after falling in love (after buying a house in the wrong country, Canadia
vs Murika (Kentucky)), but will get the pics to me sometime.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://ctbriefs.net/">ctbriefs.net</a> has been blank for some time.  Something
happened with the DB months ago, but I just haven't been inspired to fix it; the site got very
little traffic, and no one else seems to miss it.  I will get it back up, though.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>I have no pets at the moment (ever since coming to Japan).  Haven't really heard from Spot
since I saw him last year.  Haven't heard from Francois recently either.</p></li>

<li><p>I have a base and idea for my next marble track; I just need some space and an extra digital
camera (or build a framework for my digital camera).  My current camera is pretty old; once I get
rich coming up here soon, I can maybe get a new one.</p></li>

<li><p>All my music is stored on Amazon S3.  It streams pretty well, but if the connection goes
down, JungleDisk sometimes gets iTunes confused and crashes or worse, marks the songs as non
existant (very tedious to revive them one by one).</p></li>

<li><p>If I lost my computer, shit.  Several pictures and vids would be gone.</p>

<p class="date">9:23am JST</p>

<p>I'm uploading <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVqyg3HOwcM">Angelic-Alchemy unboxing vid</a> now.</p></li>

<li><p>Had some lovely earthquakes recently.  Several little cute ones in a row.</p></li>

<li><p>Weather is getting colder.  It's been amazingly rainy this year in Tokyo.  Like nearly 50%
of the September was raining.  It's raining now.  or just icky drizzly.</p></li>

<li><p>No real plans to travel, and haven't gone manywheres recently, but Fred is considering
coming here around Christmas/New Years!</p></li>

<li><p>Went <a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2008/09/28#Hike">hiking with Travis et. al.</a> last weekend.  Fun fun fun.</p></li>

<li><p>Been eating a lot lot lot of granola and soy milk.</p></li>
