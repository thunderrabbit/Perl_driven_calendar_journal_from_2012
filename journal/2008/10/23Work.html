<p>Andrew and I ate lunch at Subway.</p>

<p>Today, I've made several changes to the billing system today: cleaning up the user interface, and
making more things be editable, such as the companies' billing info, and the message to each company
that shows up on the bottom of each invoice.</p>

<p>Heading out in a bit to meet Reika for a lesson where I usually meet Yurika.</p>
