<p>After &quot;returning&quot; Romi's undated(!) message on my cellphone (from a month ago, it turns
out), and another email exchange with Nobue, a friend of a friend of a friend of Romi's, I'm on the
train now, so I can meet her (Nobue) in 池尻大橋 (いけじりおおはし) to get a couple books to read
and fill out a questionnaire and get paid like 90,000 yen.  Wow.  Not sure the deets, but it's for
her thesis about past lives. (*)</p>

<p>(!) My phone is dumb in a lot of ways.  Not dating voice messages in its inbox is one of
them.</p>

<p>Ahem.  (*) It's for two different classes; basically she is outsourcing her homework.  She told
me that the classes are non accredited / not for credit.  She said finishing the classes won't
change her life, but she just wants to have them finished, and she intends to read the books
later.  It's clear that she's already got a budding hypnotherapy practice..  In the end I asked her
for 120,000 yen to do the work.</p>
