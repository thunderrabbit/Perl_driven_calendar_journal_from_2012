so i was thinking it might be nice to build you a sweet bike for xmas
(since i am building one for me) and bring it up there, but there are
a few problems with that idea: you must define "sweet," you may not
need/want another bike, it's a pretty expensive xmas present, and it
may cost more to make it here and take it over than to buy/build one
there.

if you think you can surmount these issues, go for it!  if not, give
me xmas present ideas.

I wrote this earlier today.  Not going to get much better soon.

C / D below are probably the best in the presents category for me.


Are you definitely coming here?  That's enough of a present!

But, I'm willing to think of some ideas, cause, hey, presents!

A (bike)) I definitely don't need a bike, but a nice present would be
materials for my current ride, TJ Bike.  Basically it has to chill
outside, so it's gotten rained on and the chain is getting rusty.  I
know it's not the optimal way to care for a bike, but I also know
bikes as a technology are pretty durable.  I still ride TJ Bike about
once a month, so I know the chain and corresponding parts still
*work*.

HOWEVER

A significant reason I've not taken better care of TJ Bike is that
I've been working hard to get out of debt, but have for the past year+
been on a pretty low salary (by Tokyo standards (avg $2000 per month))

B (money)) I'd like to pay you cash so that you receive back as much
money as you sent to me when I broked my shoulder.

C (CDs)) I remember you paying me $100 for all my CDs.  There's a part
of me that wants to get them closer to me.

D (Diaries)) Most of my diaries are in Ma's condo.  I still don't know
where Volume One has gone, and I'd love to find it.  Last I remember
is that it was at janette's house when she lived in Dallas.  When I
look online at what I've transcribed from it, I was living in Dallas
with janette at that time.

Whether or not I find Volume One, I wanna get those mofos transcribed
and online.  Or at least each page photographed nicely and placed
online.   (Actually photographing them could be optimal; it captures
the emotions and everything much mo betta.)

E (puzzle))  One of my mates needs a 1000 or 1500 piece jigsaw puzzle,
but I haven't tried to find one in Japan.  He has found 500 piece
puzzles in Macau, but not 1000 or 1500 pieces.  Maybe he said 2000
pieces.  Maybe my mind is amplifying the past. 5000 pieces?  It must
have been 1,000,000 pieces.  Who would settle for less?  I should look
for one here before you look for one there, but if you find one, I can
outsource my present-getting for someone else (Mark, who hosted me and
Ami in Macau for four days).


F (Fujikyu Highland)) I'd love to go to Fujikyu Highland with you
while you're here.

J (janette))  Escort janette here with you!
