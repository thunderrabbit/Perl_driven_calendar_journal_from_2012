<p>Good grief.  Romi has just called me to say that she heard from her friend, who apparently heard
from Yazawa, who was apparently upset/offended/taken-aback/surprised that I had, in (my version of)
Romi's (version of her friend's verison of Yazawa's) words, &quot;charged her for counseling,&quot;
even though, as I mentioned in said email, I don't have a plaque on my wall.</p>

<p>So I've replied to her directly as below:</p>

<pre>
HI Yazawaさん

I received a phone call from my friend Romi, through whom I was introduced to you.

Given that I haven't heard from you directly, I won't guess your intention, but she said my most
recent email caused some concern for you.

So, as we agreed during our phone call on Monday 6 October, I'll give the books back this week
(tomorrow), and you can pay 10,000 for my time spent on writing the reports.

   Thanks!
    - Rob

&gt;&gt; I change my mind because your questions shook my subconsicous mind over the
&gt;&gt; night and made me realize
&gt;&gt; that I do not need to submit the reports done by someone else. I am the
&gt;&gt; same even if I do not submit the reports.
&gt;&gt; I do not need to prove anything to anyone. I am who I am and what I am with
&gt;&gt; the reports or without the reports.
&gt;
&gt; Excellent!   Congratulations.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; That's the reason to change my mind and I believe it is very importnt that
&gt;&gt; I stick to my understanding.
&gt;
&gt; I agree.
&gt;
&gt; The types of questions I asked you when we met are part of what I call
&gt; my freestyle healing (massage, reiki, counseling)...  I'm  glad my
&gt; questions were able to help you find more of your true self.  You are
&gt; who you are with or without writing reports.   :-)
&gt;
&gt; When we spoke on the phone after your realization, I felt angry, only
&gt; because I didn't understand the reasoning behind your change.  I asked
&gt; for payment for my time spent on the reports.  本当は、I don't care about
&gt; that time spent.
&gt;
&gt; But as part of *my* growth process, I want to shift my source of
&gt; income from computer work to my healing practice.  I have spent years
&gt; practicing massage with my friends, and counseling in my men's group,
&gt; so I know I can do it, but I don't have a certificate on the wall from
&gt; a school.
&gt;
&gt; Would you help support my freestyle healing practice?   Whatever
&gt; amount of money the questions and resulting realization is worth to
&gt; you, perhaps the same price as one of your hypnotherapy sessions...
&gt;
&gt; I have attached a photo of the inside cover of my bank book.
&gt;
&gt;   Thanks!

<p>WTF didn't she ask me directly?  Her English is fine.  My communication to her has been
clear.</p>

<p>Part of me wants to just say fuckit and not get paid for my time at all.  But fuck that; we had
an agreement that she broke, and this is the second agreement.  I'm not going to unnecessarily hurt
myself financially by giving up on it.</p>

<p>Finally, an answer:</p>

<pre>
Hi Rob,

As a Japanese I made my reply too beautifull in order to be courtious.

I always get a positive learning even from the negative/unpleasent experience.

There was  no rapport  when we met and talked. At least I felt so.
When there is no rapport, you can not go ahead with the project.
You can not fully trust the person.

When I get the books, I will deposit the money into your account.

Thanks,

Nobue

<p>My reply:</p>

HI Nobue!

Thank you for your honest answer.  I definitely appreciate that.  As
planned, I will send the books tomorrow.

I'm surprised to hear you're considering this an unpleasant
experience.  You've just saved 110,000 yen!  :-)

 Have a good night
  - Rob!

<p>I wanted to say, &quot;by being untrustworthy, you've just saved 110,000 yen!&quot;</p>

<p>And, I must admit: I bet she's going to try to hire someone else to do these papers for her.  If
so,..... that's unbelievable.  But I guess I'll never know fo' sho'.  I want so bad to catch her in
a lie, but my higher self says it's not worth my time.  Just give her the books back and run
away.</p>
