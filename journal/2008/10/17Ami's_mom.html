<p>Ami called me crying today saying that her mom was diagnosed with apparently having stomach
cancer, and could have as little as 3 months to live, or it might not be cancer; we'll send her to a
different hospital for further tests.</p>

<p>Um, why not be sure first, before giving such dire news and making Ami cry?</p>

<p>I told Ami to relax and breathe and give support to her mom.   「ママにチュして。」</p>
