<p>These are the journal-worthy bits of an email I sent to Tamara:</p>

HI Tamara!

Lovely to get your email; yes things here are good.  I have been commissioned to paint a small
painting for 4000 yen, and offered to take part in a study about past lives for which I will receive
90,000 yen if all goes as planned.  wow!

I'm happy to report that Ami and I meditated together for 10 minutes this evening, and then did an
eye-contact meditation for about 10 minutes.  She said she saw a チャイ色 hole going through my
forehead.  Interesting!

I did not go hiking this weekend, but did meditate outside this morning.
