<p>I called Kumi tonight cause she said she would call me this weekend.  It was 11:20pm when I
called, and she was still at work!  Again!  She was stuck late at work on Friday (which is when we
were originally supposed to meet to talk about my late-night email to her)...</p>

<p>She told me she was still working, so I was like, &quot;まだ？&quot; and then because it's a good
pun, I was like, &quot;また？&quot;</p>

<p>And she said my Japanese was good and I appreciated it.</p>

<p>I hope everything is okay with her and her work.</p>
