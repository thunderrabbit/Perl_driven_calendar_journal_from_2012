<p>Though I was up till the early hours of the morning (1:10am) reading Volume Two of Atlantean
Secrets, I'm already on the train headed to Shibuya.  I don't have to be at work until 11am, but I'm
meeting Tariq at 9:45 at Krispy Kreme in Shibuya He says he's got a cool idea to show me regarding
our (our?  more like his) new website idea.  I have the domain and the programming skillz, but he's
been the idea guy fo' sho'.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was working on the second commissioned piece (blind lines style) fr Rimi this morning;
it's due to be finished today, and it's allllmost finished, but not quite.  Maybe 30 more minutes.
It's taken so so long compared to 4000 yen.  I either gotta find a different way to do this style of
painting (perhaps not paint the edges and back (what's a painter suppoed to do?  these canvases wrap
right around the edge of the board.  Can't stop painting (this style of painting) if there's still
canvas to be painted!)</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be better if I paint these style on paperboard (not sure what else to call it)
so that I can stop at the edge with clear conscious.  Cause seriously, painting around the edges
has been a trick and 1/2.</p>

<p>I'd not paint these anymore at all, but it's pretty much the one canvas that everyone liked when
I showed them at Pink Cow.</p>

<p>I've got a few more ideas along these lines of paintings; if more requests come in, I will look
into doing those as well.</p>

<p>I haven't eaten breaky, so I'm lookin forward to a free sugarshocker donut at Krispy Kreme.</p>
