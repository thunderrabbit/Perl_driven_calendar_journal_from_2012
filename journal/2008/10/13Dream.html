<p class="dream">Arrived back at the camp, and was climbing on some posts which caused them to
break  I didn't mind at first, but then I realized they were perfect for people to grab onto a rope
that was suspended over the dirt area in front of the wooden porch.  I was like, &quot;oh man; I
just broke these two posts!&quot; and my companion was like, 'what did  you o?&quot; and I go,
&quot;I was just supporting my weight with my hands&quot; which shouldn't have broken them; all my
weight was essentially straight down.</p>

<p class="dream">I could see the crack in the wood where it had broken; it would go back together
perfectly, but have no strength to stay in place.  Unless we had a lot of glue to slather on it.
But being out in the middle of the woods, we didn't have many supplies.</p>

<p class="dream">But, then I noticed a train line nearby, lke quite nearby the porch, so I could
actually wave to people o the train and they could see me cause I was so close.  The track turned in
such a way that I could see the front of each car that came by and wave to the people seated in the
front seat for the driver's front view.  A coupld trains went by and then a shinkansen came through
and I was all excitedly waving to people who were waving back.  Then the last car didn't even have a
shell around it, but was open like a kiddie train the a park.  I waved and the woman in the very
last left hand seat (the train was going by from right to left, and I was on the left side of the
train) was like, &quot;my coat!&quot; meaning, &quot;there's the guy who helped me find my
coat!&quot; and I was like, &quot;wow!&quot; partially because it was great to be recognized, and
partially because I didn't remember finding anyone's coat.  I had some candy in my pocket, and I
threw a piece to her, but it missed.  The train slowed down as it went around some corners in a
hallway, and I took the opportunity to yell my domain name so she could email me.  I was like,
&quot;Rob Nugen Dot Com!&quot; and she turned toward me as the train turned right around a doorway
and she fell out of the train. </p>

<p class="dream">oops!  She was trying both to hear what I was saying and catch the train, but
wasn't able to do either.  I pressed the emergency stop button (have always wanted to do that) and
the alarm sounded in the rock-filled hallway where the tracks were located.  I noted the alarm
stopped blaring pretty quickly, so I was going to yank the switch that turned off this section of
track, but I saw there were cops already talking to the woman, so they must have the situation
handled and turned the alarm off themselves.</p>
