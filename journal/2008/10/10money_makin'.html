<p>Invited Ami to join when I met Akiko and Rimi at Hachiko where I received my first payment (4000
yen) for a commissioned art piece!  Rimi's friend wanted to buy a piece like &quot;Blind
Lines,&quot; but with my own choice of colors.  I created &quot;Blue Blind&quot; over the last week
and presented it to Rimi today.  She and Akiko seemed to quite like it.  Nice feeling to have my art
appreciated.</p>

<p>We ate at the Modern Japanese restaurant after being asked to wait 20 minutes at the もんじゃ
place across the street.  After Rimi further surprised me with a certificate to prove my piece was
officially painted by me, I signed it in the same style that I signed the painting, including
drawing a thin green line around the signature.  They all clapped and I gave a &quot;speech&quot; as
if to the room, though there was only one other couple nearby, and they paid no heed.</p>

<p>Starting with an omelette-like egg roll (nothing like eggrolls from Vietnamese or Chinese
restaurants in the US), we had only a couple of items.  A salad and then some nabe thing.  Just
finished the one course plus tea before a woman started smoking nearby, so I suggested we promptly
escape for ice cream!</p>

<p>Went to Baskin-Robbins where I got a double scoop big cone of ポッピングシャーワー (cream flavored
ice cream with green and red pop rocks (carbonated sugar candy) in it), Akiko got a single scoop
big cone of pumpkin flavored ice cream, and Rimi got cheesecake of some variety.  All were nice;
fortunately for me, I liked mine best.  :-)</p>

<p>We ate outside the shop, where I dripped ice cream on Uncle Cow and was chastised for
unceremoniously throwing away the top of my cone which felt soft like it was a few days old.  Bluh..
I'm surprised cause I thought that shop got a lot of action.  Maybe they don't make their own cones
(it's a small shop, but so are griddles.  I didn't look carefully.)</p>

<p>Chatter chatter about randomness and then John I and his girlfriend walked by!  Ami noticed them,
but they didn't notice us.  Granted, I was turned around so they wouldn't have seen my face nor
newly ice cream enhanced Uncle Cow.</p>

<p>Then to プリクラ partially because I wanted to capture the moment but especially because Akiko
and Rimi said they hadn't been in <em>years</em>!  Wha???</p>

<p>Funny pictures and generally great time, especially since Akiko has an aversion to smiling for
cameras.  Funny girl.</p>

<p>Headed slowly back to the station and dropped off Rimi at Hachiko Yamanote entrance, then Akiko
near RanKing RanQueen, and Ami and I are now on Tokyu Toyoko Line headed to our respective houses.
She's going to her crib tonight so I'll be painting some more art, blessing my future artistic
career.</p>
