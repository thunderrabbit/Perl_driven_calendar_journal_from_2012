<p class="dream">Riding bicycles with Andrew, or riding my bicycle and came across Andrew's
abandoned, and hooked my pedal to his so I could bring the bike home.  Andrew caught up with me and
flipped his bike upside down to get the pedal unstuck, and it flipped me upside down while I was on
my bike.  I was like, &quot;hey watch it!&quot; and I swung my bicycle at him and clipped him in the
face, and he threw his bike down on me and was like, &quot;haha look at us, fighting over
nothing.&quot; though I didn't think it was nothing, I did think I had escalated it unnecessarily,
but I could have talked to him instead.</p>
