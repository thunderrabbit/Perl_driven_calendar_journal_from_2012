<p>Said bye to Dale, and then ate curry at an Indian restaurant in ·ÃÈæ¼÷, and shared stories about
getting screwed over by Japanese passive agressiveness.  I told them about having recently had the
woman take back her offer to pay me to do her homework (after we had written an agreement (no, she
didn't sign it, but she photocopied it for me)).  blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Nice to hang out with them.</p>
