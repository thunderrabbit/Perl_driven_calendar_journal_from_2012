<p>Been focused on the billing project for a while, and today I finished the ability to edit the
invoices, and all the itmes at a time (instead of having to save each item individually).  Near the
end of the day, Sho and Malek were talking about some billing stuff they need to do.  I believe Sho
is a bit attached to the way he's been doing billing for the past couple of months, whereas Malek
was like, &quot;well can't we just use the new system?&quot;</p>

<p>That shone the light on me; fortunately I had everything in a state where it was usable, even
though it's not yet perfect. (I've added some fields to the invoices, but they aren't reflected in
the PDF output (which simply hard codes the most common values).)  I was like, &quot;yeah; I'm
pretty sure it will do what you want it to do.&quot;</p>

<p>So Malek asked me to show him through the system as it stands.  I showed him how to add a
company/contract and then create invoices.  He was quite happy with it, and within about 15 or 20
minutes had done three invoices for three different entities, including some variants which show
where there's still some work to be done on the system, but it's still built enough to work around
those deficiencies.  I'm quite happy that all the hard work I've put into it has worked out
well.</p>
