<p>Didn't meet at Enio's tonight; we tried, but there was no one available to let us in.  So, we
(Michael, Kevin, and I) visited an Indian restaurant in Ebisu, the same one where Kevin and I have
eaten at least twice before.</p>

<p>Mostly talked about Kevin's housing plans, or lack thereof.  He'd like to live in Europe, but has
no guarantees about getting a visa yet.  They're looking at Kamakura and such; he'd like to get his
1.5 year old closer to nature than their small apartment in concrete jungle.</p>

<p>Also talked about ideas for website enhancement, trying to get a more professional, multilingual
website.  Michael and I both had some recommendations.</p>
