<p>Ami headed home ahead of me to P, and I joined her in my room with ice cream.  She was laying on
the bed and I straddled over her and ate ice cream, feeding her small amounts when she opened her
mouth.  I tried to let some ice cream slide off the end of the spoon into her mouth, but it was
frozen to the spoon and didn't move.</p>

<p>Tried it again with some meltier ice cream and she said, &quot;ちゃんと下さい&quot; which I
could translate as &quot;carefully, please,&quot; or &quot;be exact,&quot; but I missed and it
ended up on her neck.</p>

<p>I said, &quot;sorry&quot; and ate the ice cream and helped clean her neck.  She wiped it cleaner
with her shirt and refused to eat any more.</p>

<p>I climbed off her and asked if she was angry at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said ちゃんと下さい。&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said I was sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Silence for a bit.  How do I help her realize there's more to it than this?  I've dropped ice
cream on many necks in my time.  Most times it's just funny.</p>

<p>Oh shit; I know what it could be.  She's now 美血子; it's that time of the month.</p>

<p>Rob, how can I make myself understand there's more to it than this?  Hugs are in order.  bye!</p>
