Hey mate

I've just set up the database to be backed up and encrypted.  The
encrypted data is being sent to my email address here.
(T.R.@angelic-alchemy.com)

It's conceivable that you'd want access to these, in case I die or
something.  Because they're encrypted, I'll need to teach you how to
decrypt them.

The data needs to be encrypted because it contains all your customers'
information (addresses and stuff, for a start, and possibly credit
cards once we get that part going)

Read the sentences above in a different order and they may make more
sense.  I'm tired and can't write words rightly right now.

Just ask if you have questions.  PS: in about a week, ask me if I've
set up the .php files to be similarly encrypted and archived.

  See you
   - Rob!
