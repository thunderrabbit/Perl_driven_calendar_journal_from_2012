<p>Ami was chillin' at my apartment when I got home.  I had purchased foodage for us, and she cooked
while I worked on some flash stuff for project with Tariq, and checked Yurika's transcription.</p>

<p>Before that, though, she told me about her dream in which I basically said I wanted to break up
so that I can have more fun.  Hmmmm!  Hmmmm?  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Dinner featured tuna-cabbage-spaghetti and easily washed dishes.</p>

<p>We let friskiness take over after dinner for a quick romp, and then snooze for a bit until time
to meet Tariq online.</p>
