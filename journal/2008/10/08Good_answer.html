<p>After having a $1200 &quot;job&quot; taken away from me, I was pretty mad, until I found out the
reason.  Basically I was asked to write two term reports for a woman who just wanted to get the
classes &quot;finished,&quot; if only by outsourcing the job to me.</p>

<p>Turns out she had a pretty good reason to renege on the job.</p>

<p>Her reply and my reply:</p>

&gt; I change my mind because your questions shook my subconsicous mind over the
&gt; night and made me realize
&gt; that I do not need to submit the reports done by someone else. I am the
&gt; same even if I do not submit the reports.
&gt; I do not need to prove anything to anyone. I am who I am and what I am with
&gt; the reports or without the reports.

Excellent!   Congratulations.

&gt; That's the reason to change my mind and I believe it is very importnt that
&gt; I stick to my understanding.

I agree.

The types of questions I asked you when we met are part of what I call
my freestyle healing (massage, reiki, counseling)...  I'm  glad my
questions were able to help you find more of your true self.  You are
who you are with or without writing reports.   :-)

When we spoke on the phone after your realization, I felt angry, only
because I didn't understand the reasoning behind your change.  I asked
for payment for my time spent on the reports.  本当は、I don't care about
that time spent.

But as part of *my* growth process, I want to shift my source of
income from computer work to my healing practice.  I have spent years
practicing massage with my friends, and counseling in my men's group,
so I know I can do it, but I don't have a certificate on the wall from
a school.

Would you help support my freestyle healing practice?   Whatever
amount of money the questions and resulting realization is worth to
you, perhaps the same price as one of your hypnotherapy sessions...

I have attached a photo of the inside cover of my bank book.

  Thanks!

<p>I'm glad I didn't mudsling her name in my journal while I was mad about it.</p>
