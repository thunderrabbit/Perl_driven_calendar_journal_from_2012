<p>I woke up at like 2am this morning, with my eyes burning and itching.  I had been scratching at
them in my sleep. Upon awakening they were just screaming for gobs of anti-itch pudding or simply
removal.</p>

<p>I decided to pour some saline solution in 'em, but that could involve having cold liquid drip on
my face/neck/ears/chest, and I was already cold from having the window open while sleeping.  So a
brief internal discussion decided that the saline should join me in a hot shower, so any cold drips
could be nullified with copious hot water.</p>

<p>Lazed in the water for a while until my eyes basically stopped hurting.  Considered shaving my
head at the same time, but didn't want to deal with cleaning up hair.</p>

<p>Back in my room, considered writing in my journal but sleep triumphed.</p>
