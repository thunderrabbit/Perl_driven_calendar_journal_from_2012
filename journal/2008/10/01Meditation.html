<p>Meditated for 20 minutes this morning, and then did angelic awakening exercise.  Got an email
last night from Tamara confirming lunch for today, but we still haven't chosen a location; she was
suggesting Harajuku, which I can do, but not for very long within a 1 hour lunch, so I suggested
<a href="http://thanksnaturecafe.com/">Thanks, Nature</a> which is closer to my work (if her
schedule is mo' flexibler than mine).</p>
