<p class="dream">At the Vice Presidential campaign speech for the democratic party, but the VP was
a young black woman named Valerie, who looked a lot like Charyl, but with a bit crazy hair.  The
speech had a completely different plan than normal.  Instead of talking about her plans as VP, she
brought on stage her two VP candidates for when she'd be president in the next term.  I was on the
front row before the stage, but she was actually behind the stage, which was basically unused as a
stage, but just a barrier between the crowd and her.  I Liked what she was saying, so, though the
rest of the crowd was going nuts, chanting &quot;Va le rie!  Va le rie!  Va le rie!&quot; in a quick
four beat rhythm, I stayed quiet, and made eye contact with her as she was on my end of the stage.
Showed her two V-peace signs with my hands to say, &quot;you're on the right track,&quot; and she
smiled back at me.</p>

<p class="dream">Then she shifted techniques and let people swarm around the stage to her side and
though it was a security nightmare, everyone stayed cool.  I was even a bit worried at first, but I
stayed on my side knowing that I'd just add to the nightmare if I tried to jump into the fray to
keep the fray away.</p>

<p class="dream">Then she was wearing a gorilla suit, to show how she was going to knock down any
opponents, and the crowd made a space in the middle for this mock fight, where she was going against
two other people in gorilla suits.  Then she got knocked down to show how she would call upon help
from above, and an angel came down and picked her up and knocked down, then sat upon her
opponent.</p>

<p class="dream">After that event, the dream shifted; I was still halfway climbed up the stage to
jump into the fray, but the speech was over, and my friends were eating fruits and stuff at a brunch
afterwards.  Someone enticed me down with a длдн (I think persimmon in English) or maybe it was a
dragon fruit, and though I got down, I had to poo, so I went to the restroom, which was in a
closet-door protected area, but with no real lock.  Someone else came in (British Mike?) after a bit
though I was still sitting (but just waiting, so no problem) and then several people came in and we
were playing a game with water under a sheet of plastic on the table.  Basically I was trying to
squeeze water out from under the plastic to get them wet, and they (led by Sarah Buchanan) were
trying to get me wet by getting the water on top of the plastic, and the whole while, we were
talking about the VP campaign, debating her technique.  I mentioned that I had been just about to
climb into the fray, but didn't want to enfray myself.</p>

<p>something else, but I forgot.</p>
