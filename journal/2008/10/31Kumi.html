<p>Called Kumi after the meeting to give her the details of what we planned and tell her what Helma
will be doing.  We ended up chatting about 20 minutes about her work, and about getting enough sleep
and morning routines, and then details of how we do neti in the morning.  She uses a neti pipe,
whereas I just use my ramen bowl.  Not sure if there's a difference in the end, but I'd like to see
if I can tell any difference using a pipe instead.</p>

<p>We're going to meet on Monday evening for a longer spiritually related discussion.</p>
