<p>In the middle of some pretty big changes, and a bit (unnecessarily) nerve-wracking because I've
spent a good deal of time on this data, though it's officially a test database.  I should just do a
backup first thing tomorrow and then feel better about doing whateva I want with the data. </p>

<p>The changes will allow entire invoices to be changed at once, whereas before the code only
supported changing a single aspect / line item at a time.  The new system is necessarily a bit more
complicated, including the ability to sort the items before saving them.  As such, I need to store
sort_by values, and to make the coding a bit easier, I'm just wiping all of the line items for the
invoice and then writing all the ones that were on the screen at the time of the save.  That way we
can delete/add/sort the items all day and they'll show up perfectly upon save.</p>

<p>Right *now*, I'm in the middle of removing the contract_id from the invoice items.  I knew from
the start that it wasn't 3rd normal to have it in there, but at the very start I didn't allow a
single contract to have two invoices, so invoice_id and contract_id were effectively the same.  I've
got all the code fixed to not write contract_ids in the invoice items, but those functions still
take contract_id (and invoice_id (I was smart enough to do that)) as a parameter.  I'll be removing
those parameters on function calls and from the function definitions tomorrow.  There's still one
bit of code that I think reads by contract_id, though I might have confused that with code that
reads from the invoice table using contract_id (which makes sense according to 3rd normal
rules).  Anyway, that shouldn't take too long to fix.</p>

<p>I ran my save for some test data, and it saved okay and read okay except for one detail: I hadn't
saved all the bits I needed.  D'oh!  Suddenly all the previous-balances and discounts and tax-items
and late fees all became the default type: &quot;products&quot; because I hadn't needed to specify
their types when I was just saving an item at a time.  I just adjusted the item with that ID and
all the non-adjusted bits stayed the same.  But now that I'm deleting them all first, I have to
recreate them all from nothin'.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I've got a pretty legible technique for writing the fields for the items.  To write
the invoice items on the screen, I'm running a foreach over all the existing items in the DB, and
for each field, I'm outsourcing to a different function which will write the field according to what
type of item it is.  For example, the produts need to have a quantity attribute.  But the tax item
does not.  There's five different products in the invoice, 3 of which are quantity 10 units and the
others are quantity 4 hours, but the tax is just the tax.  No quantity nor units needed (well,
currency is a unit, but).</p>

<p>So I'll just expand that paridigm and make hidden fields where I'm not allowing them to be
changed, but still need to remember the values.  (well garsh, that's what hidden fields are
for!)</p>

<p>Okay, so tomorrow:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>* archive my DB</p></li>

<li><p>* remove contract_id from various functions' calls and definitions that should just be using
invoice_id</p></li>

<li><p>* add hidden fields where I've got none when writing the invoice items</p></li>

<li><p>make a button to actually add items to the invoice.  (in this case, all the fields will be
editable, until the item is saved.)</p></li>

<li><p>* the delete button is already written</p></li>

<p>basically copy the technique I've used to allow editing of invoices to allow editing of
contracts.  If I do it smartly, I can reuse the functions that write the fields for each part of
each item. (*)</p>

<li><p>sort out why the sort code isn't working</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) by design, the items in the contracts are essentially the same as the items in the invoices:
for it's precisely the items in the contracts that are slapped right into the invoice.</p>
