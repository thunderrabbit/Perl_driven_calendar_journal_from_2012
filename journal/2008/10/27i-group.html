<p>We had an open I-group tonight; Takeshi invited a man named Dale, who he knows from his
university.  We had a light process about things we got / didn't get from our fathers while growing
up.</p>

<p>A list of five A-words (which I noted all happen to have double consonants for the second and
third letters) as categories:  Affection, Attention, Allowing, Appreciation, and Acceptance.</p>

<p>I wrote</p>

<li><p>Acceptance - bicycle rides together</p></li>

<li><p>Appreciation - &quot;you're smart&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Allowing - play outside, use dad's tools, gymnastics</p></li>

<li><p>Attention - seat on his work table in his workshop</p></li>

<li><p>Affection - great hugs</p></li>

<p>And then in the negative categories, I was a bit surprised at the first two that came up</p>

<ol>
<li><p>never built flying musical car</p></li>

<li><p>never saw space shuttle launch</p></li>

<li><p>didn't follow through his career as counselor</p></li>

<li><p>verbal fights with Ma</p></li>

<li><p>Told me not to suck my thumb (*)</p></li>

<li><p>Told me Santa Claus was real</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) I sucked my thumb until I was in 5th grade.  (It dwindled off between 3rd and 5th grade, but
I remember my final check in 6th grade: I was in the back of the darkened classroom during a film
presentation, and I checked the suckability of my thumb.  &quot;Nope,&quot; I realized, &quot;I
don't need to do this anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm sorta amazed that I still feel some latent sadness at the first one: we never built a flying
car, nor even a musical one.  I enjoyed the idea that one day we would work on such a fantastic
project together: just me and my Dad, and it would be great.  There's still a chance we could do
it, but I'm thinking that chance is pretty slim.</p>

<p>I feel less sadness about never having seen a Space Shuttle launch, but a bit less so, perhaps
because the promise was made when I was older, and the process by which we would go see a launch
isn't magic like a flying car would nearly be.</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway, those are the things I wrote, and I felt some sadness.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the group, we walked toward the station and talked about David's recent
movie, <a href="http://www.myexgirlfriendstv.com/">My ex-girlfriend's TV</a>, a 15 minute short
which he wrote, and in which he played the main character.</p>

<p>Suggested that he have a screening at The Pink Cow, perhaps during one of their monthly ad-hoc
art performance nights.</p>
