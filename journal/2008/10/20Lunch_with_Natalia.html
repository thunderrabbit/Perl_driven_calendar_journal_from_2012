<p>Natalia had taken an interest in my Atlantean Secrets Vol III last night at her house; I touted
the awesomeness of the series and we planned to meet up this evening, but she forgot she's already
meeting her friend Maria to plan a workshop, so I met Natalia briefly for lunch to give her my copy
of <em>Atlantean Secrets Vol I: Sleeper Awaken!</em></p></p>
