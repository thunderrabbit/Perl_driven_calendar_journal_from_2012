<p>Met Reika at the cafe above the bookstore near the <em>other</em> (bigger) McDonald's close to
Shibuya. (I know of a 3rd McDonald's that's &quot;in&quot; Shibuya, but I wouldn't say it's close to
the station.)  Happily for me, she had done homework which featured some mistakes, so I used those
to help adjust her English brain cells toward better spelling, grammar, and more fluency.</p>

<p>She's doing quite well, and I'm pleased to know someone with such high aspirations: she's got a
good sense of what she'd like to do for her career (translation, interpretation, international
business), and is looking for work to specifically support her path.</p>

<p>The lesson went by pretty quickly, and then we wandered a bit: I showed her ÉûÅÔ¿´Àþ, and then we
went up entrance 15 to find Cross Tower, at the top of which we hoped to get a lovely view of
Shibuya.  I'm sure it woulda been a lovely view of Shibuya if only they woulda let us into the
restaurant.  With tears in our eyes, we headed back down the elevator, but only after I pointed out
how cute Uncle Cow was, and how he'd love to have a view of the city.  The woman surprised me with
her creative answer (in Japanese): &quot;yes, but Uncle Cow can't give milk, so I'm
sorry..&quot; </p>

<p>(very few Japanese would think of such an off-the-wall answer)</p>

<p>Back to the station and up the rest of entrance 15 to the walkway next to the Ginza Line and then
waved and hugged by in front of my (favorite) line, Tokyu Toyoko.</p>
