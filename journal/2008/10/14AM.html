<p>Found my green marker yesterday; I had brought it home but didn't realize it.  Not sure how it
escaped my bag without me noticing, but.</p>

<p>So I worked a bit on Colleen's painting.  I've not uploaded any pics of it yet, but I may do
that soon.  'thing is, I want to upload them in chronological order, and the earliest ones (and all
must most recent one) are on my other computer.</p>

<p>Today seems a bit vacant of people on the trains.  Like it's a holiday or something.</p>

<p class="date">10:13am JST</p>

<p>I'm on the train now.  It seems less full than normal; on the platform I jumped to test my dream
state.  I'm not dreaming, or at least I wasn't dreaming a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Tokyo is a funny city.  Long as we're quiet, we can basically do or wear anything and no one will
say anything.  But don't swim nakedly in the Imperial moat.</p>

<p>Why is Emperor spelled with an E, but Imperial spelled with an I?</p>
