<p>Ami is over to visit tonight.  She's a bit sick, so we spent a good deal of time sleeping, in
the sense that sleep was involved.  I really enjoyed that we meditated together, and did the eye
contact meditation.</p>

<p>Tomorrow she's going to scope an apartment; she seems likely to move into her own apartment
soon.  She still lives with her parentals, which is quite common in Japan, given the high price of
housing.  (at least in Tokyo)</p>
