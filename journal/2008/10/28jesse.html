<p>In a combination of bored and panicked, Jesse called me today to see if I could hang out while
he had no lessons at work.  He said last week or so that he's had very few students at Gaba
recently.  David from my i-group has said the same thing about his school (Geos) and has suggested
that the industry in general is collapsing in Japan.</p>

<p>I stayed at work until 6:15pm and then busted out to chat with Jesse a bit.  We met under the
big Starbucks overlooking ½ÂÃ« crossing and then went to the McDonald's just across the street (to
the left) from there.  I chowed a chicken burger, and we each ordered softserve ice creams cause
the shake machine was out.</p>

<p>Chatted about his recently finished ticking system for his church, and because he wanted to make
it open source, I suggested he turn it into a tutorial.  The size of the project simply isn't big
enough (at the moment) to warrant a forum, user base, bug tracking system, etc.</p>

<p>Good to reconnect with him a bit.  I hope we can keep in touch mo' betta' than we did during 2007
and the first 3/4ths of 2008.</p>
