<p>Fatima and I have enjoyed a lovely afternoon with Natalia at her new apartment near Ichigaya.
Because Fatima only had like 3 hours of sleep, I had to wake her up before we left, and she's taken
some naps since we ate, but she's awake now.</p>

<p>Natalia is speed chatting in Spanish (I would use the Spanish word to write Spanish, but the
current Shift-JIS encoding won't encode the fifth character.  Gotta change my journal to UTF-8, but
not sure how to re-encode everything.</p>

<p>Fatima has two new friends: Mr Poof, a large overstuffed beanbag (cube shaped), and Kiri, her
name for Uncle Cow, who she's going to take to her work (Gas Panic in Shibuya) tomorrow night.</p>
