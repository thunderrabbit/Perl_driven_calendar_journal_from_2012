<p>Met Reika at the cafe in the bookstore at 7pm for a 1.5 hour lesson; she still seemed a bit
nervous even after an hour, so I suggested we head to <a href="http://thepinkcow.com/">da Pink
Cow</a>, which I had suggested as an excellent resource for her job-finding, English-learning
plans.</p>

<p>Our visit at The Pink Cow included Traci-hugs, ice-free orange juice, double-guacamole tortilla
chips, Corrine-chat, cow-go talk with Murphy (who's far more business minded than I would have ever
guessed), David asking about Uncle Cow (stinky after Gas Panic) and Ami (with her stomach cancer
dehanced mom), plus introducing Jeff, and me-n-Reika's conversation, including the summarized long
version of my answer to &quot;what do you believe?&quot;</p>

<p>Dropped her off at Inokashira Line (taking her through Shibuya station, instead of out by Hachiko
(it's slightly sprinkling)), and she said she'd contact me for more lessons.  Nice.</p>
