<p>Met with Kumi last night to plan ISIS 101 workshop which we'd like to organize here in Japan
this year or early next year.  She also talked about just going to OZ to do the training there, an
option I fully support, though don't know if I can afford to go *and* stay out of credit card debt.</p>

<p>(what does &quot;afford&quot; mean?  Maybe invest is more appropriate, and could include going
into debt temporarily to do it.</p>

<p>Told Kumi about Ami's mom, which sparked a discussion about whether or not we are ready to die,
and what would we do if given five years to live.</p>

<p>Fun to see Kumi becoming more and more genki as the night progressed.  It seemed like the
further she got away from having been at work, the closer she blossomed into her self.</p>
