<p>Walked around with Ami after a lazy lazy holiday (not sure why we have the day off, but we do..).
We held hands and played and it was generally nice.  She even climbed into the small river (concrete
ditch) and we walked along the water until we got to the end, guarded by some ducks.</p>

<p>Saw a great spider as well.  Wow.</p>
