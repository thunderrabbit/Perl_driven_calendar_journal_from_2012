<p class="dream">I went over to where they were trying to reproduce what we had done.  The guy was
making cookies</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Hello, everyone, my name is Mike and I just like to invite you all to come
down to sing with us in the choir group; we're going to be getting started in just a few
minutes,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The group was breaking up, so I began to yell, and finally got their attention,
&quot;women and gentelmen me first!  Everyone listen to me first!!&quot; and I hit the wall; my
voice seemed to smal and weak compared to his, &quot;Listen to meeee!&quot; and finally I got
people's attention.  &quot;I've got them admitting that they downloaded a database ilegally, and I
just need a few people who kow something about politics or the law to come support me; they are
brining in their big guns now, and I've been  doing this alone for some time.  Just looking for
some support.&quot;</p>
