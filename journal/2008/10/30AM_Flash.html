<p class="date">10:27am JST Thursday 30 October 2008 (day 14099)</p>

<p>Woke up at 6:15am, slept until my alarm at 7am, did reiki for 36 minutes, then neti in the
shower, and then 20 minutes meditation.  Glad to say that this has been my morning schedule for
nearly two weeks now (11 days).</p>

<p>Met with Tariq from like 8:45 to 9:15 or so; he said he was impressed with the game I've got so
far (nothing like grand theft auto..  it's just like a mini-game for kids) and I told him that by
focusing on coding instead of frames, it's been a lot easier.</p>

<p>I'm on the train now (have been since 10:18am) and wanna work a bit more to see if I can add
dynamic tweens.</p>
