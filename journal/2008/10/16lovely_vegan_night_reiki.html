<p>Uncle Cow didn't meet anyone new at The Pink Cow vegan night tonight, but I did.  First, I remet
Callie and Dave, and then when I tried to sit next to Travis et. al., all seats were taken, so I
tried next to Tamara, and found the same, so I found a new table (next to the low-rider couch) and
met Doiyn (sp), Patrick and Wakana, Misato, and didn't get Mutsumi's name until after she left.</p>

<p>Kumi arrived and sat on my right on the low rider couch, and chatted with Mutsumi as I was
chatting with Wakana.  Wakana went to Berkeley for a year to do some studies in marketing and
promotions, especially around the Bay Area.  Patrick, wearing a sideways hat when I first met him,
turned it forwards when I said, &quot;your hat's on sideways,&quot; and came back later and asked me
if I spoke English.  I asked him if he spoke English, and he left with no answer.</p>

<p>Tamara sat at the very corner of the restaurant, chatting with Callie and Dave, and a bit with
Doiyn (sp) and Wakana.  I introduced her as Tamara, and she said she had changed her name, (to her
angelic name,) Arial'a.  She introduced herself as Arial'a to a few people, but when Travis
came up later, she used Tamara because he e-knows her as Tamara from his hiking email list.</p>

<p>Michael came over to say bye to Arial'a, as they are fellow Kiwis, and we talked a bit about
crazy sports by his friend Henry and AJ Hacket (sp) the man who popularized bungy in the western
world.  As much as I wanted to join him for a helicopter bungy jump, I equally wanted him to say bye
so I caould chat with Arial'a, but I realized I needed to ask him about his work(shops), and I'm
glad I did.</p>

<p>He's getting together people who do reiki, hypnotherapy, etc, and different modalities to help
promote the facts of these &quot;alternative&quot; healing techniques.  They work.  I told him I
would be doing reiki 3 this weekend, and he commented like I should check out his workshop.  As we
were talking a bit, I could literally feel my hands warm up, as they were each like, &quot;reiki?
did I hear reiki?&quot;</p>

<p>Sweet.  So I got his card and will likely join.</p>

<p class="date">1:00am JST</p>

<p class="note">(I'm at home and showered now, and have laundry in the washer.)</p>

<p>People started to head out, until just Mutsumi was speaking with Kumi and Arial'a about her mom
and someone who did channelling; I didn't catch the details.</p>

<p>After that, everyone left 'cept the people in the bar, and lucky me with Arial'a and Kumi on each
side.  We were chatting about The Pink Cow and other good things, and I patted Arial'a on the back
to thank her for coming, and she commented approvingly about my healing hands.  Kumi was like,
&quot;really?&quot; and I placed my right hand on Kumi's back as well.  I felt the warm energy
return, and Arial'a and Kumi both commented on the warmth.</p>

<p>Arial'a also noted that I became quiet; I had been all chattychatty, but when reiki energy
started coursing through, the astral brain slowed down.  Just reiki and etheric body.</p>

<p>Lucky lucky lucky me, receiving positive verbal and tactile blessings, surrounded by two of my
favorite people, just for opening up to let the reiki through.</p>

<p>We eventually had to head out, so we walked to Shibuya, during which Kumi asked Arial'a what
kind of daily work she did.  Arial'a said basically that she stays true to herself by staying as
aware and honest as she can.  Her answer reminded me of Christina Branmart's answer that she
evaluated each action in the moment: &quot;will this lead me to or away from my goal?&quot;</p>

<p>Arial'a said something like, &quot;there may be times that I want to do things, because they'd be
fun, but I ask if they will benefit me in the long run.&quot;</p>

<p>She added that she tries to maintain awareness of her footsteps and her connection to Mother
Earth, while staying aware of her connection to her angelic energies above.  I offered that Thich
Nhat Hanh suggested we kiss the Earth with each step.  (though I can't find proof of my claim now, I
find on page 13 of <em><a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/3312188/">The Long Road Turns to
Joy</a></em>, &quot;... touch the Earth deeply with your feet.&quot;)</p>

<p>Kumi answered the same question with &quot;meditation&quot; and I answered with &quot;almost
daily meditation, but I often fall asleep, or is it a different state, not quite sleep?&quot; </p>

<p>And now I'm wondering about using reiki during meditation to keep my focus.</p>

<p>Hugs to Tamara by Ginza line, then by to Kumi in Nakameguro.</p>

<p>Bye to my computer now and hello sleep.</p>
