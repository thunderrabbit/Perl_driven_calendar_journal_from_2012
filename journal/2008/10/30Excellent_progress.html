<p>Nice nice nice progress here at work.  I want to point out that I entered several tickets into
trac, and I've been spanking them FIXED at a higher rate than the estimated hours that I wrote last
night.  It's nice to see this list dwindling.</p>

<p>But not so nice that I'd skip my lunch break, which I'm going to use now to read out in the nice
warm sun.</p>
