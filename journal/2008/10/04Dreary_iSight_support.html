<p>The text above is how much I wrote before I realized it would be way easier to record it first
and have it automagically transcribed.  I wondered about making a quick video using the built-in
iSight.  Found a reference to <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/broadcaster/">Quicktime
Broadcaster</a> which I downloaded only to find that while it <em>can</em> record to disk with a
simple checkbox, it can't *not* broadcast just as easily.  Someone said I can simply set the
loopback to the local device, but didn't say how.</p>

<p>So then I
found <a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/HackTVCarbon/index.html">hackTV</a>, but no
compiled version.  I'm all for open source and DIY, but I'm also for having someone else sorted out
how to compile it so I don't have to!</p>

<p>Ah. Then I
found <a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/QuickTime/idxMovieCreation-date.html">http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/QuickTime/idxMovieCreation-date.html</a>,
and that it's got compiled versions.</p>

<p>Then I noticed <a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/WhackedTV/WhackedTV.dmg">a dmg link
to WhackedTV</a>, and it seems to work just about the way I want.  No heaviness of iMovie, plus its
time remaining clock counting UP while it exports.</p>

<p>WhackedTV produces a web appropriate file from the start.  Or so it seems; the movie I made with
iMovie was five minutes long, but the subsequent test with WhackedTV was only like 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Pausing while recording wih WhackedTV made the sound get outta wack.</p>
