<p>Am a step away from finishing the coding part of the billing project.  Today I started on the PDF
output, but was getting a bit mucked up because I didn't have all the data summarized (need the
total and subtotal, plus a list of codes to display in the invoice filename), but the data was
*there*; just had to be extracted.  I started thinking about ways to have the PDF outputter
calculate them, but soon realized that would be a mess, plus a bad idea, so I summarized and summed
elsewheres and now *tomorrow* I can start on the PDF output in earnest.</p>

<p>Emailed with Helma; now I'm scheduled to meet her at 8:45 in the morning for ISIS...  That means
I gotta get up early (for me) and be on the crowded train.  whoosh!</p>

<p>AND, Jennie J is now Auntie J!  Congratulations, Kazzah!</p>
