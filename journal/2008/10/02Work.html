<p>Just finished vacuuming the new office..  I wonder if I can do that in my apartment.
Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>Also today, I've sorta got the billing thing finished, though I need to allow editing of
individual line items, and need to output PDF files.  I added a delete button per each item (pretty
easy), but the edit button will be a bit more difficult, mostly in the GUI.  I'd like to replace
the text with input fields with the text inside.  I guess I might be able to write them both, and
hide one or the other with mootools; that could make it easier, I think.</p>
