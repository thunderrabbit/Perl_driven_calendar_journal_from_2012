<p class="date">8:59pm JST Thursday  9 October 2008 (day 14078)</p>

<p>Started to leave work a bit after 8, decided to wait for a train where I could get a seat (simply
by being (among the) first in line), and am now on the train, still chillin' in Shibuya station.</p>

<p>On the way to the station, I saw four girls wearing bowling pin costumes, so I had to stop to
get a pic of them with Uncle Cow.  Said, &quot;亜美ち、チョッッッと待って下さい。ユーカウの写真写真をとらなきゃ。&quot;</p>

<p>(I don't know the kanji for &quot;take&quot; (a picture).)</p>

<p>Called Ami back but didn't tell her about the picture, so she can see it with a fresh mind
tomorrow.</p>

<p>I'm considering going early tomorrow to Nobue's house to hand deliver the books.  I probably
won't do that cause I'm gonna get home late tonight and not wanna get up that early in the morning
(would have to be early enough to get back to Krispy Kreme to meet Tariq at 9:45am.  I mean it's
not OMG early, but it's possible.  But in the end, the reason I'd be doing it is just
self-victimizing, so with that POV, I'm not going to do it.  I'll just take them to the local
くろねこ tonight.</p>
