<p>Going with Andrew to meet Jen for lunch in a bit.  Helpin' support her quota of lunches for the
month.</p>

<p class="date">2:13pm JST</p>

<p>Nice to see Jen!  We ate at the curry place near Herbeans after finding the Herbeans satellite
location closed.</p>

<p>Andrew and I raced back; I won.  Twice.</p>
