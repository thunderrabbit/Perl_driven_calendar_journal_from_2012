<p>Yesterday morning and this morning I woke up around 7am, did reiki, neti, and meditation.
Though I haven't done my meditation yet today, I'm about to right now.</p>

<p class="date">9:47am JST</p>

<p>Done.  At this stage, my mind seems to wander for well more than half the time that I'm seated
for meditation.  I can pull it back to meditative awareness for perhaps 30 seconds at a time every
couple or five or ten minutes.</p>
