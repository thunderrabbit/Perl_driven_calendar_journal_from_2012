<p>Went outside to meditate (Helma suggested I need to build up my etheric body by chillin' with
nature.  Got three mosquitoe bites, and for a while had the most effective tickle in the world: a
strand of spiderweb touching my nose, but then an even more awesomer thing.</p>

<p>I thought time was getting pretty close to done, so I decided to check the clock on my phone.
Pressed the button to show the time <em>just</em> as the alarm went off to say it was time.  Like a
quarter of a second after the alarm had begun to sound.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>
