<p>Went to see Ami's mom at the hospital where she works and is now a patient.  To get there, I rode
TJ Bike to Ami's house and her dad drove us to the hospital.  We didn't talk much in the 10 minutes
with 2 movie-filled TVs in the car, or the 40 or so minutes with the same movie in the hospital, but
he did say &quot;thank you [for coming]&quot; and asked where I work, and if I plan to stay in Japan
fo-e-va. </p>

<p>Now Ami and I are in Azalea in Kawasaki for foodage at a pasta shop which thankfully disallows
smoking in the shop.</p>
