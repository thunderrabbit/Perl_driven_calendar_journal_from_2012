<p>About half finished with my second commissioned piece.  The style is the same as Blind Lines,
which is not &quot;my style,&quot; even though I made it..  This email sorta explains:</p>

HI Rimi!

Thank you for offering the full 4000 yen!  I've started the piece; I can probably finish it this
weekend because I don't have anything else planned.

In the future, for this particular style of painting, let's make some more money!  Your 20%
commission will be 2000 yen at least, for a minimum of 10,000 yen for the piece.

I only ask this price for these "Blind Line" style paintings.  They're very labor intensive, and not
much room to be creative.  I hope you don't mind.  :-)

   Thanks!
