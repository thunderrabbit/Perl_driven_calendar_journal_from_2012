<p class="dream">Got on a train at 3:07pm, and the driver was a white American woman; I complimented
her on having broken into the train driving profession, and she was like, &quot;thanks!&quot; and
then as a couple of college students were getting off, they too talked to the train driver, giving
some gossip about the previous driver, and how he had been making mistakes, but kept on the route,
being protected by someone behind the scenes.</p>

<p class="dream">I became friends with these two girls by virtue of them also talking to the train
driver, and we went into the school building.  I told one of them about my friend Megumi in Boston,
and she asked if Megumi had considered going on a voyage on PB.  I was like, &quot;no (*), she was
like, ...&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;aw, what is she thinking?&quot; interrupted the girl.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;'I look into it, but I'm not going to sail right now; I'm going to get my
documentary skills up, and then maybe go on a voyage and make a documentary of it to help support
PB more effectively.'&quot;</p>

<p>(*) in my dream, I had forgotten Megumi has already been on as web reporter.</p>

<p class="dream">The girl was like, &quot;OMG that's awesome!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I know!  When I heard about PB, I was like, 'that's perfect!' and dropped my
entire life to go onboard; it was great fun, but now I have nothing to show for it, and I haven't
really helped PB all that much.&quot;</p>
