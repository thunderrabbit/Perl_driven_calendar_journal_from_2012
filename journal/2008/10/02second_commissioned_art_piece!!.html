I have excellent news!!!
Rob-chan, we have got a commission work!!!

It is rather modest, but it is worth trying.

As mentioned, one of the guests who attended the home dinner at my
place liked the one which I purchased very much and would like to
order the similar one in the same size.

I am so excited and hope it makes you happy, too.
May I think you will accept the offer?

Looking forward to hearing from you very soon.

Ciao,
Rimi

hooray!!

Rimi, thanks so much for coordinating this!  I'd like to receive
minimum 5000 yen for the piece.  What colors would s/he like?

   Thanks!
