<p>I sent two semi-related emails this morning.</p>

<p>One was asking Kevin if he could do ISIS sessions for me, given that Helma is chillin' in
Australia for a spiritual retreat.</p>

<p>If he can, I'ma ask Kumi if we can do the sessions at her apartment.  It's between Kevin and I,
and she's been doing ISIS too, and also can't work with Helma at the moment for the same
chillin'-in-OZ reason.</p>

<p>The other email was to Traci, owner of <del>Ye Olde Pink
Ox</del><ins><a href="http://thepinkcow.com/">The Pink Cow</a></ins>, offering an hour of reiki /
massage for a free <a href="http://vegan.meetup.com/389/">vegan night buffet</a> meal in
November.</p>
