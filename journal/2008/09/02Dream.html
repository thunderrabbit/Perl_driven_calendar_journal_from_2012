<p class="dream">Talking to my dad outside on a concrete picnic table while waiting for Kim Sawyer
to arrive for our meeting, telling my dad about Andy, but getting the stories mixed up for a bit
between Andy from ultimate frisbee, and Andrew my buddy from work.  I know Andrew better, but Andy
had actually given me a ride in his truck.  Dad was asking me about a woman named Andy as well, and
something about facial hair, which triggered me to realize we had gotten confused on Andy = who
exactly.</p>

<p class="dream">Kim arrived and I finished my sentence with my dad, and took some notes in my
journal, as Kim and dad greeted each other like old siblings and a bit of sibling rivalry.
Basically they were competing in a game of physical strength of only the hands and arms in a seated
wrestling match.  I ignored them at first, letting them play out their greeting however they wanted.
I knew Kim and my dad necessarily had a different relationship than Kim and I.</p>

<p class="dream">They kept on, though, after I had finished jotting down the notes in my journal,
and the game was getting a bit more serious, though my dad was still fine; he was giggling like when
he and I used to have tickle contests.  After a bit, though, Kim said, &quot;ahah!&quot; as my dad
apparently made a mistake and Kim was able to capture both of my dad's hands with one hand or
something, and a bit later my dad had to give in.  &quot;Okay okay [you win],&quot; and I felt a bit
sad, but Kim won fair and square, and my dad was even the one who instigated the game, so there was
nothing to be said about it.</p>

<p class="dream">At one point I remember wanting to protect my dad; &quot;he hasn't been able to do
as much personal growth work as you; go easy on him,&quot; but I didn't say anything.</p>
