<p>Work has featured some coding to let new users know where they are along the registration
process.  I was having problem with infinite looping at one point, but I think I figured it out.
Instead of checking where they should be, making sure they aren't there and sending them there, I
check where they should be, then make sure they aren't there and send them there.  Hmmm; those are
the same.  I'm not sure what the actual logic difference is, but basically I split the
assertions(?) out of the If statements into other If statements.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to explain what I did, but it's done, and now I'm going to meet Romi for a
little translation work.</p>

<p>On the train in Shibuya now.  At the end of the evening, I showed Malek what takeout looks like
so far.  I finally got the account creation logic to work correctly (and now we've decided to
change it a bit, but it will be easy now that I've figured out <em>how</em> to do it easily), so
Malek went through that whole process.  Good news to have messages for the users so they know their
stuff was saved and what to do next.</p>

<p>Oh, I also need to add a field that asks what kind of venue they are.  This will be cool and
similar to the logic I use when choosing the location of the venue: when choosing United States as
the country, the next field down asks for State, but if they choose Japan, the next field is
Prefecture.  But it will be one step easier than that because for *that* code, changing the country
includes an AJAX call, but this will just be javascript.  Well, they're both mootools, but.</p>
