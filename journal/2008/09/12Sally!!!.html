<p>Just Skyped with Sally for an hour and 40 minutes; I'm glad I came to work early so I could talk
longer!  Got to hear the news and process of her engagement with Brad (*), and glad they are doing
couple's counseling as well.  Literally, I just listened and gave a bit of feedback, noticing things
as I would in my men's group.  But spiritually quite lovely to reconnect with Sallyallyally!!!</p>

<p>(*) I wanted to write &quot;senor Brad del Australia,&quot; but the n with tilde can't be encoded
with Shift-JIS.  Dang; I wouldn't have this problem if I switched everything to UTF-8.</p>
