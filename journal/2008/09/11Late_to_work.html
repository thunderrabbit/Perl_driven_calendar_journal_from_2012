<p>Late to work seems to be the <em>modus operandi</em> (sp), so I didn't stress myself to be on
time for work today.  Instead, I</p>

<ol>
<li><p>posted the email that made me go, hmmmm</p></li>

<li><p>read yet another article wondering if we'll all die via lhc</p></li>

<li><p>read some <a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>.  xkcd rules.</p></li>

<li><p>wondered wtf was &quot;2girls1cup&quot;</p></li>

<li><p><em>almost</em> hurled.</p></li>

<li><p>took a shower</p></li>

<li><p>did not work on Colleen's Painting</p></li>

<li><p>barely missed the big traffic light crossing Tsunashima Highway&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>climbed a tree to look down into the &quot;river&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>ran up the scarcely populated escalator</p></li>

<li><p>noted the Meguro Line train was scheduled to leave 1 minute <em>before</em> the Toyoko
Line.</p></li>

<li><p>Watched the Meguro Line doors close, turned around to get on Toyoko Line and had to leap
forward as <em>they</em> were closing, use my supra human strngth to pry open the doors</p></li>

<li><p>sit down on the train</p></li>

<li><p>write this</p></li>

<li><p>arrive in Jiyugaoka where I plan to switch trains and take the express to Shibuya, but only
if it's a super express. (they call them Limited Express, which for a while confused me cause I'd
think Express is faster than Limited Express.  In Japan, it's not.</p></li>

<p>LTD EXP  See you!</p>
