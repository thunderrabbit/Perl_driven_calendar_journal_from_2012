<p>Painted a ring on my big canvas (in honor of LHC?), and added some bits to Bean's
painting, <em>and</em> splopped my excess paint across a small painting, which is basically
completely covered in paint now.  I have an idea for it, but stage two will have to wait until the
existing (oil) paint is dry.</p>

<p>I've written the below to start a project I've wanted to do for a long time (and barely started,
but abandoned):</p>

<p>[[Colleen]] has probably been my most-continuously connected friend from my advising years in
[[YRUU]].  She was a youth at the time, and a lot of my brain cells are still in that mindset.  But
we're slowly moving away from that (she drove me-an-Ami around Austin last summer; she's
commissioned me for this painting; I say HI randomly to her on email/chat).</p>

<p>It all started, perhaps, when she sent me a little stuffed blue-green rabbit.</p>

<p>[[Francois]] started as  a little stuffed blue-green rabbit, sent to me by [[Colleen]] for Easter
2003, just after I arrived in Japan.</p>

<p>Naked and unnamed, the rabbit hung on my wall in Japan for two (2) years, in good ol' [[Bell
Wisteria]], where I lived with [[Frank]], [[Matty]], then [[Genki Man Dan]], but not with [[some cat
named Steve]].</p>

<p>Now in Nakameguro, so have to change trains.</p>
