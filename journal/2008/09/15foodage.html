<p>By way of a makeup, I made mashed potatoes for Ami, who doesn't make mashed potatoes like Ma
used to make back home.  Ami cooks them in the microwave, and the mashing results in like potato
glue instead of light and fluffy potatoes.</p>

<p>So I chopped them up and boiled them, then mashed them up.  Exact same potato glue.  WTF?  How
does Ma make mashed potatoes?  I thought the microwave wasn't cooking them correctly.  Now,
granted, I didn't use enough water and they were sorta sticky in the pot by the end, but I don't
think that was the difference.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>Anyway, we ate potatoes and ramen, and Ami made two lunches for my lunches tomorrow and
Wednesday.</p>
