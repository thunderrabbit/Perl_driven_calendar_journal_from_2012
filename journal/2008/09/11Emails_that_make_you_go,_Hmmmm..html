<p>I got an email from Stephen in Indiana.  (He came briefly to Japan
and joined our I-group while he was here.)  Not quite sure what's
funny, but:</p>

<div>Rob,</div>
<div>Something happened to the rabbit on the way back to the mud hut.&nbsp; I 
saw this and thought it might make you smile.&nbsp; See below.&nbsp; Love the 
rabbit idea you came up with.&nbsp; :-)</div>

HI Stephen

I certainly like the poem, but no smile to see my animal totem
shredded by a dog.  Perhaps it's good to know that rabbit may be in
rabbit heaven. :-)

Which of my rabbit ideas do you love?


  - Rob!
