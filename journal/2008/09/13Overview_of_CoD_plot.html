<p class="danger">!! warning: spoiler alert !!</p>

<p>Here's the overview of my first Castle of Dreams story, perhaps to be written as a book:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Two kids (*) go into the cave, and one gets his arm chawed off by a firebat.</p></li>

<li><p>Scout Seven happened to be there and save the kid, save for his arm.</p></li>

<li><p>Sebastian / the spooky guy from the basement / Finneous (sp) try to pass legislation to keep
people from going back there.</p></li>

<li><p>Scout Seven and the other kid go back to the cave, with Stanley Steamer there to protect
them from firebats.</p></li>

<li><p>Firebats attack like crazy.   They get out through an unknown exit.</p></li>

<li><p>Sebastian et. al. take the kid and Scout Seven to court for violating their law.</p></li>

<li><p>Finneous is called to the stand.  He gives his sob story; the court case turns upside down
and is thrown out.</p></li>

<li><p>The real truth is revealed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hmm.  That was easy.  That means I'll need to trim <em>a lot</em> of what I wrote during the 2007
NaNoWriMo, but those can be saved for other stories.</p>

<p>(*) Because I say &quot;two kids,&quot; though I gave them names when I wrote during the 2007
NaNoWriMo, I don't remember their names now.  I know from reading the preface to Ender's Game (I
think), that therefore they aren't real characters.  &quot;I couldn't remember her children's
names.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm seeing these more as short stories... Dang this is perfect for
the <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">Castle of Dreams wiki</a>; I can write them as
stories in the library, and use the navigation engine to flip through the chapters of the story.</p>

<p>Next story:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Thunder Rabbit and Scout Seven visit The Gears.</p></li>

<li><p>Multiple Thunder Rabbits and multiple Scout Sevens.</p></li>

<li><p>Much hilarity ensues.</p></li>
</ol>

Laura-dear,

I've gotten a wild hare who's given me some energy toward writing Castle of Dreams stories.  I
revisited the idea of cleaning up the story I wrote during 2007 NaNoWriMo, and realized it would
work well as a short story, and *that* would work well on the Castle wiki that I made some time ago.

I'm thinking basically I can add the story in the Library, and using the same navigation engine I
made for moving people between rooms in the castle (pages in the wiki), I can move people between
chapters in the story.

So, in about a week or two or so, can you ask me how it's going?

In other news, I hope you're well, and enjoying the hurricanes.

   Love Love
    - Rob!
