<p>Cindy next to me totally missed a target by miles.  She drew a bridge when the target was fish
being poured out of a net.</p>

<p>Then we did the next target.</p>

<p>Oh snap!  She had nailed it!</p>

<p>Interesting that she had ended her first target session, and then picked it back up again and
drew the bridge-like structure.</p>

<p>In the same way that I meditate, I've got a lot of data flowing (in the &quot;right&quot;
mindset) for a while, and then my mind is all over the place analyzing and such.</p>

<p>We played The Bone Game (not sure if it'll be on da 'pedia), and my team got point only when I
was the chooser, or if I was patting the chooser's shoulders in an optimistic manner.  Other than
those time, we lost over and over.  Hmmmm.</p>
