<p>Hmmm..  My part of takeout is done for now, so I'm starting on a different project: basically to
write a billing system to replace excel files.  I think I've got a pretty good rough outline for
it.  The key being a super master key table: the Contract table.  It will include a start date and
currency.  Maybe an end date, but hopefully that will just be open ended.</p>

<p class="date">7:45pm JST</p>

<p>Showed my overview idea to Malek, and he agreed that it seems to cover everything we'll need.
The original spec was for a throwaway project, but I'd like to think this one will last way-longer
than that.  I'm sorta tempted to do more work on it tonight, but i should have a meeting with Sho
(scheduled for 5:30pm tomorrow) cause he's the one who's currently doing the billing, and has a
sense of what the new system will need to handle.</p>

<p>I'm actually on the train now (as of 7:45) and plan to sleep the rest of the way home and then
prolly read some ATS, write some CoD, perhaps meditate (I haven't in a while), then sleep early.</p>
