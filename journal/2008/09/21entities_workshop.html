<p>On the Tokyu Toyoko line now, after just having said bye to Kumi in Nakameguro, and I decided it
would be good to have a god deal of time to write, so I took a whiz in gakugeidaigaku, and am now
taking the local train *back* to Shibuya, and then will go *back* through gakugeidaigaku to musashi
kosugi, but this time.  oh wait, I need to go back to Motosumiyoshi, but *this* time, I have a seat
so I can write about today.</p>

<p>The entities workshop went quite well; I got to attend for free since I helped Helma and my help
was well received; people said it was quite good, and Helma said she could feel the energy land.  i
could feel it, too.  I identify it with the sort of relaxation feeling I have..  not sure how to
quantify it beyond that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was really into the characters I was playing in the example ISIS sessions, and actually
cried and really got into them.  I just figured that in one of my past lives, or, in four of my past
lives, I probably had exactly these situations come up, so I can just cry about them here.  Good to
just live in realtime like that.</p>

<p>During the &quot;announcements&quot; portion of the evening, a woman named Tamara promoted a
woman named m-something's workshop on angelic presence.  on Tuesday.  man; I'd really like to go,
but have already told Travis I'd join his hiking trip.  so I've requested that the angel make his
presence known to me during the hike.</p>

<p>The hike is 20km, and Ami has agreed to go, but I doubt she knows how long it is; I guess i
should be more clear.</p>

<p class="date">12:17am jst</p>

<p>I just called her to let her know; she'll decide tomorrow if she's gonna go.</p>

<p>Even if she chooses not to go, and it rains and storms and the hike is cancelled, I don't know
that I can reasonably afford the angel workshop right at this juncture.  we shall see.</p>

<p>What I *do* know, though: I really fell in love with Tamara's blue eyes and bright smile.
dang.  enjoyed a nice real hug with her.  I was trying to tell her something about something, and
just was like, &quot;um, my goodness, you eyes,,&quot; and just went in for a hug.  it wasn't a
fully super huge because I was still holding the entities book in one hand, but it was still nice.
quite nice.</p>

<p>Kumi asked if I still lived on Toyoko Line, (so we could chat until Nakameguro) and I was like,
&quot;yep, but I'm hungry,&quot; so we went to the Indian restaurant under Museum Tokyo to chow
before heading home.  Helma and Denise joined a bit later, so we had a nice dinner with the
teacher, talking a bit about Brett and Helma's recent ISIS session regarding making a living with
spiritual work, and Kumi told us about her adventures in Bali at Karen Kingston's Space Clearing
workshop, plus wreck diving, and being molested by a dolphin in some sort of tourist trap dolphin
tank thing.  She was (a bit) traumatized by the experience, but when she told us the story, she was
like, &quot;please laugh,&quot; but we were too stunned to laugh; I was like, &quot;you're not a
sex toy for dolphins,&quot; but I don't know if she really got my message.</p>

<p>Speaking of message, I woulda given a massage to Denise's wrists after I saw her stretching them
out, but then I asked if she'd like some reiki for them.  My hands warmed up a lot during the
energy delivery; I hope her hands feel well soon.</p>

<p>Found out that Kumi doesn't watch TV (as of 2 years ago), and her favorite movies include some
by Quentin Tarantino.  Wow wow wow.</p>
