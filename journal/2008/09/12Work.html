<p>So far today, in addition to writing a bit on the dooj email list, adding an entry for it and
Fred to my wiki, I have added code that allows the users to choose their venue type.  The data is
saved, but it's not read from the DB.  That's next.</p>

<p>Plan from now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>* go for a bit of a walk</p></li>

<li><p>* add trac tickets for</p>

<ol>
<li><p>add CONST to determine if we should read blog on keitai page</p></li>

<li><p>move reading blog info to a class.  have keitai page and front page use that class instead
of copied code</p></li>

<li><p>* move URL selection to step 3</p></li>

<li><p>* enumerate the steps</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>* read venue type from DB</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And I've found several changes that need to be made to English on the site (which must be fixed
before asking Sho to translate (otherwise it would create key-chaos)).</p>
