<p>I'm in Shibuya on a train that will go until Musashikosugi.</p>

<p>Significant today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I cancelled with Travis tomorrow (*)</p></li>

<li><p>so I can join Tamara and the Angelic Awakening workshop</p></li>

<li><p>I switched my IN for OUT in regards to whether I'd be attending I-group tonight</p></li>

<li><p>We started moving our office (****)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Didn't get much work done, though did move a bit forward.  Now I've got it calling a series of
functions that will look for unpaid amounts, apply late fees, apply monthly charges, and apply
tax.  Next is to apply total due and previous balance.</p>

<p>The first function isn't working quite correctly, because it depends on the initial state.  I
need to figure a way to make the initial NULL state be a valid state.  Where NULL could be default
vals in the DB when records or made, or make sure the records are made correctly in the first
place, but what should be the &quot;prev_invoice_date&quot; for a new client?  What about
&quot;current_invoice_date&quot; for a client who's never received an invoice?</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm thinking of just making those old dates.. perhaps Calder's birthday in 1986.  Hers is
the only post 1983 birth year I know for sure, cause of her old tagline, &quot;wreaking havoc since
1986.&quot; I would make it my birthday, but phpMyAdmin only allows back to 1983 I think.  Not sure
if it's a DB issue or PHP or what.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is a holiday in Japan.  Not sure why, but I sure am looking forward to the workshop.  I
described to Travis basically, &quot;the workshop claims it will answer a question I've been asking
for years: why the hell am I here?&quot; Not sure why the hell I used &quot;the hell&quot; in that
case, but yeah.</p>

<p>(*) While walking with him toward Shakey's I learned details: Travis is organizing a 30km hike in
Odawara.  I'd definitely like to go, but as he pointed out, there will be other times to hike,
including perhaps this weekend.  Sounds good to me.</p>

<p>(****) Moving to Malek's apartment, basically to save shload on rent, and hopefully get my pay up
to a more appropriate amount.  It's a bit further away from Shibuya station, but not too bad.  I
think it might be closer to Michael's apartment on Denentoshi Line, but I might have my directions
all upside down.  It's interesting, I have a footmap of Shibuya in my head, and I can see Shibuya on
a map of Tokyo in my head, but moving between those zoom levels hasn't been my forte.</p>

<p>In other news, I had a lesson with Komatsu today.  They've been slightly more tolerable than
before, but he still shocks me at times with how his mind seems to (not) work.</p>

<p>For example, most of this questions are effectively True/False questions (they're multiple
choice with only 2 choices).  They come in sets of four, and when I check them, I check the four at
a time and tell him how many he got wrong.  Then he immediately asks, &quot;which one?&quot; if
there was only one wrong, or, &quot;really?&quot;  &quot;yes.&quot;  &quot;really?&quot;
&quot;yes.&quot; if there was more than one.</p>

<p>I think a core issue is that he's somewhat more interested in having the correct answers written
in his workbook than for his brain to understand why the answers are correct.</p>
