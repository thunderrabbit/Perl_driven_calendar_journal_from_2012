<p>HI Kim!

<p>Happy to report I'm starting this check-in on time; it's the first Tuesday morning of the month
as I write.  I woke up from a dream featuring you and my dad:
http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=dream&amp;date=2008/09/02 The dream seems to say I've
gone beyond my dad in terms of self growth.  But there's probably some deeper layers I've not yet
noticed.</p>

<p>Basically the last month has seen me putting a lot more effort toward my inner growth.  I've been
meditating 20 minutes plus reiki-stuff nearly every day.  (Higher percentage of the time when I wake
up alone, but not as often when Ami is here.)  I've done 2 of 3 sessions with a modality called
EnSofic Ray from the Rocky Mountain Mystery School (http://www.rmmsint.com/ensofic_ray_healing).  It
may be as hoaky as the description on that page, but on the other hand, I've had some interesting
dreams recently (another featuring me going back to my old neighborhood, and finding the place had
been repaved to make it easier to navigate
(http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=dreams&date=2008/08/21), and another where I faced my
worst fear by screamingly banishing it instead of waking up in fear
(http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=dreams&date=2008/08/30 (here's the highlight:</p>

<p class='dream'>I was scared beyond balls shitless and I realized it was a dream. or no, but it was
at that level of scaredness that I always pop awake. Not this time. I stayed in the dream and
screamed holy bloody anger RAAAAAGGGHHHRRRR (that's like 192 point font).  The energy of the house
cleared up RAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!!! like a thousand angry chewbaccas in unison with a chorus of King
Kongs.</p>

<p>)). You don't have to read the dreams, but for
the second one, I'll point out that was an absolute first of facing my nightmare in such a way.) and
I'm back on schedule writing to you.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>Now it's nearly 7pm on Thursday, so my early start is above, and the rest of this email is below:</p>

<p>(0) In the overview, I'm still a bit thin in the money department, I'm survivin'.  And I'm thrivin'
in the spiritual department, and artistic department, which are arguably more important, in my view
of the world.</p>

<p>(1) I'm secretly easing myself into the idea of a longer relationship ____ ___ (not telling her
anything different because I feel better having the option to run away).  Basically (I don't know if
I mentioned this), I saw a video explaining how we humans are worse off for having all these options
available to us in modern western life.  Basically he was saying this: we waste time while choosing
and abuse ourselves after the selection process, under the assumption that one of the options must
have been perfect.  So when we're still not happy after the choice, we blame ourselves.</p>

<p>And he suggested that even when we've made a choice, we devalue that choice by comparing it to the
good features of all the other choices.</p>

<p>I applied this logic to relationships, noticing how I would compare women's pros and cons, never
finding the *perfect* match.  I've got Ami now, and I can compare her to 50 million other women who
excel in some aspects...  OR I can just chill out and be happy with Ami.</p>

<p>(2) I'm teaching one student English for 4000 yen ($35) per hour.  I don't really enjoy teaching him
because he doesn't want to study, and has no real input in the lessons.  My preferred style of
teaching is to sit back and relax while answering questions, or have a conversation while correcting
mistakes which the student will duly note.</p>

<p>This style doesn't work with this student, and I got an email from my boss saying (in Japanese)
&quot;the student wants more input from you,&quot; and I realized that I had been bitching
(victimizing myself) like, &quot;woe is me; he has no idea what he wants,&quot; etc..  So in our
next lesson I'm planning to take the reins and actually give him some tasks.  I trust/hope for the
best.</p>

<p>(3) My *other* student pays just 2000 yen per hour, but she does tons of homework, and my preferred
style of teaching works quite well for her.</p>

<p>(4) I'm working on my first painting using oil paints, which is also my first commissioned painting.
And I might have it done in time to put it in an upcoming art show (deadline 12 September).  I'll
know by next month, and will more likely mention it if I do put it in the show than if I don't.</p>

<p>(5) At work, we recently released our new product: http://sbstrm.com/ is a site that allows artists
to promote themselves.  We've focused on DJs and stage performers, though I have an account on there
as well: http://thunderrabbit.sbstrm.com/ I'm enjoying the work, though the money is still a bit
thin (as I was saying before).  Now that this product has been released, we're focusing our
development on a product that I've been doing alone for a bit.  It'll be a site for finding
restaurants, and we can tie it to the same databases as the DJ promotion site (which includes venues
for the performances).  Anyway, it's exciting; the new product should actually be a direct money
maker as we'll be selling it to restaurants in Tokyo, etc.</p>

<pre>Be well
  Love Love
