<p>Was up late last night reading news about the US economy and sent a BCC email to several of my
peeps (mom, dad, bro, maggie, molly, marcel, wende, sara) asking how they're faring regarding the US
economy.  So far, the answers have been fine-ish, though Molly-n-Will's house hasn't had power for 9
days.  Yikes stripes!  I hadn't asked about Ike, which I considered asking right after I sent the
message.</p>

<p>Oh, so I was reading news until like 2:30am from my favorite portal sites these
days: <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.projectcamelot.org/">Project
Camelot</a>, <a href="http://www.opednews.com/">OpEd
News</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122200573768460503.html">wsj.com</a> (not sure
what they're root URL is; does it always include &quot;online&quot; as the machine name?), and maybe
others.</p>

<p>Collapsed into bed and ignored my alarm this morning.  Woke up, but was like, &quot;bah,&quot;
instead of getting up.  It's not like I expect anyone to be there as early as me anyway.  Although
it would be good to get this billing project through its next phase of development.  I've got some
functions designed on paper, but haven't had the SQL tables in front of me to make sure I've easily
got all the right info at the right time, but I think it should be pretty much easy to do.</p>

<p>I think, actually, the biggest issue in my mind is regarding the angelic presence seminar on
Tuesday.  Its price is basically all my savings for this month (actually I don't really know how
much I've got available), but also, I've committed to going hiking with Travis, at least in my
mind, though I've prepared for that as much as a walk around Yoyogi Park (I've done nothing), but
it's a 20 km hike.  I'm in pretty good shape, so I think I'll be fine.  I hiked Fuji with no prep,
but I *did* have some extra gear lined up.  Well, I still have those hiking boots (good investment,
thank you Tomoko and Sumidasan (where are you???)) so I prolly just need some bug spray and a water
bottle and I'll be fine.  Maybe a sandwich.</p>

<p>Anywayyyyyyyyyyyy  (arriving in Shibuya momentarily), I asked for guidance on what I should be
doing, and the answer I seem to have gotten back was twofold:  meditation and painting.</p>

<p>The vision was of having canvases all around my room so I could just colorfully engage whichever
one I wanted at the moment.</p>

<p>But the best news is the answer was not just meditation, as the answer has been for years.  I
think I'm on the right track.</p>

<p>'cept that I'm headed to work, where there's no paint.</p>
