<p>Today was day two at our new location.  I was pretty zoned into work, with headphones on from
10:50am arrival through 2pm or so.  Then waited a bit for second lunch time (I ate noodles during
my code zoomin' time).</p>

<p>Also set up a office cleansing calendar to get us working in a clean place from the start.</p>

<p>Code-wise, I'm doing pretty well on the billing project.  Today and yesterday I got it to allow me
to create a new company to bill, and a new contract (header and items), and it already knew how to
take the contract and create an invoice.</p>

<p>The end-of-month part of the invoice (what else is there???) doesn't work quite perfectly;
basically I need to focus some flow-charting brain cells on that again.  In my head, it's not a
trivial problem: how to handle them having paid or not paid (adding late fees), how to handle
taxing items and how to let them over-pay and carry balances forward, *and* keep a history of the
invoices intact...</p>

<p>I guess that's basically it, that the invoicing schedule is like a barrier of sorts, but the
balance carries forward through that.  I'm not going to re-hash *all* their items to figure out
their current balance due, so I want to write their balance due into the invoice items.  Maybe the
best way to handle it will become more clear when I add the payment system.  Now that my framework
is a bit more built, I can sort out how to add payments (both gui-wise, and code-wise).</p>

<p>In other news, I've bounced a couple of emails with Tamara: she will join the vegan night on 16
October; I owe her 15000 yen from the Angelic Awakening seminar so will meet her briefly tomorrow;
Lucifer is not an angelic name (according to Arteshar), and I'm glad about that!</p>

<p>I'll probably be meeting Tamara for lunch tomorrow, though haven't confirmed time/location.</p>

<p>Laura emailed me today to ask about the story I wrote for NaNoWriMo in November 2007.  I've moved
the relevant portions to a book in the <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">Castle Wiki</a>
library.  The library is up the Grand Staircase and then toward the west.  or maybe east.  Anyway,
it's up there.</p>

<p>I have been meditating each morning and evening (essentially (twice a day yes, but sometimes
late at night)) for the past three (3) days so far.  Part of the impetus comes from my most recent
ISIS session: <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Clairvision:ISIS_0012">ISIS #12</a>.</p>

<p>And,</p>

<p>I've been testing Angelic soap recently; my friend Angel sent me a few lovely bars of soap that
she <em>made</em>, and plans to sell through her new
company, <a href="http://angelic-alchemy.com/">Angelic Alchemy</a>.  In exchange for the soap, I
have been working on her website (ahem), which as one can see, does *not* currently include much.  I
was going to put a &quot;coming soon&quot; with her email address, but because of some strangeness
with Google Apps, the accounts are not working properly <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hosted-the-basics/browse_thread/thread/b3eba90c95ad4087">(&quot;You can't send mail yet.&quot;) even
though the URL <em>has</em> been verified</a>, etc.  A woman named <em>Angel</em>a has been helping
people get their accounts sorted, and says they don't yet know what's causing the problem, and no,
we can't fix it from our end(s).</p>
