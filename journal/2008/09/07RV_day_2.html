<p>Wow; a lot of matches in the RV I did last night for the target that was chosen today.</p>

<p class="date">2:33pm JST</p>

<p>Just now back from lunch.</p>

<p>About to do ERV: extended remote viewing.  I hope I can stay conscious.</p>

<p class="date">10:33am JST Monday  8 September 2008 (day 14047)</p>

<p>I stayed mostly conscious through the ERV, but got very little useful data.  I mostly just drew
pictures in the hopes that something would work.  And something did.  I drew a lion using a 5 to
start (his nose is the top left corner, and his open mouth below that.) and the target was something
like &quot;Court of the Lions, 1800 - 1880.&quot; Sweet.

<p>While writing after the second ERV, I flashed on the picture of Space Lab (which Kevin had used
the previous day), but discarded it as not likely he'd choose two space targets.  But the target
was Apollo Souez mission, 1975.  (sorry if I misspelled the crap out of that, but I don't have
internet, and it's not in my little dictionary.)</p>

<p>Went to dinner with Kevin at an <em>Italian</em> restaurant instead of Indian, our normal
favorite (because the local Indian place was closed (on Sundays?)).  I asked him what he knew about
some of the guys who were in Stargate, and he told me a bit about personalities, but doesn't know
much else.  One guy Mel (I forgot his name again) would never want feedback on his targets, but he
was one of the best.  Oftentimes, though, they didn't *get* feedback on their targets because of
the nature of the project.</p>

<p>Went home and when I talked to Ami a bit about it, she was like, &quot;oh nononono I wouldn't be
interested,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;why?&quot; I was genuinely surprised.</p>

<p>&quot;because what if I target on something scary like a murdered baby?&quot;</p>

<p>And I was like, &quot;WTF?  Where'd you get that idea?  From TV, right?  I told you TV sucks;
stop watching.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From the TV show about Joe McMoneagle you asked me to watch.&quot;</p>

<p>fuck.</p>
