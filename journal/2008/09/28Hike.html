<p>Chillin' on a mountainside with Travis, Tomoko, and Helma.  We're on a trail headed up to
 みょうじんたけ.  I wonder if we are on schedule; we've been taking lots of breaks.</p>

<p>Started playing The Jackie Purdy Game for the first 20 minutes or so, and then Travis had a good
idea of writing hiking 俳句.</p>

<p>Top of the mountain.  I was barefoot at first, scree sliding.  Fog came in and it got cold.
Talking about goats and Family Guy.</p>

<p class="date">3:13pm JST Sunday 28 September 2008 (day 14067)</p>

<p>Now we're on a different hill, overlooking Gora station.  Basically we are aligned with the
cable lift, but on the facing mountain.</p>

<p class="date">3:59pm JST Sunday 28 September 2008 (day 14067)</p>

<p>Now near the bottom of the hill, or near enough that I can hear traffic, and am currently
sitting with my legs dangling off the edge of a little access road for maintenence guys to work on
a tower.   (I saw them.)</p>

<p>To get here, I zoomed down the mountain ahead of my three cohorts in climbing (and descending).
I had been playing a game of closing my eyes and waiting for them to go down a ways, and then
zipping down to the end of the line where I closed my eyes again to wait.  I realized I needed to
get in front so I could do some unbridled zooming, so I requested that and started to zoom.</p>

<p>I'm gonna guess it will take them until 4:20 to get down, because I'm guessing I went down for 5
minutes and guessing about 4 times faster than they were descending.</p>

<p>Got a couple of pictures overlooking Gora station: one with us in the way, and one without.  I
hope I can put them on my website in a way that shows where we were.</p>

<p>While I played my game, Helma and I were quiet, and Travis was helping Tomoko with questions
about sendmail and a different program.</p>

<p>Travis and Tomoko arrived at 4:05, and Helma arrived at 4:09.</p>

<p>From here, we're planning to find an onsen in which we can bathe our muscles, and then head
home, probably after some foodage.</p>

<p>I got some breast-shaped pudding cups for Ami, and a little onsen egg.  Wow!  I have wireless
access up here at Gora station; I think I'll upload now.</p>

<p>I've got some なつかしい feelings being on this train from Gora down to Hakone-Yumoto.  I came
here alone way back in the day, got sick of the crowds and climbed directly up the hill.  Good
times.</p>

<p class="date">7:44pm JST Sunday 28 September 2008 (day 14067)</p>

<p>Damn.  I lost the little onsen egg.  I had it on Tokaido Line in my pocket, but not on Nambu
Line.  It musta fallen out of my pocket while I was wigglin' around for a comfortable way to
sleep.</p>

<p>I guess it's okay; Ami's iPhone doesn't have a way to attach little danglies to it anyway.</p>

<p>I hope someone finds it and enjoys it, instead of it being tossed out with the rest of the trash.</p>

<p>In other news, Ami said she was sick in bed and can't meet me tonight.</p>
