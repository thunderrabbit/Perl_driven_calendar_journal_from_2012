<p>And then I find out Helma will be speaking at Circle of Light in a couple weeks.  Dang!  I've
been in Japan 5 years and haven't done shit, and she's speaking after only her first year.</p>

<p>&quot;I spoke during my first month.&quot;</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>She just follows her gut feeling, the clear fountain, on who she's supposed to meet.</p>

<p>So what am I supposed to do?</p>

<p>Well, meditation brought me this far...</p>
