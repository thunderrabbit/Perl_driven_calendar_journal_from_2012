<p>Got a gentle prod on the shoulder as I was stepping from local to express in Jiyugaoka.  Turned
around to see what I had forgotten.  Matteo!!  I definitely hadn't forgotten him, and was happy to
get a bit of an update.  They moved closer to Shin Maruko, and Hitoe is studying to be a nurse..
No longer leading lost Japanese across Europe, though I must say that job seemed a lot cooler.  He's
working 6 days a week (and going crazy); 3 or 4 lessons today in Italian culture until 4pm.  He
actually did most of the questioning; found out where I live and heard about my housemates.. That
reminds me; I want to make a record of my housemates... I can make a section called Peeps in my
wiki.  That seems appropriate.  I guess I should get permission to put various pics up, but.</p>
