<p>Stopped by Lawson's in Shibuya to see Tsunashimasan and the gang.  There was only one other
customer in the whole place, so I got to goof around with the employees a bit more than usual.  In
this case tossing greetings back and forth in different languages.  Japanese, Mandarin, French,
Spanish, English and Korean were involved.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my two favorite girls don't work there anymore.  Akami cause she was so genki and
crazy, and Ai, cause she was so easy and fun to tease.</p>
