<p>Hmm.  I happen to be sitting next to a forgotten bag from Disney Land.  I wonder what's inside. (*)</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  Today work started pretty un-productive; I needed to chat with
Malek or Andrew to get some help on next steps for takeout.</p>

<p>But then, once I got those, I was able to re-skin takeout with
the <a href="http://sbstrm.com/">sbstrm</a> skin, including copying almost verbatim the code for the
blog admin.  (Had to comment out the trackbacks and blog comments, but we'll probably add them back
in at some point.)</p>

<p>Um; that's sorta all I guess, though I got a nice email-rant
from <a href="http://www.spellingsconsulting.com/">Dude</a>, which I posted
as <a href="/blog/2008/09/09/dudes-take-on-the-lhc/">Dude's take on the LHC</a>, without his
permission. (!)</p>

<p>Oh!  And Chiemi sent me a link to <a href="http://www.iknow.co.jp/">iknow</a>, which I used a bit
to learn me some Japanese. (**)</p>

<p>(*) Nevermind.  Not forgotten.</p>

<p>(**) Poor grammar in honor of Benny(?) who hung around with us in Junior (?) year high school
lunch, famous for the phrase, &quot;will you borrow me a dollar?&quot;</p>

<p>(!) But I got this response:</p>
