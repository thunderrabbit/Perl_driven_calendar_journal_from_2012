<p>On the train last night a little kid got on and was determined to find a window so he culd watch
out the back of the train.  He din't find a space available, so I relinquished my space for him.  He
said clearly in English, &quot;thank you!&quot; and i was like, &quot;sure!&quot; As I got off the
train in Musashi-Kosugi, he goes, &quot;see you!&quot; and I mirrored his enthusiasm, &quot;see
you!&quot; and he came to the side window to wave bye to me.  I matched his wave and waved bigger as
the train rolled away, finally using my umbrella as a wave extension, though he may have been too
far away to see it.  In any case, I made a new friend.  I'll be amazed if I ever see him again.</p>
