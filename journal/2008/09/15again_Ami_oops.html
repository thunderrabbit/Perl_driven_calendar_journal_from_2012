<p>Oh man.  I got home and snuggled up with Ami who was snoozingly waiting for me to arrive from
Shibuya.  Awake enough to remember later, but not enough to really remember, I remembered later she
asked me to meet her at 6:30 at Foodium for some grocery-oriented shopping.  I zonked out while she
went to her English lesson and was rudely awakened by Ami saying, &quot;what time is it?&quot; I was
like, &quot;pssshh I don't know.  You're the one turning on the light waking me up; what time is
it?&quot; (I didn't say that, but I would have thought it had I been awake) Oh snap I forgot to meet
her at 6:30 at Foodium.  She's *already* been gone 3 hours and I never even woke up.</p>
