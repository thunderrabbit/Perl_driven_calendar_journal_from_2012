<p>Saw some skinny caterpillars a couple weeks ago on the cherry trees near the little stream by
which I walk each day to and from Motosumiyoshi.  Saw them again today, and they were quite a bit
fatter!  They had grown to four or five times their previous mass!  Wow; we should have done an
infomercial to recommend these leaves as a great way to bulk up!</p>
