<p>Got a call from Malek as I was on the train (as it was stopping in Shin Maruko), saying that
they'd be starting the move at 5pm instead of 1pm, on account that Sho wouldn't be able to make it
by then.</p>

<p>Fair enough, in a way, but Malek knew already that I had to <em>leave</em> around that time for
stuff I gotsta do tonight.  I doubt they're preferring Sho over me; I imagine they're preferring
later rather than earlier.</p>

<p>My immediate reaction was to go back home to bed, but that would have required something like 25
minutes, plus it would have negated the 25 minutes I had already invested in heading toward Ogikubo
for Circle of Light tonight.  So, since I need to prepare a bit for that anyway, I'll find a spot in
Shibuya where I can take notes on the ISIS session examples.</p>

<p>That spot will probably be very close to my desk at work, cause I'm quite low on cash at the
moment (I didn't realize Natalie's party last night was 4000 yen, 1000 yen above the amount I
thought would carry me through the weekend.  (Actually I think it's more reasonable to say that I
didn't carefully think about it before deciding *not* to go to the ATM before the weekend), plus
going to ageHa afterward required me to borrow money from Ami), so I'll break into my piggy bank
(plastic drink bottle), which has been collecting as much money at a rate based on how much I've
been spending it on ice cream (e.g. 126 yen on ice cream = 200 yen in the bottle) with the goal of
buying a Knowledge Track from Clairvision.</p>

<p>Boo hoo for me: I was looking forward to free lunch in the form of pizza, but it appears I'll
have to fend for myself.</p>

<p class="date">1:33pm JST</p>

<p>I ended up not staying at work longer any longer than it took to snag 2000 yen in small bills
from my bottle, and forget to grab Uncle Cow's cards.  Now I'm at a curry shop that will go unnamed
because they specificallly said I could not use their electricity to charge my computer's battery.
Yeah, I'd hate to boost their light bill more than all the lights in here already use.  I'm actually
surprised because the same-named shop in Motosumiyoshi welcomed my use of their electricty.
Perhaps I shoulda *not* plugged in here until after he brought my food cause then he woulda not
even seen the plug, and I woulda not spitefully spilled my water on the counter ostensibly to
remove ice cubes, but really just because I was pissed.</p>
