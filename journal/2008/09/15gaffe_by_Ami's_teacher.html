<p>Upstairs to check out her lesson notes from her teacher.  I found like <em>seven</em>
errors in the notes, from missing articles and missed tense in a single sentence, &quot;I filled
water bottle by poured water into it,&quot; &quot;sometime&quot; spelled as one word in a phrase
like, &quot;she spent sometime studying,&quot; and this gem, &quot;she've = she have been&quot; with
&quot;has&quot; crossed out under &quot;have&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;WTF?  This isn't even a word!&quot;  Now granted this teacher is from
Australia, but I'm pretty sure Australian English does *not* include &quot;she've.&quot;  I think
this girl has been trained in grammar even less than me, and is just going by what she thinks it
sounds like in her memory.</p>

<p>Cripes.</p>

<p>So I related to Ami this story of when I came home from first day of my sophomore year in high
school, which featured a class in Spanish. (Fourth period with Mrs Sherman.)  I showed my dad the
new Spanish I learned, and he said, &quot;nope that's wrong, the correct Spanish is blah blah
blah,&quot; and I was like, &quot;WTF?  Since when did you know more Spanish than my Spanish
teacher?&quot; and I'm sure that was a big reason I lost interest in studying Spanish.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, it may be that my Spanish teacher didn't know Spanish.  It may be that my dad didn't
know Spanish.  It may be that I had misremembered the Spanish my teacher had given us.  I don't
know; I don't speak Spanish.  But, I *do* speak English, and this is flat <em>wrong</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Ami pointed out that the phrases &quot;I filled water bottle&quot; and &quot;poured water into
it&quot; were written separately, and then connected with &quot;by,&quot; as that preposition was
the teaching point.  Now, yes, there's a missing article, but she wasn't studying that.</p>

<p>So we basically agreed that I would get to go over the notes to make corrections before Ami
studies them in earnest.  Not sure how well that's going to go, but Ami likes her teacher and I'm
glad she's studying again.</p>

<p>One other error I remember: the words &quot;of, by, to, at, in, from, &quot; etc were labeled as
&quot;particals,&quot; which is wrong in two ways.  They are prepositions in English, and the closest equivalent
part of speech in Japanese (for which Ami doesn't even know the name in English, so it's not helpful
to write it down) is &quot;particles,&quot; <del>single</del> characters which identify how the main words
relate to each other in the sentence.</p>

<p>I couldn't think of a good example where changing a particle would change the meaning of the
sentence, while still resulting in sentences that might be spoken, but certainly there are some.</p>

<p class="date">1:59am JST</p>

<p>Woah.  I just looked up particles on wikipedia, and there are *tons* more than I thought!  I
thought they were just single (or occassionally pairs of) characters like, で、も、を、に、と, から、
まで、 etc, but there's something like 100 particles listed, including a three character one that I
thought was a word I didn't quite grasp yet.  ばかり、</p>
