<p>After that, we went to the &quot;To The Herbs&quot; Italian restaurant, where I took a picture
of the small plate of 12 (twelve) doritos they gave us.  Twelve?  What about a big basket of corn
chips?  I guess not in Japan, and not in Italian restaurants.</p>

<p>I loved my cheese pizza, and I double loved the little pitcher of honey (I drained it, partially
using my straw), and I triple dipple loved the sauce from Ami's pasta.
MMMMmmmmMMMMmmMMMMmmmmMMMMMmmMMMMMMMMM!!!!</p>

<p>I soaked all of it up that I could with my pizza.  SO YUMMY!!</p>
