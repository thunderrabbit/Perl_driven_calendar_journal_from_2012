<p class="dream">Though I was tired and wanted to go hime, I didn't get ready fast enough to go
home before i-group started.  I joined the beginning of the group where we honored the directions,
and it was like an extended version.  with new architypes.  In the east: electric man, and in the
south taliban, and west was America, and north Sata Claus..  We went thrugh them all twice, and I
woke up.</p>
