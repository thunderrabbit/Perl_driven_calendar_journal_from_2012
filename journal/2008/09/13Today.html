<p>Today, </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I did ISIS number 9 with Helma</p></li>

<li><p>I ate cereal and played with Ami when she came over</p></li>

<li><p>Ami and I went to Kawasaki to see a movie.  On the way there, I
worked on a new art piece, and offered to let Ami draw on the plain
white board first.  She was hesitant, but then wrote her name across
it.</p></li>

<li><p>We saw _Wanted_.  It was good, though a tad beyond unbelievable
at some points.  (I bet train couplings aren't actually that
secure)</p>

<p>At the end of the movie, when he's like, "what have you done
today???" I was like, "I did ISIS, made some art, and worked on my
story!"</p></li>

<li><p>we ate at the kaitein zushi shop near Cinecitta, having
forgotten about the annoying employee there</p></li>

<li><p>I barked at the annoying employee when she came up unsolicited
and told Ami the name of a type of seaweed that I didn't want to eat.
I was like, "yeah; she's Japanese," referring to Ami.  She knows the
names of Japanese foods.  <em>Then</em> she continued her useless
blabber by saying I was good at using chopsticks.  I was like, (in
English) "No shit! I've been in Japan for five years, now fuck
off."</p>

<p>PS: my reaction is *not* appropriate for polite Japanese behavior,
but damn that comment pisses me off.  (plus, the same woman said the
same thing when Ami and I were there some months ago.  Apparently she
didn't remember us from then, but perhaps she will if we ever go back
to that shop.)</p></li>

<li><p>we got a vanilla shake from Makka's</p></li>

<li><p>then wandered around the shops a bit more, but they were
mostly closing</p></li>

<li><p>back at home, and for the past couple of hours, I did my
Helma-homework: basically compiling a rough draft of a book
for <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">The Castle of Dreams
wiki</a>, using the stuff I wrote for NaNoWriMo 2007.</p>

<p>The book is available from the library, among other places to
those who know their way around Mediawiki websites.</p></li>
