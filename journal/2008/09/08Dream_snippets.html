<ul><li>
<p class="dream">There was an entrance in the fence with stairs leading down into area of the little
&quot;river&quot; near my house.  I realized that's why they must have paved over the old walls.</p></li>

<li><p class="dream">Had Uncle Cow and met some women at a pool party.  Most people hadn't met, so
I used U-Cow as an ice breaker.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Hmmm.. I just remembered Dru Daddy G once said that alcohol is a social lubricant.  So is U-Cow.</p>
