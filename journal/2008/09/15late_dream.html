<p class="dream">Going down an escalator to the 15th floor, I could feel the motion going down, but
we were already on the 7th floor, then 6th, 5th, etcth, and then the numbers started over again at
like 75th 74th, 73rd, down down down and skipped some numbers; it was like buildings had been
stacked upon each other.</p>

<p class="dream">On the way down, I wanted to see outside, but even though this elevator was so cool
that it could connect multiple buildings, it had no windows.  Then I noticed it *did* have windows,
but they were crudely blocked off with sheets of black rubber rivitted down on four corners of the
window, so I could slightly see out.  If Only I could have climbed on the thin hand rail, I could
have seen through the exposed window *above* the rubber sheet.  I didn't know if I'd be in trouble
for doing so, and the floor indicator changed from 38 or so to PHOTO, which perhaps meant they were
going to take my photo soon (and see me on the rail), so I ended up not seeing out the elevator
window.</p>

<p class="dream">I did, however, finally reach the 15th floor and got out in a room that had a
large rescessed area for couches and then along the walls a facade of a house, where kids could
play.  I looked through some pictures I had taken of JC with my cellphone.  I was surprised to find
I had taken so many, and I was flipping through them backwards, looking at the details being
exactly the same, but he had been in the facade play area, poking around and exploring.  I saw him
in the kitchen area, digging through some cans of food in the pantry.   Then a few pictures later
(previous) he was in the dish washer.  I was like &quot;wha?&quot; and flipped through the pictures
in forward order.  He climbed into the dish washer, and then vanished into the back and emerged
from the pantry!</p>

<p class="dream">I laughed at the hilarity, but then realized of course it should be that way.  It's
for little kids; they don't want kids to get trapped in the dish washer.  I walked back behind the
facade to find a large walkway where parents could easily collect kids who would have otherwise
vanished into the facade.</p>
