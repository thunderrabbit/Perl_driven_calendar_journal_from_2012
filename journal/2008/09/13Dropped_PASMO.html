<p>While transferring from Ginza line to Chiyoda line in Omotesando station, I was surprised to find
that I had aligned myself at the &quot;wrong&quot; door.  I wanted to zoom ahead of the crowd and
down the stairs in Chiyoda station, but I mis-remembered which door would stop there (or it changed,
which, though unlikely, has evidence to support the theory: the poster describing transfers said
carriage 3 is best, but actually carriage 2 was better than 3), so I was stuck in the crowd trudging
down the stairs.</p>

<p>But, happily, I was stuck trudging with a view of a woman with cool hair; it was cropped short
with a cute fuzzy tie on it.  I watched her hair as we descended the stair, then while walking
toward the exit, a PASMO appeared on the ground.  I immediately snagged it and wondered who dropped
it.  Considered shouting, &quot;hey yo, who dropped the PASMO?&quot; but didn't expect that would
come across correctly, so I just guessed that it was the girl I had been watching or her friend,
and as her friend went to exit, her card holder didn't work.  While she was like, 「あれ？」 I held
the card sorta in front of her, as she was turned sideways in the gate to see why it wasn't doing
what it normally did.</p>

<p>She recognized what happened, looked up at me and smiled as she took the card.  I converted my
fingers to Peace Sign, but I should also have smiled.  Ah well.</p>
