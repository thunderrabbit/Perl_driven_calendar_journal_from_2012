<p>Just finished ISIS #9 I think.  Found myself back under the rubble after an earthquake(?) in
China, post television, pre computer days.  So sad: unable to help people around me.  Sadder: not
able to help my family.  Died, relaxed, went back to my body, pain and sadness and anger: Why wasn't
I allowed to finish?  I was asked this lifetime to work hard for my family and I worked my
proverbial ass off but not allowed to see it through?  Not allowed to see them succeed?  I only
wanted to help my family...  I only wanted to let them go to school and have a better life than me.
I just wanted my kids to work hard like me.  I wanted my efforts not to be wasted.  I pushed them to
work hard... Oh shit I was a tyrant.  I pushed too hard; I had no idea I was doing anything wrong.
Oh I'm so sorry my dear family; you're better off without me, and I'm so sorry I hurt you.  I
thought I was doing just the right things.  Back to death: back home.  Gilt and shame soothed by
peace and angelic waves.</p>
