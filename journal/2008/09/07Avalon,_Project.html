I've been reading/ watching Project Camelot interviews for a while
now; they basically are trying to spread news about "what's really
happening" behind the scenes of media, government, etc.  Basically
they are interviewing peeps in-the-know of what's going on.

One guy (Benjamin Fulford) has recently said the US economy will
bankrupt on 8 September.  We'll see soon enough!
