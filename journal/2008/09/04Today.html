<p>Decently productive day at work: got some logic worked out for auto-updating a map or not, and I
think it's relatively user-friendly as well.  Basically if they move the location while zoomed in
at better than level 14, a boolean is set so that the dropdowns will not refresh the map.  So the
basic idea is the dropdowns choose roughly where they are, and then the user finetunes it.  After
finetuning, their work won't be lost.  Cool points: (!) if they move the marker while not-so-zoomed,
the dropdowns will still update the marker. (@) they can easily toggle the boolean if
they <em>want</em> the dropdowns to update the map.</p>

<p>It was this last point that gave me some trouble..  How to lock it at the right time, and how to
let them know why the dropdowns aren't working.   I had originally designed it so the boolean==true
means the map is locked, and it was down by the map, not near the dropdowns.  Now the logic is
opposite.  If boolean==true, the dropdowns work, and it's up by the dropdowns, so it makes sense to
the user.</p>

<p>I officially claim the above ideas as of noon 4 September 2008.  No more M$ weak patents on pgup
and pgdn or some crap like that.</p>

<p>Also got the new universal login code from our other systems merged with takeout.  Just as
sbstrm was supposed to go live, Andrew and Malek were like, &quot;hmmmm we should have a universal
login for our systems,&quot; and spent about 2 weeks on that and some other ideas that came up.
Now the takeout system has it as well, so anyone who can log into sbstrm will automagically be able
to logonto (*) takeout as well.</p>

<p>(*) I considered &quot;login to&quot; and &quot;log on to&quot;</p>

<p>Um, so that was good.  Oh, and then I played with Google's face recognition service on Picasa.
It did relatively well, considering most of the faces I had on their servers were me an' Hitomi
making funny faces.</p>
