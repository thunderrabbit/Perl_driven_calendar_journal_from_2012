<p>The great discussion between peeps on my nerd-list (Dude, Fred, Jesse, James) has
morphed <em>again</em> into some sort of politi-religical debate, far far from the original question
of whether the LHC will destroy the earth.</p>

<p>However, all has not been lost: someone posted a link
to <a href="http://hasthelhcdestroyedtheearth.com/">has the lhc destroyed the earth . com</a>,
which I forwarded to Andrew who hasn't responded, Phatpat who laughed, and Ryan McCarthy who asked
if the site updates automatically.</p>

<p>&quot;no,&quot; I assured him. &quot;you have to hit refresh.&quot;</p>
