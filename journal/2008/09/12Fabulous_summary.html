<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.projectcamelot.org/">Project Camelot</a>, I've just listened to a
fabulous <a href="http://www.projectcamelot.org/david_wilcock_9_sept_2008.mp3">history of the world
by David Wilcock</a> (in only 2 hours), including up to the present day (as of 9 September
2008).</p>

<p>From their <a href="http://www.projectcamelot.org/audio_interviews.html">Audio Interviews</a> page:</p>

<pre>
This is a blockbuster of a two hour phone conversation with David Wilcock, focusing on immediate
current events but spanning time travel, the Freemasons, the Anunnaki, the Nazis, WW II, advanced
technology, the Roswell crash, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Illuminati, the war in
Georgia, the coming US election, Benjamin Fulford's testimony, and what may or may not happen in the
coming few weeks and months.

<p>You can call me crazy; call me what you will, but I think we're amidst a spiritual enlightenment
of the world (though we'll still likely have some rough times).</p>
