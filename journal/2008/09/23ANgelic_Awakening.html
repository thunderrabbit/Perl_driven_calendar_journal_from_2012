<p>Arrived on time and all good.  We are nearing the end of our first break in this beautiful
apartment with a view over the Yurikamome Line and water near Odaiba.  First was some eye contact
exercises, and then receiving our angelic names.  Mine hasn't fully come yet, but I keep hearing F
and L sounds.  Maybe Foal or Flow or Orinoco Flow or Bubba Flo Jo or some such.</p>

<p>Gave to Tamara my painting called &quot;Angel&quot; for as upon meeting her, I realized the
painting would be perfect for her.  Before she consciously saw the name (written on the back), she
said, &quot;it's so angel.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>When we reconvened, Mai Rah gave us a brief history of earth, saying that several different
stocks of humans have been placed here, but it all started when this universe was created as a
universe of duality.  There was a call made to all beings to incarnate in this universe and
transmute the energy of duality into energy of oneness.</p>

<p>We applied for that job, and it was great at first, until we began to forget the reality in
favor of the dream.</p>

<p>But, there is now an opening for us to leave the system, basically between 1989 and 2011.</p>

<p>After describing the scene, we had a ceremony: inviting angel Michael in to replace our swords of
duality for swords of truth.  The basic process was to energetically remove our swords, and offer
them to Michael, represented by a polished pink stone on a crystal.  Mai Rah channeled (sometimes
bodily) his requests (often to remove other weapons and shields) and gifts (gold jewels for third
eye vision, or green juice for healing, etc).  S/he had me remove a breastplate and said, &quot;ah,
Roman,&quot; which I hadn't previously considered, but could certainly be.  Also suggested I take
off some leather leggings which were keeping me rigid.  (really?)</p>

<p>I stood in my modra (sp) stance, with arms open and hands sending energy to support the space.
She goes, &quot;there's a reason you hold your hands like that,&quot;</p>

<p>and I was careful not to 'get embarrassed' and stop.  I left them still and she continued,</p>

<p>&quot;You have healing hands.&quot;</p>

<p>I knew that, but it's nice to get a confirmation.</p>

<p>&quot;It's like gold light streaming out of your hands.&quot;</p>

<p>I knew that too, but it's nice to get a confirmation.  I received no excess gifts besides my new
handy dandy sword of truth.</p>

<p>After helping clean up, I was the last person to leave besides Tamara and Mai Rah.  I told Tamara
clearly that I have a crush on her, and that I have a girlfriend, so nothing will come of the crush.
She said it was sweet, and it seems nothing more will come from her end, either.  We decided in the
end to just be friends.  And perhaps I'll become an NLP client of hers, if'n I like the process.
She said it's &quot;amazing,&quot; and I'm all about trying amazing things when suggested by people
with such credentials.</p>
