<p>Went to The Pink Cow with Ulrike tonight; cool thing: she met Travis in Shibuya cause I was in a
lesson with Yurika until 8pm, which is when the dinner started.  Around 8:20 I joined the table with
Travis, Ulrike, Sue, YK, Tom and Waki.  Hadn't previously met Sue; she's from Slovakia, which (,
apparently,) is close to where I guessed she was from (I guessed Holland).  She was like, &quot;it's
south of there.&quot; &quot;Um, Poland?  Romania?  Switzerland?  Afghanistan?  Czechoslovakia?&quot;
&quot;Yes; Slovakia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow.  Now, why did I think Czechoslovakia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The name was changed,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Man, I've got to learn European geography.  And African, and Middle East, and and and.  I'm
pretty good with Canadia and Australia, so that's good, at least.</p>

<p>Chatted with Waki a bit; I've still got a slight affection for her, just cause of her smile and
genkiness, but I don't genuinely know her.  She might see the movie &quot;Into the Wild&quot; with
YK's movie group on Tuesday, or she might go into the wild with Travis (as might I) on the same day
for Travis' hiking trip.  Not sure if I've got plans with Ami; we'll see; we'll see.</p>

<p>So, right now, Ulrike and I are side by side on the Tokyu Toyoko Line, listening to one earbud
each of her mp3 player.  Best of MTV Unplugged.  Right now Nirvana's &quot;Plateau,&quot; of which I
had never previously heard.</p>
