<p>I've been reading news and such on my other computer.  For some reason, my computer with better
emacs settings (this one (white MacBook)) farks on occassion so that the mouse doesn't work until I
log off and back on.  So I can't turn on the airport to get internet connection going.</p>

<p>!) From <a href="http://abovetopsecret.com/">above top secret</a>, read an article regarding
Hurricane Ike damage in Galveston *not* being shown on news.  Basically people wondering why there's
only scant coverage of the west side of Galveston Island.  Conspiracy?  Why did FEMA take over the
cell network?  Why put a biocontainment lab on this hurricane-prone island?</p>

<p>@) Holy crap Merril Lynch bought by Bank of America, and Lehman Brothers down the crapper.  WTF?</p>

<p>3) Palin wants war war and more war.</p>

<p>$) gasoline price gouging in Kentucky</p>

<p>%) I have to leave the house at 9am to meet Tariq on time in Hamamatsucho</p>
