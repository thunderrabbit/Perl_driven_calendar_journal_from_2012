<p>This morning on my way out, I saw Ulrike.  She's going to Kamakura today.   I was like,
&quot;oh, the same place as we went [to the beach (on her first weekend here)],&quot; and she was
like, &quot;oh really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, so you can tell them, 'yeah; I've alrady been here.' hahaha&quot;</p>

<p>I bid her farewell, headed down the stairwell, and then Cow asked if he could go as well.
Ver'well, so I asked her, and she agreed to take Cow and take pictures.</p>
