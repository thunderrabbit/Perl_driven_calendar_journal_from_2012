<p>After lunch with Travis, most of my time went to watching YouTube vids suggesting the moon
landing was a hoax, as well as Airplane Day being misrepresented by mass media.</p>

<p>But then I tweaked the keitai admin site a bit, adding a footer and title, plus getting the most
recent blog entries read from the DB.  Still gonna do a bit on that: make their retrieval optional,
as well as the menu.</p>

<p>Then, Blue Man Group.</p>
