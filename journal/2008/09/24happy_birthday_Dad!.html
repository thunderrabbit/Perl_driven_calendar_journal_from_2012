HI Dad!!!

Happy Birthday!!

I just woke up from a dream featuring you having a lovely time with my friends Molly and Will (you
may have met Maggie and Molly, twins who I met at University of Houston).  Ami and I were in a
parking lot in a big shopping mall, and you were helping me figure out this new computer system from
which I was able to clear out a bunch of old empty images of file folders, many of which were
labeled SUPER IMPORTANT, but which were all empty.  They were actually jpg images of empty file
cabinet folders.

There was a raging fire nearby (like the car next to us was burning), but we weren't concerned with
that; it was burning in a good way or something.

I woke up with happy happy thoughts of you after giving you big hugs in my dream.

Then, thought, OMG!  I didn't write dad for his birthday!!  Fortunately, though it's the 25th
*here*, it's still your birthday *there*, so whoohooo!  Happy Birthday!!

I'm enjoying stuff here... I just went to an Angelic Awakening workshop on Tuesday (a holiday in
Japan), which promised I'd get my Angelic Name.  I heard Elonn (sp) at some point because I know you
discovered that name during one of your processes..  It seemed like my outer mind; the name didn't
resonate with me per se.  The closest I got were some syllables: F or maybe FO and L.  FLO FOL
FLORIAN, FOAL, LOAF...  Hmmmmm; still nothing has come, but the workshop leader said "it will come;
it always comes."

During the workshop, we did a ceremony with "Angel Mikael" (sp) who traded our sword of duality for
a sword of truth (all energetic work, as led by our clairvoyant instructor, who occassionally bodily
channeled various beings to do specific energy work with people.  It was a bit weird, but she did
none of that for me.  For me, she said, "your hands are healing hands," and I thought, "I know," and
"they have bright light beaming from them," and I thought, "I know."  It's nice to get confirmation.
:-)

We are moving our office at work; moving to the apartment of the boss, who lives nearby, so the
company can save some money, some of which will come to *me*, cause for the last two months, I've
been on a low-ish consultant pay as I've been helping them get a new product out to make some bigger
money soon.

Ami and I are having fun, though I'm not sure that I want to marry her.  I'm not quite sure what to
do in that department.

I've been doing ISIS therapy, a type of regressive emotional cleansing, during which I often find
myself in past life situations, crying or angering over this or that situation as I gain some
clarity on how the emotional scar has beeen affecting me in *this* lifetime, and then releasing it.
I've written about all 11 sessions on my wiki, ifn' you wanna glance through them.
<a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:ISIS">http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:ISIS</a> ISIS stands for InnerSpace Interactive
Sourcing, and was developed by Samuel Sagan who's founded Clairvision (<a href="http://clairvision.org">http://clairvision.org</a>).  One
of the basic ideas is that we can reach higher states in meditation by removing the samskaras (sp),
emotional scars, that tend to make us fidgit during meditation.

I've been painting more frequently, partly inspired by my realization that I *like* to paint, and
that I could make some money doing something I enjoy.  I've also got an idea for building another
marble track; I want to take photos during the construction so people can watch a stop-action
animation of it being built.

My room is a bit messy, but I'm getting asymptotically closer to cleaning it.

   Love and Light and Happy and Birthday
    - Rob!!!
