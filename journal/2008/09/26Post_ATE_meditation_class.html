<p>Today was the first (of four) Post ATE (*) meditation class for the ATE we did a couple months
ago.  Not sure why it took so long to get the class started, but glad it finally did.</p>

<p>(*) Awakening The third Eye</p>

<p>I fell asleep like crazy during the first meditation, and then was much more awake during the
second one.  Basically when Helma said something like, &quot;try to sense an uplifting energy,&quot;
or some such, and for the first time, I felt something like an uplifting energy.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  So that was good.</p>
