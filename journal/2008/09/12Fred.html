<p>hello midnight.</p>

<p>Fred is my brother.  He's 4.25 years younger than me, though that makes very little difference
now.  Back in the day, it made all the difference in the world.</p>

<p>Fred lives in Austin, and is attending UT as a PhD student, working on some sort of medical
modeling, though at the moment, I don't remember if it's regarding the heart or brain (the topic has
changed in the past).  I *do* know that he's been working on it for a while, and I always want to
support him, though it's hard to do so while overseas.</p>

<p>Fred is on the [[dooj email list]], named after a combination of [[Dude]]'s name, and part of
me-an-Fred's last name.  Although since the time of its inception (on my gmail account), I added
[[Jesse]], and Jesse's added [[James]], though I haven't added James to my dooj list (yet).</p>

<p>Fred doesn't usually write a lot on the list, but he does weigh in with well-written, logical and
useful analysis, the quality of which I'd love to equal.  Seems that we all have our favorite
aggregators; Fred's URLs are often from xkj (sp).</p>

<p>The dooj email list only exists as such in my gmail account.  I named it as a combination of
[[Dude]]'s name, and part of me-an-Fred's last name, for it originally included only Dude and Fred.
I found myself sending links to them repeatedly, so I wanted an easy way to do so.</p>

<p>At one point, I added my dad's address to the To field, as a test to see if he would reply.  He
didn't, and after a couple of attempts, I stopped adding his address.</p>

<p>After some time, I added [[Jesse]] in a similar manner.  This felt a bit odd at first, for Jesse
has never met Dude nor my brother, but Jesse seems to send items to the list as often as any of
us, and I've now added him to the dooj shortcut.</p>

<p>After not much time, the input coming from Jesse seemed to include a distinctly
Christian-influenced religious overtone.  I responded with some variant of my
[[R.O.B.O.T. |personal beliefs]], and Jesse called in James for support.</p>

<p>I wrote this last night, and copied it to my wiki
under <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Peeps:Fred">Fred</a>,
and <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Journal:Dooj_email_list">Dooj email list</a>, respectively.</p>
