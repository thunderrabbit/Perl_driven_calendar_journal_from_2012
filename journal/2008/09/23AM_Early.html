<p class="date">8:57am JST Tuesday 23 September 2008 (day 14062)</p>

<p>Woke up at like 4:20 am, after finding my blanket rotated 90 degrees, fixing it, then realizing
it was my <em>body</em> rotated 90 degrees, and realigned myself with the bed.  Not sure what
happened to turn me..</p>

<p>I had been dreaming about the billing project, and how to do it.  Confirmed that the way I've
got it designed is correct; I mentally examined another pattern of applying the invoice items, but
it won't work as easily as the way I've already got it.</p>

<p>Was feelin' kinda ooky: hot and pooey; I took a shower around 4:30am (I hadn't the previous
morning, nor last night).  Neat to have the sun wake up while I was in the shower.  I easily noticed
because I had all the lights off in the house, including in the shower.  I like taking dark showers;
I can see quite easily in my kinesthetic mind.</p>

<p>Painted Colleen's painting for a bit.</p>

<p>Now in Tokyo Teleport before Angelic Awakening Workshop.</p>
