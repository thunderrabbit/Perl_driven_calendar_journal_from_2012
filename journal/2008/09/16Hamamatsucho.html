<p>Got a slip of paper saying the Tokyu Toyoko Line was as much as an hour late.  By my estimation,
it was more like 5 minutes late; I'm surprised to have gotten such a late pass.  Then again, I have
no idea how long it takes 'em to punch these passes; they're apparently done by hand, as the holes
never line up perfectly, nor even consistently.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  Going to Hamamatsucho to meet Tariq for the first time in some
time (month?) to talk about chatforest.  I'm thinking we could have some trivia games; I just saw
news of a jungle giraffe, so that would be a good animal to include, I think...  especially if it
lives in the rainforest, but shux, I guess jungle counts as forest in any case.</p>

<p>How is jungle different than forest?  Rainforest gets lots of rain annually, but wtf is a
jungle?</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Here's the definition according to Dictionary:</p>

<pre>
a style of dance music incorporating elements of ragga, hip-hop, and hard core and consisting almost
exclusively of very fast electronic drum tracks and slower synthesized bass lines, originating in
Britain in the early 1990s. Compare with drum and bass.
</pre>

<p>Oh wait.</p>

<pre>
an area of land overgrown with dense forest and tangled vegetation, typically in the tropics
</pre>

<p>And for rainforest:</p>

<pre>
a luxuriant, dense forest rich in biodiversity, found typically in tropical areas with consistently heavy rainfall.
</pre>

<p>Seem pretty much the same to me, 'cept for the rain.</p>

<p>Good meetin'; we came up with some interesting ideas, including a couple of viable games, I
think.  Not sure how to find time to do them, but.</p>

<p>Headed to work now.  Plan for today is to fix a bunch of English and have all the translations
keys ready for Sho to translate.</p>
