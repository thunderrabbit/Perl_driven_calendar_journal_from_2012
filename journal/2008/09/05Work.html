<p>Working on takeout these days.  Yesterday I got code from Andrew which I incorporated..  Oh the
universal login; I wrote about that a bit.  Today worked on getting what was actually quite easy to
do, but somehow I got all confuzed and tried to bring in some unneeded code.  I'm literally still
not sure what happened and why I thought those bits were needed (new header and footer being used
in sbstrm).  Got rid of those, and it worked.  I was a bit frustrated at Andrew for answering again
what I already knew instead of my question, but my question was basically, &quot;why am I
confused?&quot; or more specifically, &quot;why did I bring in these two files when I started with
just fixing the auto-logout?&quot;</p>

<p>Once I got replaced the unneeded files with the ones I already had, it worked fine again.  Oh,
and I had replaced the auto-logout code with the new version from sbstrm.  Oh, AND I had to replace
the security key creation code with a new version, but I have no idea wtf was happening with that.
Or, why tf the keys were starting as 16 chars long, then jumping to 17 for no apparent reason...
after they had been created...  (arrived at Ogikubo to do Ensofic Ray)</p>
