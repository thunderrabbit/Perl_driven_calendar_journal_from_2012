<p>On the test box, my login doesn't have permission to create new tables, so I logged onto the
closer-to-live staging machine and created some tables in an old DB made for Malek's brother some
months ago.  Since Jalal is no longer in Japan, I figured he won't mind, nor even notice, so.  No
biggie.</p>

<p>Just about to start doing some SQL queries to throw some data around, but gotta go to lesson with
Yurika right about now.</p>

<p>But I did do this much:</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO invoice_items (invoice_id, item_name, item_price, item_type, product_id)
SELECT '1', item_name, item_price, item_type, product_id FROM contract_items
WHERE contract_id='1';
</pre>

<p>It's a start.</p>
