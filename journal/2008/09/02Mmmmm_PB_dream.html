<p class="dream">Aboard Clipper Pacific, back on PB!  I don't remember the deets of the
conversation, but I looked outside and saw big waves, so I went to the window to look out at the
other ship traffic, and saw several camflauge painted ships and big waves that almost pushed a ship
onto another ship.  Then we were suddenly in some very calm water and sailing really really fast and
like zoooom even though there was ice in the water, and then through a narrow channel with a thin
layer of ice over it, with penguins walking on the ice.  The penguins scattered for safety as the
ship rushed through and slowed down as it headed up a ramp to the dock.  I was the first person off
because I was closest to the door and saw a couple of staff inside.  I showed them U-Cow, but s/he
was all fat and it looked like the stuffing had gotten twisted and enlarged.  I couldn't find his
URL nor cards.  Passengers started getting off the ship and I let the staff go greet them.  I saw
Tomoe from Okinawa and was like woohoo! cause she's cool and I went upstairs to find her, but didn't
know to what floor she had gone.  Didn't find her, but found some other rooms as I woke up.</p>
