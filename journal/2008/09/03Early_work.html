<p>Sucessfully chatted with Tina and Colleen, read news
about <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/02/rnc.security/index.html?eref=rss_latest">RNC
police attacking protestors</a>, added a blog entry to <a href="http://thunderrabbit.sbstrm.com/">my
sbstrm page</a>, and designed a UI that I think will work for the map stuff.  Basically a way for
users to lock the coords of their location so changing the city won't refresh the map.</p>
