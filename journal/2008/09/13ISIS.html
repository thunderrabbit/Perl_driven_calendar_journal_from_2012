<p>I ate 6 (six) ice cream cones yesterday.  Only six because that's how many the Glico guy gave
us, expecting them to last the whole <em>week</em>  A *week*!!!</p>

<p>So Helma focused on my guts during the ISIS.  I was like, &quot;that's right on my ice
cream.&quot;</p>

<p>She goes, &quot;yep.  Just feel that ice cream in there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's my secret.  Ice cream bingeing.&quot;  Then I got more into the space.  I was like,
&quot;I don't want to get fat.  But I like ice cream.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you want to get fat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It means I have no self control.  I don't like fat people because they have no self
control.  I don't want to lose control.  That's one reason I've never been drunk; I don't want to
lose control.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just feel that space.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel ashamed about eating so much ice cream.  I couldn't control myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When was the first time you felt that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I was about 3, I would pull up the yarn from the carpet; it would unravel in long
bouncy strings, and I would wear them as hair.  I wanted to be a girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And my parents told me not to do that.  No, they asked me why I wanted to be a girl.  I
don't know.  I'm three years old.  Maybe I was older, but I was less than five.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just feel that space.&quot;</p>

<p class="lucid">&quot;When I was about five years old I missed my ride to school so I went to the creek to play
in the rain and I got in trouble.&quot;   Bam there it hit.  I fell into grief and sadness.
&quot;I just wanted to play, but they got mad at me.&quot;  Crying crying crying (repeat). &quot;I
wasn't ready for school I was in my underwear so I couldn't open the door to tell them to wait.</p>

<p class="lucid">&quot;'<em>well you should have ____...</em>'</p>

<p class="lucid">&quot;Fuck that I'm only five years old and I shouldn't be left alone to get ready
for school!&quot;</p>

<p>Crying crying crying.</p>

<p>Then, as seems to be the pattern, the crying quickly dried up and I felt lovely tingly tingly
waves of energy washing over my body.  Chilled there for a bit.</p>

<p>After a while, Helma goes, &quot;what are you feeling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;¤Þ¡¢shit happens; they did their best; just relax.&quot;</p>

<p>Relaxed until the end of the ISIS session.</p>

<p>I believe I was five years old and school had just started for the year.  Helma checked my
astrological chart at the time and noted that in Septemer 1975, Neptune just crossed from/to my 1st
house from my 12th (or vice versa (or something)).  Neptune = water: duly noted.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p class="date">11:40am JST</p>

<p>Oh wait, there was more.  I basically was like, &quot;I just want to play,&quot; and
&quot;there's a lot I want to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Write a book, write another book, write a movie, write in my journal, create art... and
maybe other things&quot;  <em>maybe a million other things, but those are basics.</em></p>

<p>And so my homework is to work on the overview plot for my Castle of Dreams story.  I also want
to get Nim and Deek's blessing; I've tried to reach them; I'll try again.</p>
