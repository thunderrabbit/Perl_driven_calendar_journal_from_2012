<p>Fun times at Natalie's party!  I mostly enjoyed chatting with Will, who I met at ²Ö¸« this past
April in Yoyogi Park.  Also nice to be included in the slide show commemorating the fun and
friendships connected to Natalie (from that (same) day with dueling RoboCams by attaching our
monkey-tripods with cameras to our heads as we filmed each other)</p>

<p>Uncle Cow got some action as well, though I've not yet uploaded the pictures.  The professional
dancer friend of Lin's came, so U-Cow and I (and others) posed with her a couple of times.  I told
Will I was equally parts offended and intrigued by her dancing; she's basically the least Japanese
Japanese woman I've personally seen.</p>

<p>Also of note: in the audio recording I linked yesterday(?), of
the <a href="/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=all&date=2008/09/20#Project_Camelot_interview">recent
interview of Kerry and Bill from Project Camelot</a> (I think), they were talking at times about
&quot;Earth Changes,&quot; and how our thoughts are more easily manifested than before (so be
careful what you think), so I noticed that <em>just after</em> I was thinkin' I'd like to get some
pictures with the dancer, I was called to join a photo with her and a couple of her closer friends.
I gave Ami my camera and the results will be on U-Cow's site soon.</p>
