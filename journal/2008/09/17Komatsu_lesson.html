<p>Not surprisingly, Komatsu has apparently called to cancel (part of) his lesson.  I'm going to
tell them I won't do it unless I'm paid for 2 hours (as originally planned).  It's not worth my time
to bust away from work for 2 hours and only get paid for 1 hour.  Normally, busting away for 3 hours
and getting paid for 2 is okay; I need the moolah.</p>

HI Suzuki-san

I understand Komatsu wants a lesson from 3 to 4pm.  It takes me one hour of travel, and the one hour
lesson is not much money for me.  I want to cancel the lesson or charge for 2 hours, as originally
planned.

新しい予定をわかりましたんだけど、も壱時間電車と壱時間しかないレッソンはちょっと安いと思います。ので、
もし二時間のお金もらいましたら、大丈夫です。どう？

<p>I'll have Sho check my Japanese there.  And by &quot;check&quot; I mean &quot;completely
rewrite.&quot;</p>

<p>Sho's not here; I sent as above.  They decided to cancel, which is fine by me.</p>
