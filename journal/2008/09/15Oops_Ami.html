<p>Got a call from Ami just as I was finishing writing about ISIS session from today.  Actually
just writig about the warm tingly feeling I get after large emotional releases.  I asked Helma for
her thoughts on it, and she said it's rlelated to the eheric body and she went on to describe some
other aspects that I've temporarily misplaced in my brain.</p>

<p>Anyway, Ami called and d'oh!  She's in my room, as in, expecting me to be there.   Welp; I
forogt my power supply and chose to pick it up after ISIS, which went a little bit long as Helma
was telling me about some other stuff she's got going o, plus  invited me to help her model doing
ISIS at  the Circle of Light meeting this weekend.</p>

<p>So now I'm on the train (1:15 LTD EXP from Shibuya which I'll take to Musashi Kosugi, where TJ
Bike is waiting.</p>
