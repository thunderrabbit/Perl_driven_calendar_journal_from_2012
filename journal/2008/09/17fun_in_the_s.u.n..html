<p>Ami and I went to the Spiritual Unfoldment Network introductory meeting tonight, given in
English by Hari (whose name was given to him by an old Indian man (his dad)) and translated into
Japanese by Yukia, while Petya sat pretty quietly in the middle.</p>

<p>Ami says this time she could feel the energy more than the first time we went, and though she
can do it now, she couldn't think of anything negative when asked during the workshop.  And her
head hurt some.</p>

<p>I mostly wiggled around and wanted to sleep for most of it.</p>
