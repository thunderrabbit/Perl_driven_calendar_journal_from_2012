<p>Also good: Kumi was in the ATE, and in this class as well.  She lives on my line (or vice versa)
near Nakameguro.  Tonight we visited an Italian restaurant (that Jimmy da Magnet and I visited one
time) and chowed pizza over life overview conversations.  She asked me &quot;why Japan?&quot; and I
asked for her similar story when I finished.</p>

<p>She told me about seeing a total solar eclipse in Australia (and was so impressed that she went
to AFrica (Zambia) for the next one).  Told me about getting a new lease on life after being in the
hospital, and now searching for some meaning within via meditation.</p>

<p>Turns out she's my senior by 31 days.</p>

<p>She told me about being afraid to hike around South America because she heard it was too
dangerous.  So then she realized she had to do the impossible, and she did the trip.  Awesome.  Six
weeks of awesomeness.</p>

<p>She asked me what my fear was, and I told her basically initiating conversation with people.  she
listened intently, and then gave a great suggestion that she heard from someone who heard from
someone else.  Just say, &quot;interesting weather, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>Perfect.  So then I told her my next fear which is to continue the conversation, in terms of
promoting myself or my ideas or whateva.  She suggested (basically) that there may be a part of me
that rejects others, and so I'm assuming others will reject me.  Hmmmm yes, in fact, I know of a
perfect example of that.  I snubbed a co-worker when he saw me on campus at University of Houston.
This was over 10 years ago, but I've still got a lot of shame about it.  He was like, &quot;Hey
Rob!&quot; and I turned around, saw who it was, and was all, &quot;aw, it's just Bang,&quot;
and <em>didn't even realize</em> what an insult that was until he confronted me later at work.</p>

<p>Damn.  And I don't remember ever really apologizing to him, and I obviously haven't cleared it
from my system because the story is sill with me after over 1/4 of my life so far.</p>

<p>Kumi suggested I write him a letter.</p>
