<p>Yesterday was our first day in our new location.  I worked pretty solidly, which agrees with our
plan to have core hours from 11am to 6pm, and arriving up to an hour before and between an hour or
two after.</p>

<p>I left right at 8pm yesterday, leaving the rest of them before they went to some party.  Andrew
wasn't feelin' too good at times today.  &quot;You're lucky you don't drink,&quot; he assured
me.</p>

<p>I don't think it's luck.</p>

<p>Anyway, headed home and saw Ami for the first time in a while; I had been busy with workshops and
hiking and all that which I carefully chronicled in here.  Ami was cute as always, and I was glad to
see her.  Assured her that I would pay for her to attend the ATE next month; that's how much I want
her to go.  Really really really want my partner to be doing personal growth work, and ISIS is the
best that I know she can do in Japan.</p>
