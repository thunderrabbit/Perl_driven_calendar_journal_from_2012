<p>Met Travis (who works in my same building for lunch; he covered me at Thanks, Nature, which has
become my favorite eating facility near my work.  I got two slices of quiche for 390 each (I think),
and they were quite yummy, though not quite filling for my tummy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I told Travis about <a href="http://www.iknow.co.jp/">iknow.co.jp</a>, or I started to
tell him, but he interrupted; he's not impressed with their flash based product.  Ah
well.  <em>I</em> like it, and it seems to be working for me, though I've only used it for two days
so far.  We shall see; we shall see.</p>

<p>He told me about some other stuff that I think would be good for discussion in my men's group,
but he didn't seem particularly interested in that.  I hope he can sort it all out.</p>
