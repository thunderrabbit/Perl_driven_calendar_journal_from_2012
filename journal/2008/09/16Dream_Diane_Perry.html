<p class="dream">Pushing a cart through the street after noticing how
good it smelled when a woman pushed it by; she was advertising
smells.  So delicious that I had to help.  We went through a gate that
we needed to lock again later.  After the short journey through the
streets and up a hill, I said I would go back and lock the gate.  The
locks were all old old old and rusty, so I wasn't sure which ones were
the correct ones to lock.  I just locked all three of them and figured
that was more secure than leaving them open, especially since one of
them could be opened by hand.</p>

<p class="dream">Diane Perry came to check and she approved at first,
but then when I told her I locked all three, she said she needed to
talk to me, and we were in a really nice house party and she asked me
why I would have thought to lock all of them.  I was close to shutting
down my brain and just meekly taking the tongue lashing, but I sorted
out why I had done it and was prepared to say something, but she
wasn't done yet, so I said, "excuse me one minute," and I stepped away
to wash my hands, but there was food being prepared in that sink, so I
went to a different restroom and locked the door, and after washing my
hands there, she knocked on the door and I invited her in.  I was just
about to talk to her when my alarm woke me up.</p>
