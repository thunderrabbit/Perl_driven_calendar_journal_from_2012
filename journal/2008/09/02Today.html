<p>Today was the day &quot;Chrome&quot; was announced, Andrew ranted about how terribly he didn't
want to test for another browser, and I carefully read the comic and told him how great it would
be.  He finally came around to, &quot;it could be really great or really bad..&quot;</p>

<p>I added lat/long/zoom values to some of the areas in the database..  I wasn't able to find a
list of all the cities, and even if I did, that wouldn't be as helpful as having a list of all the
popular clubbin' areas of town.</p>

<p>Our new product is available!  Check out <a href="http://sbstrm.com/">sbstrm.com</a>.</p>

<p>My artist page is at <a href="http://thunderrabbit.sbstrm.com/">thunderrabbit.sbstrm.com</a>.
The picture of me and Francois was taken on our most recent day together, back in February of this
year.</p>

<p>Ami came over to give Andrew her iPhone for a day.  I went home with her and gave her my phone
for the day, but somehow in all the silliness, my phone ended up in my pocket, so Ami doesn't have
a phone for tomorrow.  Ooops!</p>

<p>Tonight's the night Curry asked why the water didn't drain out of thw washing machine when she
did laundry <em>two days ago</em> (the clothes were still there tonight, though I had tried to
restart the cycle when I found them a couple days ago, Ami said they were Karen's, cause she stops
the washer in the middle of the load and lets them sit.</p>

<p>Today was Ulrike's second day of work.  She looked pretty happy when I queried her about her job
so far.  Says everyone is friendly, etc.</p>

<p>For the past couple of hours I've been trying to sort out how to use Ubiquity to access the
innards of a frame in another tab.  I can get to the frame, (I think), but I can't seem to find a
way to access the stuff inside it.  Part of the problem: I'm using Growl as my alert, and it only
prints so much info before running out of screen.</p>

<p>The code I have so far:</p>

<pre>
CmdUtils.CreateCommand({

_dump: function (arr,level) {
	var dumped_text = "";
	if(!level) level = 0;
	
	//The padding given at the beginning of the line.
	var level_padding = "";
	for(var j=0;j&lt;level+1;j++) level_padding += "#";
	
	if(typeof(arr) == 'object') { //Array/Hashes/Objects 
		for(var item in arr) {

			var value = arr[item];
			
			if(typeof(value) == 'object') { //If it is an array,
				dumped_text += level_padding + "'" + item + "' ...";
                                if(level &lt; 1)
 				{
                                   dumped_text += this._dump(value,level+1);
                                }
			} else {
				dumped_text += level_padding + "'" + item + "' =&gt; \"" + value + "\"X";
			}

		}
	} else { //Stings/Chars/Numbers etc.
		dumped_text = "===&gt;"+arr+"&lt;===("+typeof(arr)+")";
	}
	return dumped_text;
},

<p>The code requires a <a href="http://ubiquitously.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=34">small tweak to the builtin.js</a>.</p>
