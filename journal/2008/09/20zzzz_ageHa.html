<pre>
nearly 3 hours at ageHa gives me a good workout, as it did tonight.  Ami, who had to use Akiko's ID
to get in, and I are waitin' for the free bus, which arrived as I typed &quot;for,&quot; and will take us to
Shibuya soonly.

We may have stayed longer, but Ami started to feel sick, perhaps cause of my boucing, jumping, gut
shaking dance.

Oh wait.  That was my stomach.

We plan to chow ramen in Shibuya while waiting for the first train, head home, shower, sleep, then
I'll go to work for a beginning to move and pizza party, and then straight to Circle of Light, where
Helma will give a workshop on entities, including some sample ISIS sessions featuring me as the ISIS
client.

<p class="date">1:56pm JST Sunday 21 September 2008 (day 14060)</p>

<p>After Nat's party, a good portion of us headed to ageHa.  Ami and I didn't go in immediately as
she had to get Akiko's ID card (via Lin, after Akiko went in), but immediately upon going in, and I
had specifically left my glasses in the locker to prepare for this, I was ready to <em>dance</em>.
Said HI to Will, whizzed in the loo, then whizzed into the main room, breathing the fresher, cooler
air, and letting my legs do the rest.  And by &quot;rest,&quot; I mean anything but that, except
after a while, when Ami found me jumping an imaginary jump rope in time with the beat and tried to
tell me something (that I never understood).</p>

<p>I danced &quot;with&quot; Ami after that, jumping 180 degree turns to face her then face away,
using the 8 or 16 beat music changes at cues to rotate.  Eventually, she led me away, like a
kangaroo on a leash to the outer room, where the crowd was thinner, and the beat faster.  In that
room, I drew parts of large rectangles in the air, plus several other varieties of Rob's Crazy
Dance.</p>

<p>Got tired after a bit and found Ami outside.  Led her to the pool area, where no one was
swimming.  They were smoking instead, so I was going to leave, but realized there was a breeze and
decided to go to the other side of the pool (up wind), where I imagined the wind would keep us
breathing fresh air.  The air was fresher, *and* the moves were fresher, because lo, I found Will
(and everyone else) and he and I did a variety of funny themed dances: shopping cart, driving a car,
lawn mower, and (on Jen's suggestion), peanut butter sandwich.  I inadvertantly showed Will my
rectangle dance, which he augmented with an extra slice (two paned window?) and I augmented to be
like venetian blinds..  maybe it could be the venetian blind cleaning dance...</p>

<p>I don't know what kinda crazy dance he did after that, but it apparently had a name and featured
screaming.  Maybe screaming zombie...  Even if that's not the name, there should be a dance for that
name.</p>

<p>The group moved to the bar area to see some sorta show (which had just ended as we arrived), and
after that I didn't really see the group again.  Headed back past the big room and was sucked onto
the dance floor by the beats.  I did some stair step dance steps, basically speedily stepping up and
down the steps, using either 3 of the steps in repeated and reversed sequence, or many mini steps up
the whole case's set of steps in cases where I wanted to visit Ami for to check on her and chill
for a second.</p>

<p>Eventually (after maybe three such sequences), I rested for a period of time during which I was
meditatively groovin' with Mother Earth, committing to be her willing volunteer to help support her
in a loving way.  I toned some OMMMs which were lost to everyone else in the blur of beats, but I
envisioned as resonating with the entire Earth, helping bring us to a higher state of being.</p>

<p>Lin et. al. happened by, and said HI and bye.  After a few more OMMMs (some of which I made
apparent to Ami), I asked if she was ready to go.  She was, and I asked her to tell them we were
leaving.  She asked *me* to tell them we were leaving, but I said I couldn't see them (no glasses,
plus it's dark, etc).  She suggested that we go together, which I was just about to do, but then she
said, &quot;but if you're tired, don't worry,&quot; and I <em>was</em> tired, so I took the offer,
but then immediately wanted to find her to find them to share some hugs and thank yous and see yous.

<p>I wrote the below before I wrote this expanded entry above.</p>

<p>At 3:13am I wrote the message above from my phone.</p>

<p>I was tired tired at the end as I plopped down by Ami who had been waiting for me to finish my
aerobics (&quot;dancing&quot; ??), and did *not* join her as she went to find the others to say we
were leaving.  I immediately regretted that; I missed a chance for hugs, and a thought came to mind
that it might be a while before I see them again, possibly related to something in the first 10 days
of October (7 October 2008, anyone?), which I only heard via the previously linked Project Camelot
interview, and wouldn't have even mentioned (&quot;be careful what you think,&quot;) but, (I don't
actually believe my thoughts will affect such a possible big event, if it's already in the works,
and) it's still pokin' me in the mind, even a day later.</p>
