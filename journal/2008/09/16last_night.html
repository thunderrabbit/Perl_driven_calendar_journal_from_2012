<p>Didn't do any painting nor writing on Castle of Dreams, but I did watch some vids of the damage
on Galveston.  Water was at eye level in a guy's house (and that &quot;island&quot; is basically
flat, so pretty much everyone's house musta been that soaked).  The vid showed inside his dining
room and living room with the furniture all rearranged into nice piles of debris by the water.
Everything moved except the monster TV.  I guess flat panel TVs don't float.</p>

<p>Another video seemed to be helicopter footage from soon after the storm; all the houses seemed
intact (except one that was dramatically burning) but they were surrounded by water.</p>

<p>Also downloaded a 10 minute ぶかっけ video from rapidshare that I found on 4chan.  That download
was in 6 parts, during which I watched a vid on prisonplanet.com of Jesse Ventura vs reporters in
Minnesota about Airplane Day.</p>
