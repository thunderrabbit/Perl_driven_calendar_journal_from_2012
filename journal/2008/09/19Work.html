<p>I began writing some code for the billing project at work.  I was originally (t)asked to write
everything from scratch (so we can see how you do stuff), but after not so much thought, I realize
I'm not going to do that.  First I was like, &quot;yo Andrew; I'm going to use the DB class cause it
would be silly to rewrite it.&quot; He agreed, and then when I started slappin' down some code, I
was like, &quot;well shizah; I'll need a user login system&quot; (already written), &quot;and a MVC
framework&quot; (already written)... AND, I was waiting and waiting for someone to make a DB for me
to use, and for someone else to give me a web directory to use..... but that didn't happen, so I
just ended up appending a directory to the takeout project.  I'll just surgically remove it later.
Plus, this will make it way easier to incorporate into our current framework.  Cause it will already
be there.</p>

<p>On the trai home, I layed out the functions that I'll need to write soon.  I will probably just
put them in a class based on element_factory, and call it invoice_factory.</p>
