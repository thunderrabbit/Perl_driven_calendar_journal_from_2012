<p>I remember snippets from three dreams; I checked the clock after the first one, and it was about
2:30am:</p>

<p class="dream">Andrew's car was in the shop.  It was a white sedan; perhaps a Ford Renault.  It
had just come out of the shop, but wasn't fixed properly, and he was driving it a bit, and we got
back to our new office, but Malek was sick; we saw him throwing up into a bucket, but he wouldn't go
home to take care of himself.</p>

<p class="dream">I had had the option to go across the street to cheat on my current girlfriend by
sleeping with Wende, at the same time that my house mate was going across the street to the same
house to do the same thing, but involving different people.  I had already done this once, and
chose not to do it again, so I went back to bed, and hadn't moved, but already had my soup bowl in
my hand, which couldn't otherwise be explained unless I had already gotten out of bed, so I hid it
under the bed with the intention of putting it away in the morning.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I saw Wende in line at a carnival, and she said something like, &quot;if you
see me smoking, then you'll know I'm really gone,&quot; and I was like, &quot;wha??&quot; and took
her in my arms and was looking down into her eyes and i go, &quot;smoking?  you?  really?&quot; or
something, cause I knew she didn't smoke so I was quite surprised.  She said &quot;maybe!&quot; in
a cute way or something.. not sure</p>

<p class="dream">Watching a man take notes in a lecture about NASA and stuff; he was a bit behind
in taking notes so he, for a while, was writing words with both hands at the same time.  He wrote
slowly with big, connected capital letters, like one of NASA's logos, but it was still cool to see
him do it. The lecture had actually been recorded and was being played for us from that tape.  We
were out in a vegetable field at the time.  There was a problem with something, and the person in
charge of the recording wanted to get the original speaker or something, but I woke up.</p>
