<p class="dream">Jackie Purdy wa at work, building a circuit board , both designing it and
soldering it together in an experimental fashion to see if she could solve some problem she was
having.  I was like, &quot;woah; you're even cooler than I thought!&quot; and lamented the fact we
haven't kept more in touch so I would know these kinds of things.  I called Meg Cusack cause I was
bored andwhen she answered, I realized she was also at work, and shouldn't be talking on the phone
about nothing, cause that's exactly what I had to chat bout.  Meg worked with failies in a
government office.  Not the best job for her, I think, but she had her reasons, which were beyond
my understanding.</p>

<p>My alarm woke me up at 7:06, and I turned it off but didn't' write down that dream
(above), back tos sleepin', and woke up with this dream:</p>

<p class="dream">chillin' with Fred in my messy room.  He said he liked loking around my room and
seeing all the stuff and wondering why it was there and thinking about the tie back in the day that
I had nothing but an idea and a dream to make it work.  I was like, yes that's al very poetic

He was like, &quot;for example, this cigarette..&quot; and i was like, 'what? where?  that's
disgusting!&quot; and I took it outside by crunching up the  garbage around it

the ashtray around it  but didn't touch the cig.   I sent Fred out and realized the water was left
on in my sink.  Like pouring on, and wondered if Fred had done that on purpose, or what.  I tried
to turn it off, but it stayed on, and  I kept twisting the handle shut, and finally it went off.
Then I twisted it again for good measure and it stayed off, but the heater rotated around back to
the to and suddenly the heating elemant shot up to100 degrees, then 200 then 800 and i was like
&quot;aghhhh&quot; scared that it would explode up in my face, and I went under the sink and yanked
the wire to unplug the heater.  Tat solved the problem which could be adddressed by a plumber
later.  The cord was quite thin; too thin to be used for that manuch power to boil water..</p>
