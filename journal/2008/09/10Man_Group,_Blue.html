<p>Ami and I saw Blue Man Group in Roppongi tonight!  A lot of the same elements from
<em>Tubes</em>, the Blue Man Group show I got to see in Boston
with <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Peeps:Jen_Hazel">Jen Hazel</a> were featured in this show, and
they had some funny stuff in (written) Japanese that, iirc, roughly corresponds to stuff
from <em>Tubes</em>.  But, they also had quite a cool element that I certainly do *not* remember
from <em>Tubes</em>: on the darkened stage, two characters who had been projected with laser lights
turned into real people, and then the Blue Man Trio joined them, wearing hip-hop inspired sideways
hats and rainbow lighted jumpsuits.  All five characters on the stage had lighted rods they were
swinging around in unison, except for the center guy, who bounced rods on either side of his
body.</p>

<p>This is an example of a video (which I don't have) being worth 10,000 words (which I'm not going
to write).</p>

<p>The show culminated with a massive waste of heavy white paper towel rolls.  I collected some with
the idea that I can use it somehow: perhaps for art or spills (or drawing a landscape scene like I
used to do as a kid.  Long white lengths of paper were perfect for underwater scenes, and the
mystery of the sea allowed any created critter to swim about with a smile on its face).</p>

<p>We got some pictures with each of the Blue Men, and even one with the supporting rainbow men.  We
gave U-Cow cards to most of them.  U-Cow ended up with a bit of blue on his neck (accidental), and a
splot on his snout (the Blue Man asked with delay before marking U-Cow).  I hope it doesn't come off
easily.</p>
