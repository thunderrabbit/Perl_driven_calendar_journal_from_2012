Senator,

Please help initiate proceedings to give President Bush and Dick Cheney and early retirement.  They
seem focused on starting another illegal war with Iran, even after the Pentagon recently concluded
there was no connection between Iraq and Al-Qaeda.

Please help the US regain some semblance of a peaceful nation.  We must remove these two "leaders"
before they destroy the world.

   Thank you
