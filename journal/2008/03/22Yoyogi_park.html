<p>After taking my mac to the Apple Store, I got some lunch and ate by a fountain.  I took a semi
funy picture there.  I miss Francois.</p>

<p>Closer to Yoyogi Park, I looked for Francois perhaps being sold by one of the junk vendors.  I
came across a funny old man doing magic; I couldn't figure out how he was manifesting coins from
side to side, but then he showed me how to do it.</p>

<p>Looked for Fuse the contact juggler, but didn't find him.</p>

<p>I did, however, find a bunch of dudes drumming.  I meditatively sat near them both before and
after looking for Fuse.  I gave 1000 yen to the genkiest guy in the group; his hands were tough and
smooth like well worn leather.  As soon as I gave him the cash he suggested it would be better if we
all go out drinking together; and I declined so he gave the money to another guy nearby, for the
group.</p>
