HI Ami

How are you?  I feel sad today.  I think I feel sad from last night.  I look forward to seeing you
on Wednesday.  If we can meet earlier, that would be great.

To help understand my sad feeling, I will go to I-group today.  I would really like to see you too,
but I have to go to I-group.

   Love Love

<p>( fuck I can't get to the rest of the messages right now )</p>

<p>Basically she said &quot;me too&quot; and we met at 9:25 on Hibiya Line in Ebisu after my I-group.</p>

<p>She said she was nervous about what I might say.  I grokked that and empathised with her.  I
thought *I* was the one who needed to be nervous.</p>

<p>Basically we both agreed that while I may not want kids, that doesn't mean I'll always want
kids, and though she does want kids, she does *not* want kids right now.  I made her promise me
that if she hears feels an encroaching internal alarm clock on this issue, she will tell me.</p>

<p>She said she would press me for marriage first, but, yes she promised.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what my equivalent promise would be.</p>
