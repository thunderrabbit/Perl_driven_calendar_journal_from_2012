<p>Lazy lazy day today.  Around noon we woke up and Ami cooked ramen for me and pasta for her.  We
lazed, painted, read, internetted (*) and romped and lazed some more and then I had the bright idea
to eat pizza, and she had the bright idea to *order* pizza, and I had the bright idea to invite our
housemates.  At 7pm pizza arrived and Natalia and Fatima joined me an' Ami for a pizza party.
Another romp and then lazed and she headed home around 11pm.</p>

<p>(*) Ami looked up prices to fly to Italy to meet Fred, but they're basically too high now and I
don't want to pay that much.</p>

<p>Ma wants to get a domain name via sites.google.com, so I added her to my test account so she can
see if she likes it.</p>

<p>Nightynight!</p>
