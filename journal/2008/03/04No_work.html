<p>I called in sick yesterday and enjoyed the day off.  I slept a significant amount of time, but
also trimmed down my inbox and uploaded a couple of pictures from
my <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Art:Nine_F0s%2C_early_2008">nine F0 paintings</a>.  Ami came over
around 5pm and cooked for me <em>again</em>, which of course I love love loved.  No naughty nurse,
but instead we chatted with Natalia downstairs during her dinner.  She got the job at the university
teaching 2 hours per week, which seems like nothin', but is really hard to get a job teaching there
because of the low turnover of teachers.</p>

<p>At 8pm I had a Skype chat with Naomi of <a href="http://dreamnavi.com/">dreamnavi</a> so I could
get signed up as a possible Skype teacher for students.  The idea sounds interesting; we'll see how
it turns out in reality.</p>
