<p class="dream">With my brother behind me, I hung on tightly to the sides of the plane as the pilot
(an old General in front of me) flew way close to the ground and all sorts of weird directions over
the landscape, in ways I thought certainly would be annoying to the houses and farmlands down below
us.  We were over what felt like our neighborhood from my high school days.</p>
