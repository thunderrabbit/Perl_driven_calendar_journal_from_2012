<p>Good stuff today at work.  I assured 中谷さん that I could change all occurences of the old
server name with the new name in the entire file system.  I didn't know how to do it, but I knew it
could be done, and I even knew with what tools it could be done.  Just had to figure out how to use
them.  Finally I ended up with this:</p>

<pre>
find . -name .svn -prune -o -exec sed -i 's/oldtext/newtext/g' {} \;
</pre>

<p>My understanding:</p>

<p>find files starting with . (local directory)</p>

<p><b>-name .svn -prune</b> means if you find .svn for a filename (directory name), skip it.</p>

<p><b>-o</b>  OR</p>

<p><b>-exec</b> execute</p>

<p><b>sed -i</b> sed is the stream editor.  -i means change the files in place.</p>

<p><b>'s/new/old/g'</b> Substitute old text for new text Globally.</p>

<p><b>{}</b> sends the filenames that find found to sed</p>

<p><b>\;</b> ; terminates the -exec from find, and \ escapes it so the shell won't think it means
to end <b>its</b> command.</p>

<p>Not sure why this ain't workin'.</p>

<p>But there's a byebye party for とびたさん tonight, so we're heading out.</p>
