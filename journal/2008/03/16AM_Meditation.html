<p>Last night I met Sarah and Jennifer after the first showing of Zeitgeist in Shibuya.  We were
like, &quot;so yeah, but wtf do we do?&quot;</p>

<p>It was decided that we'll start a thing on <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a> to
start.</p>

<p>This morning I was meditating and enjoyed a bit better success in keeping my brain under control.
It's been what basically 2.5 months (I'm roughly adding 6 weeks of the meditation course with Helma
and the 4 weeks since it ended)... I've been pretty consistently meditizin' since then, and just
today I was like, &quot;oh, this is interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>Some of the recent changes in my thought forms started with my most recent I-group meeting when
I started off with, &quot;I'm afraid of committment,&quot; and came to realize I'm not accepting of
myself (not committing to myself?) unless I'm perfect.</p>

<p>So that gave me the bit of cold water in the face to realize I'm not perfect, <em>and I am okay
with that.</em>   I know intellectually I'm not perfect, but now I'm beginning to stop even chasing
perfection as a goal, and just fuckin' chill and be okay with imperfection.</p>

<p>So, as a result, instead of yelling at my brain when it goes astray, that yelling thought form
doesn't even come.  Instead of believing I know wtf meditation means and I know wtf I should feel,
I've released that thought form, dropping my expectations for meditations.</p>

<p>And, this morning, I seemed to be aware of a bit more subtle shifts in my body, specifically in
my sinus, and in my temples (or perhaps not, but the sensation is a relaxation of my brain at the
temples on either side of my head), though to be clear my awareness of these points has been
growing, I noticed a little extra awareness yesterday and this morning.</p>

<p>Yesterday I noticed that with each inhalation, my brain would &quot;tighten&quot; (this is way
too strong of a word)..  my brain would elevate at the temples and then relax on each exhalation.
BUT that was only if I was semi-affecting my breath.  If I could completely get my brain's hands off
my breath, then that elevation and relaxation of my brain at the temples did *not* occur with each
(in|ex)halation.</p>

<p>Today I began to get my brain's hands off my breaths (as indicated by no elevation/relaxation of
the brain temples) even more consistently while still maintaining awareness of breath, and I noticed
changes in my sinus (the amount of air that could easily flow through which nostril).  For the
record, during my meditation this morning, and right now as I type this (10:28am) both nostrils are
happily enjoying airflow.</p>
