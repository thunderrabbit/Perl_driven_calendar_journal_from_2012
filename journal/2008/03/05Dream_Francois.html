<p class="dream">Francois came back, and I was so happy to be holding him again.  I spent a good
deal of time just looking into his little plastic eyes because I knew it was a dream and I wouldn't
be able to keep him when I woke up.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was in a cafe where the cashier said, &quot;oh, someone wrote a note about
your rabbit,&quot; and I was like, &quot;that's great!&quot; but she didn't still have the note
anymore, and couldn't remember the contents, except that Francois would be returned after the
Olympics.  I pulled a five dollar bill out of my wallet and gave it to her, saying, &quot;next
time, keep the note and give it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I was at the bar drinking a coke and a little boy about 4 years old came up and
put his straw into my drink and claimed it as his own.  I looked at the drink and started laughing
my ass off because he had also put a tea bag into it, with the basic plan of &quot;grossing me
out,&quot; so I wouldn't want it anymore.  I was more grossed out that I was drinking coke in the
first place than some kid put tea into it.  His mom came up and apologized, but I told her he was a
genius and would do well in life.</p>
