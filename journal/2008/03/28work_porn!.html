<p>At work I've started working on ebitv, which allows users to upload vids and share with friends.
Unlike youtube, all the videos are screened by humans before they are allowed to be shown.  While
adding a feature to the administrator screen (allowing videos to be &quot;recommended,&quot;), I
tried to recommend some videos that had already been screened by humans and classified as NG, or
&quot;no good,&quot;  The screen which allows recommending the video actually displays the video
(of course), and I was a bit shocked to find it was porn.  Now, of course, I would say this just
meant someone had uploaded porn, *but*, this is our test system which requires a password to
view.</p>

<p>Did they just get copied from the live system?  Did someone internal upload porn as a test?
They're just one minute sample clips from a website.  Oh yes, &quot;they,&quot; as in multiple
videos that I watched a couple times last night to put myself to sleep.</p>
