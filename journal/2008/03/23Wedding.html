<p>Nice time at Maruan and kyoko's wedding.  Got to sit with Ami and the CCs from 52nd.  Rei was
beautiful and chatty as ever, but I sorta realized that Ami is better for me.  But I did find
myself watching Rei a lot.  I don't think she would play footsies under the table like Ami.</p>

<p>Joel asked me about Zeitgeist showing and suggested I watch Power of Nightmares, which I'm
downloading now. (1:24pm JST Monday 24 March 2008 (day 13879))</p>

<p>I cried several times during the speeches.</p>

<p>Took lots of pictures.  Forgot my video camera though. </p>

<p>Now we are headed to Shinjuku for the after party.</p>

<p class="date">12:06am JST Monday 24 March 2008 (day 13879)</p>

<p>Ami and I snuggled up in the back of the shuttle from the wedding site to Takaosanguchi station,
then rode &quot;alone&quot; on the train to Shinjuku from the station.</p>

<p>On the 50th floor of some building in Shinjuku, the after party buffet mostly featured people
who had *not* gone to the wedding ceremony, including Yuuka and Ozako, who greeted my arrival to
the reception area.  Ami and I had arrived a bit early, as opposed to most of the people coming
from the wedding ceremony; because the actual ceremony had been delayed by two (2) previous
weddings at the same location, those who helped with it were delayed as well.</p>

<p>Rei's smiling loud voice allowed her to MC the event; I'm glad we chose a table in the center of
the action.  To start, Ami and I were seated across from Yuuka and Ozako; and after they arrived,
the CCs sorta used our table as a base with an extra person in each booth and then two sharing the
little ottoman on the end.  I was pretty much in heaven to have 7 women chillin' and chattin'
around me.</p>
