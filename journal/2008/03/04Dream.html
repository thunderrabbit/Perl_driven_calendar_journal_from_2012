<p class="dream">We were all in our swim suits by then, and they were like, &quot;but Rob, we have
a problem.  It's entirely possible that we'll get down to the pool and they'll say, <q>we're
closed</q> or <q>we're closing in one minute</q>&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">So I was like, &quot;well, who is still clothed?&quot; and saw John was still in
shirt and jeans so I asked him to go down and check the status of the pool.  He ran outside and when
I looked back to see how he was doing, the pool was gone!  I could see a slight depression in the
soil where the pool had been. He looked around a bit and then ran further away as a guy came back
from the other side of the room and was like, &quot;we found a pool over here, so I was like,
&quot;aight; I'll go get John cause I sent him the wrong direction,&quot; and then yelled out the
window, &quot;John!&quot; and had him come back.</p>

<p class="dream">Went out to the other side and couldn't find the guys who had gone out already, but
did find the pool and was waved over by Christina Branum-Martin (!) who happened to live in the
area!  She came to the pool area quite often, so I was hugging and hugging her and she was telling
me some latest happenings in her life about how someone had betrayed her trust, and I said I would
never lie o her... and we were still hugging and she was like, &quot;you wanna meet my kids?&quot;
and I looked up and her daughter was like 16 years old!!  I gawked and stared like, &quot;wtf??? how
did that happen?&quot; her son looked to be about the same age, but taller, now smaller, and I was
like, &quot;I thought your daughter was older.&quot; and the son was taller again, and then they
settled on their heights and the son was hiding behind the daughter in shyness and I waved hello to
them and they came over, and I was just sooo amazed!</p>

<p class="dream">Then the aunt wanted to tell the story of me and Christina: starting back in 1981
at our first junior high YRUU event, and Christina was like, &quot;nononono&quot; and began to tell
the correct story and then while she was telling the story I was reliving the moments, in a club
with some girl teasing my teeth with her finger and it tickled so I bit down to tell her no and then
something broke, and I realized it was my tooth, and while I was feeling the chip, I showed my new
smile to Christina, &quot;can you tell where the chip was?&quot; and then my whole left incisor fell
out!  It was huge like a horse tooth and shaped like a molar.  Christina started to laugh and I was
like, &quot;it's not funny!  this is real!&quot; and then I realized that even without a tooth, I'm
still alive, (but am I a bit less alive? I wondered) so it's not that real, but now I have health
insurance so I should be able to get it fixed so I was like, &quot;help me put it back in.&quot; I
figured out which way it should be oriented, by which time blood was beginning to cover important
details, but I got it oriented and gently gently pushed it back into place and woke up.</p>

<p>All my teeth, thankfully, are happily in place.</p>
