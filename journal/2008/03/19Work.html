<p>Okay.  Now I'm likely to get some work done.  I've procrastinated enough today, I think!  (10am
to now... only half the day, so better than recent days).</p>

<p>I got a bit done: trying to learn about branches and merges in SVN.  I got the branch part done,
but not the merge part.  I guess that's partially because SVN doesn't actually do merges per se.  Ah
well.</p>
