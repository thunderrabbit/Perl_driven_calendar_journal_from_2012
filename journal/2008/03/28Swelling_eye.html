<p>My right eyelid is swollen.  For a long time I just thought my eye was itchy, but now that today
it's suddenly gotten worse, I realize it's swollen.  How does one eyelid sell?  The left eyelid is
perfectly fine.  but I can literally feel the pressure on my right eyeball due to the swelling.
Previously that was just a vague irritation that I considered to just be itchy.</p>

<p>So I'm a bit freaked out by this, but don't really want to go to a western trained doctor for
meds, but I'm going to make an appointment soon.</p>

<p>I wonder if it's from too much computerin'...</p>
