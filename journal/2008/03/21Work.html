<p>Good progress at work today; I finally got a full version of the site archived in SVN.  I think
I have a bit more than needed, but not too much more; no telling if I'll ever figure out what's not
being used, but right now just trying to get a working thing so that if the server falls over, we
can have a new one running in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>At this point if the server died, it would take the better part of a day to get a new one
running, and that's not including securing the hardware.  I'd like to trim that down a lot, though
I'm not so worried about the hardware aspect of it.</p>
