<p>This is a comment I just added to some code that I intend to rewrite soon.</p>

<pre>
{*
   for some reason, the code below is NOT using $channel_list, which is just like $org_list above, 
   but with campaign_flag = OFF.  
   
   The only difference I can see in the code below and the database:  
   no channel 0 in the DB (but it is below)
   no channel 3 below (but it is in the DB)
   channel name for トピックス below is called ニューズ in the DB
   
   AND, the order below does not reflect the sort_order attribute in the DB.
   
   So I think we can just fix the sort order in the DB, and actually use smarty the way it's designed.
