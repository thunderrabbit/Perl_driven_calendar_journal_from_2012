<p>Finished _Bleeding Sun_ last night.  A bit of an abrupt ending, but I have a sneaking feeling
that it will be continued, though that's just because he ended the other books in such a manner.</p>

<p>Meditated this morning; sketched out some painting ideas..  basically drawing overlapping circle,
but I realize it's not trivial to overlap them all.  We either end up with scales or chaos like all
the shining circles trying to stay visible on a sequinned suit.  I decided I might do a spiral type
thing.  Then when I looked at the canvas on which I planned to put this, I was like,
&quot;do'h!&quot; cause I thought there were a lot more blue lines and a lot less white.  This
changes everything!</p>
