So in the freestyle email style, which we'll call freemail, I say thusly:

I've just finished halfway cleaning my room, which, while not clean, will certainly impress my
girlfriend when she walks in in several minutes.

I drink lots of bottled water and orange juice.  To try and save the planet a little bit more than
by doing nothing, I'm saving my bottles and plan to make a chair out of them.  I don't know how to
keep the all held together, nor really how to shape it securely so they all stay in place, but I'm
hoping I'll come up with something decent.

I've been reading Volume Five of a four volume series called Atlantean Secrets, which is awesomely
great.  Reading the series was like living a spiritual enlightenment quest.  And the novel part of
the books is damn near genius.  Mark Twain said something like, "every time you want to use the word
"very," use the word "damn" instead.  Your editor will simply strike the word, and your writing will
be as it should."  Now I'm reading this fifth book, which is at least as awesome as the Atlantean
Secrets series.  This one is called Bleeding Sun, subtitled _Discover the Future of Virtual Reality_
or something.


        the pretty part of Pearl Harbor.

Good.
 

        the east and west coasts. We've also been to Kaua'i
        and the Big Island while we've been here.


Did I show you pics of when I went to Kaua'i?

        that I missed while I was living in Japan (N. Zealand,
        Indonesia, etc.).


So weird that I too thought I would travel all over.  Things seem so close to Japan on a map, but so
far away when I look at my bank account.  Just gotta make stuff happen.

Ami and I are going to Saitama soon; I've been wanting to do more travel around Japan; I know
there's TONS more for me to see, but I just haven't looked for it yet.

Love Love
  - Rob!!!!
