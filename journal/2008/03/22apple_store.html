<p>At Shibuya Apple Store with my mac plus new CD drive; the old one borkked, but for the mere
price of four hours walkin' around Yoyogi while they put in a new drive, I got a new drive.</p>

<p>The drive has been broken for a while, but I decided to get it fixed today because I seem to
have forgotten my power supply at work, so I wouldn't be able to use my computer much anyway this
weekend.</p>

<p class="date">5:00pm JST</p>

<p>Dang; I have to buy 2Gigs of memory to get 2Gigs of memory.  I have 1Gig, but apparently it's
two * 512 Megs, so I can't just add to what I have already.  Garh.  That's kinda dumb.</p>

<p>I think instead of getting that, I'd prefer to get a power supply for my other machine and get
that running with ubuntu and see if I can set up a gopher server on it or something equally silly.</p>

<p class="date">5:10pm JST</p>

<p>So right now I'm just at their Genius Bar, taking up space and letting my computer drink
electricity.</p>

<p>Hmmm; I need a drink, too.  But juice or water would be better for me than electricity.</p>

<p>But first I'm importing pictures (filled up the card taking vids of the magic guy and drummers)
while my computer fills up.</p>

<p class="date">5:20pm JST</p>

<p>Okay; import is done.  I wonder if I should pay $85 for an official power supply or go look
around for a generic one.  Where did my old one go????????  I think I should take apart my room and
do spring cleaning while I look for my old one.</p>
