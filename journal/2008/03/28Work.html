<p>Just now leaving work, but didn't  actually work this late.  The last two+ hours was spent
watching the third part of The Power of Nightmares, and most of _Be Kind Rewind_, which I quite
enjoyed for an hour+ before I just looked up to find it was nearly 10pm and Ami would be finishing
her thing soon.  So byebye work.</p>

<p>I did get some stuff done today: basically allowing the admin to mark videos as recommeded, and
allowing users to  check the recommended selection of videos.  At first I was looking for a way to
make recommended be an extra channel (type of vid), but then realized  it would be way easier to
keep them separate, and then the added bonus that it allows looking for recommended videos per
channel. </p>

<p>And yes, that is the extent of our careful user interface design.  I'm not super proud of it,
but it seems to be what they want me to do.  Just do it.</p>
