<p>That wasn't totally tragic, but just a bit disgusting with smoke at times.  My &quot;speech&quot;
in Japanese was a bit tragic.  Oh, I know what was really tragic..  people fucking asking me if I
could use fucking chopsticks.</p>

<p>Let me assure the readers of this here journal: I can use chopsticks.  I have been in Japan for
five years.  That should be enough to learn how to use chopsticks.  Oh, and in the United States, I
used chopsticks at about age 12 at Vietnamese restaurants.  Good god when will people stop being so
dense as to ask what food I can eat and if I can eat it with fucking chopsticks?</p>

<p>I can also say the equivalent banalities of &quot;nice to meet you&quot; and &quot;my name is
Rob&quot; in Japanese.  This does not mean my Japanese is good so stop saying it is.  It's fucking
irritating for me to say こんにちは and the reaction to be, &quot;oh my god your Japanese is so
good!!!!&quot; Shut the fuck up and act like I'm not a fucking idiot and maybe I'd be interested in
learning a bit more.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should find a place to write this little rant in Japanese.  &quot;Stop asking
foreigners if they can eat 'Japanese' food with 'Japanese' utensils.&quot; Very little of Japanese
culture originated in Japan so get off your racist horses and live with the rest of the world.  Stop
being surprised when someone can say my name is ____ in Japanese.  I can say &quot;my name is
Rob&quot; in English, Japanese, Spanish, French, ASL, and (with a bit of review) Arabic, Mandarin
and Russian.  It's not so fucking amazing to speakers of those other languages, so why is it a shock
in Japanese?  Perhaps if Japan was more of a world-welcoming country, more people would care to
learn the language and therefore it wouldn't be such a shock.</p>

<p>Something like that.  I shouldn't post this, but I'm gonna.  I imagine my reaction is fueled in
part by my own issues, but I know I've heard more than one non-Japanese be miffed by these
questions/reactions.</p>
