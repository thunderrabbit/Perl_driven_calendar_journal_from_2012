<pre>I recently found another documentary, this one produced and broadcast
on BBC.  The series was shown in 3 parts over three weeks under the
title The Power of Nightmares.

The first part details the rise of fear mongers in the US government
and in Egypt during 1970s and 1980s.  I haven't watched parts 2 and 3
yet.</pre>

<p>That was in an email to Sarah and Jennifer who I met at the Zeitgeist screening at Pink Cow.
Now I've seen first 45 minutes of part 2 of Power of Nightmares.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of sending DVDs of the video to all the US Senators.</p>
