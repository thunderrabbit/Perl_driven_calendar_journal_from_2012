<p class="dream">The next day was the last day of SWUUSI and I had just arived as a visitor.  I was
in a good mood, so I was skipping on the boardwalk and each skip propeled me mightily into the air
for a quite speedy mode of travel.  My head would nearly brush the beams holding the roof above our
heads.  Then there was some overgrowth making it tricky to bouncye/fly forward, but there were some
ears of corn available and i grabbed some as I ended up in my mom's closet / bedroom; I grabbed an
ear of corn and bounced out of the closet and realized I had to peee so I was looking for the
restroom and realized a shower would do, then realized it was real so I woke up.</p>
