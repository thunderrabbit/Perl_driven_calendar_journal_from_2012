HI Doug

I came across your <a href="http://shiploverny.smugmug.com/gallery/1582266_E66e6#76633575">photos of TSS The Topaz</a> on smugmug (via a google search for TSS+The+Topaz).
Thank you for taking the time to post these with such exquisite descriptions!!

I had the great pleasure of sailing two world voyages on this ship with PB around 2005 (as an
English teacher for PB).  Still living in Tokyo, I've continued to stay in touch with PB staffers,
and the rumor is Topaz is on her last journey with PB.  I don't know where she'll go from here, but
I thought I should keep you abreast of the news.

If you're interested, I have a 20 minute video of when we teachers got a tour of the bridge
(unfortunately it got cut short due to my tape running out).  It's too long to put on youtube, but I
may put it on Google Video.  I have a smugmug account as well (user thunderrabbit), but I don't know
the limits on video sizes.

   Take care, and thanks again  :-)
    - Rob!
