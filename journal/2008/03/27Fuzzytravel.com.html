<p>So, I had the great idea to create a website: jacques.fuzzytravel.com, so I could send Jacques
around the world and have a wiki so people could create a travelogue for him.</p>

<p>Only problem with that plan: <a href="http://fuzzytravel.com/">fuzzytravel.com</a> is taken.</p>

<p>BUT, the site they have is pretty phat: I just signed up
as <a href="http://www.fuzzytravel.com/thunderrabbit/">thunderrabbit on fuzzy travel</a>.</p>

<p>Too bad I have no travel plans at the moment.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now I'm thinking of getting isfuzzywilltravel.com/ so I can set up
jacquesrabbit.isfuzzywilltravel.com and then sell(?) machine names on that domain for other people to
set up their fuzzy critters with wikis or blogs.</p>
