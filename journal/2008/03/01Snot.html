<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  My nose has been going *crazy* with snot pouring out (it seems
to have stopped now that I got up to write these past journal entries, but.</p>

<p>I find it interesting especially because right now my left nostril is clear, while my right
nostril is hopelessly clogged.  Usually it's reversed, which included before the healing session
with Romi, and I remember because I specifically mentioned my sinus as something that I'd like to
have healed.</p>

<p>(( basically I said one of my nostrils is always blocked, usually it's my left nostril that's
blocked while my right one is clear.  Sometimes it switches, and some-sometimes I notice a
transition period during which both of them are semi-working / semi-blocked.  I wonder if it's like
a marble rolling back and forth, blocking one or the other. ))</p>

<p>So, I find it (*) odd that now my left nostril is clear, and my right is not just blocked, but
actively producing copious quantities of snot.</p>

<p>(*) I had to get up to blow my nose or drip snot on my shirt.</p>

<p>It's not the highest rate of snot that one of my nostrils has ever produced in the history of
mankind, but it's the most that one of them has produced in recent memory.</p>
