<p>Hellsa fun time hanging out with Dan at The Pink Cow tonight.  We started with  current events
chit chat, then future plans, and then all about the PB and the various ports and kisen limits and
our respective stories of being selected for the voyages.  Great great times and so much funny
funny fun laughin'!!</p>

<p>There was a band called AutoBAHN playing live; a woman named Visi fom Vermont and a couple of
Japanese guys on vocals/keyboard and bass; they were quite genki.  Dan and I enjoyed being back
stage during the show.  Little did we know it was their first world tour!  Ah damn I forgot to have
Visi put the date on this CD; I think I'll slap it down.</p>

<p>David came by our table just to chat, and I asked him about putting up art in the bar area (I'm
scheduled for July) and then I went into the bar and talked to Traci about art and her take on
presenting art: it's a living extension of the artist.  Though I figured I'd prefer art as a living
entity separate from me, but yah.  This was after I told her I wanted to put my pieces in plastic so
they wouldn't get smokey and she was like, &quot;you mean like people with clear plastic on their
couches ?...  I think it would be better if it were uncovered.  Don't protect it so much it will be
okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Dan got picked up by a girl where he was still chillin' in our little spot against the back
wall where we could see all the action and moved up to the front dancing with 1, 2, 3 girls!  Turns
out one of the girls was David, but just in shadow so we couldn't see he was himself.  Funny.  Traci
was like, &quot;get out there; you don't have to talk to me about art...  you can talk to me
anytime.&quot;</p>

<p>Hahah she was right; I had a hella great time dancing and playing with the tambourine, cow bell,
stool (spining it like a propellor as David would tap the bottom like a cymbal each time it came
back to the bottom), and then doing some werid dance thing over the stool and spinning around not
crashing, and then spinning the stool like a drunken ballerina and trying to dance over it, but
much less successfully.</p>

<p>Finally had to go, so grabbed a CD and found Visi to have her sign it; Traci suggested she put a
lipstick kiss on it, so she did that as well.  Woohoo!</p>
