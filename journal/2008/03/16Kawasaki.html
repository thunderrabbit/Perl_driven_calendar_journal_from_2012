<p>Ami and I are in Kawasaki (Azalea); we just ate at a non smoking restaurant (I wanted to fill out
a survey to thank them specifically for being non smoking, but they didn't have that option).</p>

<p>Picked up some pants I had altered (deeper pockets) and I was joking like my arm was vanishing
into the pockets.  Then I was like, 「もうすこしいいただけますか？」, basically &quot;how about
just a bit bigger?&quot;  I was glad the clerk got the joke.</p>

<p>Ami and I looked at travel prices.  Saw Macau is cheaper than Europe so I can email Mark and ask
if we can crash at his crib.</p>
