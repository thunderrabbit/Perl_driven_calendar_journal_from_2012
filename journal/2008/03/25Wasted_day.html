<p>Today has been pretty much a wasted day as far as work is concerned.  I used the time to watch
Part 1 (of 3) of The Power of Nightmares, a BBC documentary detailing the neo-cons' rise to power
in the 1970s and 1980s.  Fascintating.</p>

<p>I also wrote
up <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/index.php?title=The_Roller_Coaster/initial_ascent">The
Roller Coaster on Castle of Dreams</a> wiki.  Actually the first ascent had been
written, but I had forgotten to link it into my navigation thingie.</p>

<p>Here at work, we had a meeting last week where I was all, &quot;we need SVN clients,&quot; and
they were all, &quot;yes, let's host SVN server, too!  It will be great!&quot; and I was like,
&quot;Why?  It will be a waste!&quot; and they were all, &quot;well, we don't want to use 3rd
party SVN servers until we find a good one, so *for now*, we'll just use our own server.&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;Google has a free secure version!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry; it will be temporary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;but, if it works, who will ensure it's temporary?  Shit that
works tends to linger and get incorporated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would we even want to host the code locally?  If there's a fire or other problem, all
the servers here will be dead.  That would be bad.&quot;</p>

<p>SO, despite my best efforts, it was decided to install SVN server on the second test server for
our website.  I released it and went along quietly with grumbles in my brain.</p>

<p>Today, the guy wanted to install SVN server (he only comes in twice a week).  He thought it
would require about 2 hours of downtime.</p>

<p>Make that 6 hours, and no end in sight.  AND, the web server doesn't work *at all* now. Well, PHP
runs, but it can't access mySQL.  Poor him.  Why all the wasted effort?????</p>

<p>I just realized that I could have been using the first test server to see if my SVNing of the
entire thing worked...  He *did* get SVN client installed on that machine, which is good, so I
coulda been using that.  But oh well; I'm going home....</p>
