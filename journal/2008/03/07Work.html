<p>This morning I finally got PHP recompiled with mysql (took a long time to figure out which dir
to use for the --with-mysql parameter.  Ended up using this:</p>

<pre>
./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql
</pre>
   
<p>And, for the record, the /usr/local/mysql directory is the one used in the --prefix parameter for mysql's config.</p>

<p>We
used <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/k1LoW/archives/53521855.html">http://blog.livedoor.jp/k1LoW/archives/53521855.html</a>
to install mysql</p>

<p>Okay, so now I'm flockin' around with trying to get the virtual servers set up on this machine.
We're using Apache 2.0 now, whereas the old machine was on 1.4 or something, so I can't just copy
the conf files over; their filenames don't even match.</p>

<p>Now, though, I'm going to lunch.</p>
