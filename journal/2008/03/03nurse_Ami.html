<p>Ami came over on Monday night and cooked the most fantastic chicken soup in the entire planet.
Each bite was orgasmically awesome because she made it like chicken stew in a way, and it had no
noodles in it, but what looked like noodles were long white mushrooms.   I was so happy to have my
very own nurse look after me.   Oh, what heaven.</p>

<p>She was a naughty nurse, too.</p>
