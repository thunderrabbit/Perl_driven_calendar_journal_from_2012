<p>Glad to report successful completion of something useful here at work!  It was an easy fix once
I found the problem..  Actually the hardest part was propogating the fix to three code bases, as
SVN still ain't working.</p>

<p>One weird thing that took me a while today (before I gave up): I still can't figure out why
checking out my files from SVN is causing the old test server to use data from the live server!</p>

<p>The config files seem right; I dunno what's up with it.</p>

<p>But right now I'm going to finish watching part 2 of <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/ThePowerOfNightmares">The Power of Nightmares</a>.</p>

<p>Just finished Part II.  It seems apparent in Part III they're going to say the Islamic
Extremists got the WTC, but, for the record, I'm pretty secure in my current belief that the US
government was at minimum complicent in letting it happen.</p>

<p>Hahahaha; it took me forever to find the password to this database... I figured out why I
couldn't find the phpMyAdmin: it's a Postgres database.  Then I was sifting through the code to find
the password and finally realized the unthinkable.  There is no spoon.</p>
