<p>First chillin' time with Travis in the five years we've lived in Japan.  I must say we never
really hung out while we lived in Houston; we knew each other through KTRU, and went to a couple of
functions, but I never really knew much more than his name and he's smart and he knew Japanese.</p>

<p>Now I'm getting a better sense of just *how* smart he is, and in what topics he specializes (math
(way more than me), computers (more than me), other stuff to boot).  I'm happy to say we can also
talk about real topics starring emotions and real, personal stuff.  That's a nice blessing.</p>

<p>We started out at kaitensushi (his second (2nd) time ever; my countleth time) and then went to
tea time cafe or somethin' under MarK City.</p>

<p>We both don't drink, and we both don't smoke.  He's got a couple of other don'ts: caffeine and
driving.  I'm happy not to drive, but I don't pay attention to caffeine intake per se.</p>

<p>We ended with watching some dude play pachinko for several minutes.  I can see how it would
become mesmerizing, and how it would be quite a drain on cash.</p>

<p>We're both ready to change the world, and coming up on our mutual calendar: karaoke!</p>
