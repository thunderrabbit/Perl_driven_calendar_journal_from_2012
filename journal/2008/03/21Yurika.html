<p>Good lesson with Yurika today.  I enjoy seeing her progress; the stuff she's transcribing is
spoken at natural speed, and she's pretty much getting it.  Definitely better than when she first
started.</p>

<p>Today she said, &quot;I always get confused by sentences using multiple verbs.&quot;</p>

<p>Hahaha.  Yes, but you just used two verbs in one sentence, so congratulations.</p>

<p>Our next lesson is scheduled for two weeks from yesterday.  Actually I've got her scheduled
indefinitely for every two weeks.</p>
