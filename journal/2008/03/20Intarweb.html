<p>Laura and I chatted about our history and therefore the history of the Tubes.  I recalled
gopher, found a gopher server written in Perl (and one in Python).  The Perl one can't be installed
on my Dreamhost account, but I'm not sure about the Python one yet.  Probably also can't, but I
*might* try to get gopher://gopher.robnugen.com/ working just for kicks.</p>
