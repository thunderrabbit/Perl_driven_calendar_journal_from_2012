<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>The guy who doesn't work in this office seems to know different aspects of unix than I.  He was
able to get mysql installed when I couldn't, and told me a bit about run levels in unix, about
which I knew nothing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even with the new mysql installed, I don't yet know how to upgrade the PHP
portion of it.  I've gotten a bit sidetracked with reading news and such.</p>
