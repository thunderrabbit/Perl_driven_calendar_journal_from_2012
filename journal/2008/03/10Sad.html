<p>I feel really sad today; I imagine it's continued from last night at not knowing wtf I am doing
with my life and the prospect of losing Ami as a result.  I want to just gtf out of work, but
instead am just trying to get fucking PHP installed properly; it's &quot;working&quot; on one
level, but about half of the Japanese that's being read from the DB is coming out as ???????????
instead of a larger variety of Japanese characters.  If it were *all* the Japanese being read, I
could understand more.  Damn this sucks.</p>
