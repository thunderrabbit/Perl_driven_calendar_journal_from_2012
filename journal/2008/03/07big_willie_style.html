<p>As I've been focused on unsuccessfully doing this installation, I've had Big Willie Style in my
headphones, with lines like, &quot;life is beautiful,&quot; in all sorts of variants like he's made
it big, and I'm thinkin', &quot;I bet he wouldn't have to worry about stuff about which he doesn't
want to worry,&quot; which is me now: tryin' to fix this crap about which I care very little.</p>

<p>So, how did he get to where he is?  (Where do I think he is?)</p>

<p>There are lots of people who I admire, and I'd say the basic similarity: they are doing that
which they want to do.</p>

<p>So now I'm like, &quot;aight; what do I want to do?&quot;</p>

<p>paint, write (without using a keyboard; egad), travel, take pictures, travel via TJ Bike.</p>

<p>AND, I want a companion at times.  Can I maintain relationship with Ami and ride TJ Bike for a
week at a time and then come back to her happily waiting at home?  Would she want to come with
me?</p>

<p>Just today, she suggested we go to some awesome looking places in Saitama, which counts as
exactly the kind of thing I want to do.  Maybe I can review it and submit to Lonely Planet or
something that would pay for the ability to distribute the information.</p>
