<p>Ami called me saying she wasn't feeling so great and didn't think she could make dinner tonight.
i was like, &quot;dude; no problem; go to bed and I'll bring home dinner.  what would you
like?&quot;</p>

<p>She goes, &quot;can you call me when you're at the store?&quot; and I go, &quot;you'll prolly be
sleepin', yeah?&quot; and she agreed and ordered pasta.</p>

<p>I'm glad to have a bit of a chance to take care of Ami.</p>
