<p>Today was the byebye party for とびたさん, and boy was it stinky.  She's nice and friendly
enough, and even bought presents for everyone.  I enjoyed knowing her name for some reason...  Maybe
because it's similar to the kid's name in ドラエモン comics (maybe even th same name).  Anyway,
everyone but like 3 people were smoking smoking smoking (actually it wasn't continually fresh smoke
blowin) out of their chattering mouths, but the stank sure stunk up the air and I was basically
wanting to be *anywhere* else.  So, I left first.  Though to be honest that was only after ゆみこ
suggested that it was okay to leave; everyone would be leaving on their own schedule, and the party
looked nowhere close to winding down as I left at 9:30 or so.</p>

<p>One of my core issues is floating around this point.  When I claim I don't like to meet people,
one reason is that &quot;people&quot; all like to drink and smoke, two activities I find disgusting
and/or pointless.  At the same time, I'd like to have some closer friendships with people with whom
I work, but..  I just can't help but think there could be some more consideration given for the
non-smokers in the group.</p>

<p>Cigarettes are so cheap in Japan that one guy at my first job here said, &quot;I actually make
money by smoking,&quot; or some such exaggeration just to make the point.  it's like 350 yen per
pack or so, I think.  And so smoking is like the second language of the culture after Japanese.</p>

<p>Now I am repulsed by my clothes and am going to go home and shower while my clothes are in the
washer.  No way are they going to chill with deadly toxic fumes emanating from my laundry bag.
Disgusting.</p>

<p>Anyway, I know I have some more meditation and emotional work to do on this topic.  I think it
boils down to shame of my own imperfections being projected onto others' imperfections.  I am quick
to judge smokers as stupid, thoughtless and disgusting, not to mention destroying the world with
carcinogens and butts.</p>

<p>I sure ain't perfect, but sometimes imagine that I am, and often want to be.  Gotta release this
more more more.</p>
