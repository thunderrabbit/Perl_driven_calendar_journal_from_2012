<p>Nice chat with K this evening after work.  Meeting her at Hachiko, I wondered how easily I'd find
her cute little self, but it all worked out.  Her main goal at that point was to get off her feet,
so we headd to Tea Time (thanks to Travis for showing me recently) for a snack and drink for me and
drink for her while chatting about London, US, and NZ, plus PB gossip.  Took us a bit to remember
the (old) PM of OZ, but I eventually came up with his name, though bells of certitude did not ring
in our brains.  For the record, the new OZ PM is Kevin Rudd.</p>

<p>I had correctly guessed she would have brown nail polish today, but I didn't guess it would be
brown with sparkles.</p>

<p>After reporting the results of the Zeitgeist movie screening(s), I told her about The Power of
Nightmares, and she asked why (US) Americans are so quick to talk about politics, and I suggested
it's cause our politics are so wack compared to other sane countries.</p>

<p>While answering my plans for staying in Japan, for a moment I talked about Ami, saying that I was
being careful not to throw away the relationship unnecessarily.  I noticed that on most previous
discussions about my girlfriends, I must have sounded like a whiney whiner.  Hopefully I'm past all
that cryingly chaotic emotional madness in which I believed myself victimized by my own inability to
settle.</p>

<p>K is good, working as a glorified teacher in Zone 1 of London.  Has been there for about a year
now.  She described her fun-time there as not as easy as home (smaller city), but she generally
just hangs out with friends.</p>

<p>She told me the funny story of the name K at work and how it got confused with people just
saying &quot;'kay,&quot; short for &quot;okay.&quot;</p>

<p>I enjoyed listening to her super-practical travel techniques, including doing a test-packing
tonight, with a scale so she will have a sense of how much more shopping she can do.  Today she
bought shoes for herself, bought a DVD for her nephew who's about 3 years old, and got her hair cut,
Tomorrow she wants to buy a trench coat and two belts: one for her body and one for her suitcase on
the way back (basically to tie her two suit cases together once she arrives in London (where no one
will likely help her carry anything)).</p>

<p>We stopped outside the pachinko parlor on the way to the station, where we wondered why people
would play that game.  She mentioned her stay in the hotel as opposed to her friend's house in
Shibuya and that reminded me about the chocolate shop, which I hadn't been able to find since then.
K showed me where the chocolate shop was; I had misremembered, which for me seemed shocking cause my
feet generally remember just how to get back wherever they've been before.  But for some reason I
was turning left before Bunkamura instead of going straight along it.  Shocking.</p>

<p>She said she may be back in Japan within about 6 months or a year.</p>
