<p>Okay, it's fixed.</p>

<p>I had deleted the directory to which the log files are written.  It's recreated.  Nobody panic!</p>

<p>The good news: I figured out why <a href="http://m.robnugen.com/j">my mobile journal</a> wasn't
working (as a temporary way to view my journal while my main was borked).</p>

<p>Ah cool.  I just added a rule to .htaccess to refresh from the root to my mobile journal writer:</p>

<pre>
Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^$ journal_writer_filename
</pre>
