<p>Damn; I can't believe I didn't write anything after yesterday.  Great great time at the GET
hanami party: Tony, Kazzah, Yuuka, Ozako from 52nd, Sam, Aalif (sp), Robyn, Jen, Taka and P, from
more recent voyages.  Robyn is a sakinori; Cape Town 52nd was her first port to organize.  She's
Taiwanese (9 years), with Japanese early education (6 years), and then South African later
education.  Coolio.  I didn't get to talk to her quite so much, but I look forward to a chane to
hang out.  Talked to P(ania) a bit more; she's a Kiwi from Aukland, and I asked if she knew K, but,
my bad: K is from Wellington, which P says is the capital only in name.</p>

<p>Then to Jen and Taka's place for their housewarming party, including Skype using my computer so
we'd have a camera on our end.  Video chatted with Jon Chin in Hawaii, and tried to talk to Akina, but not
as successfully.  (I don't actually know either of them, but I may have done a handover with Jon (?))</p>

<p>Lazy day with Ami today.  Lots of sleeping and saw an amazing video (actually there are several,
but I saw this one first, thanks to Matt:)</p>
