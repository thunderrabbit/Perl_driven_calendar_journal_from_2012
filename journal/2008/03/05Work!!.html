<p>Aight; pretty much focused on work related stuff all day today.  Basically was given a new server
and told to move our test environment over to it.  It's a different setup of the OS, but I was able
to find the httpd config, edit it to add some passwords to the new dirs I made, restart the httpd...
then it took a long time to figure out how to configure mysql, but once I realized <em>it wasn't
running</em>, things went a lot faster.  Downloaded phpMyAdmin and it complained about being run in
root mode with no password, so I fixed that.  The password is like ***************, but with upper
and lower case letters plus numbers and symbols instead of astrisks.</p>

<p>Then phpMyAdmin was saying &quot;Your PHP MySQL library version 3.23.49 differs from your MySQL
server version 4.1.20. This may cause unpredictable behavior.&quot; so now I'm trying to upgrade
both PHP and its components to the latest versions.  We're on version 5+ on the existing test
server, so I hope if I go all the way to 5.2 that it will work with current test server code.</p>

<p>Fun times.</p>

<p>AND, during all this, I made a tarball of oscart installation for Dave (after changing the config file to match his
server) so he can try to upload it to his yahoo server and hope it works.  I told him it will
either work or not work, but no halfway working biznass.</p>
