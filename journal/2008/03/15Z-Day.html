<p>Success at Z-Day.  I didn't go up on stage, but just pressed Play and 21 people saw the movie
for the first time, including Travis, who brought a best of SXSW 2008 DVD for our listening pleasure
(but my DVD player wouldn't play it).</p>

<p>7 people were at the first showing.  I talked to Sarah and Jennifer during the buffet after the
movie.  Sarah is from Scotland and has lived in England.  Jennifer has lived in Italy.  I'm not
sure what work they're doing now, but Sarah likes to write.</p>

<p>Mostly they asked questions about PB, which I certainly enjoyed reminiscing while answering 
their Qs.</p>

<p>They left before the second showing started at 10.  I sat with Ami and fell asleep for the
second half of it.</p>

<p>Before the second showing, I didn't make an announcement about the lack of FREE DVDs for those
who reserved for the buffet, but Sarah and Jennifer weren't phased when I told them there were no
DVDs, but they could download the movie
from <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">zeitgeistmovie.com</a>, so I decided not even to bring up
the issue.</p>

<p>Ami and I made the train with time to spare.  Last train to go home.</p>
