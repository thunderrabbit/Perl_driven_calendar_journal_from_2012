<p>Today is <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/zday.htm">Z-Day</a>, and I've been mostly painting,
though slowly getting ready and even did some laundry this morning.</p>

<p>I recently realized it mighta been a good idea to have made some personal business cards before
the event, but oh well. </p>
