I'm in Tokyo still (again).  I was teaching English for the first four years of my absence from the
US, but now am doing database programming for a small company.

From late 2004(?) to early 2006 I spent traveling over a year of amazingness, including 7 months
sailing around the world on ship chartered by Peaceboat (Japanese organization), 6 amazing weeks in
Palestine based in Jerusalem, and travels around this California sized island by bicycle at the end
of which I broke my shoulder, putting an end to my travels (hopefully a temporary end, but) I seem
to have met a nice girl named Ami (Japanese (Spanish) pronunciation).

I'm just now getting out of debt and looking for the next adventure.
