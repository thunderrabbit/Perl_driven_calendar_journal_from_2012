<p>Wow wowowoowowwww</p>

<p>Thanks to Josh for finding this.  I've just
installed <a href="http://www.zenphoto.org/">zenphoto</a> to display
the <a href="/zenphoto/">images on my site</a>!!</p>

<p>It's so close to perfect that I'm ecstatic.  It doesn't change *any* of my photos; it uses the
names of the photos as the titles; it doesn't create any thumbnails in my directory structure.
Just awesome, and it's only in version 1.5.  I'm really really happy with this.</p>
