<p>Ami was asking about buying a new TV and I was like, &quot;I hate TV&quot; and the conversation
devolved into, &quot;yeah I don't really want kids either,&quot; and then to &quot;I have no clue
what I want; I'm a loser.&quot;</p>

<p>Then she was like, &quot;well I *do* want kids, so why are we together?&quot;</p>

<p>Then she was like, &quot;yo G, no matter what you do, you gotta make some money,&quot;</p>

<p>And I was like, &quot;no I don't; I've got my bike; I'm cool.&quot;</p>

<p>And she was like, &quot;you gots to stop this bike-life idea,&quot;</p>

<p>And that triggered a flood of tears after I was like, &quot;dude; I broke my shoulder on my bike;
that's the only reason I stopped,&quot; when I realized how much I really loved that journey and
want to do it again and just started bawling, &quot;I could be on my bike right now,&quot; (well it
is a bit late; I'd be sleepin' for the night) and just cried and cried.</p>

<p>Then something switched after a bit and she was like, &quot;so what are some things you want to
do?&quot;</p>

<p>And we wrote a bunch of dreams on a big piece of paper to put on the wall.</p>
