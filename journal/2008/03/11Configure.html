<p>I think I'm getting better at this mysql and php installation junk.  Seems that the commands to
install are consistently</p>

<pre>
configure
make
make install
</pre>

<p>It's just the option to be sent to configure, and the php.ini that are troublesome.</p>

<p class="date">1:54pm JST</p>

<p>°æ¾å¤µ¤ó figured it out.  For some reason the mysql config file was in a directory where it
wasn't being read.  He moved it to /etc/my.cnf (which is the default, but I think quite a dumb file
path cause I wouldn't think &quot;my&quot; necessarily means mySQL.</p>

<p>Anyway, he moved it and it still didn't work, and after addition of several lines setting the
defaults to be UTF-8, all of which didn't help, he added skip-character-set-client-handshake to the
[mysqld] section.  It had been down in [mysql] section, which makes no sense to me because I didn't
put it there; I didn't even edit the file...  I think it must have been copied over from
somewhere;..  I'm going to try to figure out from where it must have come.... after lunch.</p>
