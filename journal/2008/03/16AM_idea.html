<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p><a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">Zeitgeist</a> suggests, among other things, that the US
Federal Reserve Bank necessarily enslaves those who are bound to its currency because the bank lends
money at interest, <em>and</em> has a monopoly on currency production.</p>

<p>So during my meditation, during one of my brain's forays from awareness of my breathing, I
wondered how to start a new currency.  A currency that isn't just paper with value based on
perception, but a currency that has actual value in itself.</p>

<p>Gold?  yeah yeah, no, even better than gold.</p>

<p>Platinum?  nope.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So I was like, &quot;aight, what do I actually need?&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>air</p></li>

<li><p>water</p></li>

<li><p>food</p></li>

<li><p>love</p></li>
</ol>

<p>and some would say not in that order.</p>

<p>I've read <a href="http://google.com/search?q=five.love.languages">The Five Love Languages</a>
(*) by Gary Chapman, and recently started reading it again.  It basically suggests that in order to
love our partners, we need to know in what ways they feel loved.</p>

<p>(*) need to test that link; I wrote it by hand</p>

<p>So, I'm thinking that we can start a group where we all know how each other person feels loved,
and then we can choose to love whoever we want by speaking their language of love.</p>

<p>The idea seemed a lot more doable during my meditation than it does as I write it, but I'm going
to continue with this idea for a bit and see where it goes and how it develops.</p>
