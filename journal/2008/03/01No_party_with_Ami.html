<p>I felt really afraid to tell Ami &quot;I don't want to go&quot; to the two year anniversary party
at her friend's bar.  I kept thinking it will be all smokey and I don't know anyone there (except I
know the owner's name, but if I saw him on the street I wouldn't recognize him), etc etc.</p>

<p>Finally Ami gave me the out and I accepted and then I wavered and finally she left without me.  I
cried for about 2 seconds and then sent her an email.  basically &quot;thank you / I'm sorry / take
your time / I trust you / I love you&quot;.</p>

<p>She emailed back &quot;no prob&quot; and we subsequently planned to meet for dinner at the curry
place near Motosumiyoshi station.</p>
