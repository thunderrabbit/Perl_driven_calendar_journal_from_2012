<p class="dream">Floating in the ocean, watching some boats jump ramps, the first boat was a light
white rubber raft with dual motors, one of which had shifted over to the right, so it went all
sideways in the air; we tried to get it balanced out to jump again, but a van like Mr Van (*) was
ready to jump.  It had a great jump and landed upside down, and then righted itself like a duck and
was floating perfectly on its four wheels.  I thought that was way cool, but no one else seemed
impressed.</p>
