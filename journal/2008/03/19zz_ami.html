<p>Ami just left, after tucking me into bed, which I really enjoy.  I got back outta bed to write a
bit, though.  (Including the above entry about Karen (with falsified timestamp).) I've noticed an
extreme lack of nighttime journal entries in the past months / years.</p>

<p>Ami was reading as I arrived, and just poked her eyes out from under the covers when I came in.
She claimed to be cold and invited me to join her.  She was bare enough to be cold, but definitely
not cold.  We smooched then ate, then romped, then slept as it began to rain harder outside.</p>

<p>I finally got up to floss and brush my teeth, the former while in the shower.</p>
