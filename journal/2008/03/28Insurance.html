<p>I've been waiting for a while for my insurance to start with work, but my tooth is saying fuck
insurance and go to the clinic.  So I'm going to call today and just pay for it out of pocket.
It's only 70% coverage anyway, so pretty wack insurance.  (that's just sour grapes, actually)  I
feel a bit foolish for having the carrot of future insurance keep me blinded from just getting my
teeth fixed now.</p>

<p>Cool.  I got an appointment for tomorrow at 9:30am, and Â¼¾å¤µ¤ó said something that made me
think the insurance is in effect already; I just don't have a card yet, so I will be reimbursed
laterz.</p>

<p>The only bad news:</p>

HI Yuuuuuka!

Tomorrow I have a dentist appointment at 9:30am, so I can probably get
to the Hanami Party on time, but I might be a little late.  :-(

In either case, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow!

  - Rob!
