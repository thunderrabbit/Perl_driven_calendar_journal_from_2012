<p>Home now, and just took a shower.  My clothes are in the washer.  I'm about to floss and brush
my toofs and then do 1 or 2 24-minute reiki attunement things while waiting for laundry to finish. (*)</p>

<p>On the way home, I finished the previous entry while in Jiyugaoka where the super express train
came by so I jumped on it and next stop was Musashi Kosugi where I visited the Tokyu Store and got
three things of 200ml ice cream (98 yen (whereas in the convenience stores, the price recently
jumped from 103 yen to <em>126 yen</em>!)), granola and soy milk, then ate one of the ice creams
while watching some diesel shovel (as opposed to a steam shovel) dig up asphalt and 8 inches of
dirt below that.  Good times.</p>
