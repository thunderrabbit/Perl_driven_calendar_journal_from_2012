<p>Just had my first Reiki attunement with Èþ°¡, from my meditation group with Helma.  I enjoyed
chatting with her, and enjoyed the session, which could be as simple as enjoying having her
attention for 2.5 hours.</p>

<p>I didn't notice any energetic shifts, but I did notice an intellectual schism</p>

<p>She suggested that drinking water like glug glug glug glug glug was detrimental to circulation
and could be a factor in why my hands are always cold.</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>She suggested warm water, and sips instead of glugglugluglugglug</p>

<p>I slept 4 hours today, by Ami's calculation.  It could be a result of reiki, or just a result of
a holiday today.  but, it is unusual for me to sleep so long during the day.</p>
