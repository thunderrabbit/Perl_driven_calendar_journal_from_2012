<p class="dream">With Laura near a pickup truck, and after a cross country trip during which my
python had not been able to eat.  Laura saw him and was like, &quot;oh good to see you again!&quot;
and I was like, &quot;he's _very_ hungry; be careful,&quot; and I tried to hold him by the neck and
his mouth was open hugely super wide with teeth pointing out like a cactus; he was so strong I
could barely hold him.</p>

<p class="dream">I was sitting next to a girl from NZ who I had met previously, but forgot which
city was her home.  We were sitting on a wall watching my peeps from ultimate play soccer.  To her I
was like, &quot;oh wait, don't tell me which city you are from.  oh, and I forgot your husband's
name.  I forgot your name too, hmmmm; are you from Ichigo?&quot; and she was like, &quot;yes, but
it's pronounced &quot;d'Aivo&quot; and she was talking all close to my ear and giving me turn-on
shivers and then she was closer to my lips and I gave her a quick kiss! and pulled back.  She was
like, &quot;should I have kissed you back?&quot; and I go &quot;yes, um, but no, I shouldn't have
kissed you.&quot; and she said, &quot;okay,&quot; and the soccer ball was kicked up near us, and
she jumped down off the wall as she kicked the ball and she joined the game.  The game came to a
natural halt which happened to be as a police car was rolling through.  They stopped in the middle
of our game thinking we had stopped because they had arrived, but I thought, &quot;man, don't these
guys know about entropy; things stop after a while,&quot; and everyone was quiet like,
&quot;whatchoo lookin' at?&quot; and the car drove forward and then came back but it was a
firetruck and Andy climbed onto it as it was rolling by and he opened a little panel and pulled out
a gay firefighter porn pamphlet and was like, &quot;I got it!&quot; and tossed it to the crowd and
I immediately walked away and he jumped off the fire truck, leaving the panel doors open.  The
truck came back *again* and I had to casually duck so the doors wouldn't hit me, but so they
wouldn't know I knew the doors were open (and therefore must have known what happened).</p>
