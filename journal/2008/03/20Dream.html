<p>Okay, I'm preparing this journal entry just before I go to bed, the idea being that I can just
hit timestamp (C-c T) and it will be easier to write than actually creating the new entry (C-c s D r
e a m . h t m l C-r y).  Good night!</p>

<p class="dream">I remembered not to start a new entry and to just start a timestamp, and I wrote
word by word what I wanted to write then realized I was still dreaming.</p>

<p class="dream">I received a travel membership card in the mail, and was happy I could travel.  I
wondered if Ami could also come, but I couldn't read the Japanese on the card.  There was a pictre
of a single person traveling and also a person traveling with an animal, so  figured the animal
could be another person.</p>
