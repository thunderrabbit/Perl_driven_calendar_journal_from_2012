<p>This is a tentative plan:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>* figure out why old version (5.2.0) of PHP did *not* give an error when session() was started in the
middle of output (version 5.2.5 does)
<br/>answer: the error occurs, but is not being reported to the browser</p></li>

<li><p>* figure out why error is being reported to browser on new server when display_errors = Off in
php.ini</p>

<p>answer: php variables can be set in at least 4 places.  Here are the places I know of in the
order that the server reads them (so basically the defaults are set in php.ini and the source file
supercedes the others (assuming that the server is configured to allow the php source file to change
the value (beyond the scope of this little tidbit))):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://php.net/results.php?q=php.ini">php.ini</a> file:
<br/>varname = value</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=http.conf+OR+httpd.conf">http.conf</a> file:
<br/>php_flag varname value</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=htaccess">.htaccess</a> file:
<br/>php_value varname value</p></li>

<li><p>php source file:
<br/>&lt;?php <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php">ini_set</a>('varname',
'value'); ?&gt;</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>* ask 丸山さん if he knows why the session_start was moved to the top of a file that's called in
the middle of the page
<br/>
answer: he doesn't know.  He doesn't know what session_start() does</p></li>

<li><p><del>fix it</del> 丸山さん said he'll ponder on it when he gets back from a meeting.
Basically it literally doesn't work where it is, so it must be moved back to where it was.  I'm
hoping this will prove my case that we need to be using a CMS.  I'm shooting for SVN, but that's
just because it's the one I know.
</p></li>

<li><p>* go to lunch</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="date">3:01pm JST</p>

<p>Okay, the plan continues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>think of something to do</p></li>

<li><p></p></li>
</ol>
