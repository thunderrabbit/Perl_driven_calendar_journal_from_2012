<p class="dream">Genki Man Dan and I were models for some TV commercial  being recorded in a
restaurant.  We got all the free food we wanted, which was part of a buffet, Japanese style, with
all sorts of decorative tidbits, including a pine tree with long needles.  I found some sets of
needles had fallen while still attached to each other, and made really perfect long moustache
disguises.  I was like, &quot;Dan! check this out!&quot; ad we each got long green moustahes and
the camera crew were taking our pictures and video of us in various poses.  Dan got bored of just
having his photo taken; he wanted to do more poses with the moustache like make a wig, or chevrons
of a military uniform, but the cameras weren't working properly cause we had been playing with them
earlier and must have broken something.</p>

<p class="dream">In an earlier dream, Ryan McCarthy  was there as well, listening to our story of
camera antics the led us to be spies in NOVA.  Dan had said we would look back on this and laugh so
we might as well enjoy being spis now.</p>

<p class="dream">Ryan was like, &quot;yeah, back in YRUU, we used to  have spies, but they were
real, and tried to undermine all of YRUU...</p>
