<p>Karen happened to be on the same train as me, and I was actually surprised that she actually not
only spoke to me, but shared her umbrella with me on the way back home!  wow wow wow.</p>

<p>I slipped and hit my knee on the way home because my shoes have no traction, and as a result got
several little grains of gravel in my shoe, which made for a bit of a mess in the newly caulked
shower, but oh well.</p>

<p>Oh, Karen and I got to know each other again; she's the only Portuguese/Japanese speaker at her
work (telephone operator) down on Ginza Line.  We've had absolutely no communication in the many
months that she's lived across the hall from me.</p>

<p>I reminded her that she showed me the back route from our apartment, but she didn't recognize /
remember it when I used the same (reversed) route to go to our apartment.  This seemed odd to me.
I walked her all the way home (umbrella share) and then said bye and went back out to the store to
get food for Ami and myself.</p>
