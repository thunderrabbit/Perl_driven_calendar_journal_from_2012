<p class="dream">Some youth I had never met (?) were carrying a large inflated penguin through a
school, so I quickly offered to help them carry its unwieldy bag of air down to where they needed it
for an assembly.  We had to get it down some stairs with semi scratchy walls, so I was careful to
note that we shouldn't let it scrape on the walls cause it could be punctured.  Got it down the steps
and the hallway got smaller still, so I suggested that we take it directly into the gymnasium where
the assembly was certain to be held. We took our shoes off on one side of the room and  carried the
penguin to the other.  A few marching band members were in the gym getting ready.  I happened to meet
one who came up to me with his drum kit and was like, &quot;guess what I play?&quot; and I couldn't
identify it at first because it was all folded up.  He let it come open and it was a full drum set
like a rock band.  I was like &quot;wow!&quot; and he showed me a few  beats, and then he told me how
he's having trouble in school and I kept asking questions empathetically and listening, trying to
get a sense of the issue and perhaps sort out the problem, but before I did the band director (?)
was like, &quot;blah blah blah &quot; in a way that made it smell like he didn't want me talking to
the kid, but was like, &quot;oh, we've had trouble with starting the band on time,&quot; and was
really smarmy, and I never got to sort out the end of the drum kid's issue.  I left and went to the
loo and was takin' a whiz when someone else grabbed my balls from behind as some kind of joke just to
disorient my whiz, and I was like, &quot;false&quot; and physically dug my thumbnail into his arm
(*) he let go of my balls and then we we on good terms and he tried to grab me again, so I wrapped
my arm around him and grabbed his arm so he couldn't grab mine, and then I made him grab his own
wang, which he was holding for a bit until I finished whizzing, and then he showed me he had pulled
his wang off his body.  I was like, &quot;what?? why didn't you scream out in pain?&quot;  He was
like, &quot;meh; it grows back an inch every day so it's okay.&quot;</p>

<p>(*) wow!</p>
