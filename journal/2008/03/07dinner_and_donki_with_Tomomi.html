<p>Met Tomomi for the first time in a long time; I had tried starting an email volley with her, but
I dropped the ball during my US trip, and didn't pick it up again until I excavated it from my
inbox.</p>

<p>We ate shabu shabu at a B1 restaurant acoss from a kaiten sushi restaurant on the path I take to
Shakey's from work.  Restaurnt was noisy and fibbing in that outside it said 1700 yen and inside
they said 1900 yen (I think the outside said 1700), and then I asked if the OJ was 100% OJ and he
was like yes, and he must have had a different idea of what OJ meant.  He was like 100% extra tang
flavor to make it up.</p>

<p>Nice chatting with Tomomi; she has recently quit her job, which cam as an afterthought when she
took a paid break and realized she was on to a good idea.  her husband is supportive of her not
working before she is ready.</p>

<p>She hasn't found another teacher at EV that she likes as much as me, but she's apparently still
attending regularly..  And she's taking yoga  classes which she's enjoying.</p>

<p>After being stuffed at shabushabu, we continued our journey toward shakes's, but turned  let
toward Donki Hoti to gawk at the various sundry hilarious and crzy items.  I bought some boxer
shorts with a dog's tail and ears and tongue in the front.  Ami should get a lauh out o those.
I'll put them on as a surprise one day soon.  (gotta be before she sees this entry!)</p>

<p>We marveled at the  costumes andpillows and cutsey things and cool things like a ball that
reverses color by performing some sort of involution flip thing.  It's from the US; I may be abe to
find some pics or vids.  Took a picture of me in a black hat and tight curled hair after watching
some hip hoppin' Japanese break dancers fli floppin' on tv.  They were doing amazing crazy cool
stuff.</p>

<p>Tomomi got somechocolate, something else, and some lederhosen for warmth during the continuing
winter weahter we've had here.</p>

<p>I got the dog boxers and and some clothes hangers (6 for 500 yen)  they're heavy duty black
ones.</p>

<p>Headed back to Shibuya talking about eating raw horse or dog or camel.  Nice.</p>

<p>Hopefully chat again soon.</p>
