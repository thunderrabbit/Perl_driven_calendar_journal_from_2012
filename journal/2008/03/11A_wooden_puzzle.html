<p>Some years ago I was laughing my eyes out while Jason was pretending to not see a stick shaped
like a turtle poking its head out of the lake at SWUUSI (he was holding the stick).  Just today I
mailed that stick to him, wrapped roughly in a cardboard triangle with his name and address in magic
marker on one side and my name scrawled in Japanese on the other.</p>

<p>The real puzzling thing though: how the woman at the post office and I seem to clash.  Or how I
seem to clash and she seems clueless about everything.</p>

<p>First, I gave her a postcard.  She weighed it.</p>

<p>It was approximately .1 grams or some shit.  I mean it was a fuckin' postcard.  How heavy is it
going to be?  And, don't you have a sense of these things by now?</p>

<p>Granted it was a tiny bit bigger than the average small Japanese postcard, but not quite as big
as a souvenir postcard I might get at the airport.  To send my postcard within Japan: 120 yen (too
much).</p>

<p>I then gave her the carboard &quot;box.&quot; She weighed the box.  Fair enough.  She asked if
the address I had written on the box (the only writing visible on it) was the address to which I
wanted to send it.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>She asked if I wanted to write my address on the box somewhere.  (at that point I hadn't.)
&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; I just didn't want to write it yet because I figured you'd want to put the
box in a different package first.</p>

<p>Then she pointed out that the ends of the box were wide open (being a triangular cylinder, these
things happen), and I suggested that if she were to have some tape, perhaps she could let me use it
to, perhaps, close the ends of the cylinder with the tape.  She agreed this was a good idea and got
three (3) rolls of duct tape (okay, granted one was all but finished), discarded the one that was
semi used, and gave me the almost finished one.  I brought it closer to finished to close one end
and then she gave me the brand new roll.  I was like, &quot;gimme dat&quot; and took the one that I
had been using and finished it and she pointed out that I could use the others and I should feel
free to tape it securely, so I followed her sage advice which happened to be my plan and taped it
and it was all great.</p>

<p>Gave it to her and she was like, &quot;so, what's in the box?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, um, these are things you should ask when the box is what we call &quot;still
open.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps it's better that she didn't see.  It's a wooden stick and might have rabies or something
and therefore not be allowed to send across national borders, despite the fact that it's</p>

<ol>
<li><p>perfectly dry</p></li>

<li><p>already crossed national borders</p></li>

<li><p>originally from the US</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I pointed to a wooden stamp thing she had behind the counter and said &quot;it's one of
these.&quot;</p>

<p>She seemed relieved and took the box and weighed it again, asking if I wanted to send it by air
or sea.  I said either is okay so she put an AIR MAIL stamp on it and gave me the total price.  The
stick to the US cost twice and only twice the price of the postcard sent within Japan which woulda
been 50 yen if it were a bit smaller.</p>

<p>Paid the money and she put the stamp on the postcard and a stamp on the stick box and gave me my
change and receipt, which as far as I know, means I can leave.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;um, yeah, so, when did you think I might put my address on the box?&quot;</p>

<p>And she was like, &quot;did you want to write your name and address on the box?&quot;</p>

<p>And I'm like, &quot;I'm going to fucking kill you I don't fucking care if my name and address are
on the box; you are the professional here; do I need to put my name and address on the box or not?
I know I do so if the stick turns out to be a bomb you can trace it back to my ass so why the fuck
are asking me if I want to put my name and address on the box?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't actually say all that, but she gave me the box and explained that I should write my
address in Japan on the back of the box.</p>

<p>I did say this:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Japan!  Oh, my Japanese address!&quot; and then while walking away, talking out loud to
myself &quot;I live in Japan, so I should put my Japanese address on here!&quot;</p>

<p>I fucking hate <del>Japan</del> <ins>that something I can't explain what the hell is happening here</ins>.</p>

<p>I put my address on the back.  I wanted to write a whole rant to Jason but I know that would
change everything for one mustn't write a letter when sending a package.</p>
