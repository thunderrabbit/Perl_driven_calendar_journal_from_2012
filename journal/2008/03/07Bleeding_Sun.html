<p>I guess _Bleeding_Sun_ could be considered volume 5 of the tetralogy _Atlantean_Secrets_.  It's
at least as good as any of those.</p>

<p>The scene is in the future earth, where everything has gone to hell (somewhat literally), and
all humans are immersed in a constant virtual reality, created by satan to disconnect humans from
any spiritual connection.</p>

<p>This is a snippet of a quote by the protagonist's mom:</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;[your report card] says you have a pathological tendency to avoid violent situations.  Is it
true that in the last year you haven't stolen anything, and you only killed six people, three of whom
by accident?&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>A minute later:</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;And what about sex?  The report says that for a thirteen year old young man, you're completely
inhibited.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Dang.</p>
