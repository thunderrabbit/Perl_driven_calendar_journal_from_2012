<p>Just did a &quot;reconnection&quot; energy session with Romi from my meditation class.  I don't
know if that's the right name of the work, but I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Completely relaxed, I lay down, and she didn't touch me physically.  Great feeling of warmth
over my body as she worked on various parts.  Worked is not the right word; at one point I had a
knowing that this is easy.  I don't even need her in order to draw this energy into my body, and
she's not using any effort per se, just intention.</p>

<p>I floated between consciousness and sleepin', just gliding along the line.  Her outer experience
of 40 minutes seemed like 20 to me.  At the end, my whole body was tingling, and quite clearly I
had not been in it the whole time.  At one point during the session I felt waves of wigglations
that I associate with my astral body returning to my physical.</p>

<p>Good times.  Good times.</p>
