<p>I got sidetracked reading Slashdot; first watching a video of Big Dog, a four legged robot walk
on ice and recover from some slips and a big kick.</p>

<p>Also, I hope the insider trading doc on Wikileaks helps unravel the bad guys, and last a
suggestion to learn a new programming language per year, starting with Ruby.  I've already wanted to
learn a new thing each year, so Ruby can certainly count as one.</p>

<p>So I went through most of a cool <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">tutorial for Ruby</a>.  I
think I might try and learn it. </p>
