<p>The best part about our meditation group tonight was having Mia say, &quot;your hands are
warmer..&quot; because when I first met her, my hands were way freezing, and hers were warm; now
after doing reiki with her, my hands are warmer than they were before.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just cause now it's May whereas we met in November.  But I was still happy to see her
and get that feedback.</p>
