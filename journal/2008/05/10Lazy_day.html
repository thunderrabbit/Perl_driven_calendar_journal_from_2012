<p>Been slowly ticking off items from my checklist made a couple days ago.  Ami is downstairs making
dinner and I've been downloading pics (wouldn't call them porn; they might be seen on broadcast TV
in Europe) from sites on a anonymizing &quot;darknet&quot; available
via <a href="http://freenetproject.org/">freenet</a>.  gah.  enough of that; I need to get back to
my list!</p>

<p>So now it's time to write a State of My Life Address.</p>
