<p>Cripes.  2:30 almost.  Great conference.  I volunteered most of the first day.  Ami and I both
volunteered on the second day (&quot;today&quot;).  Super super super glad to get her involved in
PB.</p>

<p>Met wonderful amazing people.  Right now I feel most impressed with Yashar who
founded <a href="http://www.peaceandloveinternational.com/">PeaceAndLoveInternational</a></p>
