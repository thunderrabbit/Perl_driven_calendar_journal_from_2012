<p>Pretty semi good productivity at work.  I got the first (easy) half of the survey-only missions
done, but when I went to do the second half, I realized I didn't have all the information available
so I'd have to redo the first half so I could have it for the second half.</p>

<p>Then I realized that I might have had the info I needed to have in the second half, but I hadn't
had a good idea of what I had to have, so I used half a sheet of paper to write the notes I had in
my brain so that I'll have them tomorrow when I have to get reoriented and doing this project's
second half.</p>

<p>More than half of the todo items on the half sheet of paper have to do with drawing a graph so I
have a chance to grasp the overview of this project; now I just have a half-pint idea of what we
have and what we have to do.  I know later I'll wish I had the graph, and so I'll use the time I
have to graph the graph and have a grasp of what I have and know if I already had what what I needed
when I thought I didn't have what I have to have.</p>
