<p>Just quickly capturing this moment on the train after having to  pry myself out of the office
with Yumiko (who has always been so patient with me) asking a question I simply did not understand,
and trying to get SVN resynced cause she didn't understand me telling her *not* to upload her
images to the live server as well; I will use SVN to move them to the main server.  I told her just
the test server, and she immediately uploaded another image to the live server; dang.

so I quickly triaged by simply giving up on checking the files were the same, and just assuming she
knew what she was doing (used to work, but SVN means we have new wasy)..  oops I m at my station.</p>

<p>That went pretty well; the guy said he didn't see any DB jobs at the moment, but new jobs come
in every day.</p>
