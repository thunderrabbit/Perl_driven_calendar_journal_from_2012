<p>Last night Akiko and I hung out at the Lawson's next to EV where I used to work (and therby met
her)..  so I had been to the Lawson's a million times and met everyone so I was chatting with Ai
and a new girl, though I didn't get her name.</p>

<p>I'm going to go back this morning to say H to Tsunashima; I haven't been there in the morning
for a while so haven't seen him.  Ai said I should come by because everyone was crying wondering if
I'd ever come back.   I'm glad when Japanese can be sarcastic.  It's such an underappreciated form
of humor here!</p>
