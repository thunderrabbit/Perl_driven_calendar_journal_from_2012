<p>Uncle Cow and I went to the dentist.  He was given a clean bill of health!</p>

<p>My toofs are pretty good given that I had the huge hole filled some weeks ago.  The dentist was
concerned that the root might have gotten infected and he didn't fill it immediately, but put a
little dot of filling and then a removable cap to protect it for a bit, and if it quit hurting after
that, he would fill it all the way.  Well, it quit hurting, even under stressors like wiggling and
cold/hot fluids and he filled it up.</p>

<p>Since then, he's been filling not-so-huge holes at the base of various teeth.  One per
appointment is the style here.  I dunno why, but each visit it cheap as chips (2310 yen today (I can
spend more on a meal and hardly notice (e.g. Pink Cow buffet is 2650 yen))) so I'm not too
worried about the cost.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for the low price, because I *had* been worried about the cost before, and this led
to the growth of the aforementioned huge hole.  These prices do *not* include insurance repays, so
(not including insurance monthly charges) it would be even cheaper.</p>
