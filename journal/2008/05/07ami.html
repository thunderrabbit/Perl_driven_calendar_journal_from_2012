<p>Lovely to see Ami again so soon; I love her new necklace (that I got for her).  It's a hematite
heart with hematite beads from Kenya.  She had been wearing two thin-chain necklaces that would get
tangled together; this one looks great.</p>

<p>Also great was the dinner she made: a new kind of noodles from something something I dunno
exactly.  They were flat and she called them はかはき or something.</p>

<p>At one point during dinner, I was massaging her legs and she was telling me about some TV show
she had seen talking about how younger and younger people are getting old people's diseases or some
such.  and I was like, &quot;stop watching TV!&quot; in a firm but gentle way</p>

<p>And I am caught between my wanting her to stop doing what she likes because I hate TV vs letting
her do what she likes because I like her, bs encouraging her to stop doing something that I think
is harmful to herself because i love her, vs me doing things that are harmful to myself becuase I'm
as human as the rest of us humans.</p>

<p>I was thoughtful for a moment, and she was like, &quot;what?&quot;</p>

<p>I got, &quot;I guess you like TV don't you?&quot;</p>

<p>Afterward, we were both quite tired as indicated that neither of us was in a playful mood, but we
did play around on FFS and Ami bought a bunch of pets that she thought were undervalued.  She had
bought two the previous day and they sold within an hour or so, and so she bought everal more.</p>

<p>I played her pet as she was leaving, and she was like, &quot;stay!&quot; and &quot;go
home!&quot; and it was cute.  Fun for me and I hope for her.</p>
