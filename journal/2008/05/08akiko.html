<p>Hung out with Akiko after meeting Hideo about his website.  Akiko was bummed about being but a
pawn in the corporate game, and now has two jobs as she's being shifted around.  I happy to chat
with her and thankful that she contacted me when feeling blue.</p>

<p>She showed me some kanji and corrected my Japanese postcard that I wrote her not so long ago.</p>
