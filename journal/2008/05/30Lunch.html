<p>Going to meet the guys in Gotanda for lunch.  Have been working on workwiki and things are
morphing into a good form.</p>

Sweet.  Looks good, though still haven't talk about pay.  I briefly talked to the recruiter who
found the job for me; he was talkin' about 2100 yen per hour, which would pay 365000 gross per month
(21.7 working days per month, 8 hours per day), which I believe would be more than I'm making
here.</p>

<p>I know from this job, about 260000 yen per month ends up in my bank account, but I don't know how
much of that amount goes away to taxes and such.</p>

<p>Ah crap.  I forgot me-n-Ami's plans for Hong Kong vacation!  Gotta rewrite this schedule.  D'oh!</p>

now, but R was askin' if I can do 水木金 in 五反田 instead of just 水金.  I'll be talkin' to
中谷さん as soon as he gets back.</p>

<p>Speaking of R, he offered 1800 yen per hour instead of the 2100 he had cited as an
example.</p>

<p>So that would be 312000 yen per month gross.</p>
