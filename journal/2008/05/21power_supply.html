<p>I'm on my new computer cause my MacBook magsafe power supply has
split near the brick.  I looked online a bit and it seems some others
have had issues with this adapter.</p>

<p>I personally love love love the magnet part of it and have had no
issues with *that* end, but just near the brick, the cable has split
to the point that I can't prop it in place with tape to get a constant
connection.</p>

<p>So I'ma take it back to the Apple Store tomorrow and look forward
to receiving a new adapter with no worries.</p>
