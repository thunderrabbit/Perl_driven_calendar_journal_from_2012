<p>Hahaha; they said that our company is faltering out of business, and they can pay me for the next
2 months, but no guarantees past that.</p>

<p>Each person in my group is having such a meeting.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>I must say I appreciate this advanced warning.  It doesn't seem like what a normal company
would do in the US.</p>

<p>I was in Apple Store writing that which I plan o paste above when Ami called.  I gave her the semi-bad new first: that they overpaid me last time and I might get less money next payday, and she was like, 'well you've got a lot this time, so y'ou're cool, right?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;yeah except that I can't really account for it,&quot; which is frikking me out a bit here; wtf did the money go? </p>

<p>Gonna bust out the bank books and shit to get this sorted.  Ah damn my bank book is not up to date, but I'm pretty sure I know i've got about 2000 yen i there.</p>

<p>I think a big chunk went to Helma for my ISIS session, but I don't recall how much.  I think 13,000..  then I paid rent 69,000 and I had bought the omputer which was either 100,000 or 120,000.</p>

<p>Dang.</p>

<p>So anyway, it's time to start paying attention to my money a bit better, and I feel fortunatel that the next set of meditation things are free (as far as I understand), and if they'r not, I might have to skip.</p>

<p>Gah.</p>

<p>anyway, Ami was surpirised when I couldn't account for the money 9as am I) but we didn't alk about it too much on the phone; I asked if she would come to my crib tonight, and she said after 10pm, i believe...  or around 10pm.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I've got 20,000 yen saved in the house, and  well, actually *I* have 10,000 yen, and we have an extra 10,000 together.</p>

<p>a bit went to my teeth, and a bit went to this shirt, and a bit went to food, oh, and the tix for the play were 6000 yen, but Ami paid me for hers, but then we went again for 1000 yen each.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I didn't even get to the bad (?) news of losing my ob in two months.</p>

<pre>
Things I didn't write:

# talk to Motogami about shtuff
# talk to Koichi about tuff

If the computer was only 120,000, after that I had about 200,000

70,000 to rent
13,000 to Helma
 7,000 wallet
10,000 to PASMO
10,000 to savings
 3,000 train tix to Chiba twice
 4,000 TIP

wtf?
