OH MY GOD this story is awesome!!

I could really feel and smell the sea and characters and the magical
whale song and man this is great!

Is Jayne a character you developed?  Is he in other stories?  Why does
he have a girls' name?   Why are his hands hammers?  what's going on
here?????
	
	
Hey, thanks Rob- that's great you liked the Jayne story. I developed him yeah, but this is the only
story he stars in. His girl's name- well, I guess we'd have to talk to his parents about that. About
his hands- he has those because he invented this new kind of whaling, and to do it he needed hammer
hands, so he had them grafted that way.  There's a few other stories set in the same world I have-
Killin Jack is one, the links are on the site. Been working on it a little today actually- moving
things around.


Do you have a website?

Mike.

I'll check out Killin Jack "soon"  !!!

Me?  A website?  Sheeeit; I don't know the first thing about HMTL nor
intertubes.

BUT  (how much time do *you* have to waste??  )

I do prefer to write all my HTML by hand (haha my misspelling as HMTL
above let me say I know nothing about it!), and I've had a website
since about 1996.  (started with Geocities before Yahoo! bought them)

My Latest Project is <a href="http://fly2.nu/">http://fly2.nu/</a>  and especially <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/"></a>

My homepage homage to my friend's old BBS is at
<a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/</a>  (basically I wrote all of the text
on the pages, and hoped people from the BBS would join, but it's been
years and people get busy)  (feel free to join and add to the fun if
the world seems interesting!)

My journal is at <a href="http://journal.robnugen.com">http://journal.robnugen.com</a> 
My blog is at <a href="http://robnugen.com/blog">http://robnugen.com/blog</a>     (not sure why I've not yet
made a machine name version)
My wiki is at <a href="http://wiki.robnugen.com">http://wiki.robnugen.com</a>   (this is mostly for pictures;
I've got bajillions of pics in directories starting at
<a href="http://robnugen.com/images">http://robnugen.com/images</a> but it's a pain to upload them via scp
(glorified ftp) and handmake thumbnails, etc )
