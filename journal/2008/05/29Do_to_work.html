<p>My to-do list:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><del>create an SVN repository for workwiki extensions</del> * add dir to existing repository</p></li>

<li><p><del>document the creation on the workwiki</del></p></li>

<li><p><del>document the apache deets for that server on the workwiki</del></p></li>

<li><p>* import the existing workwiki extension code to the repository</p></li>

<li><p><del>document that</del></p></li>

<li><p>* finish the workwiki extension to write links to servers</p></li>

<li><p>* <del>sit back and smoke a fattie</del> <ins>take a break</ins></p></li>

<li><p>* add the servers-link tag to top of admin:missionRegist and admin:missionList</p></li>

<li><p>* use the new links to easily visit the admin:missionRegist page</p></li>

<li><p>* view the source to cutnpaste the names of the ¸ø³«¾õÂÖ types (*)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) I can't read that, but I vaguely know what it means.</p>

<p>This all started because I'm working on documenting our system in the new wiki I installed
yesterday.  I can't read the options that I need to document, so I can't type them into the wiki,
and they're in a dropdown list, so I can't cutnpaste.  So I gotta get to the HTML source to copy
them, but the page isn't up in any of my tabs, so I would have to do something like use my mouse to
click the bookmark. </p>

<p>SO, I figure I should put them at the top of the wiki page, but... which server?  live?  test1?
test2?  All three, of course, but I sure ain't typin' 'em all in!</p>

<p>So I'm going to make a wiki tag (like &lt;navigation/&gt; on
the <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">Castle of Dreams wiki</a>) that will let me just be
like &lt;serverlinks https=&quot;true&quot; path=&quot;admin/path/thing.php&quot;/&gt; which will
produce links to</p>

<p>https://liveserver.com/admin/path/thing.php, https://testserver.com/admin/path/thing.php,
https://testserver2.com/admin/path/thing.php</p>

<p class="date">6:33pm JST</p>

<p>I've worked pretty solidly on the new wiki all day.  Uploading a lot of pictures and trying to
get some sense of useability.  Even though it's much mo' useable than a long list of text woulda
been, perhaps I shoulda started with a long list of text to give myself an overview of a
structure that could work well to present all this info.</p>
