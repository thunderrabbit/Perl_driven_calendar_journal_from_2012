alt="funny todo list" class="left" /></a> Last night I wrote a todo list that I've been working on
today.  I recognize the value of making an overview, but I often slash usually submit to temptation
of just diving in and tweaking/twonking/refactoring/rearranging code until I wake up all,
&quot;where da hell am I and how did it get to be so late?&quot;</p>

<p>So even though it feels slower, I've been working on drawing out exactly how this program currently works (now just from the user/DB perspective; I'm not even touching the code/logic)</p>

<p>Anyway, the last item on the list is for Fred, written in honor of Swa'vet.</p>
