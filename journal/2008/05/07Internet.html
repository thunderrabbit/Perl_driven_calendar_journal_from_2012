<p>I'm pretty far behind in all the stuff I want to put online: pics of Uncle Cow from the
conference, journal of the conference, and blog of the conference, plus a few notes on all the vids
I've watched recently, and maybe even pull a clip of the John Lear clip (from project camelot's part
1 of their 4 part interview) and post it as a response to the NPT (no planes theory) video I
copy-posted on youtube.</p>

<p>Oh, plus I need to write to Kim Sawyer for a monthly update thing.</p>

<p>AND a State of My Life Address.</p>

<p>But right now, I gotta do some work related stuff at work.</p>
