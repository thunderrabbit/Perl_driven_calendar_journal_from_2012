<p>Great busy day today chillin' with Jen T from PB; she's a cool girl..  Nat was right when she
said Jen and I would love each other if only we had been on the same voyage!  That's love in the
platonic deep emotional sharing kinda way.</p>

<p>This was the rainy morning selling tickets in Hibiya Park, and admiring Jen's ability to meet
the press; I gotta get some cards!!!  and act like she knows wtf is going on.  She basically said
she doesn't, but she's winging it quite well in my estimation!!</p>

<p>After helping each other take pics and video during the conference, we joined the Peace Walk and
stayed mostly away from the right-wing nationalists and chatted with David from EPA (European
Pressphoto Agency) and Jay Marx from Washington Peace Center, and another guy whose name I've
forgotten (dang, but overall I did quite better than usual)...  and after it was all over we sat in
front of Tokyo Station for lunch (shoulda gotten a pic of Uncle Cow in front of the huge sign TOKYO STATION
and then headed home.</p>

<p>I did get some pics
of <a href="http://uncle.cow.isfuzzywilltravel.com/index.php?title=Uncle_Cow_lives_in_Tokyo&oldid=132">Uncle
Cow *in* Tokyo Station</a>.  (the bottom two pics on that page, which may be different than the
current version)</p>

<p>Saw Ami for two minutes as she and her mom headed in to Hirama station as I headed *out*.</p>

<p>Now I've got to go to bed; I've been stuck on fucking FriendsForSale for hours.</p>
