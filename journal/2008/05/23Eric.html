<p>Saw Eric T ex-from Kawasaki Nova in Motosumiyoshi station this morning!  He was headed to
Japanese lesson and we chatted a bit.  He's lookin' for translation work, but has savings (hmmm;
what a good idea!) so he's okay for now.</p>

<p>I had to sprint off to get my train at the last second, but I ended up at the first second
*after* my train left.  Ah well.</p>
