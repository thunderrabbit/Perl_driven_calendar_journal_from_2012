<p>Got an email from Akiko saying that she was bummed due to some nonsense at work.  I called her
and she called me back; basically she got shifted to a new position and was informed of the change
as a &quot;welcome back here's your new job&quot; after Golden Week (multiple national holidays in a
row).</p>

<p>We'll both be in Shibuya at 9pm (me to meet Hideo, and she for EV lesson) so we're going to meet
for a bit after that.</p>
