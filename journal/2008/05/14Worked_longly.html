<p>Just finishing work today; I ain't stayin' late tomorrow nor Friday.  After attaching the survey
section to the site (survey is in PostgreSQL while the main part is in mySQL), I was able to add the
option of requiring users to take a survey after finishing their missions.  Now today I just set it
up so they can take *only* a survey and that be their mission.  I'm assuming we'll never need to
take a survey instead of a mission *and* take a survey about taking the survey.</p>

<p>Anyway, I know from experience at FSD, this is just the beginning.  There are entire companies
based on doing surveys; we can only do a single page survey with no saving halfway through, and no
pages, etc.  We *can* require certain questions to be filled-in, while allowing others to be
skipped, but.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm going to add the admin part to evaluate the user's surveys.  Basically, admin
checks the survey and decides if it passes muster.</p>

<p>Now,</p>

<p>I also know from experience that most people don't write a lot in the textarea fields, which is
the only thing the admin can realistically check mo' better than the computer.  But, I'll add it
just cause that basically matches the existing system here, but I may be more awake tomorrow and
push back with my past experience in hand.</p>

<p>Anyway, we are not promising any kind of anonymity with the surveys, so whateva.</p>
