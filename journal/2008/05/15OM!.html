Doood!!!

I am *totally* interested in doing that job again!   Is it in Yokohama
(same as before)?  wow wow wow

You know I can't answer for you, but if you have the twinging feeling
that it would be going backwards, then it probably would be.

It's SO hard for me to suggest that you don't come back; I would love
love love to see you and play with you every weekend!!!  My GOD I miss
you a lot, now that I think back on all our happy times

BUT if Japan = stuck for you, and Perth = get a degree and move ahead,
then you should do that.

However, if degree = who-cares, and party = I wanna party forever,
then come on back to Tokyo, baby!!!

In either case, I love and support you, though by giving you this
mixed messages email, I might not be helping much!!

   Love Love
    - Rob!

ps: lemme know OMs digits (and his real name; I forgot!) and I'll call
him up; I'd like to make some yen, and I reckon I can run the compooter
too.

  Love Love
