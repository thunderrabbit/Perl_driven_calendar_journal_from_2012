<p>Dammit dammit dammit</p>

<p>This time it's my bad fo' sho'.  I lost the SSL password, and right now our SSL server isn't
serving.  It's a $350 mistake cause that's the price it will cost to get a new one.  But peeps
around me are saying, &quot;wait just a minute;&quot; let's not be hasty, but dang, I see this as
the only solution, unless I could remember the previous password.  I know it was a passphrase,
something like,</p>

<pre>
This is the great $$L pa$$word
</pre>

<p>or something like that.</p>

<p>But, I just tried, and that's not it.</p>

<p>In February, I had it carefully written on a scrap of paper on my now clean desk.</p>

<p>Next password will be a bit more carefully distributed to co-workers.</p>

<p>They got it fixed.  I've printed out a nice form with &quot;all&quot; our passwords and
distributed to everyone.  I'm not sure if they actually had to pay $350 or not, but it's all handled
and the passphrase is known by all those who need to know.</p>

<p>Gotta head out to meet Yurika.  Spoke briefly with Nakatani who basically said it's okay this
time, but I ought not let there be a next time for such a mistake.</p>

<p>Basically, it kept our web server in Maintanence mode all day, and required 2 worker-days to
get it fixed.</p>
