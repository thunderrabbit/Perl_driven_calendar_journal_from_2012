<p>got wiki.fly2.nu started.  It doesn't refresh to isfuzzywilltravel.com because wikis aren't
fuzzy; they're websites.</p>

<p>Got great work done at work.  Finished incorporating the cool CSV code written by the programmer
I respect, and replaced some security checks the other programmer had removed.</p>

<p>THEN I got the survey-only code planned out and just about got it going, but need to head out
for I-group right about now.</p>

<p>I'm leavin' in *plenty* of time, so I can be plenty relaxed on the way there.</p>

<p>Man..  knowing that my computer at home is diligently logging in to FFS every 15 minutes and 2
seconds so that I can get $2000 every hour certainly helped me stay off FFS here at work.</p>
