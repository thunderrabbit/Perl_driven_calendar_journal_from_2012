<p>Great I-group tonight; I blabbed about not valuing myself, and
narrowed it down to not valuing what I'm doing on the planet at this
moment.  Jacob knew from where I was coming.</p>

<p>Afterward, I went with Kevin to an Indian restaurant in Ebisu, and
he told me more about the ISIS 101 adventure.  I've definitely gotta
do that "soon;" it sounds amazing.</p>
