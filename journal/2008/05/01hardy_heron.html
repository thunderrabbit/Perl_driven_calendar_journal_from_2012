<p>I popped the Live CD of ubuntu 6.04 into my other machine last night.  It loaded up well enough,
but there was no network access.  I looked briefly online for help and noted something that might
indicate that the Airport card specs aren't released, so developers can't develop for it.  If
that's the case, it pretty much sucks, but I'd be surprised to think that XP can run on Macs, but
not Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Anyway, I bought CDs so I can burn a live CD for Hardy Heron tonight and see if I can clarify
things on this issue.</p>

<p>If I *can* run ubuntu with wireless access on that machine, I almost certainly will, just for
the learning experience, and to make my software all legal.  Right now it's got 10.5 on it, which,
while nice in some respects, isn't necessarily nice enough for me to run out and buy it.  But
I'm glad to have gotten this test period to use it.</p>

<p>I like Spaces, and I like the clean desktop.  But Hardy Heron has the equivalent of Spaces, and
they brag about having a clean desktop (on startup), so I'd be anti-impressed if they've done
nothing to help keep it nice during normal use.  Of course it's clean when it's new!</p>

<p>BUT, if it won't run my wireless card, I'll stick with OS X.</p>

<p>ALSO, in any case, I've decided I will *not* just transfer all my shizzle from this compizzle to
the new one.  I'll use the new one as if it's on its own, though I wouldn't be adverse to networking
them at some points, not that I think those points will come often.</p>

<p>Oh.  Hardy Heron doesn't support PPCs.  I'm 90% sure that includes PowerBooks.  Dang.  I wonder
if they will be supported again soon.</p>

<p>So now I'm going to try the Live CD on my MacBook.  (My &quot;real&quot; computer.)  (this one)
(on which I'm typing now) (which I'm apparently loathe to shut down..)</p>

<p>Aight; I found a version that will work with my PowerBook, so I'm burning the disk image now.</p>

<p>It didn't seem to work; the screen went all wonky, but came back fine after a hard boot.  Back in
OS X, I looked at partitioning the drive, but it won't let me select anything but Mac partition.  I
wonder if that's cause it's already got a volume on the entire drive.  But now bedtime; I'll try
again in the morning zzzzzz</p>
