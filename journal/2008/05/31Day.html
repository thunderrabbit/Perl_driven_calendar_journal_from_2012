<p>Yesterday, Saturday 31 May 2008 (day 13947), the business cards for Uncle Cow came via Sagawa
(sp)!  BUT I wasn't happy with the service; I had requested the previous night that they come by
noon, and when they didn't come by 2pm, I called and they said by 4pm, and when they didn't come
*again*, I called again and they finally came by 6pm.</p>

<p>I believe in the US, such crappy service would at least result in getting a discount or free
delivery on the next purchase or something, but even though Ami and I asked as specifically as
possible, no such luck.  I signed for the package &quot;YOU GUYS SUCK&quot; cause I was so
unimpressed with the lack of customer care.</p>

<p>I shoulda written something in Japanese, but </p>

<p>I <em>shoulda</em> just counted my blessings that I can afford $80 for business cards (they're
*not* cheap as chips here in Tokyo).</p>
