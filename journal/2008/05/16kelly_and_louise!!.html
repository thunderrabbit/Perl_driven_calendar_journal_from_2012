<p>Ami and I went to see the musical Something Funny Happened on the way to the Forum, in which
Kelly H performed as a whisp or something.  The show was HILARIOUS, including a backwards chase
scene that had me laffin' so hard..</p>

<p>There's a song in which the virgin sings, &quot;I'm lovely...  absolutely lovely..&quot; as the
refrain, and during the chase scene she skips across stage just long enough to sing,
&quot;lovely,&quot; and then when it's reversed, she skips backwards and sings, &quot;evil,&quot;
hahahahahahahahahahahhahaa!!</p>

<p>Here are the pics from after the show

price for those who've already seen the show.</p>
