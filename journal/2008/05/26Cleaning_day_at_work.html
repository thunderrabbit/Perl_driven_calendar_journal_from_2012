<p>Hmmmm; the last time we had a cleaning day here was just before our holiday for the New Year.
In this case, it's only our table that's having a cleaning day, so I imagine it's cause this
&quot;office&quot; is going to be moved to a new office.</p>

<p>The cleaning frenzy started right after their meeting (I don't join because I don't understand
Japanese, which I realize now is self-fulfilling.</p>

<p>Been lookin' for jobs that don't require Japanese fluency, but just conversational level...</p>
