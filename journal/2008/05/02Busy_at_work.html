<p>I'm busy at work in the way that I probably &quot;should be&quot; each day.  I've
got <a href="http://remix.nin.com">remix.nin.com</a> in my headphones and I'm focusing on a task
list that I'm choosing *not* to transcribe here.</p>

<p>That's how busy I am.  :-)</p>

<p>(basically it's just making sure the surveys and missions can be created on the live server's
test site.)</p>

<p>First run through looks good-ish, but still a couple of cosmetics tweaks to be twoked.</p>

<p class="date">6:30pm JST</p>

<p>Nice.  Actually that all worked pretty well.  I got it a bit better sorted; I think we can move
this online with zero downtime.</p>

<p>One more install-run next week (Monday and Tuesday are holidays!) and then move online on Thursday.</p>
