<p>Quite early arrival, so I'm actually chillin' in the hotel near where we meet.  For some reason
the weather feels like winter.  I think it's like 17 C today, whereas I would expect 24 or so.  I
haven't looked up historical temps in Tokyo for this time of year, but I'm sure it's supposed to be
warmer.</p>

<p>I rolled in to the hotel hoping the massage room up on the whatever floor would have some
free massage givers to pimp their work and try to entice me upstairs with their rubbin' prowess.
But, sigh; ¤¤¤Ê¤¤.</p>
