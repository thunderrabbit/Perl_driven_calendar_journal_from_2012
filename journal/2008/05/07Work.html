<p>Work was/hasbeen aight today: actually I was pretty dang productive for some hours in a row: I
smashed through an entire page of items on my checklist (large size handwriting) and think
everything is cleaned up so it will work perfectly tomorrow.</p>

<p>BUT, I was unable to create a copy of the DB (tried to export it, but the result is a zero byte
file) because the DB name is test-e and I'd rather it be called live or some such.</p>

<p>I wanted to talk to my boss' boss about payday (I think I got too much), but he went into a
meeting as soon as he arrived around 6pm or so.  Hopefully they'll be done soon, but doesn't really
sound like it.  I would bust in but he and my boss are in there with some customer I've never
met/seen/grokked before.</p>
