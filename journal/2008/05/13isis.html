<p>Good ISIS session with Helma.  Saw myself as an earthquake victim; cried for the other victims
and my inability to help.  Wonder if it's just cause of the recent earthquake in China.  Helma
didn't have change for my cash, so I gave her less and bought her dinner tonight.  This was at
Foresta near Waseda station.</p>

<p>Talked about living lives in freestyle mode (guided by Spirit), and how that looks like
chaos/craziness from the outside.</p>
