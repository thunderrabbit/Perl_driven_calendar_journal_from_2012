<p>Lesson with Yurika tonight.  She confirmed that the Japanese used by ÃæÃ« was pretty
noteworthy.</p>

<p>Her excellent homework shows me how hard she's working to learn English.  My eyes drinking in
her makeup shows me how I still have the hots for her in a way.  But we're safely past all that so
no worries.</p>

<p>After the lesson I noted that the underground connection to the other side of the street is
open, so we walked down there for a second.  I found the name of the new line on a map.  Fukutoshin
or something.  I bet it's the one to which my beloved Toyoko line will connect, giving me a
straight shot all the way from my station to Ikebukero, which is pretty dang cool.</p>
