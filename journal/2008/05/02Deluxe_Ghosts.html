apologize for this short delay, and thank you for you patience and understanding. In the event you

Hey doods

&gt; In the event you find this delay unacceptable and wish to cancel your order

Haha I've been waiting this long; I ain't cancelling now, but I
appreciate the option.  :-)

just writing to send some love your way.  You may be in a little chaos
due to the ordering snafu, but just remember to breathe and be happy
in the moment.  You're doing great.

Peace and Love
  - Rob
