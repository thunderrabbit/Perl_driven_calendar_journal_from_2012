<p>Yesterday evening, Ami and I went to Takadanobaba to meet up with Jen et. al. for a Brazilian
samba party featuring <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxkO0iTq3A">Francis Silva</a>, but I
wasn't careful enough with the directions to the place, and I got lost.</p>

<p>We ended up just chillin' at <a href="http://www.benscafe.com/">Ben's Cafe</a> and then as we
left, Jen called me back and we met up at the location.  The party was over, so we went to a nearby
Japanese style restaurant with Levi, Kazzah, Tony, きざし, こうすけ, Jen, and Taka</p>
