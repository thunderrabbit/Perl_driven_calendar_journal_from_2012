<p>I've not searched for any jobs yet today; like I haven't even thought about it.  Oh wait, I did
a little bit: Dude sent me a link to rentacoder.com and I signed up as a coder on that site, but I
haven't yet bid on any jobs.</p>

<p>Near the end of yesterday I was asked to figure out why a particular user's data seems wonky.  On
this page it says PAID, while on this page it says PENDING.</p>

<p>After a bit of research, the answer returned to my brain.  In fact, this is already something I
had noticed, but from the code / DB point of view.  I was like, &quot;wtf: the code is written such
that it's a pain in the arse to set the user's items to PAID.  They get stuck at
PENDING....&quot;</p>

<p>That was back in December, and I told my boss.  He shrugged it off, perhaps because I said it
would be difficult to update the data properly. (*)</p>

<p>I was busy with other stuff, and I blew it off because <em>it's been that way since the beginning
of time,</em> at least from the perspective of the program, and I figured if no one has complained
about it, the issue must not be visible to users.</p>

<p>It's visible to users.</p>

<p>I had never seen it before because I'm ineligible to be paid by our own website (or so I
thought; the above mentioned user is an employee who sits quite near me).</p>

<p>(*) I don't remember the details, but I think when the PAID data is written, that code only has
a sum of the data, and no access to the individual records that made that sum.</p>

<p>So now I'ma try to find where the code should be changed, discover just how hard it will be to
correct, and see from there.</p>

<p>Hahahaah</p>

<p>The solution was to change the status from PENDING to REQUESTED.</p>
