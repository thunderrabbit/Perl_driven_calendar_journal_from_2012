<p>I just did 20+ minutes of narration for HSBC; they're introducing some new technologies that I
doubt are sooper secret cause nobody mentioned nothin'.  Basically ATM cards with RFID to track
customers/preferences, and an automagical cash processing thing, I guess like what I saw in the US
at a WaMu branch.</p>
