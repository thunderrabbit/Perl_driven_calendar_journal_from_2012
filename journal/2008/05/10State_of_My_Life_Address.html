<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I have two (2) working computers now.</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>white MacBook 14 inch, purchased about a year ago (?), featuring
<br/>OS X 10.4.11
<br/>1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo
<br/>2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM
<br/>74.2 GB HD with 2.5GB free
</p></li>

<li><p>brushed chrome PowerBook G4 15 inch, purchased used in excellent condition about 2 weeks
ago, featuring
<br/>OS X 10.5.2
<br/>1.67 GHz PowerPC G4
<br/>2 GB DDR SDRAM
<br/>93.0 GB HD with 78.8GB free</p></li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>I bought the PowerBook basically to replace my old PowerBook, on which I wanted to put
ubuntu.  The old PowerBook screen is pretty much dead (all the pixels are fine, but it
flickers/statics so badly that it's useless), and I know from experience it would cost about $1000
to get it fixed via Apple (though I've not tried other options).</p>

<p>When I tried installing ubuntu, I wanted to partition the HD to leave OS X 10.5 on there and
ubuntu "next to it," BUT I can only divide the partition if I keep the format the same.</p>

<p>I imagine that means it's not a low level partition with data actually in separate areas of the
disk, but a logical partition with the data all mixed across the disk.  (Travis thinks otherwise,
but doesn't know what could be causing the problem)</p></li>

<li><p>So for now, I'm leaving OS X 10.5 on the machine and keeping it awake and online 24/7 so it
can
<br/> reload FFS so I get $2000 every 4 hours
<br/> reload FFS so Francois gets $2000 every 4 hours
<br/> keep a section of the darknet cached for people
<br/> download movies and such (though haven't done so yet)</p>

</li>

<li><p>I downloaded and installed <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK_in_Brief">CHDK, a firmware upgrade for Canon cameras</a> that basically allows access to a bunch of features that are already "in" the camera, but just not accessible via the normal interface (that's my understanding), and adds some extra features such as games, including 
<ol class="decimal">
<li>reversi (Othello), on which I have beaten the computer</li>
<li>sokoban, a puzzle that I have *not* been able to beat (and am beginning to think it's actually impossible to solve, but I can't see why it would be on there, unless as a funny joke)</li></ol></p></li>

<li><p>I just looked up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=sokoban">sokoban</a>, and it's certainly a "real" thing, so I imagine this puzzle is solvable.  I'd post a link to this particular puzzle, but not sure how to search for it.  Just an image of it is one thing, but I'd like to offer an actual playable version.</p></li>

<li><p>There are some super sweetly fragranted flowers outside my house.  Not sweet like, "awww that's sweet..." but like, "wow!  am I in janette's kitchen?"  I think of her every time I walk past them, and wonder if there's a way I could capture the fragrance and send it to her in a bottle.  Pictures will have to do for now.</p></li>

<li><p>At work I'm still working for AClass on the BS website, having just added the survey website, kinda cobbling together a frankensite that I hope stays intact.</p></li>

<li><p>Just recently at work, I've been recorded twice on video.  The first time was actually for video (commercial for PSP) and the second time was supposed to be just for audio so I was surprised when they recorded me on camera as well, but I can imagine it's easier to fast forward to the different parts visually instead of audibly (like each time I messed up, the camera guy would wave his hand in front of the camera to indicate a new take; the camera just rolled for 20+ minutes).</p>

<p>This vid was for HSBC (a bank) offering some new products or something</p></li>

<li><p>Just volunteered last weekend at the Global something something Conference <a href="http://whynot9.jp/">whynot9</a> put on by peeps from PB.  Basically a great time with thousands of people.  The first day I met Gordon from Kenya, plus Dana from Tokyo nee Houston, plus Kamau who I know from PB 49th voyage.  Met volunteers Brami and Yuuka who I joined in helping Frauke direct people from the hotel to the convention center. Also hung out with Rose for a bit when things were quiet.</p>

<p>The second day was supa-busy with handing out and taking back radio receivers for a lecture hall.  We would go through phases of sheer nothing to do but chat, and phases of chaotic activity, trying to get everyone equipped with / stripped of their receiver.  During that time a guy saw me and I didn't recognize him at first (had to scope his name tag) OMG Rami from Palestinian Vision!!!  We talked for just several seconds before he went off to his next thing.  Met most of the same people as yesterday plus hung out with P and Nerys (oh wait that was on the first day), and Ami was there the second day so that was great.  Uncle Cow made some new acquaintences, and at the banquet after dinner I met Yashar, a supa-cool guy who's developing <a href="http://www.peaceandloveinternational.com/">Peace & Love International</a>, an organization dedicated to helping peeps around the world.</p>

<p>I was most impressed with Yashar, and would love to be kickin' it with him around Japan (he's in Nagasaki right about now).</p></li>

<li><p>It sorta makes me wonder if I should detach myself from my current life and do a similar trip as to what started him off (a year around Africa)...  but wasn't this trip to Japan supposed to be the same?  How did I get stuck?</p>

<p>Who says I'm stuck?</p></li>

<li><p>This morning I went to the dentist; I left in plenty of time so I could enjoy my walk and be there on time.  During my enjoyable walk, I flashed on an idea that if I were to leave plenty of time to be on time, then I would be more relaxed (I like to be on time) and, while I was at it, simply enjoy my walk more..  just BE instead of DO.</p>

<p>Assuming this might make give me more time to relax outside of the places where I normally spend time (home, work), I could simply have a book or flash cards or notepad ready to read, study, write, or maybe even a iPhone to write online, or a iPod to study audio.</p></li>

<li><p>There are now officially 4 sites in the <a href="http://fly2.nu/">fly2.nu network</a>, one (1) of which is active, another of which as pictures, one of which is waiting for pictures to be uploaded, and the last of which doesn't actually have an animal yet:

<ol class="decimal">
<li><a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu">u.cow.fly2.nu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://go.rilla.fly2.nu">go.rilla.fly2.nu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://monty.bear.fly2.nu">monty.bear.fly2.nu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jacques.fly2.nu">jacques.fly2.nu</a></li>
</ol></p>

<p>I take a bit of the blame that Monty Bear's site doesn't have any pictures; I forgot to enable uploads when I first set it up, so that perhaps broke Colleen's momentum in getting started.  Now she's got several other things on her mind, starting with hosting her family in Portugal!</p></li>
