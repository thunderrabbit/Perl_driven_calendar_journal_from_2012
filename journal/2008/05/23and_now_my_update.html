Ahoy maties!

While I wish that meant I plan to sail again around the world on Peace Boat, it actually just means
I often spend a lot of time wondering what to write as the opening!  I'm glad I got past that and
can let ya know what's up!

I'm probably changing jobs soon, but I don't know to what job yet!  I was informed on Monday that
our company is losing business / money / sales / desire to pay me after June 25th...  So, since I
went against the advice of my personal coach and put "all" (not actually, but most) of my savings
toward my debt, I now have very little savings to float me past any gaps in income and need to find
(a) new job(s) pronto!

But the good news is I'm officially out of debt (except for pesky $200 that I didn't realize I still
owe my mom and bro for shoulder stuff back in the day), so I have plenty of space on my credit card
to go back into debt if necessary!  Muwahahahaa! Hahah!  I'm just kidding!  probably.

If I didn't really like Ami, then I would probably ditch Japan and head over to Shanghai, where a
friend of mine says he can basically get me a job on the spot.  Ami is open to the idea of coming
with me, but "not right now," as we say when referring to the Mysterious Future!

In the week since the end-of-job announcement, I've been working hard at work *and* searching for
new jobs online.  I've done two interviews so far (thanks, Kellie!) and have another scheduled for
Monday.  This weekend I'm planning to spread my resume around the internet like spam and get some
business cards made!

No, not business cards for myself; business cards for Uncle Cow!  I've got the proofs done for the
English side of the cards (thanks, Jimmy!) and got the Japanese side almost done, but not quite
cropped to size yet.  The cards will be oh-so-great, and I'll certainly put the images on Uncle
Cow's website when they're ready!

Uncle Cow, by the way, is visiting the United States right now (thanks, Gleb!) so I hope he comes
back with lots of great pictures!

In other news, my art exhibition will be at Pink Cow in July!  I haven't gotten a date confirmed for
the opening party, but hopefully I'll know soon!  And speaking of July, my 14,000th day will be July
23rd!  That's right, 14,000 days will have passed since my grand entrance into this place we call
Earth.  My 14,000th day celebration will be held at Pink Cow in Shibuya, so there will be a second
chance to pimp my art!

Monday morning has arrived, and I've been intending to send this out for the past couple of days, so
right now is the big moment!

Hugs and Love to All
   - Rob!
