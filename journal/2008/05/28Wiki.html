<p>I made yet another wiki today.  This time to document the websites we have here at work.  I
started doing a brain dump, and it was all going in to one file like </p>

<p>etc, and it just wasn't going to be particularly user friendly, much less maintainable.  Now,
with it being wikified, it will be both.</p>

<p>The only thing I forgot to do was document how I created the wiki; it required a bit more than
just clicking [install]; I had to run some code that I can't even recall the name to find anymore
to set up the search in postgres or something something.  Anyway; the wiki software install process
was self-documenting enough to figure it out promptly, but the doc I used didn't work precisely for
my situation.  Ah well; I'm going home.</p>
