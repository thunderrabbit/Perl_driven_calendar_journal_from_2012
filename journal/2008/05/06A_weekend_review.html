<p>On the train to Kawasaki with Ami now; I don't have emacs set up
fully on this machine, but the battery here is better so I'm using the
"new" Powerbook.</p>

<p>Pretty fantastic weekend; two days ago I woulda said Gordon from
Kenya most impressed me, seconded by Dana from Houston.  Gordon gave
gifts to everyone who helped him sell the rest of the gifts he brought
form Kenya; I bought a necklace for Ami, and got a shirt for myself.
I'm sure UCow's website will have pics that include the shirt, but I
don't have pics of Ami wearing the necklace yet.</p>

<p>Yesterday was pretty busy (?) giving out and taking back little
radio recievers to hoardes of people going in to Convention Hall B.
No real issues there, but some people had difficulty figuing out how
to use the receivers, how to know which room to go to, and how to
return the receivers when they were done.  Out of 600 total, we ended
up with 585 at the end of the day (as far as I know).  They even made
a plea for receivers to be returned at the small (!) reception after
the convention.</p>

<p>I loved Gordon's smile and loving giving nature.  I loved meeting
Op from foundation Movement; his wild hair and equally great smile and
downto earth nature were lovely.</p>

<p>Dana sang opera in Houston and has now been in Tokyo for like 5
years and she seemed pretty cool, though I dind't reallly get to talk
to her all that much.</p>

<p>Ami and I are leaving Kawasaki; we ate lunch of noodles and melon
soda, got a new short sleeve dress shirt for me and took ƒvƒŠƒNƒ‰ pics
for us, and a pic of Uncle Cow on the world's shortest escalator.</p>

<p>Speaking of shortest, this little trip was short but it's already
5pm; I slept until noon (Ami until 1 or 2pm) cause I was up until 4am
watching John Lear tells all.  This morning I was watching a movie by
PilotsFor911Truth.  I look forward to the truth being released and
everyone knowing what happened.</p>
