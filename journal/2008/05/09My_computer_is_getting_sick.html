<p>My computer has been acting wonkily at times recently.  I'm sure it will end up needing to
replace the mainboard or some such, which is nice enough that it's under warranty, of course, but
sucks that I'll have to lose my machine for some days to get the work done.</p>

<p>Just now my mouse has stopped working properly.  The pointer moves, but clicks are ineffective,
and the dock doesn't even appear when the mouse hovers near it.  It's like the pointer is moving,
but in a separate plane from the computer.</p>
