<p>By the proverbial skin of backups, I found copies of the code that I'm supposed to put in place
today (not gonna happen today though)</p>

<p>This is stuff on which I was working in DECEMBER, and it got sidelined until someone else could
get the actual images created, and by that time code changes had taken over and SVN was involved
and these two programs never got into the loop.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was able to find them, but since they haven't been around for 5 months, they've missed
all sorts of updates, so I had to patch in some more code and stuff, but the worst part is even
with all that extra shtuff, I still can't get them to work, but not only that, I can't figure out
why they are not not working the way I think they should.  I'm getting errors where there should be
none, and getting nothing where there should be errors.  The weak thing is that this code *can't*
write errors to the screen because it's supposed to be writing images to the screen, so the headers
preclude any screen writing.  So I've got it writing to a log file in the background, but for some
reason it's not writing when I view the file embedded in an image tag, but it does write when I
view the file alone.</p>

<p>PLUS, the headers are supposed to be writing no-cache stuff, but those aren't working,</p>

<p>PLUS, it's not working *AT ALL* because I have not once been able to get it to write the files
to the browser, but I remember *clearly* having the code work perfectly (embedded it worked, not
embedded gave an error-image) and everything was great and then</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, please wait for our graphix guy to create the images...&quot;</p>

<p>FOR FIVE MONTHS and now wtf; nothing works and this sucks.</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>am going home.</p>
