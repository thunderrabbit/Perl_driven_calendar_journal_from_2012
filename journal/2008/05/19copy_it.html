<p>I wrote this at the Apple Store on the 19th, in my User:Rob space on <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">Uncle Cow's website</a>.</p>

<p>Today featured a meeting with my boss and his boss to say that the company seems to be going out of business, and they say they can pay me 2 more months, but after that it's 50/50, but I imagine it's more like I gotta get a new job pronto.

</p><p>They said no problem to take some time off and go to interviews and such.
</p><p>So now comes the game of figurin' out what I want to do next.
</p><p>Let's brainstorm some options:
</p>
<ol><li> get a teachin job
<ul><li> work at a big school (Gaba, Berlitz)
</li><li> work at PB for GET
</li><li> get my own students
</li><li> work in Shanghai (earthquake may have changed things, but job is all but guaranteed)
</li></ul>
</li><li> get an IT job

</li><li> get a way different job:
<ul><li> massage
</li><li> bartender (in an as yet unknown nonsmoking bar)
</li><li> Apple Store
</li></ul>
</li><li> modeling
</li><li> NHK
</li><li> work for OM
</li><li> big travel

<ul><li> SE Asia
</li><li> Africa
</li><li> India
</li></ul>
</li><li> make fly2.nu viable
</li><li> get a sugarmommy / daddy
</li><li> give up and go back to the US
</li><li> move to an English speakin' country
</li></ol>
<p>Actual plan from now:

</p>
<ol><li> * did reiki already
</li><li> meet up with Ami and chat with her about plans
</li><li> meditate
</li><li> write a Rob Update
</li><li> write to Kim
</li></ol>
<p>Ooops - that's one thing for which I'm late already.

HI Kim
</p><p>Interesting stuff on this end!
</p><p>I was supa happily busy during the weekend that I intended to write my monthly update and then hit the proverbial snooze on reminders until they all went quiet

</p><p>New project is mine alone: <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu" class="external free" title="http://u.cow.fly2.nu" rel="nofollow">http://u.cow.fly2.nu</a> to promote a stuffed pillow cow that I bought.  The website is a wiki, which allows anyone to upload images and write text about the images...  The basic idea is that all the pictures will be of the cow and his travels around the world.
</p><p>I'm close to having business cards made for the cow, and want to have postcard flyers made soon after that.
</p><p>But that's not main thing on my brain..
</p><p>Yesterday, at my full time IT job, we were informed that our company was likely to go our of business and they could pay us two more times (25 May and 25 June), but probably not past that.
</p><p>I'm feeling sadness and fear around this.  My plan is basically to start lookin' for other IT jobs, private students, maybe staff at Peace Boat.
</p><p>A first step as I see it is put my current job on my resume.</p>
