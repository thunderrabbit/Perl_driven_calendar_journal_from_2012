<p>Fred showed us (me, Dude, Jesse) a cool
movie: <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap080429.html">APOD: Airplane Flight Patterns over
the USA</a></p>

<p>And a bit later, Jesse was like,</p>

Oddly, what is at the yellow circle?
</pre>

<p>Fred and I looked at it for a while in chat, and Fred noticed the important clue: airplanes were
bouncing off the LHS of the movie!</p>

<p>Fred wrote back to the group:</p>

<pre>
my best guess is that it's japan(!).

i say that because flights bounce off the LHS of the movie!  (watch it
again, they really do.)  and the only flights that come to or from
that spot are from the LHS, indicating that it is not, in fact, near
the US (or flights from LA would go directly to it).  so i think that
it is a mirror image of japan, with the LHS of the screen acting as
the "mirror".

some flights, rob points out, leave "japan" and go away from the
"mirror"; perhaps they are flights heading to europe?

Fred and I have been watching and chatting; I agree with his
description below..  I overlayed google maps
<a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=32.10119,-157.148437&spn=71.753687,155.039063&z=3">http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=32.10119,-157.148437&spn=71.753687,155.039063&z=3</a>
on the thing and can pretty much exactly see that the Latitude of the
lower left and Jesse-circle spots match Latitude of Hawaii and Tokyo.
 It's harder to match Longitude, but roughly speaking (slightly
different scales involved), it matches the google map above as per
Fred's mirror description.

<p>But it seems Jesse has been looking at this even more...</p>

<p>He sent us a movie with the map overlayed, but I still think it's Japan that he circled.</p>

<p>Jesse wrote:</p>

<pre>
It isn't Hawaii! Hawaii is that brighter spot to the bottom left!
 
I put a map on top... remember this is not to scale...

<p>I'm replying:</p>

<pre>
Who said it was Hawaii?

The spot Jesse circled is Tokyo (reflected off the LHS of the page)

The brighter spot in the lower left is Hawaii, and Jesse's overlay map shows that exactly.

Near the beginning of the movie, watch between 22:22 and 13:00 the next day (according to the clock
in lower right hand side of the page) There are several flights that go from Hawaii to Japan, but
bounce off the LHS to get there.  Airplanes in real life don't bounce, so it must be a reflection..
basically the reflection conserves space, both screen space and storage space on the movie.
