<p>Just finished work, and am on the train now in Shibuya station before it heads home, well,
before it takes me most of the way to my home.</p>

<p>I got good shtuff done at work, from begining to end working on getting the award images 9they
call them seals) that are like, &quot;you're great!&quot; cause they reached &quot;level N&quot;
where N is between 1 and 5.</p>

<p>Oh, the issue I was having at first that was p ing me o: one of the include files had some extra
cariage returns at the bottom of the file, so the headers couldn't be sent, .  well, they were sent,
but not interpreted as such because of the preceding spacs.  I erased those few carriage returns,
added a coment saying they should stay gone, and it worked.  Well, it worked after I completed all
the changes I had started making while I was smashing through the code to find the problem.</p>

<p>The code is much nicer now; it was one big try/if/then/for-looping/catch extravaganza, but now it's got
functions, each of which are pretty easy to read.</p>

<p>Now it's still the same structure as above, but the for-loop is in a function, and all the bits
between the ifs and thens are in functions.  anyway who cares.  I'm glad I got it working, though I
can't say it's the nicest code I've ever crafted.</p>

<p>In other news,...</p>
