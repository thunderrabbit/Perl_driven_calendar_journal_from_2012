<p>Yumiko added the Japanese I wanted to the picture of Uncle Cow in a bamboo clump.  I'm a bit
concerned that the proportions are going to be off, but fuckit; gotta start somewheres.  This is my
homework for I-group; I'm supposed to get the proofs in to Kinko's before Monday.</p>

<p>Jimmy da Magnet got the English side all perfected; I wonder if he'd do the Japanese one as
well, especially considering (1) it took a while to do; (2) the work might be redone by whoever
prints it (3) it's the weekend (4) the card proportions may be wonky.</p>

<p>I just need to be careful *not* to let these concerns keep me from getting *anything* done on
it; perhaps I can just take them both to Kinkos (*) and be done with it.</p>

<p>(*) Travis always says, &quot;not to Kinko's; they're too expensive,&quot; but then I haven't
looked for any alternatives.</p>

<p>Actually I have; I looked at the cards at Pink Cow, hoping to find a &quot;printed by&quot; note
on the bottom of one, but didn't find such.</p>
