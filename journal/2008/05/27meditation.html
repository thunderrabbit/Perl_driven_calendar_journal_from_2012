<p>Great time at meditation tonight; I actually am super glad with how it worked out because I had
been asked to do an interview via Skype at 6pm, but that's exactly when I had to leave for
meditation... but I told them no: either earlier or omorrow, and we had the interview at 5pm, so
I'm really thankful for that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I paired up with Kevin for the first eye0contact meditation, and he noticed when I
finally released and he was like, &quot;your heart just opened,&quot; and I
thought, <em>is <b>that</b> what that was?</em> and I was able to maintain the feeling, so that was
cool.</p>

<p>Paired with Romi after that and felt really open, which was also great, etc.</p>

<p>I called ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó on the way out at 9pm, but good for him he had gone home for the evening.  I
let go of work and joined Kevin, Helma, Amy, and Denise at the local Indian restaurant for
conversations that whizzed through two hours like nothiin'.  Amazing meditation stories from Helma
and Kevin; amazing travel stories  from the other two.</p>
