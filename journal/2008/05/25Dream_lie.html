<p class="dream">I found a perfectly new unused skateboard on the top of a box on the front desk of
some reception area.  I decided to take it for a ride, and ractice my skateboarding skillz (of
which I have basically very few).  I  took one pass through the cafeteria, jumping over all the low
spots on the floor, and then took another pass and jumped over all the speedbumps on the floor.</p>

<p class="dream">Then back to the reception area where iI planned to retrun the board, I found that
the box was gone!  I noted the wear marks on the board were quite visible in green, yellow, red
spots appearing from under the painted surface that had been scraped off with my feet. (*)</p>

<p class="dream">I thought about just casually leaving the skatboard beside the desk, but then
decided to admit I had grabbed.  &quot;Do you know whose board this is?&quot; I asked a kid near
the desk.  he was like, &quot;yeah; that's Cory's.&quot; and I was like, &quot;cool; Ifoud it in
the top of a box, and wanted to bring it back.&quot;  and the kid continued, &quot;yeah, he was
going to throw it away,&quot;</p>

<p>(here comes the lie)</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;I know; I couldn't believe it, I was like, &quot;what's this
box?&quot; and the guy was like, &quot;it's trash.&quot; and I was like, &quot;what????&quot; so I
knew I had to use it.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The kid goes, &quot;that's cool.  Cory said you should join the club..&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And I go, &quot;what club?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;The skateboarding club, of course!&quot;</p>

<p>(*) I definitely saw color in this dream.</p>
