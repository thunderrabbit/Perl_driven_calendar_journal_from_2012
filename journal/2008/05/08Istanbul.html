<p>Confronted my post office nemesis when sending the card to Ayse's mom.  I made the mistake of
thinking there was kanji for the Japanese word for Turkey.  So I didn't write it on the card; I was
just going to ask them the kanji and write it down.</p>

<p>So when she saw the card, she was like blah blah blah, meaning &quot;where is this
going?&quot;</p>

<p>And I go 「トルコ」</p>

<p>And she goes, 「東京？」(*)</p>

<p>Um, no.  「トルコ。」and I tried some other variants that couldn't be right, and then was like,
「英語で&quot;Turkey&quot;」</p>

<p>And she was like, &quot;______&quot; with a blank look, so I came from a different angle.</p>

<p>イッスタンブルと言う町のくにはなんとういう？」</p>

<p>More blank looks, but she turned around and asked the group, who also didn't know.</p>

<p>One of them did think of it and was like, 「トルコ」</p>

<p>And I was like, 「あぁ、だからトルコと言ってた。」</p>

<p>She looked it up in the book and I saw the カタカナ.  Dammit.  There's no kanji; it's just トルコ。</p>

<p>(*) I can appreciate on one level that she at least understood I might be saying Tokyo.</p>
