<p>Just arrived  in my seat on Tokyu Toyoko line from Shibuya heading to my crib.  Got UCow under
the omputer kinda upside down between my legs.</p>

<p>Oh, I know.. I got a photo of a yong woman wearing a bright yellow jacket and one pink and one
blue sock.  I never saw her face, and chose not to stalk her into the Yamanote platform to try and
get a pic of her with UCow; I can go wander around Shibuya...  Hmmm speaking of which, I went a few
days ago to the free hugs area to see if I could rustle up some pictures of shiny happy people
hugging cow, but no huggers were there.  I didn't think at the time to hold UCow up over my head,
but I think the joke would be lost on the crowd.  If there were a bunch of FREE HUGS signs, and a
cow among them, then i think it would work, but.</p>

<p>Jen can touchtype on her phone.  I was pretty shocked when i saw that, but I dunno why; I'm
touch typing now (prolly with hella errors, but still).  Sh was just tappin' away and I was like,
&quot;wtf?&quot; and realized she wasn't just randomly hittin' buttons, but actually spellling
words an shit.</p>

<p>Never seen anyone els do that.</p>

<p>Hey I think this is the same train I came to Shibuya on this morning.  at least if it's not,
then at least two trains have the exact same brand name advertised in *all* the advertising slots
on the train.</p>

<p>I wonder how much it would cost to advertise a carriage worth on the train.  I wonder if UCow
would like to be advertised that way.</p>

<p>I think I'll just start with flyers in Pink Cow (no animal-entendre intended).</p>

<p>Speakin of flyers, the dude from Metropolis who I met a couple days ago is a graphic artist
there, and when I asked him, he offered to make some postcard sized flyers.  But then later he said
he was too busy.  Not too much later, but a day later.  I was just in touch with Jimmy da Magnet
via hearing the Beastie Boys line and already thinking of Jimmy yesterday, so I guess I should ask
if *he* can do the flyer, but actually fuck dat; i can do it myself.  I'm pretty sure alls I need
to do is crop UCow out of a red background (used Ami's towel) which I imagine will be easy enough,
once I figure out how to make The Gimp do it.</p>

<p>Once side of the card will show UCow jumping over Earth as taken from the moon, and on the other
side of the card (the Japaense side), he'll be chillin' with some bamboo.  (pic is already on his
site).  I'm pretty impressed with the idea.  The English side will essentially reference The Cow
Jumped Over the Moon, and the Japanese picture side is vertical, so I can write the kanji vertically
in old Japanese style.  Sweet.  I'm thinkin' for now I'll make the postcards be just the same design
as the business cards, but 4 times bigger.</p>

<p>I told my I-group that I'd get the proofs done and turned in to Kinko's by the next meeting, so
I still have some time, but I need to allocate some to make this happen.</p>

<p>I think I'll do it tonight over a bowl of choco corn flakes.  It couldn't be *that* hard to crop
UCow out and blank out the background!</p>

<p>Oh, also today I downloaded Google Gears onto my Flock browser.  Haven't &quot;done&quot;
anything with it, but I have it.  (Not supported on FF 3.0 yet)</p>
