<p>During the week I had folded big sheets, cut in half different sheets, collated books with other
sheets, and helped hang some curtains.</p>

<p>Tonight I helped collate the cut sheets with other sheets and put them in the big folded sheets,
carry boxes of collated books + sheets downstairs, and saw the big curtain bundle go down as
well.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;I've touched all this stuff!&quot;</p>

<p>Except for some voting boxes that I hadn't, but.</p>

<p>Fun times, and quite busy.  I'm beginning to remember people's names more effectively, too!</p>
