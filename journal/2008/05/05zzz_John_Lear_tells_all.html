<p>I just watched this must-watch video.</p>

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1904583671241989001">John Lear tells all - part 1 of 4</a></p>

<p>Most interesting for me: the planes on Airplane Day were holograms.</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone watches vids when I recommend them.</p>
