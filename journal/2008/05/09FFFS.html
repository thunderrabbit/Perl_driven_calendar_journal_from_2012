<p>Played FriendsForSale on Facebook this morning a bit.  Francois and I are beginning to make a bit
of money.  Francois moreso, it seems; he has been more accepted by a pretty popular / rich crowd
featuring Erin Cahill with about $4M +.</p>

<p>I have been focusing on my favorite owner Sabrina Mendoza, who is now worth probably 10 times
what I first paid for her.  Mark Ramm and I had been buying her back and forth over weeks on end,
and just recently someone bought her from me for just under $400K.  so I bought her back
immediately.  We'll see how that goes.</p>

<p>Too bad it's all just a game and keeping me from focusing on things that I think are
&quot;important&quot;!  Like journal / painting / writing / fly2.nu.</p>

<p>Man, fuck FFS; those things have got to have priority.</p>
