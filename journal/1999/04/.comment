<br>I would love to hear the result!<br>

The coolest mix I've done is play Miranda July's "Medical Wonder" over Francis Dhomont's _Frankenstein Symphony_. That probably means nothing to you...<br>
Basically "Medical Wonder" is a dramatic story told from the point of view of a researcher who has gone mad after an experiment. _Frankenstein Symphony_ is a CD of crazy sounds chopped up from various symphonies. I combined the two, using Dhomont to amplify the drama in "Medical Wonder." I loved the result!
