<p>Paul and Jackie drove Lin and me home from Nicole and Danny's Happy New Year house party.  Mykey
was there with his wife Margarite (sp), and they both played Silent Football with me and Jackie.
To make things interesting we had three black holes in the game.  To make things interesting and
quicker, we didn't explain the rules to Margarite, who learned the game very quickly anyway, and
became &quot;Ms Margarite learns very quickly,&quot; upon Jackie's suggestion.</p>

<p>Also at the party were Nicole and Danny (not surprising since it's their house), plus Mykey's
brother Nathan (?) and his wife who's six months pregnant and whose name I've forgotten.</p>
