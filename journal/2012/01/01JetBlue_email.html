HI!

This email is for your tech department.

I imagine you'd get more people actually using your allegedly convenient WebCheckIn if you give a
useful link in the email below.  You capitalize the letters of "WebCheckIn" to make it all fancy,
but you don't actually make it useful for us.

When creating this email, you have *all* of my information, so you should make the WebCheckIn link
go directly to my PDF file.  Why should I enter my name and airport?  You have a long dropdown of
airports that isn't scalable as your list of routes increases.  Why should I select a button that
tells if I'm entering a Confirmation Number or a TrueBlue number?  You have the information when you
sent me the email.  Just give me a link.

You should make the links have my information or a hashed key that you lookup.  Then you can do your
statistics (which you collect on Flight Status (source=empreflight_flightstatus)) but not on
WebCheckIn...  You're losing valuable data by not tracking the WebCheckIn links) *and* you could
make the system more useful for users.

Same thing for checking their flight status. If you made the "flight status" link useful, people
would use it.  As it is below, I have to think, which isn't what you want users of your system to
do.  I have to think, "where am I flying?"  "which drop down is the FROM?" "which dropdown is the
TO?"  "what's the name of the airport?"  etc etc.  You have a huge table of airports that also isn't
scalable as your list of routes increases.  You've already got a smaller font to squeeze them all
into your javascript popup.  What about people without javascript?

You've done *tons* of work on making a system that can let us choose seats, legroom, bags, etc etc,
so why not add a single table lookup to let us easily use the system?

I'd love a thoughtful reply, but if you don't have time, just send the "thanks for your feedback"
message.  Please don't send the "here's how to use our system" message.

    happy new year!
     - Rob
