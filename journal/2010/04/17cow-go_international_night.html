<p>Cow-Go international night tonight at The Pink Cow featured a rock band called Planetarium, with
lead vocalist drummer, which seems rare to me.  Emiko and I went after yoga class, and met Mariko
and Kayo (?), plus two other women whose names I never heard, and then Akina's friend Fabian from
Germany.  He and I laughed a lot.  Nice times.</p>
