<p>Last night Soness was getting ready for her trip when I wanted to go to sleep, so I went
upstairs and slept on Anna Bananna's bed, expecting to move downstairs once they came up.</p>

<p>I heard them say something, and realized it was Soness saying &quot;Rob was on top of me,&quot;
which (in physical reality) I certainly was not.  I couldn't figure out what she was talking about
and then I realized they were both already in Soness's bed, and Soness had just woken up from a
dream!  Wowowow so surprised they had just let me sleep and not sent me downstairs.  After everyone
realized what was up, I was like, &quot;aight I'm going to sleep downstairs,&quot; and they go,
&quot;no you can stay,&quot; so I conked out again, still on Bananna's bed.</p>

<p>Woke up at 5:45am and went downstaris for meditation (difficult to stay awake) and then Skype
with Sally.</p>

<p>Soness said I was on top of her giving her a healing.  Hmmm.  Fair enough, though I don't recall
it.</p>

<p>Sally said that she had just gotten a Thai massage, and they guy crawled up on top of her.
Maybe it was a future me crawled up on Soness to give her a Thai massage.</p>
