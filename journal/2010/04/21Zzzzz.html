<p>Got home last night and made dinner for Soness and I.  Veggie soup, our specialty, but not quite
as well made this time as usually..  For some reason the veggies weren't as well cooked as normal.
I guess the lower heat made a difference.</p>

<p>Soness got home tired and hungry so she had some soup as well.  Then we both kinda flopped over
on the floor and zonked out with the light on.  zzzzzzz</p>
