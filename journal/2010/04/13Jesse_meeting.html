<p>Met Jesse for Cow-Go meeting at The Pink Cow.  He got tied up with meeting peeps for new
apartment so was two hours late.  Traci gently yelled at him and I met with him.  Soness came in to
The Pink Cow during our meeting so we were wayyy late getting out because she can't leave without
talking to everyone (exaggeration) in the restaurant.</p>
