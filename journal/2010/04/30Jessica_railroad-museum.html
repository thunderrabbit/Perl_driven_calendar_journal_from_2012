<p>Went to the Railroad Museum with Jessica today, for what we plan to be our last time to hang out
before I go to Thailand.  I took a couple of pictures near the beginning of our trip and uploaded
them with the hashtag #railroad-museum.jp cause that's the URL of their website.  In the museum are
several full size old school locomotives and passenger cars some of which we can touch, board, sit
down, play with the disabled switches and levers.  A couple of trains we may not even touch, notably
the Emporer's train from I'll guess 60 years ago, each car of which was in its own glass room.</p>

<p>The upper floor overlooks the train cars, and has a button we can press to raise or lower the
pantograph (thing that smurfs electricity from the overhead line) on one of the trains.</p>

<p>On the other end of the museum, things are even more explicitly hands-on.  There are hourly
training sessions on how to close the doors at a station (including checking clock, turning on and
off the all-aboard music, getting on the train, closing the door, looking for the all-clear, closing
the doors, looking for the light to be off, and tell the driver to go!), how to run the green car
ticket window, and maybe how to run the ticket machines.</p>

<p>Next to that area was a set of computers on tables for which we could sign up for a 30 minute
session on &quot;designing&quot; our own train (picture).  The choices were quite limited on each
page, and not fully-easy to go back and forth, but we chose body type, shape of windows, paint
color, stripe or not, number of doors, background image, etc.  I may remember to scan mine and
upload it.</p>

<p>All of that was on the ground floor.  On the 2nd and 3rd floors was the train version of a kids'
science museum, where everything was hands-on, and lights and moving things and spinning things,
all related to trains.</p>

<p>On the &quot;roof floor&quot; we had a view of the surrounding area, including a couple of
trains on one side, and shinkansen line on the other.  We actually had come up right at the right
time to see two shinkansen go by.  Only problem is that though there are outdoor windows to keep us
on the roof, the windows' supports limit the view of the trains.</p>

<p>Stayed until the place closed, and had ice cream across the street at MiniStop (where we had had
lunch, avoiding the crowds and prices in the museum).  Then headed to Omiya for proper dinner (at
CoCoIchi curry shop).</p>

<p>It was Jessica's first time to eat there; she got om-rice curry of normal spicyness, and I got
vegetable curry for sweet tooths.  Mine was yum, and hers was a bit spicy, but we both enjoyed
everything.  At the very end of that, as we had been talking about different things, including Lisa,
I was like, &quot;yah, I think I like Lisa.&quot;</p>

<p>In Ikebukuro we hugged for a long time, our last time to hug before I go to Thailand for 3
months.  Bittersweet.</p>
