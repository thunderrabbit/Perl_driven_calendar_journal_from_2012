<p>Chatted with Anna Bananna this morning after sleeping in.  I had a bit of a dream that I can't
quite recall now.  I may start writing them down again.</p>

<p>I meditated as per usual, but this time while sitting in the corner that Soness specifically set
up for meditation.  I don't know that it was any easier to be meditative there, but it certainly
wasn't any more difficult.</p>
