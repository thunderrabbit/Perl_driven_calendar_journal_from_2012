<p>Left home around noon thirty and got to the office at 1:45 to clean out my desk.  But first I
played online, trying to learn git a bit.  I had downloaded lilURL from sourceforge, and made some
updates.  Wanted to upload those to github, but (fortunately) had the brainstorm that perhaps, just
perhaps, someone had already uploaded it there.  And someone had.  I
<a href="http://help.github.com/forking/">forked</a> <a href="http://github.com/gbremer/lilurl">gbremer's copy of lilURL</a>
to <a href="http://github.com/thunderrabbit/lilurl">thunderrabbit's copy of lilURL</a>, and then
did something like the following:</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git@github.com:thunderrabbit/lilurl.git
</pre>

<p>But I kept getting publickey denied errors (or something), and then I realized I needed to
<a href="http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect">generate a public key</a> on my server.</p>

<p>Did that, told github the public key part, and the clone worked perfectly.</p>

<pre>
$ git clone git@github.com:thunderrabbit/lilurl.git
</pre>

<p>Made my changes, (actually they were already made in a different folder, so I just copied them
over) and then did</p>

<pre>
$ git add *
</pre>

<p>In the /trunk directory to add all the files.</p>

<p>Then</p>

<pre>
$ git commit
</pre>

<p>And that was it! (*)</p>

<p>(*) I think.</p>
