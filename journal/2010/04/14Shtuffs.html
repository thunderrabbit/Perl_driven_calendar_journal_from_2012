<p class="date">9:08pm JST Wednesday 14 April 2010 (day 14630)</p>

<p>Today Bananna got her cast off!  I went with her to the local hospital and got her sorted enough
to sit in the right waiting area.  We chatted about 15 minutes or so about this hospital vs other
hospitals she's visited during this wrist break adventure and then she was like, &quot;you should
probably go,&quot; and I left.</p>

<p>Got home and I got a call from the bicycle parking lot; two days ago, I had told the guy I would
be there today at 6:30, but after reflection, I thought he must have meant tomorrow because I
thought he also said it was the day we can get the monthly passes for bike parking (which is
tomorrow).  So anyway, he called me all, &quot;I'll be here another hour and a half,&quot; and I was
like, &quot;eep!  I'll be there in ten minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>So, they're going to arrange a specific spot for TJ Bike; the dates are exactly layed out, and
they'll give me a pass for the first few days in May!  Coooool.  I didn't ask about the last 24 days
in August after I return, but I'll talk to them on 2 May, when I can get the special 3 month pass.
Nice nice nice.</p>

<p>Went back to find Bananna in the same chair in the waiting room.  She hadn't seen the doctor yet,
but as the room was mostly cleared out, it seemed likely that she'd be called soon.  She was, and I
took pictures of the brace removal.  The doctor spoke English quite well, so my limited translation
skills were of no use.  Even so, really neat to meet him cause he'd been traveling around the world
for 10 years, learning different languages: French, Spanish, German, English before landing back in
Japan. Anna and I were like, &quot;cooool!!!&quot; when we heard his story.</p>

<p>Back to the house together and said Bye to Soness who had been getting ready for the final
Artist's Way class after chatting with Yuji about The Pink Hoop, and the new video they made while
she was in NZ.</p>

<p>Anna headed upstairs and then possibly to the beach.  I headed to Shimachu to get</p>

<ul>
<li>40 meters of wire</li>
<li>a light for shed</li>
<li>double switch box</li>
<li>triple plug outlet</li>
<li>waterproof tape</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not really proud of the waterproof tape purchase; it's going to be my solution for plugging
the water fountain in to the electrical wire that I'll run out into the garden.  I need something
small, waterproof, durable... an outdoor plug might be good, but I have no way to affix it to the
concrete wall next to the garden.</p>

<p>Ah crap I didn't get an end for the cord.  Need to get that.</p>

<p>Got back to the house, and installed the three plug outlet where the two plug outlet had been,
BUT there was no easy way for me to connect the new electrical wire.  There's another wire already
using the back of the outlet to get power.  Hmmm. We just need to rewire the entire house!!</p>

<p>After that, Anna helped me pack up the TV for Alfonzo and the leg massager for Sorcha and we
carried those to 7-11 to be sent to their respective new owners.  Then zoom zoom zoom I had to run
out the door to meet Emiko at 7pm for her lesson.</p>

<p>Lesson with Emiko featured chatting with Sho, a new teacher with Cow-Go who's attending Temple
University.  Emiko is studying for an accounting test in July, so we found Sho to hopefully give her
someone who can help her study.  She turned him down, though, basically because he had learned
accounting in English. (Though he's fluent in normal Japanese, he's not fluent in accounting
Japanese.)</p>

<p>After the lesson, Emiko walked with me to Tokyo station, by way of a book store where I got a 
メトロポリス magazine for Bananna.  I hugged Emiko at the bottom of the stairs for the Shonan Liner
that left the station at 9:00pm.</p>

<p>Right now it's 9:41pm, and we're stopping next at Fujisawa, then Tsujido, and then Chigasaki.</p>
