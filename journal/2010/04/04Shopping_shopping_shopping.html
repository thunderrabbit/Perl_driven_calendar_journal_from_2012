<p>Today, though I slept in late, was pretty busy going out getting shtuffs for the house: boxes to
send unused stuff to various places, TP and cat litter to go down one specific place, and bird
food which will end up all over the place.</p>

<p>Then headed to Shimachu to get some replacement roll of bamboo fence, and ended up ordering a
water fountain as well!  It's plastic, but looks like rock, and just the perfect size for the space
Soness wanted to be a water fountain in the garden.  Nice!</p>

<p>Also got the blue bike brake repaired, but the guy was like, &quot;yeah, your whole bike needs to
be repaired,&quot; pointing out the rusty holes in various places of the frame.  Hmm.  Soness
requested the same size as the yellow bike, so I'll bring ol' yeller by the shop to specify the
size.</p>

<p>Finally got home, then replaced the section of fence that was basically destroyed by recent high
winds, sat down for a break while texting with Soness on her way home, and headed to the station
when she asked if I could get her some medicine.  Turns out that made me late enough to go ahead and
wait for her train's arrival, so I saw her for about 5 minutes before my train left at 7:20.</p>

<p>She had a rough day today, esp. considering she has laryngitis as well.  She plans to go in to
work tomorrow, but.... to what end?</p>
