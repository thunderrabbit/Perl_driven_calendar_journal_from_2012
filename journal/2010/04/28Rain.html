<p>When it "rains" in Tokyo, and all the umbrellas come out, I usually say "that's not rain; that's what I'd call humidity."</p>

<p>In Houston, when it rains, it's like boom. Rain. An inch per hour. Two inches per hour.  I don't remember zackly, but it doesn't mess around.  It sprays ＊down＊.</p>

<p>(now I'll grant Houston isn't the rainiest place on earth, but Tokyo isn't even the rainiest place in some deserts.)</p>

<p>Usually.</p>

<p>Today, it's raining.  Streets are filled with 6 inches (15cm) of water around my house. It's gushing down. I even brought an umbrella!</p>

<p>TJ Bike and I love it!  We were singing new rain songs as his tires cut through six inches of water and utterly drenched my feet (*). I held fast to handlebar and umbrella in common Japanese fashion (forget bike safety; we can do anything with our free hands while riding a bike) and wove deftly between the people weaving between puddles or in some cases, standing next to puddles that covered the entire street for blocks.</p>

<p>(* I've been wearing sandals each day since July)</p>

<p>I got to the bicycle parking lot to park TJ Bike with a huge smile on my face as we surfed through the lake-street out front.  There were several customers, I thought, considering the rain, but going to work is tiptop important here.</p>

<p>I parked TJ Bike on the first level and headed out into the liquid entertainment.  As I walked directly through the flooded street, my flipfloppy sandals flipped water up onto the backs of my legs. Took the sandals off and barefoot through the water I splashed to the station.</p>

<p>Got to the very last 25 meters where a street adjacent the entrance acts as a wind tunnel and many umbrellas give their lives in service.  I knew that from experience, plus, I could clearly see the wall of rain pouring down, versus a wall of rain blowing sideways. Closed my umbrella and ran barefoot across the street mock-yelling champion!!! as umbrellas around me flipped inside out.</p>

<p>The stairs were crowded with people looking out into the rain, and as I went up, I heard a student say to his friend, "cool! Barefoot!" (すごい裸足だ!) I smiled to myself a 

<p>I'm actually surprised the trains were running right on time; the rain was that effective, but the trains moreso.  I got a ticket for the 8:05 and we're now about to arrive in Shibuya ( takes that long to write on my iPhone).  No backpack + computer today.  iPhone in plastic bag sealed and dry.  And now it's pretty much dry outside, not even what I'd call humid.</p>

<p>Thank you fun rainy day!!!</p>
