<p>Last year, I took a beginner shiatsu course from the Kimura Institute (one room in Kimura-san's
apartment), and thought it was okay, but not great instruction.  I didn't get any detailed
correction from Kimura-san; he just worked on me, and I worked on him, then paid him 5000 yen or so
per lesson.  Upon finishing the course, he seemed supportive of my future endeavors in shiatsu
practice, though I didn't plan to go back to him for any more non-instruction.</p>

<p>Today, I called him, &quot;hey this is Rob Nugen; I'm trying to get an education visa to study
Thai massage in Thailand so I need a recommendation from a school in Japan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay; if you draft it, I will sign it,&quot; he agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;Great!  Do you have a school letterhead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but I have a rubber stamp with the school's name and address.&quot;</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, I'll call you back to let you know if that's enough.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked the woman at Thai embassy if his stamp was good enough for the letter; he doesn't have
letterhead for the school.  No problem, she said.</p>

<p>I called Kimura-san back, &quot;they said it's no problem,&quot; then, thinking of logistics,
&quot;do you have a printer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, I was thinking I might be able to email you a document and it would be um, okay to
print it there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you say your name was?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rob Nugen.  First name is R-O-B; last name is N-U-G-E-N.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And when did you say you came to the school?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm not so good with questions involving when things happened.  &quot;Um, last year, I think,
um, like summer?  We met each Thursday at 10am.  It was just a 10 hour course; it's okay if you
don't remember,&quot; I said, slightly heartbroken that he didn't remember.</p>

<p>He flipped through his documentation and found it, &quot;ah, you said you are a programmer,
right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; I'm a programmer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't show that you finished the course, you didn't say anything so I wasn't
sure..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you ask me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Thai embassy asked for a recommendation from a school, and yours is the only school
I've attended in Japan, [plus it's associated with healing.  So I thought...]&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you call someone else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;よろしくおn。。 「ガン」&quot;  == &quot;thank you ver　[CLICK]&quot; and he hung up before I could finish the word.  Sigh.</p>
