<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>I've been working as a programmer in Tokyo for the past couple of years, with a bit of time off
to make cash in clinical drug trials.  I recently finished a contract, and have some time available
for my next adventure / educational experience, studying Thai massage in Thailand!  Since high
school, I've enjoyed giving massages at least as much as receiving them, and have just
&quot;recently&quot; gotten into the idea that I could actually earn some money doing something that
I love to do.  I have often used &quot;lack of credentials&quot; (e.g. diploma) as a reason I
couldn't do it, so I'm going to get that now, just like a feather for Dumbo.  hahaha!!</p>

<p>My tickets are for 7 May to 7 August, and I plan to remain in Japan at least long enough to meet
Colleenie Beanie in October!  (There; I've told the whole world, so you *have* to come!!)</p>

<p>I've been in Japan just over 7 years now, and though I don't want to &quot;stay forever,&quot; I
can't help but notice that if I stay just 3 more years, I can get permanent residency and have a
choice of either country, with going through the hassle of getting visas and stuff!  Interesting
motivation, to say the least.  :-)</p>

<p>For the past year, I've been living in Chez Soness, home of my friend Soness down by the beach.
It's certainly a nice area, though a bit far (1 hour and 950 yen) to get to my favorite hangout (The
Pink Cow in Shibuya).  In the past year, Soness has been working super hard to get her businesses
going, and I'm beginning to see what it might take for me to do the same.  But can I?  Really?
Me???</p>

<p>And so I'm going to Thailand to get some training in a new aspect of massage.  9 weeks of classes
are planned, though the school (Sunshine Massage School in Chiang Mai) seems quite flexible, with
instruction given to individual students at a higher or lower level, as needed.</p>

<p>Last year saw me study Shiatsu for 10 hours of instruction, which I use a little bit when doing
my &quot;freestyle healing&quot;  Two years ago I learned reiki, which I use a lot, especially when
giving people massages.</p>
