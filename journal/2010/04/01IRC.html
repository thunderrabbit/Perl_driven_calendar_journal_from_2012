<p>I just found that emacs has an IRC client built in.  Sweet sweet emacs, how I miss your lovely
ways!  Well, I uses emacs every time I write a journal entry, but I *don't* use emacs for actual
programming anymore.  I've switched to various IDEs for that, currently NetBeans.  I wonder if emacs
could actually handle all the shiz I need, though: svn, (eventually (*) git), well dang, I know it
can do SVN, but oh man why haven't I been using emacs???</p>

<p>Okay, so anyway, this entry is about irc, iirc.  (there, I did it; am I happy now?  (yes!))  I
was reading <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2010/01/break-my-concentration-and-i-b.html">Break My
Concentration and I Break Your Kneecaps</a> and was like, &quot;dood, emacs can do irc?&quot; and
flipped over to emacs and a few M-x irc RET keystrokes later, I'm using IRC!  Wow!</p>

<p>In university I was always unimpressed with the kids who used IRC for MUDDs or whatever they
called them, and I had heard stories about how IRC peeps hate new users, so I was like, &quot;fuck
dat&quot; and never got into it.  But hey, what's to say I can't start now?</p>

<p>/list showed a list of 994 channels, through which I searched for the word &quot;chat&quot;  I
found a couple such channels, but no activity when I /joined them, so I lost interest pretty
quickly.  Plus I had to work.</p>
