<p>Skyped with Sally this morning!  So great to hear she's doing so well.  She said she was just
finishing her morning meditation, and is on Day 8 of that.  Awesome.  She asked how my recent stuff
has been going, and I told her about Jessica and our walk last week.  Sally was like, &quot;your
patience has paid off!&quot; and I got, &quot;and only one year to go!!&quot;  It's only going to
prove or disprove that we can stick it out.</p>

<p>Sally's job will likely move to Melbourne (Sallyy says Melbun now), but she's pretty much
decided *not* to go with it.  She just got herslf sorted in Adelaide, so why move now?</p>
