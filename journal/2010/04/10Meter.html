<p>Just now, my train stopped in Oofuna.  The doors didn't open like normal.  The announcer was
like, &quot;uh just one moment, the train is going to move again,&quot; and then moved the train
backward one (1) meter (m) and then opened the doors.</p>

<p>Now, I would gladly walk the entire length of the train to see both ends of this process in
progress.  I'm relatively familiar with what the driver and conductor do at each stop.  On the
train, I know what signals the driver looks for, and who/what turns which signals on.  (I haven't
been able to definitely identify all the signals the driver looks for *outside* the train.)</p>

<p>But I've *never* seen the driver and conductor in the process of moving the train backward one
meter after overshooting the stop.</p>

<p>Here are some anecdotes for you, memories for me:</p>

<p>I'm sitting here with my back against the wall opposite the driver, who's sitting (on a chair)
with his back to the same wall.  The train stopped slowly at first and then abruptly, and the doors
didn't open.  People outside the train were watching expectantly as I heard buzzing in the cockpit,
which is a simple squawk system the driver and conductor can use to wake each other up.  It *seemed*
to me that the buzzes were long-short-short and then repeated.  The announcer was like, &quot;uh
sorry something something,&quot; and then &quot;okay the train is going to move again,&quot; and I
thought, &quot;backwards or forwards?&quot; cause I don't think she specified.  The train went
backwards about one meter and stopped.  The announcer goes, &quot;okay the doors on the right will
open&quot; where the right meant the side of the train on the right when one faces the direction
the train *should* have been going, but, strictly speaking, were on the left when considering the
direction the train had just traveled (one meter).  The doors opened; people got on; I started
writing this entry.</p>

<p>Everything since then has been perfectly normal.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<p>Who decides the train needs to go backward?</p>

<p>How far off the mark is acceptable?</p>

<p>Who drove the train backward?</p>

<p>How much switch flipping is required to drive the train backward one meter vs driving the train
&quot;backward&quot; the entire route?</p>
