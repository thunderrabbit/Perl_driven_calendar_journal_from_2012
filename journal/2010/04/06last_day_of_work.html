<p>Yesterday was my last day of work!  It seems sooo far away now; almost like I can barely remember
what I did.  Let's see......  I wrote a little page and then, oh I remember, just testing testing
testing the site, looking for any problems.  Soo boring!  But I did find a few issues, four of which
were pretty important, and two of which I was able to correct.</p>
