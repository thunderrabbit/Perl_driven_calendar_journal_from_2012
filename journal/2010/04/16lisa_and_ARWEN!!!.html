<p>Last night ARWEN!!! brought Lisa to vegan buffet night.  Oh man I was like googoo over her eyes
and smile.  Everyone at the table laughed at me, but I really enjoyed talking to Lisa about her
spiritual growth experiences with avatars, kundalini, and direct communication with the divine.
I look forward to chatting with her more.</p>

<p>Hiten was like, &quot;man, I hear wedding bells!&quot; and I was like, &quot;perhaps next
lifetime hahahah!&quot; and then explained, &quot;we just have a nice spiritual connection.&quot;</p>
