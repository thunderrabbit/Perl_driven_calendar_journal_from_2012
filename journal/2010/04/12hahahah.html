<p>After tucking Soness in to bed last night, Bananna and I were chatting about movies.  I told her
about the hilarious scene from Master of Disguise where he's like, &quot;my first kiss!&quot; after
miss-timing his first kiss... hahahahahaha!!!  Downloaded the movie and we three may watch it
tonight.</p>

<p>Bananna and I recreated the scene a bit, just for fun.</p>
