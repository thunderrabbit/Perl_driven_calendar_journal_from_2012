<p>Today, my first full day off in a while, I enjoyed a great day with Jessica, wandering around
Chigasaki beach area, then going to Pacific Deli, and then going to Enoshima where we took the
elevator up to the top of the tower, took the stairs to the bottom of the tower, and then went to
the very back of the island where there are some fun rocks and waves splooshing around them.
Perfect for a picnic on a hot day.   I might go back there again if I get another day off before
heading out to Thailand.</p>

<p>Rode the train with her back to Tokyo and we joked about it being scandalous!  hahahah I guess
it was a location joke.  :-)</p>
