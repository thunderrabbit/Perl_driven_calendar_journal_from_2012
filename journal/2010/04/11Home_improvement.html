<p>During daylight hours today (after sleeping through at least 5 of them (except for helping
Bananna get up at 6:30)) I basically worked around Chez Soness.  Successfully completed: installing
a cute shelf above her refrigerator on which I placed her modem and wireless router.  This was
intended to reduce the number of wires stringing from her kitchen to her desk.  To keep electrical
wire clutter down as well, I bought an outlet box and tapped into the electrical wire running where
I put the shelf.</p>

<p>Interesting that I didn't take any pictures of the process.  Hmm!</p>

<p>I also looked into planting the water fountain in the garden.  This will require running an
electrical wire from the shed (? (it's the nearest electrical outlet on her property)) to the
fountain, and therefore require keeping the connection dry, even though it'll be in a garden with
water hoses spraying, rain falling, earthworms squirming, etc.</p>

<p>When looking at where I can connect the outlet, the *easiest* solution would be to simply plug in
an extension cord to the light that's dangling from its electrical wire attached to the top of the
shed.  That wouldn't be really pretty, nor stable, though.</p>

<p>Sooooo, I'm considering extending the wiring to add a light switch on the wall near the door
(instead of pulling a string which can be hard to find in the dark).  The easiest way for me to
think about it would effectively triple the number of wires: current wires running from the current
light location to the switch where they'd be split into two more pairs: one set running back to the
light, and one set running to the garden fountain.</p>

<p>But it seems like there should be a way to limit the number of wires between the light and the
switch.  I guess confoozion comes from needing the fountain and light to be switched independently;
I can't figure out how to do that, *and* have the switch away from the light, *and* limit the number
of wires.</p>
