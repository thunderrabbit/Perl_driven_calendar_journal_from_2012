<p>I enjoyed today's yoga class more than any previous class.  Paola had us all doing different
poses, many of which were relaxation poses designed to stretch the bits that need stretching.  For
me, that's neck, shoulder, and quads.  We did the neck and shoulders pretty well, but haven't found
a good relaxation pose to stretch the quads.</p>

<p>Emiko didn't squeak much today, perhaps because she's getting much stronger and more flexible.  Nice.</p>

<p>Even nicer was the amazing meal Paola produced out of fresh produce, including wasabi root, soft
tofu, kelp, tomato, watercrest(?), cucumber, cheese, potatoes, giant beans, and not as fresh, but
still delicious, canned salmon.</p>

<p>So yummy and so lucky!!!</p>

<p>Emiko, bless her, went to English school (not the school where I met her) instead of eating the
full course meal.  It was partially at my recommendation because she has about 30 tickets saved up
at that school, with 4 new ones coming every month.  I was like, &quot;go to school!&quot; so she
can use up her tickets and quit, cause that's what she wants to do.</p>
