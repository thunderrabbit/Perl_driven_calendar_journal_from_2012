<p>After meditation,</p>

<p>I checked the fountain this morning, and its hose had come loose from the thing.  The water level
was really low, so I bet it sprayed water outside the tank until it couldn't spray hard enough to
get water outside the tank... Fortunately, there was enough water inside for the pump to not burn
out... but we definitely should get a water float switch installed for it.</p>

<p>I don't know if Shimachu sells those, though.  Don't know what they're called in English, much
less in Japanese, but I bet I can draw a picture and sort it out.</p>
