HI Sweet Bananna Pie!!

I tucked Soness in to bed last night, came downstairs and just cried because you weren't there.  I
didn't let Soness hear me, but I probably could have wailed.

You're really a treasure in the world, and I'm glad you find all the right people and krazie dogs.
Could you sleep last night?  I hope the interview went well today.  :-)

Good luck with the heat and humidity!  If it gets unbearable for you, perhaps I'll come down as
well!  I love the heat heat heat heat!!!  and humid humid humid humidity!  whoooooo!!!

Thank you for illuminating parts of me that are difficult for me to see.
