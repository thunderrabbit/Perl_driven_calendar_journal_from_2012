<p>I arrived home last night at 1am.  Soness was like, &quot;so what's up?&quot; but I could tell
she wasn't actually asking that.  She called me on dating while I'm supposedly not dating, first
with Jessica and now two consecutive days with Lisa.  Soness tried to listen, but mostly talked,
then went to bed.  I tried to maintain awareness of my magnitude, and lovingly reiki the whole
situation, but mostly felt sadness and shame.</p>

<p>I cried a bit last night, and cried a lot more this morning and Soness was supportive in her
way, not really letting me cry, but trying to be there for me.</p>

<p>We're pretty much better now.  She says she's 100%; I'm like 95%.</p>
