<p>Bananna got the 10:44am train to Yokohama; she's probably boarded her plane now and is on her
way to Okinawa.  This morning I cried a bit on the way back from dropping her off at the station,
actually at the platform, actually on the train, just a couple seconds from when the doors closed.
We had had a good morning of watching her parents' video download to her computer, posting a box
via SEAMAIL to Jersey, and not having a camera to take pictures of ourselves in the magnifying
glasses at the post office.</p>

<p>I suggested we could go back there on the way to the station, but it kinda got too late so I
figured we could just make glasses with our fingers like this and take a picture.  We walked hand
in hand to the station; I really like Bananna.  She made glasses eyes at me when the doors were
closing on the train.  She's so cute and funny!!</p>
