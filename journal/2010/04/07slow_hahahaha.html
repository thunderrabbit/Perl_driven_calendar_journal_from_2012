<p>D'oh!!  I was too slow getting off the train in Chigasaki, and the doors closed before I could
get off.  I forgot I had to get my big bag out of the overhead bin.  hahhahahhaa!!</p>

<p>So now I'm headed to the next station, which I think is actually the next next station.  But no
extra charge, and no worries.</p>
