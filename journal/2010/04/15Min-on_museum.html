<p>Jessica and I went to the Min-On Musical Instrument museum on Thursday.  We slowly visited the
different rooms, enjoying the performances and nice conversation.  We were just fun and fine and
silly and joking; it was great!!  This was the first day we didn't talk about anything
&quot;heavy;&quot; it was all light and fun conversation.</p>

<p>We went to lunch at a nearby non-smoking restaurant, enjoying Japanese style yummies (I forgot
what we ordered) and more conversation.</p>

<p>Soness called just as we were finishing lunch to tell me her throat was hurting again.  I
encouraged her to cancel her lessons (she had) and sleep (she planned to).  She asked if I could
bring home some chicken soup on my way home, but did not ask me to leave any earlier than
planned.</p>

<p>Jessica expressed concern and said she'd be &quot;too worried about Soness&quot; to relaxedly
hang out with me.  I took a few moments to explain that for many years I had tried to fulfill the
slightest whim of women around me, and slowly come to resent that I wasn't taking care of myself,
and therefore resent them.  I'm trying hard to take care of myself and not lose my needs in the
presence of requests from women.  &quot;But,&quot; I said, &quot;Soness is feeling bad, and I'm
going to go home to make sure she sleeps.&quot;</p>

<p>Jessica agreed, but later texted &quot;I wish I were selfish enough to ask you please don't
leave me :-)&quot;</p>

<p>I go, &quot;I like you all the more because you did not ask.&quot;</p>

<p>After a bit, though, things went all screwy.  I wanted to make plans for our next outing, and
mentioned that I couldn't meet her Sunday night because I'm going to a movie with Emiko (I had
already told Jessica this, and already told her that we're not dating (neither me and Emiko nor me
and Jessica are dating)).  But this time when I texted it, it seems to have made her not want to meet
me at all.</p>

<p>wtf?</p>
