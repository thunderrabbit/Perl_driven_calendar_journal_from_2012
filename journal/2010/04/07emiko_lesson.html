<p>Emiko was ten minutes late for our <del>7:30</del> <ins>8pm</ins> lesson, but unfortunately, to
make my train, I had to leave at 9pm.  She was like, &quot;no worries,&quot; because, well, she was
late, and I had finished checking all her homework anyway.  Plus we hang out a lot so she certainly
gets 10 minutes' worth of English with me on a regular basis.</p>
