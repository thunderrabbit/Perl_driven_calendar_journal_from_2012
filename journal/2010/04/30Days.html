<p>Wow.  Days have gone by without me having written.  I know a lot of time has been spent chillin'
at home, and a lot of time has been spent chillin' with Lisa.  A little time has been spent gettin'
my visa, and a bit more time has been spent meetin' people for Cow-Go.</p>

<p>Yesterday Soness led a workshop on visionboarding at Ben's Cafe in Takadanobaba.  I largely
enjoyed it, and had some suggestions for how she can make it better next time.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the visualization most.  I hadn't previously done anything like it.

<p>Also, I ran on the beach yesterday, and came back without injuries.</p>

<p>Ohhh  I know what I need to post in here, a story about the rain which I wrote on my iPhone and
have posted to FB but not here.</p>

<p>This morning I had a dream</p>

<p class="dream">On some sort of game show, or recording something for TV where I got to surf along
a conveyor belt, pretending to have my eyes closed.  The first time, my eyes were open, so I
naturally kinda directed where I went.  The second time I actually closed my eyes, but I had the
path memorized so I was still able to direct my path.</p>
