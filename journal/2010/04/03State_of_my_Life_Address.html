<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I recently went for a walk with Jessica.  Nice day.</p></li>

<li><p>Anna Bananna has rejoined Soness and I at Chez Soness!  So nice to have her smiling face and
lovely hand decorated bananas.</p></li>

<li><p>I have just about finished my contract working with Nate and Alfonzo.  It was extended a few
times, but looks like this is it.</p></li>

<li><p>Fortunately, I have a bit of savings with which I plan to go to Thailand (perhaps) for a 6
or 12 week thai massage course.</p></li>

<li><p>No girlfriend, but really interested in Jessica at the moment.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is my white MacBook.  I have a template for SOMLs and the idea for the computer
part was to write a bit about it on my wiki, and just link to that edit from here, but I've been
writings SOMLs on the train, during which I do not have web access.</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone is Little Blue Monkey, and its battery is dead.  I recently put all the apps with
icons of single letters onto one page in ABC order.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm looking forward to having a bit of a reprieve from work.  I think I'ma go to the beach
tomorrow; I *might* go to ultimate in the afternoon.</p></li>

<li><p>Considering learning Japanese a bit more; it's about time, or not.</p></li>

<li><p>robnugen.com is still my website, and it still needs a good way to display pictures.</p></li>

<li><p>I was considering doing a TJ Bike trek, and taking a stuffed animal with me, yet to be
purchased, and yet to be named.  The idea would be to give the animal a twitter account and possibly
a website and let the community name him/her and then give him/her away via lottery at the
end.</p></li>

<li><p>But Soness pointed out that it's a bit of a distraction from my real desire to make money
via massage.  Why not go get some training?</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really made any art recently, but my maze book is still under consideration.</p></li>

<li><p>Had a nice little earthquake recently, but nothing came of it.</p></li>

<li><p>Cherry blossoms are out in full bloom right now in Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really talked with my dad or mom recently, but have been in touch with Fred.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been enjoying yoga with Paola at <a href="http://yogasan.net/">yogasan</a> most
Saturdays.  Emiko, Jon and I are basically the class (Jon is Paola's husband.)</p></li>

<li><p>I've been meditating semi-consistently for 20 minutes each morning.  I plan to be more
consistent once my job situation is lessened.</p></li>
