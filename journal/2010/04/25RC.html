<p>Going to RC now, to support Tatiana in leading the intro workshop.  I hope it goes well for her.</p>

<p>There were like 5 new people in the class, including a man Tatiana had met, and 4 people that
Emma knew.  I learned a good bit from Tatiana when she emailed me later, explaining how even though
some people laugh during their discharge, we shouldn't laugh with them, cause it's very likely a
laugh covering pain, like the guy said in French Quarter of New Orleans, &quot;I laugh to keep from
cryin'.&quot;</p>
