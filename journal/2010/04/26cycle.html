<p>In my men's group tonight, a man said about me, &quot;I see you set boundaries or tests for
yourself, that are extremely difficult to maintain, and you're bound to fail them.  When you judge
that you have failed this test, that generates the feeling of shame in your life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The test is not you; the judgement of failure is not you; the shame is not you.  You
created all of those.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know where the cycle started, but I've seen you felt shame in your life around
perceived sexual addiction, so you set up a test to prove something to yourself, and when you fail
it, you're feel shame anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The action is not the problem.  The judgement of failure and resulting feeling of shame is
the problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you obsess about something, you lose prana, or life energy.&quot;</p>
