<p>Right *now* I am on my way home (with a boquet of flowers!!) after cleaning out my desk at work
for a temporary 3 month absence while I attend massage school in Thailand.  Actually 4 months while
I chill in Chigs during April and then go to Thailand...  Super thanks to Anna Bananna who found
perfect tickets for me on ebooking.com (I think that's the URL) for like 587 British pounds.  Dat's
a lot better than what Number 1 Travel quoted at 150,000 yen.</p>

<p>Also right now, I have no other journal entries for today or the previous two days except for
zzzzz on Monday.  I'm going to try to catch up a bit now.</p>
