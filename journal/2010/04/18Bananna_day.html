<p>Over the past 20 hours, Bananna and I enjoyed nice chillin' at home, featuring _I Am Legend_
featuring Will Smith last night, snacks featuring hummus today, and productivity featuring her video
and my installing wire in the shed, featuring Bananna's help.</p>

<p>We went to the beach just a bit ago, visiting Tanakasan for a bit, and then rock hopping after
that.  So happy that she said she got some great pictures!</p>
