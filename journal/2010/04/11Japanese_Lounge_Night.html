<p>Went to Japanese Lounge Night last night, arriving around 7:30 (I think).  I sat at Emiko's table
with her mates from English school: 一人, Akinari, Akiko, and Shin.  They had just finished eating,
so were unable to help eat my burrito.  I chowed it methodically, while answering the basic
questions we get asked, &quot;where are you from?&quot; and &quot;what Japanese food do you
like?&quot; taking a brief break to go play a shoulder slung taiko drum on stage.  After I finished
drumming, I finished the burrito, and then Emiko gave me the rest of their salad, of which a
significant portion remained.  As I was finishing off the salad, using knife and fork as taught in
the US, 一人 was like, 「すごい、フォクは上手ですね。」, or &quot;wow; you're so good at using a
fork!&quot; And I laughed it off, and then he goes on to the most ridiculous question that
westerners get asked all the time, &quot;can you use chopsticks?&quot; (( hint to anyone who has
considered asking this question: don't ask. ))  I took it a step further and claimed to not know
what &quot;chopsticks&quot; were.  Emiko assured them in Japanese that not only was I quite capable
of handling chopsticks, but I carry three sets of &quot;my hashi&quot; in my backpack.  (While
normally true, (and I would have been happy to break them out to promote the idea that things can
be <em>reused</em>) instead of throwing out new chopsticks at each meal, ironically last night I
*wasn't* carrying them, as I had dumped my bag contents a few days earlier, and not sorted through
everything.)</p>

<p>Japanese Lounge Night did *not* feature Kumiya, who normally organizes it.  The lineup seemed to
have a different flavor of performers than most nights, including comedy ukelele, and a comedy
shamisen.  However, Toshi played one of my favorite shamisen songs, so I asked if he had a CD; he'll
send me one from his teacher in the mail.</p>

<p>I chatted with Emiko a bit; Akiko gave her a flyer for an annual (?) event where single men in
Chiba invite single women from Tokyo to come out for a night to find themselves a partner.  Wow.</p>

<p>I'll see Emiko on Wednesday during our normal English lesson timeslot, though this time I'll
introduce Sho, who may help teach her some accounting while I'm in Thailand.</p>
