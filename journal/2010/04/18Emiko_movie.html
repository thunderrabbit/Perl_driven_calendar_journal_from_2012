<p>Emiko and I met in Kawasaki for dinner at an &quot;American&quot; buffet (corn on pizza and fake
ice cream proved we weren't in the US.  Also, no Dr Pepper in the soda machine!)  But the pizza was
yummy and other things yummy, plus mango pudding was probably yummy, but I forgot to get some.</p>

<p>Went to 109 in Lazona adjacent Kawasaki station for _Alice in Wonderland_ starring Anne Hathaway
as my favorite character in the movie.  I liked the scenes where she was all, <em>ewww!</em> while
otherwise being so gracious and flowing.  Emiko's favorite character was the mad hatter.  Her
favorite scene was Alice slaying the Jabberwocky, whereas my favorite scene was the cheshire cat in
the hat posing for the mad hatter at his would be beheading.</p>

<p>YK was there for a movie meetup.  We talked to him a bit at the end.  He didn't really like it,
saying he wanted more witty dialogue and blood from Tim Burton, but guessed that Disney got its
family sensitive hands on it.</p>
