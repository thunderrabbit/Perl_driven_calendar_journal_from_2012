<p>On the train now headed to Shibuya to meet Lisa.</p>

<p class="date">10:02pm JST Wednesday 21 April 2010 (day 14637)</p>

<p>I left a bit later than planned; I asked her to move our meeting to 2pm instead of 1:30.  After
installing the water fountain, I wanted to do things like &quot;shower&quot; and &quot;change
clothes,&quot; so I took a bit of extra time to do that.</p>

<p>Met her and her friend Helen near the big Starbucks in Shibuya and then we were going to go to
Denmark Cafe, but it's closed.  Sigh.  I forgot to take a picture.  Ate at a nearby Italian place
which was yummy.  I had three cheese pizza.  Lisa ordered a salad, and Helen did the same, but with
soup as well.  We talked about our interest in skydiving (mutual), bungy jumping (me and Lisa),
roller coasters (me and Lisa), and spinning rides (me and Helen). Interesting that they each had a
something that they wouldn't do, but were willing to sky dive.</p>

<p>Headed out once the place got smokey, and Helen had to go shopping so Lisa and I went to Yoyogi
Park (for her first time).  Sat by the fountains talking about deeper topics about how/why I don't
respect myself as much as I think would be good.  Also talked about not loving myself and another
thing or too; I forget what.</p>

<p>She's been reading _A Course in Miracles_, and said one of the things it suggested was becoming
conscious of one's magnitude.  I tried that a bit, and was like, &quot;let's go for a walk!&quot;
took of my shoes and we went.  Came to a tree which we spent some time hugging; she asked if I
could feel its energy.  Not really.  She asked for support in me feeling its energy, and I got a
whiff of a viewpoint like from above a large tree.  Some kids joined us and ran around the tree a
bit, but were called away by parental units.</p>

<p>Lisa goes, &quot;do you enjoy children?&quot; and I was like &quot;I could be better...&quot;
and she suggested I/we have a play day and just do anything we want to do.  Could be nice!</p>

<p>Continued walking and I found a tree to climb for a moment (while Lisa smoked (eewww)) and then
continued more until we had circumnavigated the park.</p>

<p>Then to Meiji Jingu and enjoyed the ever deepening peaceful energy there.</p>

<p>Afterward, we sat on the wall outside the nearby performance hall, looking out over Yamanote Line
as the sky prepared for nighttime.  On the wall, I was able to verbally support her, pointing out
some beliefs she held that might not be serving her optimally.  Hugs were exchanged, and I ran
along the wall for a bit of free expression, while she expressed the part of herself that likes to
smoke.  (eewww!)</p>
