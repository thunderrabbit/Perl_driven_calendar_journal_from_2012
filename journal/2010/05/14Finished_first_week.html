<p>finished first week of classes.  Shara and I were going to go to dinner after having hung out
with Christine at the pool.  Shara didn't show up where we said we'd meet, though I waited an hour.
I bought some nice pics and some raw honey, though.</p>

Today finishes the first week of classes for us at Sunshine Massage School. For the hour+
practice massage at the end of today and the end of yesterday, I partnered with Shara,
taking particular care of her lower back, which features a pinched nerve from an old
injury.

Shara joined Christine and I at the pool today, and I enjoyed sitting on the side with
them in the water.  Shara had put her legs up on the side to do some water assisted
sit-ups, so I hopped out to hold her feet down. Christine did the same, but not where I
could easily reach her, so I didn't.  Hmmm

We discussed plans for tonight; Christine had been all talking about doing to the White
Rose, which has a public sauna every other Friday night where people apparently go to meet
other people and give each other body scrubs.  Really???  Wow, but I wanted her to go and
verify this claim before I went.

Shara was like let's go! (to White Rose) but also like, but first let's go get some
food. I was down for food, and then Christine was all, actually I don't want to go tonight
after all.

So Shara and I are going to eat dinner and then she's going to meet some friends after
that.  I told Christine there's no chance I'm going out with Shara's friends tonight.
Well okay maybe 2 percent chance, but it's really rally unlikely.

We decided to meet at 7:30 at Starbucks in the night market. I've been here since 7:22,
but no sign of her yet. It's 7:50 by my clock now.

On the way here, I found a shop that sells honey.  Christine and I had just been talking
about nutrition (mostly she talked, and I went wow!) and she said raw honey is better for
us, and explained the difference between raw and processed honey. So anyway I bought some
raw honey for 200 Baht.

Walled a bit further and saw a photo that caught my attention. It was of a baby elephant
enjoying a good shower, and I was like that's so cute!  Then saw a couple others I liked
and bought three photos.  Nice.

Kinda weird cause I never buy photos.  I mean seriously, I think this is the first time
I've bought any, except when with a significant female other.  </pre>
