<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm in Thailand!  In Chiang Mai, more precisely..  I am living in room 1111 of Imm Eco, a
lovely lodge set in a garden of trees and fairies, with a large lovely pool in the back, and free
wifi in my room and free buffet breakfast every morning from 7am to 10am.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm studying Thai massage; classes are daily from 9am to 4pm at Sunshine Massage School.
This is my first (of three?) beginner's classes that I plan to take in 9 weeks of training here.  My
fellow students are Cyrille, a French guy who's worked as a sports medicine guy for a while, Sylvia,
Italian, with cool tattos, Anne Gaelle, French, Shara, a Canadian from Vancouver, who's quite
attractive with nice smile and bod, and Christine, from Deleware, who lives in the room next to me
(1110), with whom I've enjoyed long conversations about her work/studies at Omega School (?)..  and
she's a UU!  Wow!</p></li>

<li><p>My finances seem okay.  I have paid for all my classes, and all my air tickets, I think, and
still had equivalent of $3000 USD left in my Japanese bank.  Even eating out for most meals, that
should be enough to cover this extra fun lifestyle.  Did I mention I'm paying $300 per month for
this room at Imm Eco?</p></li>

<li><p>No girlfriend at the moment.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is set to super-zoom mode cause I have my contacts out right now.  I'll take a
picture of the screen.</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone is in airplane mode, and has been essentially since I left the airport in Narita
149 hours ago.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access through Imm Eco is fast and free, but hrequires entering a password after I
take a break from the internets for a bit.</p></li>

<li><p>No roommate</p></li>

<li><p>I-group numbers had been low, and they cancelled the last meeting on 10 May.  Not sure if
they'll have more while I'm (and so many others are) gone</p></li>

<li><p>I've considered studying Thai a bit, but haven't done much yet..</p></li>

<li><p>Recently did a bit of program tweaking to my Rob Updates code, and am considering dumping it
for a PHP solution called PHP List.  But if I do that, I'll want to add in auto-purging email
addresses, and I'm not yet sure how easy that will be.programming</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really listened to music since I got here.</p></li>

<li><p>If I lost my computer now, I'd lose this entry and a couple of other journal entries, but
pretty much have all the pictures on my iPhone.</p></li>

<li><p>The weather here is hot and humid and I love it.  40 degrees C is the high scheduled for
tomorrow.  THe lows are like 27 degrees.  I love it love it love it.</p></li>

<li><p>Am going to Honkers for the weekend of 21 - 23 for a wokrshop Soness bought me.  I hope I
like it more than I think I might.  After that, I plan to go to Koh Phi Phi to see Page from PB
instead of missing a day of the next beginner class.</p></li>

<li><p>Am considering doing a Vipassana 10 day course in early July cause the school seems to have
a break in advanced classes at that time.</p></li></ol>
