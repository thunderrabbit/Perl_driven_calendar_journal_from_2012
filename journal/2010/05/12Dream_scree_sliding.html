<p class="dream">Met a man who told me about his job situation; he felt sad after having been laid
off from his job and though he hesitated, finally cried and cried while hugging me telling him no
worries mate, just cry.  We had been staying in a building during a party in one area and I had been
looking for a restroom that was available.  I knew an area that was little used in the building;
there was a long line in the busy area.  A woman came up to me all asking basically if I wanted to
hook up with her but I explained my mission, though couldn't really explain the WHY of my mission,
but she went away anyway.  I remembered after we were talking that Wende would come
home soon so I wanted to turn off the lights that weren't being used and clean up the place a bit,
but then it was 1:30 am and she hadn't come home.</p>

<p class="dream">Heard about the possibility of working at a company where I had previously worked,
and we and a couple other guys went over at like 4:30pm and they were thinking they might rock
in there and see the place, but I was pretty sure they wouldn't let us in without an appointment.
I was right as when we arrived my friend was going &quot;no problem!&quot; a bit too loudly to the boss guy who was
looking out a window on the second floor going, &quot;um, we've got a business to run&quot; and
then to me, &quot;yah there's work available tomorrow if you want,&quot; and I was like,
&quot;great!&quot; and he said, &quot;oh, I was talking to the other guy.&quot; so I said,
&quot;great!&quot; and went to the hill to slide down.</p>

<p class="dream">The hill was sandy about 45 degree angle, but if we set our feet just right, we
could slide down it, and had enough speed to keep sliding along the flat part at the bottom.  A guy
in front of me reached his hand back to give me a boost forward so I was like, &quot;whoo!&quot; and
jumped over a hump in the sand.  Then I reached back and gave a forward boost to a woman who was
catching up to me sliding.  She took a little tumble and I apologized, but she was like, &quot;no
that was all me&quot; and we kept sliding.  I started to announce the results of the race, like,
&quot;oh here he comes across the finish line ladies and gentlemen this is incredible!&quot; and
they were like, &quot;no actually, the finish line is up there.&quot; and I started pushing myself
forward with my hands ad announced, &quot;he's cheating, but still got the lead,&quot; and they
were like, &quot;that's not cheating..&quot; so I kept at it and actually won according to the
painted line with writing next to it, &quot;full body across the line 10 points&quot; and then  two
circles on the ground that said &quot;breasts 360 points&quot;, and I thought those should be past
the line if that's the full body line, but didn't worry about it  the girl arrived just a bit
after me and I wanted to catch her and smooch her, but I didn't.</p>
