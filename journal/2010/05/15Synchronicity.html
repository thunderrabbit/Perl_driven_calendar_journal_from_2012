<p>Today, being a lovely day for lazy activities, found Christine and I at the pool after
breakfast.  I brought A Course in Miracles, and she brought a couple of books, including _Seven
Laws of Money_, which I loaned to her.</p>

<p>It got too warm for Christine around 11:40am, and I came in about an hour later.  Was reading a
bit about forgiveness, and I realized I hadn't fully forgiven Shara for not showing up last night.
I called her and she was like, &quot;where were you???&quot; and I go, &quot;I was there! Where were
you??&quot; and it turns out I was at the wrong Starbucks!  Yes, she had specified the other, but
because I didn't know there were two, I ignored the specification she had made.  Sigh.  My bad.</p>

<p>The synchronicity is that she had just gotten up 10 minutes before I called, having been out
until 4am.</p>
