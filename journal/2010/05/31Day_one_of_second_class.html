<p>Dude!  This time it's a class of all dudes.  :-)  Already in the room when I arrived at 8:30 was
Wayne, from OZ.  Then Shawn and Shane came in.  Shawn is well-bearded and from Alaska, while Shane
is well-Hawaiian and lives in Las Vegas.  They're apparently good friends, and Shawn suggested to
Shane that he try out the class.</p>

<p>Scott came in just after Air was like, &quot;I hope no one else comes,&quot; and &quot;oh no;
you're all guys!&quot; and explained, &quot;you're heavy!&quot;  He had come in on the night bus
from Bangkok, barely got any sleep on the bus, and was pretty much dead tired during the class.</p>

<p>When I first saw Shane, I was like, &quot;hmm!&quot; cause he's kinda big, and I wasn't sure how
easily I'd be able to put him into a back arch.  Getting to talk to him, I found really exciting
connections around healing and spirituality.  After I did reiki on his foot, he was like,
&quot;wow, your reiki symbol is really beautiful,&quot; and began to draw it out for me.  At first
I was like, &quot;whut&quot; because the symbols are secret, but the symbol he drew wasn't the one
I visualize; he drew a far more complex thing that, gosh, I don't know, so I was like, &quot;wow!
I'm glad you are able to see something!&quot;  He was quite complimentary, saying he could see a
column of light from my crown chakra and stuff.  Sweet.</p>

<p>I realized that I really like people who genuinely compliment me on things (esp. things I'd like
to have noticed).  Maybe I should make a bigger effort to compliment people.</p>

<p>The sequence of moves was super easy for me to remember.  I visualized myself doing them in
Tokyo for lots of people.</p>
