<p>&quot;How's Chiang Mai?&quot;</p>

<p>It's hot and awesome.</p>

<p>High temperature for the next several days:</p>

<p>39, 37, 39, 38 (C)</p>

<p>and I love it!!</p>

<p>I moved from one guest house to another cause it's a lot closer to my school, plus has a garden,
swimming pool, free breakfast, and much nicer facilities all around.  yay!</p>

<p>Guess what room number I'm in?</p>

<p>1111</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>It's totally been great!  I've got a fantastic place with pool and
garden, just five minutes' walk from my school, which is equally
great, for its own reasons.</p>

<p>Have my own room with a locked cabinet (my lock) where I keep my
computer when I'm not here.  The only crime so far is being charged
tourist prices, but I'm okay with that.</p>

<p>I'm optimally set in Chiang Mai; living in a private room at Imm Eco, featuring a large clean
pool, breakfast buffet in the on-site restaurant, and all set in a large garden.  Really a lot like
paradise, I believe!  Just $9 per night.  :-)  It's 5 minutes' walk from my school, and I've been
enjoying the classes well.   :-)</p>

travels.</p>
