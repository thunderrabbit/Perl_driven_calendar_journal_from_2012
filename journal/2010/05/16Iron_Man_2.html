<p>Iron Man 2 was better than it could have been, partially because it was longer than it could have
been.  Had to ignore the ridiculous computer h@x0r crap and the ridiculous particle accelerator, but
other than that, solid science.  (not).  It's a bit more of a guy movie than a chick flick, but we
knew that already.</p>
