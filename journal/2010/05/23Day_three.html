<p>Second best part about today: Debbie used the word &quot;honky&quot; to mean Hong Kong Dollars.
She would say stuff like, &quot;that's 350 honky&quot; or ask &quot;what's that in honky?&quot;</p>

<p>Best part about today: after Chris described Billionaire Bootcamp, he was like, &quot;I'll give a
special prize to the first two people who buy the course,&quot; and I made the decision to
attend, <em>ran</em> top speed back to the back to buy the ticket, he kept trying to get a second
person to go back, but no one was willing to move.  He goes, &quot;going once, going
twice.... really?  Okay gone..  Rob, I'm going to give you the trip to Egypt, and I'm paying.
That's the course called &quot;Billionaire Adventure Club.&quot;  Wow!  Wow!  I'm going back to
Egypt, and this time, get to really tour the pyramids!  And this time get to cruise the Nile!  And
this time..  wow wow wow!!!  FREE!</p>
