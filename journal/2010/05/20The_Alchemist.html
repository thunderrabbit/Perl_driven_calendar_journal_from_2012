<p>Read several pages of The Alchemist, basically read the story of caravan to the oasis and the
boy meeting The Alchemist after 500 guys tried to attack the oasis.</p>

<p>pretty good book, though I don't know if it's mind altering any more than Celestine Prophecy or
Way of the Peaceful Warrior.</p>
