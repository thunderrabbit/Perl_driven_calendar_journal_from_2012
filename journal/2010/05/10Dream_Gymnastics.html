<p class="dream">In a gym with trampoline and TV in one side showing what was being broadcast in
the gym, a fog started to come in trhrough the window and some of the girls were like,
&quot;wha???&quot; and I went to the window to see what was coausing it, but couldn't tell.  I
checked the TV screen and the air around me to see if they looked equally foggy, and then I
realized that the trampoline would possibly be all wet.  I could hear my voice on TV as I said,
&quot;the trampoline is probably wet&quot; ans ran over to it.  Jumped on fro some slippery fun.
It was wet at first, but soon dried out as I was doing flips and stuff.  One guy was trying to mess
me up by holding the mat in a weird way, but I could feel him messing with it, and told him to
stop.  Then I noticed some of the springs were off so I was fixing them when I woke up.</p>
