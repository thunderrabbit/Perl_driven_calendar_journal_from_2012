Hi mate!!

I've been having fun for sure in Chiang Mai.  I'm living in a lodge called Imm Eco, with great
swimming pool, free breakfast and wifi for $9 per night.  Massage school is 5 minutes' walk away,
and class is great with cool classmates from around the world.

Just tonight we went to the riverside bar for bevvies, though I didn't stay for the after party!  hahaha

Tonight was also a flower festival, with crowds of people and great food.  Coolest thing was seeing
them pour tea into a tube and wheel it up on ropes to pour it out on top of the Buddha hill.  Quite
interesting "tea ceremony!"  Too bad we didn't have an interpreter or guide.

I saw some flowers I thought you would like, but nothing reallllly like omg wowwwww.  just lots and
lotsa flowers.

   Love Love Love
    - Rob!!!
