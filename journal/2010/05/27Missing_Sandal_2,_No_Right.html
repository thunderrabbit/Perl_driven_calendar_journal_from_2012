<p>Hmmm!  One of my sandals is missing!  This time it's the right sandal that seems to have taken a
walk.  I bet a dog has found it delicious.</p>

<p>I came back from breakfast, and *both* sandals were missing!  <em>Cue mystery music!</em></p>

<p>Went to the front desk and they produced a plastic bag with the dog chew toys that <em>I</em>
thought were my sandals.  They apologized and said they'd buy me some new ones.  Wow!</p>

<p>Nit said she'd go get some, so I asked if I could go with her to make sure they fit.  I know
better than she about the size of my big feet.</p>
