<p>Leaving the dining area after breakfast, Christine and I saw some motorcycles with red flags
driven by people wearing red shirts, often featuring passengers with red shirts, and signs with Thai
lettering.  It's Sunday in Chiang Mai, and the people are peacefully parade-protesting a stolen
election.</p>

<p>I took several pictures, and have uploaded some to FB.</p>
