<p>Woke up, emptied my inbox of email from May, then called Shara to see if she could meet for
lunch.  We met near Tai Pe gate and ate at the restaurant where the owner gave me free bottled
water yesterday on my way walking home from the airport.</p>

<p>Shara had had a little accident on a motorbike, scraping up her leg in a few places, primarily
on the top of her ankle.  Luckily she was wearing a helmet, cause she scuffed that up as well,
instead of her head.</p>

<p>Lunch was yummy.</p>

<p>We took a red taxi truck to her house (not far away) and then I walked home (kinda far away).
It was fun because it rained pretty effectively.  Nice warm rain.  yay!!!</p>
