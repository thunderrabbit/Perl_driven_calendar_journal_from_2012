<p class="dream">I was supposed to be introducing a band at their first big show, and while I had
seen them perform plenty of times, I knew each band member by name and their hobbies and cats and
dogs I  was like, &quot;it's rt's really fantastic to know these guys before they blew up and to be
here tonight at their first big show, and the crowd started building up with excitement, &quot;are
you ready?  and I started counting up &quot;one!  two! three! four! five! six! seven! &quot; and
thinking to myself ah man I can't remember tehir name!!!  and I was trying to read the guys' shirt
in front of me, but it was wrinkled under just at the band's name, I knew the last word of their
name was five, so I just showuted something muffled as the crowd's roar was roaring what waht
FIVE!!!&quot; and then gave the mic to someone else, as we wre all right in the audiecnce giving
testimonials.  and once I knew the name, I was like, &quot;aight rewind the dream a bit&quot; and
went back to the counting part, &quot;please welcome, count it down with me ONE TWO FUNK FORCE
FIVE!!&quot;
 and it was almost as if I had gotten it right the first time.   Nice.</p>
