<p>Heard some cat feet running around upstairs and was like &quot;wha?&quot; and then heard cat
hollers upstars and said, &quot;naw,&quot; and zoomed upstairs two steps at a time, but by then the
invader cat had already ran back outside.</p>

<p>My heartrate was like GONG GONG GONG GONG and then eased back down slowly as I hugged Soness a
bit and she said, &quot;you were so fast&quot; and &quot;thank you for waking up; you never wake
up,&quot; which makes me wonder what events she thinks should have woken me up.  I said, &quot;when
it comes to protectin' my family...&quot; but didn't finish the sentence.  I just continued the
thought process I had on the way up the stairs, &quot;how am/would I break up a <em>cat</em> fight?&quot;</p>
