<p>&quot;Today&quot; I walked home from the airport, and got pretty overheated / dehydrated.  I mean
not *bad* like dying in the middle of the Sahara, but I was super hot + headachey + diarrheaey
&quot;last night,&quot; and by last night I mean a few or more hours ago, so I bought eight 500 ml
bottles of Gatorade, drank two of them, then took a cold shower until I was no longer hot.  Then I
slowly warmed up the water until it was a bit warm, but felt comfortable cause I wanted my body to
not try to make more heat to counteract the cold water.</p>

<p>Awake now and feel basically normal, but about to zzzzzz.</p>
