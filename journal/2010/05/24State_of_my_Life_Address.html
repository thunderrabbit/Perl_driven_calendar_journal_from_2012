<p>I forgot to write this while in Hong Kong, but I will include some elements from there.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>In Hong Kong for the weekend, I attended Chris Howard's _Breakthrough to Success_, with a
&quot;yeah right&quot; attitude going in, and a &quot;whoohoo!&quot; attitude going out.</p></li>

<li><p>While in Hong Kong, I lived near TST (Tsim Sha Tsu) on the MTR (train system) in a building
called Chung King Mansions.  The place was dominated by foreigners, who seemed to enjoy staying up
late at night in the mall area on lower levels of the building, even when shops were closed.</p></li>

<li><p>I met several peeps during the conference, and will probably stay in touch with about 5 peeps at
first and then 1 or 2.</p></li>

<li><p>Basically I went in with negative attitude because of my learned biases against NLP, Neuro
Linguistic Programming.</p>

<p>(( I first heard about it from Tony Robbins, in his books that I never really
&quot;got&quot; and never finished.  I met Helma, a good-crazy woman who said she's perceived NLP
practioners as a bit &quot;odd.&quot; I then met Tamara, a quirky beautiful hearted woman who was an
NLP practicioner.  Never learned anything from her, though I asked her if she could tell me a bit
about it.  Then I met Lisa, a beautiful and beautiful hearted woman who I really &lt;3, and who has
done NLP, and said she didn't really like the results / usage of it. ))</p>

<p>During the weekend, either they NLPed my ass without me noticing, or I decided I could do the
stuff not including NLP and that would be great, and then decided, <em>well I might as well do it all
because I don't have to use NLP if I don't like it, and perhaps I can guard against it a bit more
effectively if I actually know some techniques</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>During the event, I ran around the room and stood on my chair (not simultaneously), and
yelled really loud (my throat is sore now), mostly because I was bored and was trying to stay awake
and also because I wanted to &quot;follow directions&quot; of playing at Level 10.</p></li>

<li><p>Several of the women I met seemed to be making googly eyes at me like I could hook up with
them if I wanted.  Was it because I was running around and standing on my chair and yelled a lot
during the conference?</p></li>

<li><p>In short, I thought, &quot;what could it hurt to hang out with peeps who know how to make big
money?&quot; I know I have issues around money, asking for money, making money, feeling worthy of
money.  Don't I deserve to take care of myself and my family (original and future)?</p></li>

<li><p>Also, can't I blame Soness if it turns out to be shit?  And, won't I have to blame myself if
it turns out to be awesome?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure why I've got some &quot;blame Soness&quot; thoughts coming up.  Apparently it's
from not wanting to take responsibility for myself.  I'd rather be able to say &quot;I told you
so&quot; to her, or her to say, &quot;see?  wasn't that great?&quot; to me, as opposed to her
saying, &quot;look at where you could be had you done it...&quot;</p>

<p>What's all this biznass about Soness?</p>
