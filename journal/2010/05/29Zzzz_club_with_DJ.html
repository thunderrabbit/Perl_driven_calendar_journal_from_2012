<p>DJ and I have chatted long conversations about programming, websites, cool news / tech items,
etc.  Tonight we went to get some foodage, and then he was like, &quot;you wanna get a couple
drinks?&quot; so I figured hey, and we went.  Walked to a place called 1991, which was desolate, but
we sang a karaoke song, &quot;Black Superman,&quot; a song about Muhammed Ali.</p>

<p>He was like, &quot;this place is dead,&quot; so we headed to a place he had been before.  We
arrived and I recognized it as the place I had seen before and was like, &quot;well, I ain't
going <em>there</em>,&quot; but now there I was.</p>

<p>Our hostess brought us to three vinyl covered love seats arranged in a U shape around a coffee
table, and facing a big TV on which karaoke/videos could be shown.  DJ was like, &quot;last time I
was here, they brought out a line of girls, half of whom were wearing black dresses, and half of
whom were wearing red dresses.  The red dress girls would laugh and chat, but that's it, and the
black dress girls were willing to do what you like.&quot;</p>

<p>They brought out about 12 girls/women from whom we could each choose a couch partner.  DJ let me
choose first, and I was like &quot;eeeep!&quot; but then figured hey, and was like, &quot;who speaks
English?&quot; to our hostess and she asked them in Thai and I chose the one girl from the innocent
side who raised her hand.</p>

<p>Language colonialism, true.  Helping me feel a bit more comfortable in a totally uncomfortable
situation, true.</p>

<p>I had chosen Tian, whose name includes these characters, เง, but I can't figure out how to get
the chars I want.  And I'm not totally sure I know which ones I want.</p>

<p>We sang lots of songs, drank lots of bevvies (I stayed with OJ and then cola), and enjoyed some
paid platonic partying.</p>

<p>Tian jokingly said she was a ladyboy, the term used for transvestite, I think.  I was like,
&quot;whatevs&quot; cause she didn't have the voice, shape, or texture.  When she kept saying it, I
was like, <em>well there goes your tip,</em> cause it started spooking me out.  I know its
effect was all in my head, but still.  Real enough for me.</p>

<p>We left after a couple hours; I paid 1000 baht, and DJ (who drank a lot more than me) paid 2600
baht. (*)  He actually covered the whole thing when they brought the bill, and only when I asked how
much it was he goes, &quot;you can pay whatever it was worth to you; I know I drank a lot more than
you, but you can pay just <em>one baht</em> if you want.&quot; Nice.</p>

<p>(*) Dat's like $108.  Woulda cost way more than that in Japan, I'm sure.   Not sure if I'll go out
like that again, but maybe.</p>
