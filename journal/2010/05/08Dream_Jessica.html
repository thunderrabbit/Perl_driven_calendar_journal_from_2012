<p class="dream">With Jessica in Bangkok, wanting to get to Chian Mai, but it was our first time to
be here so we didn't know much.  Found a bus that would go, but it hadn't arrived yet, so we went
back to a little shop in the back of which was a DJ turntable.  I saw her interest in the felt pad
on top of the platter ad I showe her how it would allow the disc to be rotated independently of the
plater.  I actually turned on the thing with the Play Stop button and showed her the felt spin and
unspin at a touch.  I showed her how the platter could be stopped with the fingers as well, and then
it would spin back up to speed.  I turned it off an she said, "do you eve get troubled" and I
figured out what she meant and changed it to "do you ever get in trouble" and she agreed that's what
she wasnted to ask so I was like, "yeah, but what do you mean Like what context"cause I've been in
trouble lots of times.  I didn't think I'd be in trouble for turning on the turn table, but I was
sorta in trouble for other things hand had been in big trouble as a kid.  Oh!  The bus is here so we
went out to get it, but i t drove away and I started to chase it, running running down the street,
then turning as i t turned and running on all fours to get a bit more speed.  I found a rock and
threw it at the bus but missed and ran some more and the bus stopped at the next stop and I was
like, "cool we have another chance" and Jessica was coming up behind me and we got to the bus and it
was actually two buses, the first of which was basically full, with 1 babysitter and e or 5 kids in
the tent with her, and the other bus was full with two people laing own together in their tent.</p>

<p class="dream">We talked to the guy about other options  to get to Chiang Mai, and he showed us on
a map where it was and how to get there.  Only about 2.5 km so we could walk it, or if we took a tuk
tuk through the busy streets, he did the calculation  at 1.2 km per hour it would take just a couple
of hours and I was watching some insects on  the wall like caterpillars joined at the butts and then
some fly landed on my lip for a second and when I went to brush it waaay it was already gone, but it
felt like  it may  have stung me,  or I was  just spooked by  it.  The  feeling persisted for  a few
minutes and  I told the guy what  happened, &quot;uh, a second  ago, or maybe three  minutes ago, an
insect landed  her and it  felt like it may  have bitten me,  but I'm not  sure if it's ust  my mind
making things up&quot; and he  had me stretch my lip around my teeth like a  horse to see i he could
see the spot any more  clearly with the skin stretch, and I made some  kissessing noises and he went
back to get some cream, and I said &quot;smooches please&quot; to Jssica and woke up.</p>
