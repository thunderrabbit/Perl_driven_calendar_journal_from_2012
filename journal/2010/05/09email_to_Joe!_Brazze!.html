<p>I've just gotten settled into my new location here in Chiang Mai.
From my massage school, it's 1/7th the distance than where I stayed
last night. (5 minutes' walk as opposed to 36 minutes' walk.)  It's
twice the price, but features a rather large pool (5 lanes plus
shallow area) and about 20 deck chairs, restaurant with free
breakfast, free access to ye olde internets, and awesome outdoor-ish
showers, and a bunch of large trees as canopy for the place and
gardens..  I mean, basically it's paradise.  $9 per night.  Aww yeah.</p>

<p>I've visited the school, and it seems great; classes start tomorrow
(13 hours from now), so I plan to sleep, wake, eat, put on some long
pants so I can enter the immigration office in proper attire, sort out
my education visa (I wonder if I can do it in one visit!!), and then
head to school, hopefully on time.  Hmmm!!</p>
