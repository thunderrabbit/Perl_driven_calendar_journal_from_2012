<p>I'm back in the Bangkok airport for a night.  Right now I've just spent 125 baht for a Starbucks
bevvy (and electrical outlet), which turns out to be more than half the baht I had left in my wallet
for this weekend adventure after paying for taxi and little snack in Chiang Mai airport.</p>

<p>I was going to walk away from buying the yummy drink and then decided to live in the moment.  I
have money now so I'll spend it now and just be happy now.  Tomorrow doesn't even exist.</p>

<p>Plus I know I can walk from Chiang Mai airport to Imm Eco.  I did it the first day I arrived in
Chiang Mai.</p>
