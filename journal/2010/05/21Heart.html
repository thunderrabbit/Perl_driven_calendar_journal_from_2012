<p>Right now, my heart (higher self / angels / guidance / clear fountain / intuition) says it has
the info I need for life.</p>

<p>I can't quite believe/imagine what will be different when I attend the workshop tonight.  It
smeels like it will be a totalllllly different feeling.</p>

<p>I like the word smeels.  It was going to be smells and then feels, and now it's both.</p>

<p>while taxiing:</p>

<p>Basically, I really enjoy the guidance given from my heart, sometimes with written words like
The Alchemist, and sometimes through gentle guidance by direct revelation.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that thinks the workshop is going to be crap; that I'll hate it, hate NLP,
etc etc.</p>

<p>Back in Tokyo, Lisa suggested, &quot;just pay attention to your heart and to your experience
during the workshop.&quot;</p>
