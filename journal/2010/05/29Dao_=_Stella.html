<p>I just met Stella, whose Thai name is Dao, because dao in Thai means stella in
French.  She's from France, but has been away from France for a while, longer than I've been out of Texas.</p>

<p>She's also attending Sunshine Massage School, and asked if she can practice on me after
breakfast.  Showertime now and then we'll go to the school, where I've not been for over a week.</p>
