<p>It's not like I'm *reallllly* in Bangkok yet, as I'm still in the airport, but I've gone through
customs and found a nice spot on the third floor next CIP ROOM 4 (and also next to an electrical
outlet, though it doesn't seem to work).</p>

<p>I plan to write a couple of journal entries, pop out my contacts (as they've reached their two
week suggested life span), and conk out for the night.  Tomorrow I'll get a ticket for Chiang Mai
and *then* leave <em>that</em> airport and say I've made it to Thailand.</p>

<p>Funny how, because this is my first time to the country, I just called Chiang Mai
&quot;Thailand,&quot; like the time I said to Bryn, &quot;oh, one of my teachers is from
Australia.&quot; and she goes, &quot;where in Australia?&quot; and I go, &quot;I don't
know; <em>Australia!!</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Fortunately, Thailand is smaller than some states in Australia, so I'm getting more focused with
my imprecise geographic naming practices.</p>

<p>Even *more* fortunately, it's 30 degrees C, and I'm realllllly happy about that.  I'm prolly
gonna sleep without even needing janette's quilt over me.  I'll just sleep with it under me.</p>
