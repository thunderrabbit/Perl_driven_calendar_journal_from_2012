<p class="dream">Hiking a bit with Soness and Carl/Daniel , I was going to climb down the carved
totem pole supporting the bridge from which Soness had wandred down dto the river side.  She asked
how I was going to get down, and I said, &quot;I'll climb and catch up with you&quot; and then she
was on the side of the river, and Carl jumped off the bridge over really shallow water and I was
aafraid he'd break his leg, so I didn't look, but listened for screams... there was were none, and I
was glad, but then I had to go to the restroom and did that and was sitting there for ta while naked
and a cleaning slady came in and I was like &quot;どぞどぞ&quot;in Japanese, but she said in English,
&quot;the sign says don't go in, and I was like, 'Ive been here for a while&quot; assuming the sign
wasn't there when I went in because I sure didn't see it.  I went out and was going to jump nakedly
off the bridge because there was some deeper water I hadn't seen before, and I noticed my shorts
there but I don't know how they got there so I put them on and woke up.</p>
