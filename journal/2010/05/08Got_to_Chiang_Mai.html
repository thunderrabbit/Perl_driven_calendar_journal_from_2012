<p>70 minute flight and *bing*; we're in Chiang Mai!  I skipped all the taxi offers and just
decided to walk; it's about 2.5 km to my guesthouse.  Was barefoot at first, but the ground was a
bit too toasty for my feetsies so I put my sandals back on.  Noticed some nice looking restaurants
on my right, and am outdoors enjoying the heat at Suan Paak.  This trip will be an optimal time to
switch my journal to UTF-8 and be able to write some Thai characters, not that I know any yet.
But I was noticing patterns on the menu, so the language does have some structure.</p>

<p>Funny that I'm approaching learning Thai like an archaelogist instead of pickup at Thai for
Dummies or some such.</p>

<p>ps: it's about to rain.  Possibly pretty effectively.</p>
