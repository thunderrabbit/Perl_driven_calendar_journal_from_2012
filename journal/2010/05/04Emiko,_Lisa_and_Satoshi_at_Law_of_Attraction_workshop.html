<p>At the Pink cow, Charles Alan Ross led a workshop on Te Law of Attraction, which basically says
&quot;like attracts like&quot; or &quot;good thoughts get good results.&quot; I was there with Emiko
after our lesson at 3:30pm.  She was on my right and when Lisa came in I patted the seat on my left.
Satoshi sat there, and I didn't complain but laughed on the inside.  I enjoyed the workshop just
fine, and got some good benefit from it.  (Hey where is my workbook?  I haven't seen it since.)</p>

<p>Emiko wasn't sure that she liked it, and I felt a bit bad about that, but д▐дв, she didn't have
to come so oh well.  As soooon as the workshop finished, I had to escape the seats to meet Naoko for
a bit (so she can take over my job as Cow-Go manager), and then Naoko watched my meeting with Yumiko
(so she can teach David (their first lesson is tonight, May 8th, and 8pm Tokyo time)).</p>

<p>Ah crap; I was supposed to write Naoko an email.  I'm going to do that now.  Dang but no way to
send it until I get to guest house in Chiang Mai.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Okay, that's written.  73 lines of goodness.</p>

<p>Um, so I didn't get to chat with them right after the Law of Attraction workshop, but I chatted
with Emiko and Lisa a bit for final thank yous and see yous before I headed out for home relatively
early.</p>
