<p>Yesterday, I wrote this about _The Alchemist_:</p>

<pre>
pretty good book, though I don't know if it's mind altering any more than Celestine Prophecy or
Way of the Peaceful Warrior.
</pre>

<p>Though it's been a few years since I read either of those, I don't remember them eliciting
tears and laughter within a single page, multiple times.</p>

<p>This morning, I read The Alchemist while waiting for the Cathay Pacific counter to open at 6:??
am.  A line formed quickly when the counter opened, but since I just needed to check in, I didn't
mind letting others go in front of me.  While waiting, I heard in my heart &quot;keep reading,&quot;
but I ignored it until I noticed the line was going to take a while.  So I read while waiting.  I
read the part of the boy turning into the wind, and of their continued journey for gold and
treasure. In short, I finished the book, laughing and crying as appropriate.</p>

<p>Upon my first emotional response, though, I wanted to stifle it as inappropriate.  But then, hey,
I often say &quot;let it out&quot; and &quot;if you need to cry, cry&quot; to my friends and self.
So I let it out.  Gently, but still, enough.</p>

<p>Just before it was my turn at the counter, I finished the book and its epilogue.  I was going to
put it in my bag, and my heart said, &quot;give it to the guy behind you.&quot;  I continued to put
it in my bag, and then realized the folly.  I offered it to the guy behind me.  &quot;Would you
like a really good book?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw you laughing,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>&quot;And crying!&quot; I corrected.</p>

<p>&quot;sure, why not?&quot; he said in Australian.  (I think he actually said something like
&quot;ah, bloody hell,&quot; but in a &quot;sure, why not?&quot; kind of way.</p>

<p>Just then, the counter was available for me, and I gave the woman my passport.  She was like,
&quot;can I help you?&quot; and I thought, hmmm, just scan the passport and see, and said, &quot;uh
yeah, I have a confirmation for a flight today at 8:50.  Er, 8:20.&quot;  She visually confirmed my
confirmation and was all, &quot;you just need to go to that counter over there,&quot; pointing to
where I shoulda known I needed to go.</p>

<p>(( all big airports have the same layout.  I think it's because the layout works.  Little
counters for buying tickets and then big aisles with conveyor belts behind them for checking in.
Why had I waited in the wrong line? ))</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, that's very kind of you,&quot; said the Australian man behind me.  Ah yes.
This is why I waited in line.</p>

<p>I didn't say much past that; maybe &quot;no problem&quot; or &quot;of course!&quot; and walked
away.  On one level, I wanted credit for having passed the book along.  I wanted him to email me and
tell me it was life changing and become mates and visit his place in OZ.  On another level, I wanted
to have listened to my heart before and registered the book
on <a href="http://bookcrossing.com">bookcrossing.com</a>, possibly in Christine's name as a gift to
her, and then record that I had read it.  Hadn't done that, though, so I'll let this journal entry
do something similar.</p>

<p>ps: The Alchemist is a really good book.</p>
