<p class="note">(written while taxiing 8:42am ICT Friday 21 May 2010 (day 14667))</p>

<p>I called Shara to wish her a good test today in school.  She'll do fine as long as she simply
stays calm and relaxed.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not actually in the plane are you??&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yup, and I realized I needed to call you right now or it'd be too late.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're so sweet; thank you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No worrie mate!&quot;  (I like you)</p>

<p>&quot;What time does your workshop start?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tonight at 5pm; I know it's crazy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, have fun and give me a call when you get back!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay; see you on Monday!&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder why slow aircraft movement on the ground is called taxiing.</p>
