<p class="note">(to be transferred from my iPhone; summary below:)</p>

<p>Planning to read and work on my website this weekend.  Other than Honkers next weekend, and Koh
Phi Phi for the week after that, I'll be in massage school every week, save for two weeks off in
early July.</p>

<pre>
Plans for this weekend include asking Alfonzo for some code, reading (Course of Miracles),
swimming, practicing massage at the school on Saturday, possibly installing PHPList on my
webserver, etc.

Yes, I came to Thailand to work on my website.

Plans for next several weeks include:

One week to finish beginner course
Weekend in Honkers
Week in Koh Phi Phi
Two weeks beginner course again
Two weeks beginner course again
One week advanced course
Two weeks off (*)
One week advanced course
One week advanced course
One week free
Go home to Chez Soness

(*) during the two weeks off, I'm considering doing a ten day Vipassana course, partially
to keep myself out of trouble, and partially for the low price.

I've heard about a couple of things that have piqued my interest:

going to The Dam, which features a floating hotel and pristine beauty

Umm maybe that's it.
