HI Joe

I came across your code called Mailer on github a bit ago, and, given that you have several
github-hosted Cake-plugins that appear to have straightforward installation instructions, I'm
guessing you kinda know what you're doing.  :-)

I'd like to ask a couple of Qs, after I give a bit of background:

I have some Perl code I wrote some years ago that sends emails to my list of a few hundred names.
http://robnugen.com/wiki/Rob_updates.pl

The feature that my code has that no other email sender has (that I've found) is "automatic address
removal," meaning basically I want to periodically require users to say "I wanna stay on the list."
I can set each users delete-date independently.  So my family won't be asked until the year 2100,
but the guy I just met at the bar will be removed in 2011, unless he requests otherwise.

I'd like to rewrite my code in a bit more robust manner, so I'm looking at Cake and possibly forking
your Mailer as a starting point.

My question:

does the "automatic address removal" feature seem easy to add to your code?
(I won't ask you to add it, but I bet you know your code offhand better than I could figure out in a
couple hours)

I think it would just require two bits:

1) adding a removal date field to the user table (might get messy if that involves changing the Cake table)

2) then checking that date field when processing and do this:

Rob, 

Firstly, thanks for the email! Sounds like a pretty neat setup you've got going on.

While you certainly could accomplish what you're doing currently with CakePHP, the functionality for
periodically opting "back" into the email would have to be done outside of the Mailer plugin, reason
being that it has no concept of outside rules that it should adhere to when sending email.

You could easily utilize it however for sending your email after it's been vetted through your
processes. This way you would still maintain your functionality without having to merge it into the
plugin while still letting it do what it does best, send the email.

I hope this answers your question. If you have any others please feel free to drop me a line.

Sincerely,
Joe

HI Joe

And thank you for your email!

I scanned through the source of Mailer today, and distinctly did not notice any recipient handling
code... but yes, as you say, plenty of code to handle sending messages.

I'm guessing you must have some code not in the Mailer source that instantiates the classes defined
in Mailer.  In fact, I don't think I saw any code that wasn't a class definition.  Is that right?

Given what I saw in the code, and what you're saying below, I think I'd need to write a class that
just maintains the statii of possible recipients, and then some code that orchestrates everything.

Do you have examples of code that instantiates and calls Mailer classes?

PS: though I'm replying immediately after yours, I'll probably not be able to get back to this until
after the weekend (I'm going to Hong Kong for a workshop) (unless I can't get out of Chiang Mai at
all due to protests, in which case I'll have plenty of time to play online.)

Rob,
The process for mailing is fairly straightforward. You add emails using the QueueComponent which
lines up the emails for sending, from there the QueueShell attempts to send the emails out using
your "transport" of choice. The plugin ships with a couple "transports" already available.

If the QueueShell is unsuccessful it will increase the "tries" count for the email in question. It
will, by default, attempt to send the email three times. If it is successful it will mark the
"processed" column in your database to "1" to indicate a successful mailing. The system also
defaults to using the "debug transport" for mailing which lets you monitor what it's trying to
do. You can change this by passing a parameter when you start the shell.

We have a crontab that runs the QueueShell periodically which allows it to clear out the email
queue. You can execute the QueueShell like any other CakePHP shell. Here's a quick example of
starting the QueueShell and passing it various parameters...

$ cake mailer.queue process -transport pear -test true -limit 100

This would start the QueueShell and tell it to begin processing. It would attempt to use the PEAR
transport (it ships with this) and it will do so in its testing mode (it won't actually send
anything) and it will only work on the first 100 emails that are waiting to go out.

Hopefully this helps get you on your feet. Have fun in Hong Kong and be safe!

-Joe
