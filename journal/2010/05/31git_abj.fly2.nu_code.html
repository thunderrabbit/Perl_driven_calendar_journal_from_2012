HI Richard

I've made several changes to the image-dropbox code so it will work on my system.  Eventually I'd
like to get it so the code will work on both your system and mine with no modifications.

Right now, though I doubt you'd want all my code, I did find a bug that disallows newly created
users to log in.

<a href="http://github.com/thunderrabbit/image-dropbox/commit/be867652c40833d798d48ea568a4862024731596#L1L38">http://github.com/thunderrabbit/image-dropbox/commit/be867652c40833d798d48ea568a4862024731596#L1L38</a>

Basically your DB INSERT is saving the plaintext $password to the users table instead of SHA1
$hash_password

Also, I see you've got the schema.sql and schema-update.sql written so they can be imported on the
command line.  I think it would be better for users if those were written as .php files that could
be run from the web.

Two reasons: It would be easier for most users (who don't do command line stuff), AND the files
could use the conf.php values for the DB name so they would "just work" with no modifications.

To make the DBs via web, I started to write fixes/install.php, but realized it would be a mess to
keep a .PHP verson and a .sql version of the DB create files.

<a href="http://github.com/thunderrabbit/image-dropbox/commit/3829ab5a0cb1c4a078eae207ea65519e02a0baa9#diff-0">http://github.com/thunderrabbit/image-dropbox/commit/3829ab5a0cb1c4a078eae207ea65519e02a0baa9#diff-0</a>

What are your thoughts on converting the files from .sql to .php?

   Thanks
    - Rob

ps: I'm sorry for my email about "fixing" the template system that already worked.  :-)

<p>I'm pretty excited to have gotten what I think will be the solution for my fly2.nu animals.</p>

<p>A guy named Richard has written some code called &quot;image-dropbox&quot; and has the source
hosted via github.</p>

<p>It pretty much looks like it does all the things I want it to do, without much extra.  And it's
small.</p>

<p><a href="http://abj.fly2.nu/">http://abj.fly2.nu/</a> <em>basically</em> works now, though it's
got a way to go.  Please don't upload any pics unless they include my bear Johnny.  (yes I know I
uploaded Spaghetti Spoon, but that will be deleted as soon as the delete functionality works.)</p>

<p>It works now.</p>

<p>crap I gotta go to bed.</p>
