<p>I just about walked out of my Thai language class because he was going way too quickly for me.  I
mean, he *has* been going way to quickly for me.  Then I was like, <em>aight stop</em> to myself
until I could figure out what to do.  Then to him I was like, &quot;aight stop,&quot; and explained,
&quot;I can't read these characters yet,&quot; referring to all the Thai characters that look a lot
like แตวดาสหปรอป๔๓ย๒งกงด๘๙รสคลาหม๗รปกง to a non-Thai reader like me.</p>

<p>I go, &quot;I just want to work on reading,&quot; so I asked him to leave all the stuff he had
written on the board, and I began to work out what I could read / recognize, etc.</p>

<p>Now, though I can't yet write them with my physical keyboard, I can read and write stuff like,
หก, สาม and สิบ., written with my electronic keyboard.</p>

<p>Class went great once I got him working the way I wanted.</p>
