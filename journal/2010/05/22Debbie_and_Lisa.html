<p>On the train headed  home a woman was like, &quot;did you sign up for the next Chris Howard
training?&quot; apparently cause she had seen me <em>run</em> to the back.  I was like, &quot;not
yet,&quot; and explained the package that Soness had bought, and that I might do some of them, and
might not, and not sure but we'll see, etc.</p>

<p>They both said they &quot;didn't get&quot; the &quot;eyes closed part&quot; of the training (a
visualization).  I was like, &quot;hmmm&quot; and told them it may have been easier for me because
I had done similar things with other trainings.</p>

<p>They asked if I had been to Honkers before, and I told them about PB until we parted ways.</p>

<p>&quot;Please come find me tomorrow; we can go to lunch.&quot;</p>
