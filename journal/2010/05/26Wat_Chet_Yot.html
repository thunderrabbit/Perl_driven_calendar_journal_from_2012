<p>Shara invited me to go bicycling, and we headed to the Chiang Mai museum, but overshot a bit and
ended up at Wat Chet Yot, which featured some old temple buildings (600 years old, I think).</p>

<p>Got several pictures and posted them on <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/thunderrabbit/WatChetYot20100526">picasa</a> and <del>maybe</del> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=436896&id=816205715&l=5b59de5eb2">FB</a>.</p>
