<p>Went by the mall on the way to the train station and bought a bar of soap, and a new blue camera,
cause I couldn't find mine when I was packing, plus Honkers has great prices on electronics.  I
almost didn't buy it because the power cord has the big crazy bulky HK power thing, but then I
realized I can just cut the end off and replace it for 100 yen.</p>

<p>The camera is waterproof to ten meters and shock proof when dropped from a couple meters.  It can
do colorswap even in video mode, face detection, and probably more.  Model = Canon Powershot D10.</p>
