<p>Due to the recent violence in Chiang Mai, the US government has asked its citizens to leave
Chiang Mai.  Christine has chosen to follow this advice.  I'm choosing to stay.  She gave me a copy
of _The Alchemist_, and she told me about the soldiers and protestors she had seen near the night
market.</p>

<p>Same scene that I've seen before (via internet from US, and with my eyes in Palestine):
well-protected, heavily armed soldiers facing off against street clothed unarmed protestors.  She
said she got to cross the bridge that had a pile of burning tires on one or both ends, not long
before it was closed to traffic.  She said she could have reached out and touched AK-47s on one
side, and protestors on the other side of her tuk tuk.  Dang.</p>

<p>She didn't get any pictures, though.  Dang.</p>

<p>She's heading out tomorrow on a 6am flight.  Going to Koh Sa Mui (sp!!!)</p>
