<p>I slept near a group of youth who didn't sleep during the night.  They chatted animatedly, but
their chatter didn't really affect my sleep.  Their cart races did, though.  Everything was
blissfully quiet, and I was like &quot;ahhhhh nice,&quot; until they came racing back in giggling,
squealing, shouting pairs of cart pushers and cart riders.</p>

<p>I was glad they didn't crash into anyone.</p>

<p>&quot;Now we should change drivers and do it again!!&quot;</p>
