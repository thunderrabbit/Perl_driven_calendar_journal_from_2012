Soness

This email is being written kind of backwards, so I can save the best for last.  First, I wrote
"Thank you thank you," but now I'm putting these four paragraphs ahead of that.

Chris is fine, and super genki.  He seems like a really cool guy, and I approve of him being your
mentor.  ;-) Johnnie Cass was his fellow presenter; I don't know if you've met him.  He's from OZ
with Italian blood (I think).  Apparently pretty famous in OZ for TV shows or something.

The course was cheap as, so included a lot of sales pitches.  After each sales pitch, he'd be like,
"the normal price is xxxxxx, but because you're here, you can get it for only xxxxx."  People would
go back to the back and sign up if they were convinced they could/should do it.  On the first day, I
wasn't convinced, but near the end of the program, because I was getting a bit antsy, he was like,
"... but the seminar price is only xxxxxx" and I *RAN* back to the back at tip top speed, just
because I wanted to run.  I had no intention of actually signing up, given that you've offered me
all the courses at no cost to me.  (I put my name on the paper, but never finished filling it out.)

I actually ran a lot this weekend around the chairs in the hall.  When you're in Bali, when you see
Chris and other peeps that were here, they'll remember the guy who was running around, (and stood on
his chair, (and threw his hat and stuffed animals in the air))..

Thank you thank you for the course this weekend.  I've pretty much decided to do the entire thing
and go through the Fast Track of courses.  I'm debating between accepting your gift and investing in
myself with my own money.  I think I can get it for 99,000 HKD.

BUT

I did buy a couple of things this weekend!

Thirdly, I bought access to the new Chris Howard
extravaganza なんとか website, which was just launched a couple days ago.  I don't have my login
information, or even have the URL, but the current price is $17.95 per month if you pay for the year
in advance, and you lock in that price for as long as you stay a member.  I got the year package for
that.

Secondly, I got something for you at Billionaire Bootcamp in Bali, and I hope it works out
correctly.  It's like a pizza, but not.  It's not that biga deal, but I hope you like it.  It is my
way of thanking you for this gift.

Firstly, after Chris described the Billionaire Bootcamp, though I'm not going to Bali, I did decide
to go to the one next year (though it's not even announced yet).  I *RAN* to the back at tip top
speed, all the way from front and center around the chairs and to the back.

Chris had said, "I like to reward people who take action, and I'll give something special to the
first two people who sign up."  I was like "cool" and RAN back there, started signing up, but no one
else in the audience moved.  He was like, "going once,.... going twice....  really?  Okay, gone!
Rob, I'm going to give you one year access to the website, and ... the trip to Egypt.  Billionaire
Adventure Club; it's on me."

OH MY GOD!!!!!!  I was like, "whoohoooo!!!!" but that wasn't even exuberant enough now that I've
been thinking about it!  Holy snappers!!

It's this October... are you going??  Wow wow wow wow!

So I'm going to Billionaire Adventure Club in October, and then Billionaire Bootcamp in 2011.
Cowabunga!!

I plan to do a couple more of the courses before BB next year, but not sure which ones will be
available when, etc.

- - - -

Several of the staff knew you or knew of you.  Stella (?) said she moved the dates of BB in Bali for
you, and I gave her a really long really genuine hug.  "Thank you.  Soness is so busy.  Thank you;
it really means so much to her."

After the whole night, and all the everything, I still wasn't convinced that I'd do the entire
course.  I was turned off by Chris's rhetorical question, "wouldn't you like to be able to have
conversations with people and have their minds just change while you're talking?"

I was like, "no way; that violates their free will."

BUT then, during dinner with new mates from the class, I remembered, "oh, but if I know NLP, not
only do I NOT have to use it, I can detect if someone is trying to use it on me..."

So that's when I decided to do the whole Fast Track.
