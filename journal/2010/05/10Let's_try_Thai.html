<p>I've set my input types to include Thai and Thai - PattaChote.</p>

<p>First, Thai:</p>

<p>ๅ/_ภถคตจขชๆไำพะรนยบลฃฟหกดเาสวงผปแอทมใฝ</p>

<p>Next, Thai - PattaChote:</p>

<p>๒๓๔๕๗๘๙๐๑๖ตยอรดมวแใฌฃทงกานเไขบปลหคสะจพ</p>

<p>Now, English:</p>

<p>1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,./</p>

<p>Except that I removed from the Thai listings the characters that showed up as empty
rectangles.</p>

<p>Okay, now let's try to save this in UTF-8.</p>

<p>Done.  Now upload...</p>

<p class="date">6:16am ICT</p>

<p>Okay, it looks like bollocks, which is what I suspected, but if I view the character set as
UTF-8... it looks correct.</p>

<p>Now to set my journal.pl file to output UTF-8</p>

<p class="date">6:39am ICT</p>

<p>Perfect.  Now when I view today's entry, the encoding is in UTF-8, and yesterday's entry, the
encoding is EUC-JP.</p>

<p>Now to make sure I can have both Japanese and Thai in the same file/day:</p>

<p>これは日本語でございます。</p>
