<p>Yesterday after school I mostly farted around on internet; I crave some source code for storing
images on my site.  Though it's been a bajillion internet years, I still haven't gotten a solution
I like on my site.</p>

<p>I set up abj.fly2.nu for Auto Break Johnny, my new traveling stuffed animal after leaving U-Cow
on a taxi, though still 30% chance I'll get him back, I bet.</p>
