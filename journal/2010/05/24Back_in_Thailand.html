<p>Arrived in Bangkok airport and went through immigration, which meant I had to pay 100 baht.  I
wasn't able to flirt, talk or even bribe (with ice cream!) my way out of it.  I gave 120 baht to her
and left the change kind of as a basskacwards nice-jerky thing to do.  I had asked, &quot;who gets
the money?&quot; and she was like &quot;you just give it to me&quot; and then I was like, &quot;is
it a tip?&quot; God, I'm not so proud of this conversation, but I mainly wanted to know how I was
supposed to know, esp. given that &quot;someone downstairs&quot; told me I had to exit after I said
&quot;I'm going to Chiang Mai.&quot;</p>

<p>Basically it ends up being 100 baht paid to the immigration guy in Bangkok.  Do I get 100 baht
back in Chiang Mai?  Can I get through without going through immigration in Chiang Mai?  If so, then
why did I need to go through at all?  So confuzzinged.</p>

<p>So I gave her 120 baht; she gave me 20 back, I tried to give it back to her, and she said,
&quot;nooo&quot; and then I left it on the counter as I walked away.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, counter girl; I shouldn't have done that.</p>
