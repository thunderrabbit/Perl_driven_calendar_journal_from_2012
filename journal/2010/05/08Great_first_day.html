<p>Great first day in Chiang Mai!</p>

<p>I successfully walked from the airport to my guest house, booked a room for four nights for 600 Bhat
total, chatted a bit with the peeps there, and then walked to Sunshine Massage School to ensure
I can find it on Monday.</p>

<p>Talked with founder-owner-manager Max a bit and generally looks like things will be great. He gave
me water, good advice on getting an education visa, and a list of nearerby accomodation. On the list
was <a href="http://www.immhotel.com/eco-home.html">ImmEco</a>, which was my first choice when I
searched online, but they gave either a null or negative response via email. Max suggested that was
cause I had asked during a busy season, but now they were probably quite available, especially with
so many countries telling their citizens to NOT travel to Thailand because of the riots.</p>

<p>What riots?</p>

<p>I walked over to Imm Eco, fell in love with its gardens, signed up for a month lodging including
free breakfast for 10,000 Bhat. Sweet. I move in tomorrow.</p>
