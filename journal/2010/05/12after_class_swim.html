<p>After class, Christine, Shara and I went to the Imm Eco pool for a chillaxin' swim.  In several
'dives,' I walked along the bottom of the pool from the deep end to the shallow end.  At the
shallow end, five or six dive pedestals give divers a place from which they can dive.  They also
give me a place from which I can do back flips.</p>

<p>I did two back flips today from the pedestal.  I did two yesterday, but the first one took about
10 minutes for me to get my nerve up.  I basically was afraid of hitting my head on the concrete, or
smacking my back on the water.  I asked my angels for an answer, and I looked up and saw the screen
between the something and something else.  safety net.  I looked up and saw a screen as part of the
roof over a patio.  Safety net.  Hmmm safe.  Saw another screen elsewhere.  Then I remembered that
if I were on a trampoline instead of a dive platform, I'd be able to back flip no worries.  Anyway,
I rememebered how to flip from gymnastics and did it.  Arms up, arms down+bend legs, arms
up+straighten legs, up, tuck, look, untuck, sploosh!  yay!!!</p>

<p>After twice yesterday, I did it twice today, and then tried doing back flips at the deep end of
the pool, which is at water level.  I wasn't quite able to rotate all the way over, but I nearly got
it.  Tried again, and was a bit worse.  I think with a bit of tweaking on my timing and launch, I
could get a full standing back flip.  I'm really not likely to try it on the ground, though, even on
a mat, unless I have a competent spotter.</p>
