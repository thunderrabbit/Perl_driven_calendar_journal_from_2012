<p>Rak Yen owns the vegetarian place that Christine and I enjoyed a few times during our class
two+three weeks ago.  I went in there today and chatted with Rak Yen, got her picture with Johnny,
got her son's email address so I can send the pic, signed their guest book, and practiced reading a
few Thai characters.</p>
