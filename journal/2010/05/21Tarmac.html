<p>The tractor pushing us back was like <em>bump bump</em> and then <em>shove bump</em> and then
nothing.  I was like &quot;hmmmmm,&quot;</p>

<p>and later, the captain was like, &quot;The tarmac in this part of the airport is soft, and the
push-back tractor cannot get enough traction to push us back to where we are allowed to start our
engines.  Air traffic control will not let us start our engines in the current position, so we are
waiting another push-back tractor to come help us out.  I'd like to say this is not a Cathay Pacific
issue, but an issue with the Thai airport, and is out of our control.  While we are waiting, the
cabin crew will continue to provide you with anything you need for your flight.</p>

<p>&quot;I expect a new tractor will be here in a couple of minutes and once we are airborne we'll
enjoy clear skies for our 2 hour and 22 minute flight to Hong Kong.&quot;</p>

<p>Now we are moving back.  Oh, I mean forward.</p>

<p>I wonder if there's any mention of this on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll notice them turn on the engines.  (I chose a seat way at the back of the plane
so I'd have a clear view without the wing in the way, so I can't see the engines.)</p>

<p>Yup.  I noticed.</p>

<p>Must have been frustrating for the captain; we were moved forward about 100 meters to the engine
start point.</p>
