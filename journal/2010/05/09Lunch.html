<p>I slept slept slept until about 12:30pm today, and then went outside to check out of my guest
house, and get some lunch..  met four guys out front and we went to lunch nearby, right across the
moat from the southwest corner of old city Chiang Mai, where some kids were climbing the wall and
jumping into the water.  I couldn't help but recall my dream!</p>

<p>After lunch, I walked to Imm Eco.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it!!</p>
