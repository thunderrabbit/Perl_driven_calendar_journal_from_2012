<p>Went to the club again with DJ last night (night of 30 May).  I didn't realllly want to go, but
he was like, &quot;if we stay past whatever time you set, then I'll pay,&quot; and we went.  I
enjoyed riding on <em>top</em> of the red taxi truck on the way there.  Not that it was crowded
with just the two of us, but it was fun.</p>

<p>I chose Tian again, and though we sat together and it was kinda fun, it wasn't really fun, and I
was pretty much over it when we left.</p>

<p>One cool thing though was in the men's restroom, when I went to whiz, a guy put a small hot towel
on my neck, gave me a shoulder massage with finger tips, and then another guy gave me some neck
adjustments when I was wiping my hands at the sink (with another hot towel).  Wow.  First time I've
experienced any of *that*!  I gave them 100 baht.</p>

<p>Though I decided not to go again, I was thinking tonight, &quot;maybe next time, instead of
feeling guilty for not choosing the same girl when they do the lineup,&quot; (egad), &quot;we could
go in there and ask for random names until the name actually identifies one of their
hostesses.&quot;</p>
