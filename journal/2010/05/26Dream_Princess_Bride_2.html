<p class="dream">Wesley, climbing all over the construction area of a castle, trying to find
Buttercup, had to evade Buttercup's father, played by an old man who looked like incent Price.  In
the climax, Price almost reached Buttercup, but Wesley swooped in and caught her and continued
climbing the rebar frame of the castle under construction lifting her as easily as if he were
climbing alone.  Price nearly jumped to his death, but decided to live, and went to the room where
he had been sleeping and did a little soliloquy, blessing the two who he'd never see again.</p>

<p class="dream">Then they were right there beside him, listening, in bed on the florr together,
giggling, and then he saw them and they were one big small happy family.</p>
