<p>Ah!  I've got a solution for my UTF-8 woes..  I'll declare today May 10th, to be the day I
switche to UTF-8, and now alllll my previous journal entries that are stored in Shift-JIS will not
work if they have Japanese characters in them.  Then I can either do a hack that tells my indexer
to treat dates before this date as Shift-JIS and dates after this date as UTF-8, as a temporary
fix, and then later later actualy re-encode the files.  Okay.  But first, I gotta put in my
contats.</p>

<p>Oh, and this entry is called Get Ready cause I gotta get ready for school, but first gotta get
ready to go to immigration office to try and sort out my educational visa.  I'm on tourist visa now.</p>
