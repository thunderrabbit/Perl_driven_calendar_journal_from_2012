<p>Planning to meet Lisa in Shinjuku and visit the park well *before* 4pm hahahahaa.</p>

<p>We got a good deal of sun in the park, drawing and chatting.  She gave me some great suggestions
and guidance on getting some clients when I get back from Thailand.  We worked out some numbers, and
figure I need to put flyers in about 50 places around town.</p>

<p>Once the sun had us nicely toasted, we walked in search of food.  Found a little shop in
ø∑Ω…ª∞√˙Ã‹ that featured several different flavors of french toast.  Actually the toast was identical (thick
white bread) but just the side dish flavoring differed.  She got a cute scoop of vanilla ice cream,
and I got cinamon-juice drizzled over whipping cream.</p>

<p>If there's a next time, I'll prolly get vanilla.</p>

<p>I had been feeling hesitant about going to the weekend workshop in Honkers, so I asked Lisa if
she'd help me do a process by which I could request an answer from my highest self.  She suggested
what is basically like a prayer, but called a decree, and wrote a suggested draft, which I amended
a bit, read through in a prayerful manner, and waited for the answer.</p>

<p>We went outside and Lisa suggested if I quiet my mind a bit, the answer may just come.  It
came.  I'm going.  Yay!!!!</p>
