<p>Since my last day is tomorrow, we all decided to go to dinner tonight at Tanzi.  After class,
Cyrille, Shara and I (Christine has left the class for travel purposes) went to our pool to swim and
chill until about 6:30pm.  I played around doing silly stuff including back flips off the diving
platforms (into 1.1 meters of water), doing a yoga crow position on the platform and forward
fall-flip to back breaker on the water, playing lava on the different colored parts of the pavement,
and jumping slight backwards from the poolside into 1.6 meters of water and trying to keep my hands
from slipping from the edge on my way down.</p>

<p>Then we were chatting and Cyrille told us about a guy named Dean(?) ??mann (dang I forgot) who
has a cool way of teaching young children lots of stuff.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, Cyrille got a phone call from his mate saying that Chiang Mai may have a
curfew at 8pm around downtown (in downtown?) and decided to head back to his place.  Shara and I
were still game to go to the restaurant, and grabbed a tuk tuk for 60 baht.  He drove us right
almost to the place and we walked the long (long) way around the hotel looking for it and then
found it just ahead of where he had dropped us off.  It's called Tian Zi.</p>

<p>And it's closed tonight, ostensibly for the upcoming curfew, and, though we were 15 minutes late,
we didn't see anyone else from class (Ohm, Silvia, Anne Gaelle).  Did they all decide not to come
because of the news?  Did they decide not to wait 15 minutes for us?  We're vaguely nearby on the
corner having Thai street food.  She's got some spicy chili chicken, and I'm getting some hopefully
non-spicy vegetable chicken rice.</p>

<p>On occasion, groups of motorbikes go by with horns honking, and shouting, but I don't know yet
what that means.</p>

<p>dinner has arrived.</p>
