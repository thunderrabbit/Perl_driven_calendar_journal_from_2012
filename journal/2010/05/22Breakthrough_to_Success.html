<p>Just back in my hotel room after the first full day
of <a href="http://www.chrishowardasia.com/">Chris Howard</a>'s Breakthrough to Success weekend
training.  I must admit I've gotten some good out of it, and I've sat through a lot of hype about
his other trainings, which sound like they could be pretty good for those people who want the
skills they'll teach.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening was the first part of the program, in which they introduced several of the
concepts.</p>

<p>Today he modeled a technique for instantly removing negative emotional triggers from our
lives, and then had us go through the process twice.  I'm not sure that it worked for me, but the
method seems like it could work if done on a one-to-one manner with a trained coach.</p>

<p>I can't go into details about those things, but I can say how I traveled and where I sat.  Upon
arrival at my hotel yesterday, I took some time to chill and play online (though the connection was
slower than molasses waiting for Christmas on a cold day), and then asked peeps at the front desk
how to get to the center where the training would be held.  They were like, &quot;do dis&quot; and
&quot;do dat&quot; and I was like &quot;thanks!&quot; and went downstairs and took a taxi.  HK$55
later I was there, and strolled in, with plenty of time to spare, even after having some rice and
chicken.</p>

<p>In the contract that says &quot;don't take pictures&quot; and &quot;we can take pictures of you
and use them in promotion,&quot; I crossed out the latter part before signing the contract.  I
don't want them making money off my antics without me getting something directly back.</p>

<p>Sat in the VIP section (thank you, Soness!) yesterday next to Stacey and Leslie.  Each time they
had us jump up for what we'd call in YRUU an energy break, I would jump up into my chair.  After the
second break, I *ran* back to my chair as fast as possible, just for fun.  Stacey and Leslie headed
out before I could get out, so I ran the long way around the crowd to catch up to them and ask if
they'd help me get back using the train instead of taxi.  They did, and it was great.</p>

<p>I got home, surfed the etherwebs, took a shower using toothpaste for soap on the most important
bits: hair, pits, and hands to take out my contacts.  Oh, and my teeth.</p>

<p>Today, I woke up gently, washed my hands with toothpaste before putting in my contacts, surfed
the internoodles a bit and then headed out, using the train and free shuttle instead of taxi.  When
I got on the shuttle, I noticed, that though I was 45 minutes early, its clock said I was 15
minutes late.  Hmmm!</p>

<p>I checked my phone, and found it was set on Bangkok time!  Oh noes!!  I am <em>certain</em> I
set it to Honkers time upon arrival, so I don't know how it went back to Bangkok time.  Dang.</p>

<p>I strolled a bit more quickly toward the center once we got off the shuttle, and once I was close
enough to the open doors for the staff to see my wrist band, I started to <em>run</em>, full
throttle through the door, full throttle ran around the right hand side of the seats (plenty of
space) and then full throttle right in front of the front stage area to where I had been sitting
yesterday, in VIP seats.  The speaker couldn't help but comment, plus &quot;everyone give him a
thunderous round of applause,&quot; and then I yelled, &quot;I was 45 minutes early and then
realized my clock was on Bangkok time!!!&quot; &quot;That's all right; we're glad you're
here.&quot;</p>

<p>(later, I told Heather (high ranking staff) &quot;I figured if I was going to be late, but sit in
the VIP seats, I was going to do it BIG.&quot;</p>

<p>She goes, &quot;are you the one who's been standing up on your chair?  yeah, we [staff] have been
enjoying watching you from the back.&quot;)</p>

<p>I sat beside Jian today, and we went to lunch together during lunch.  She told me she wasn't
sure what she wanted to do with her life, and I understood her plight.</p>

<p>After the whole thing, which finished with Chris saying how we should really sign up for the
great low low price for the whatsit training, I <em>ran</em> full throttle from the center of the
*front row* to the very back to where the crew was all ready to take my payment information.  I
signed my name and then took the sheet to another staff person and asked if she knew if the package
Soness had gotten includes the training up for which I was about to sign.  She didn't know, but I
bet it does, but don't know if I wanna attend anyway (I had just wanted to run), and I folded the
registration form gently and put it in my pocket.</p>

<p>Was talking to some of the other staff, who were all like, &quot;you're so fast!&quot; and kinda
gawking smiley at this crazy barefoot foreigner.. they were like, &quot;let's race!&quot; and set up
a race between me and one girl who I was going to let win until I saw she ran around half the chairs
while I ran around all the chairs.  I won and then they all crowded around for picture time and then bye
bye waves.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the early show starts at 7:45am.  I plan to be there on time.</p>
