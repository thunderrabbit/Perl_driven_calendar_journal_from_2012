<p>There was a big line to a big desk featuring a big sign that said TRAIN TICKETS.  I stood in
that line for a bit until I saw no line near a small machine featuring an equally big sign that
said TRAIN TICKETS.  Press [ENGLISH] for English, [1 ADULT] for me, and insert 100 HKD for the
ticket.  Boom.  No line needed.</p>

<p>Why was there a line to the big desk?</p>
