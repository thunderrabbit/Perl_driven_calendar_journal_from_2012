<p>I have just dropped off our two couchsurfers at the train station to hang out with Soness's
friend Maggie (as opposed to my friend Maggie); they're going to do some wwoofing and then relax in
hot spring.  I'd like to have gone as well, but have Cow-Go meetings, and Law of Attraction Workshop
at The Pink Cow.  yay!</p>
