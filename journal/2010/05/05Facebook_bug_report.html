<pre><b>photos are in album, but album has no photos</b>

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=427442&id=816205715&ref=mf#!/photo.php?pid=12431469&op=1&view=album&subj=682991081&aid=427442&auser=816205715&id=816205715">http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=42744&amp;tc</a>

The photo linked above (and all its brethren) claim to be in the "at Godzilla Park" album, which is
what I'd like.  But, if I click "at Godzilla Park" link below the photo, the album claims to have no
photos.

The album was created with "Facebook Exporter for iPhoto, v1.0.6" using iPhoto version 6.0.6 (322)
on Mac OS X 10.6.3 about 12 hours before this report was submitted.

Please note, the attached screenshot consists of *two* screenshots, one above the other, with some
scribbly lines to explain what I'm talking about.

Thank you guys for doing incredible work with an even more incredible volume of data.
