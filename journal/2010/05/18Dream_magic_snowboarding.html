<p class="dream">Heard about a way to get across the river, that involved using the train trestle at
times that the train wasn't on it. Christine and I were going to do it, but she wasn't sure if she
could manage.  We were both sure I could manage easily, which I did: the trestle was out towards the
right and I went to it, and under it.  Kept walking through the snow and came across a row of people
standing in a line facing me.  I realized they were just mannequins and there were numbers in front
of each one indicating how tall they were; I went for the tallest one just to be snarky and was
hopping up to it and then instead of climbing over it, I dodged around it at the last minute and
then was past the river.</p>

<p class="dream">I got to the snowboard area and basically realized it was illegal to do it, but
also magical and one had to be in phase before one could see where to snowboard.  Actually looking
for the area wasn't a crime, but people were deterred from looking because one you found it, you
couldn't be caught because of the phase shift.  So I was trying to sneakily dig my snowboard non
chalantly into the snow and then suddenly the snow fell open below me and I was in!</p>

<p class="dream">Snowboarded down down into a deep game area where the basic idea was to dive down
into a sheer hole in the snow really quickly and try to catch certain moments that were indicated by
words of various lengths.  I first caught the word &quot;on&quot;, but then was able to expand that
to &quot;noon&quot; and then made it to the bottom of the hole.  The game floated me up to the top
and then I immediately went down again, catching &quot;wash&quot; and then &quot;washing&quot; and
then &quot;washington&quot; all in quick succession.</p>

<p class="dream">There were other more advanced players, but everyone was having fun and supportive
of others just by virtue that we couldn't be here if we didn't deserve to play.  There were guys
doing crazy flips and catching words like, &quot;outstanding&quot; and then &quot;chiropractor&quot;
in a single drop or one guy who did crazy monkey flips sideways to catch &quot;stress free
somalia&quot; and &quot;downtown tibeten guru&quot; in a single dive down the slope!  I was utterly
impressed, knowing he must have been doing this for years.  I kept playing and playing, catching my
three and four letter words, just having a blast and then the scene shifted so that I was out of
phase again, looking for the next hole to drop down into the snow game.</p>

<p class="dream">This time was harder to find, but I eventually found it, But once I got in, there
was no snow; we were surfing down this grid of wooden mannequins and arm rests until we got to the
bottom of a theater.  At the bottom, were a bunch of men who were all warriors (MKP) and honoring
one guy by lofting him over head.</p>

<p class="dream">I was in character as a bird, and I could only jump with my legs together, or fly,
though I wasn't very good at flying with human arms yet.  But I hopped over to the guy and there
were other people around who lofted him overhead, and I flew up to help as we carried him around the
room.  I was flying overhead, with one arm helping to guide and make sure he safely navigated the
room, as he was pretty heavy and it was hard for the group to pick him up.</p>

<p class="dream">Then we were standing back in a circle and someone asked when I would come back to
play. as I woke up.</p>

<p class="dream">I woke up on the deck of a small yacht and someone was asking me something, and I
go yeah, I'm just acting as first mate because what better way to work on a yacht than be able to
chill out on the top deck and make a hundred thousand dollars in two weeks.  Then I woke up into
this reality.  dang.</p>
