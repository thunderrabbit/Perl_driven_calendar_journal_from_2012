<p>Had lunch by the pool, next to a table of 6 people and three laptops.  I thought, &quot;LAN
party?&quot; but heard their conversation and realized they were doing some sort of data
acquisition.  Turns out they've got little motion sensor chips that they put on kids' arms to
measure how active they are at different times of the day.</p>

<p>Cool!  I got a picture of Johnny with tags around him.</p>
