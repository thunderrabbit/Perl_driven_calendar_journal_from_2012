<p>Today was thel day we learned the plow (difficult), and some other not so difficult things.  I
received a full hour massage from Air (teacher in training), and then was going to give massage to
her for an hour, but got switched to Shara last minute.  Fine with me; Shara is cute.  I switched to
reiki mode when she had some pain in her back (she has a misaligned vertebra) plus some pain in the
middle.</p>
