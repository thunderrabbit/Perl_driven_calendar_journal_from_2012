<p>The case of the missing sandal opened with the front door to my dorm.  I looked at the place
where I left my sandals last night and saw my right sandal, but not the left.  Every other pair of
shoes was a pair.  I looked briefly in the entry way, under the shoe shelf, and around the shoe
shelf, but my left sandal seems to have left.</p>

<p>I was reminded that Shara brought only one shoe to school yesterday, so couldn't go running
afterward, but that's surely a coincidence...</p>

<p>Christine joined me at breakfast, and we talked about A Course in Miracles and, semi-unrelated,
Eckhart Tolle being really cool *all the time*, while Deepak Chopra has a different vibe when
on-stage or off.</p>

<p>We headed back to our dorm and *bing*!  Two sandals!  wow!</p>

<p>Ahhh...  I see tooth marks and a bite missing from the left sandal.  Mystery solved.  Thank you,
Imm Eco staff for knowing from where the sandal had come!</p>
