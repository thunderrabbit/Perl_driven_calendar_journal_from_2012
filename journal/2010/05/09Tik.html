<p>Tik (pronounced &quot;teek&quot;) is the employee whose smile I've been enjoying while talking to
her at the desk of Imm Eco, where I'm staying.  She's the one with whom I negotiated to get my room
for 300 Bhat per day, (10,000 Bhat per month, actually) and who's taught me a bit of Thai language.
I gotsta start learning the character set, and need to switch my journal to UTF-8 pronto.  Yesterday
she let me use one of the lodge's rental bikes for free, and told me how to get to a market nearby,
wehre I bought some fruit, and some ??? nad ??? and ???? and ???? (those are question marks, not
misinterpreted thai characters) I have no idea what I bought, but most of it has been delicious,
actually all of it was delicious, thought I haven't tired everything yet.  Two more things to
try. of those that I bought,..  They were all dessert type things, which I'm sure helps support the
likelihood that they'd be delicious.</p>
