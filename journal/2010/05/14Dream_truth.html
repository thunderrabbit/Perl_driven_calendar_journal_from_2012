<p class="dream">Back in houston, I heard about a plan for the mayor and a few high ranking
officials to pull off a public stuent of detonating some smoke bombs in a public event with tons of
cameras to get public exposure that would make them go to ail and this would somehoe bring people's
awareness to get some truth around world trade center destruction.</p>

<p class="dream">As I was hearing about the plot, I wa pised at the government and trying to break
down th door to the white house office doing flying karate kicks at it, but no response.  So I went
to the big sideglass dors and I bent one to shatter it, but it just bent.  Fair enough, it was
noticibly torqued so they'd have to repair it.  My defense was going to be, this costs nothing
compared to all the bombs you're detonating in Afhanistan in your illegal war.</p>
