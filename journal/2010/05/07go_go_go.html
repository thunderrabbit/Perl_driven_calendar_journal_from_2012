<p>Souper-duper thanks to Soness for cute little notes in my bags, pocket and wallet!!  I've been
discovering them since we hugged and waved bye in Shinagawa.  She and Nino took Tokaido line with me
after I locked TJ Bike up in the bike parking lot in his own special spot and four locks plus
blessing for safe sleep until I get back on 7 August.</p>

<p>Plenty of time to get trains on time, and even time for soup (thank you Soness!!) and everything
is cooool.  Just a bit ago I was in line for more food and realized I had exchanged *all* my yen
for Thai Bhat.  hahahahaaha!!!  I guess I'll just wait for food on the plane.</p>

<p>Reading A Course In Miracles now, after Lisa suggested it.  It's dense with information.</p>
