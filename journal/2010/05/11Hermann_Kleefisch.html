<p>OMG, today I totally met an inspirational guy named Hermann Kleefisch.  He's
inspirational, not just because of his awesome name, white Abe Lincoln beard, or his white beret,
but because he wrote a book titled &quot;Around the World at 87&quot;</p>

<p>And that's 87 as in eighty-seven years old when he wrote the book, and he's still kickin' it
today with a happy humming whistling attitude..   wow oh wow!!</p>

<p>Basically I had to go to immigration to convert my single entry visa into a multiple entry
visa.  Most people there (including me, to an extent) were all more concerned with being first in
line and beating the system and getting what they came to get.  A man, humming a little tune, came
and sat near the back and I was like, &quot;I'm glad you're singing!  It's nice to see someone
happy even in the immigration office.&quot; and he goes, &quot;well, there's just no other way to
be!  I was in the war and nearly lost my life so now every day I'm alive I just remember that and
I'm happy!&quot; (or something like that, but more awesomely put).</p>

<p>We chatted for a bit, and he eventually took it a step further and showed me a square shape,
on which I recognized an image of his face, and then &quot;Around the World at 87&quot; and then
realized it was a book!  I pulled out my wallet immediately, &quot;how much is it?&quot; and bought
it on the spot.  He signed it, and gave me his email address, and we took a photo together.  I'll
put that up now.</p>

<p>Er, later, after I get my iPhone pictures synched.</p>
