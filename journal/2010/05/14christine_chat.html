<p>I bought some bananas on the way back, and just as I entered the Imm Eco driveway, I saw
Christine on the way out.  I tempted her with &quot;I got you something!&quot; and she came inside
with me, and we sat in my &quot;hot&quot; room.  (I haven't turned on the A/C since arrival, of
course.)</p>

<p>She was like, &quot;so what did you have?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I had a strawberry frappacino, and um...  hmm I can't remember...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, did you eat at Starbucks???&quot; she asked with surprise, cause we had planned to eat
at the nice riverside restaurant (where Christine and I had gone before).</p>

<p>&quot;No, um...&quot; I paused for mock dramatic effect, &quot;oh, that's right, she didn't show
up!&quot;</p>

<p>Christine's eyes widened like, &quot;interesting!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah; and she's the one who said 'I'll be there at 7:30,' twice, so... I didn't even call
her.&quot;</p>

<p>Inside, I answered Christine's question about why I didn't call Shara, &quot;did you not call her
out of pride?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmmmm. naw, it's partially from my men's group; we would call calling her 'caretaking.'
She's an adult; I'm an adult; I'm not going to take care of her, like 'don't forget, it's 7:30!'  If
she didn't show up, she had her own reasons, and I understand that.  The other reason may be about
what you were saying...  something like, we said 7:30 at Starbucks and I planned to go to dinner and
not anywhere else, so I wasn't going to call her and have her be all, 'oh why don't we go to
the blah blah blah instead?'  Nope; I'm not willing to go follow her around town.&quot;

<p>Conversation turned to fruit and health as we had a banana each and then used my マイハシ to have
a bite of raw honey each.  Yummmm.</p>

<p>Christine went to go get some water, and I just went over to see if she had any interesting
stamps in her passport.  &quot;No; I usually end up getting a new passport each time.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess she's not coming back over for more chatting, but I left my door ajar just in case.</p>

<p>Christine didn't come back and I just woke up with my light on and the door wide open.  I'm
pretty sure no one but the wind even walked by in the hall, much less came in.</p>
