<p class="note">(written 8:13pm ICT Thursday 20 May 2010 (day 14666))</p>

<p>And by &quot;just finished&quot; I mean I finished before 1pm, cause I elected to &quot;get my
test over with&quot; [sic] instead of waiting to do it in the afternoon (as if I would study during
lunch).   I gave massage to Shara, my favorite partner this class.  She might take the same second
class as me in 10 days; that would be great!</p>

<p>Anyway, I pretty easily rolled through 2 hours of massage, extended a bit by careful and
diligent care.  As feedback, she said I could have pressed harder (this has been recurring feedback
for me, from Ami to Silvia to Shara.  Silvia is also in this class).</p>

<p>We went to the vegetarian place for lunch</p>
