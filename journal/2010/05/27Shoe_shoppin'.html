<p>Nit just dropped me off at The Dorm, and I'm back in room 1111 after shoe shopping to replace my
sandals.</p>

<p>Went to Tesco with Nit in her nice brand name car.  We actually stopped by three different
shops, looking for just the right size/shape/color.  Got the first two, but couldn't get blue.  The
green reminded me of fatigues, an association I didn't really want, but she goes, &quot;I like
green,&quot; in a way that seemed genuine.  Got them.  Well, she paid, and got a receipt.  Imm Eco
is paying (and I guess, therefore, I'm paying, but not full price).</p>

<p>We got tasty beverages (watermelon slushee for her, banana slushee for me), and after we found
shoes, went to a Japanese restaurant, that was like a combination between kaitein sushi and nabe
restaurants.</p>
