<p>Got my ticket to Chiang Mai for 4382.50 Bhat, saw a guy walking around barefoot in the airport so
I'm optimistic I'll be barefoot here, at least on the weekends. (I'm not sure if I want to take
dirty feet in to be Thai massaged.)</p>

<p>The purchase of my ticket apparently left two seats on the plane.</p>
