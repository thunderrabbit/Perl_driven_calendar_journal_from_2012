<p>Krypto used my shaved head as his canvas tonight on stage at The Pink Cow for the second monthly
hair design event.  I have some hearts and arrows drawn like crop circles in my hair.  Great fun to
get it done and then dance dance dance dance while Leigh performed rap with Jon on shakuhachi,
Akira on Digeridoo, and Hide on guitar.  They have a name this time, but I forgot it.  Acid
something I think.</p>

<p>Emiko came at some point during the hair shaving.  I didn't see her come in, but I saw her
hiding in her favorite corner of the restaurant after I sent an email to Soness saying I was
getting my head shaved &quot;right now!!&quot;</p>

<p>Kana from PB 49 came as well, bringing her friend Mari, though they just missed the hair cutting
part.  They got to see the belly dancer, though.  I invited Emiko over to their table and they chat
chat chatted about stuff while I dance dance danced on the wall during Leigh and friends'
performance.</p>

<p>Met Ed after the whole thing was over over; he didn't even get to see the belly dancer, but he
saw me dancing to one final song by Leigh and the gang.  Ed is also from Texas.  UT Austin.  He's
been in Japan for twice as long as me.</p>
