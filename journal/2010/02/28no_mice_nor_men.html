<p>Mice and Men, a play based on the book by Steinbeck, was performed this weekend in Ebisu by
TIP.  I wanted to see the tidal wave more than I wanted to see the show, so I felt a bit lucky when
the trains were stopped for the tidal wave.  Unfortunately, there was no tidal wave, but the trains
didn't restart after I deemed things &quot;all clear.&quot;  I guess my sway in Japan isn't as
pervasive as I might have hoped.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got to the theater just as the play was over, and met Emiko, crying, on her way out;
we were supposed to have attended together, so I figured at least I could show up.  We ate a bit,
though it took her a bit to regain her appetite after the play.</p>

<p>Karaoke after that, and then we took the yamanote line from Ebisu to Tokyo where I got the 22:13
train to head home.  Emiko sat with me for a bit on the train before it left. We were in the front
of the green car, in the seats at platform level, just until a minute or two before the train
left. </p></p>

<p>After we were clear of the station, I moved up to the upper deck, cause that's where I really
wanted to sit.</p>
