<p>Tonight was Japanese Lounge Night at The Pink Cow.  I invited Taki and Emiko, but only Emiko
could come (but she invited her friend Izumi).  Tonight is the 11th Japanese Lounge Night, so Kumiya
gave a bit of a speech (while Traci tried to get the internet connected so they could broadcast the
night via UStream) and some of the performers described their instruments.  Apparently, shamisens
were originally covered with cat skin, but now kangaroo skin is more common.  The first performance
was two shakuhachi and 1 shamisen, then 1 shakuhachi and 1 shamisen, and then a koto master was solo
on koto and then, about halfway through the show, Soness called; she's back in Japan!  I was like,
&quot;eep!&quot; because the house isn't exactly clean, though basically it just needs vacuum and
clean my bed off the living room floor.  And refill cat litter.  But the laundry is pretty much all
done and everything else is in order.</p>

<p>Hmmm!  So I was suddenly focused more on emailing Soness than the music or conversation, then
told them the situation.  They were like, &quot;do you need to go?&quot; and I was like &quot;eep
eep, um, yes,&quot; and headed out.</p>

<p>Man, I hope I make it home before Soness does, so I can clean up just a <em>bit</em>.</p>
