<p>Taki, Emiko, and I went to see Avatar 3D today.</p>

<p>The movie was pretty good, and perhaps even nicer in 3D.  The glasses were a bit heavy; I wonder
what's in 'em?  There's some sort of light detector in the bridge of the glasses, that when covered,
makes the images a bit brighter, and the 3Dness go away.  Hmmmm.  But the view without the glasses
is even different than that; it's fuzzy (cause both eyes can see both images).</p>

<p>I wonder if they can really do that?  Projecting consciousness into a different body makes sense
that it could be done, but hmmm.</p>

<p>Shinagawa station is next.</p>
