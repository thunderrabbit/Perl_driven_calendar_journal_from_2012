<p>Last night the guys were like &quot;you gotta line up at 4 or 5am to be here on time to get
passes when they start handing them out at 6am.&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;pfff; I'll just come on March 1st [to line up for the unclaimed
passes]&quot;</p>

<p>When I got to the bike parking area this morning at 6:56, there were still passes available!  I
got one for me and for Soness.  Yay!!</p>

<p>I have keys to work today so I'm rocking in early, which made bike pass procurement possible.</p>
