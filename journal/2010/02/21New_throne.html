<p>Chez Soness features a porcelain waste disposal unit designed for a traditional asian squat.  To
support booties used to sitting, a plastic seat converts the squatter into an actual throne, if one
has a good enough imagination.  People with really good imaginations might even believe that the
previous seater's seat wasn't broken.  However, even a cursory inspection of the bottom of the old
seat would reveal I had implemented a fix of plastic bottle caps and chopsticks to support the seat
and keep its parts together, respectively.  This lasted a few months before its own failure.</p>

<p>Today, I rode Soness's yellow bike to Shimachu, and purchased a new throne to augment the
porcelain squatter.  I chose the one whose plastic seemed sturdier (thicker and more flexible,
actually) than a new 5800 yen unit identical(?) to the broken one at the crib. 11,500 yen for our
lovely new chair, but get this: it has a lock type thing to attach it to the existing
porcelain, <em>and</em> it has some kind of hydraulics that ensure it closes silently, so no one can
crash it.</p>
