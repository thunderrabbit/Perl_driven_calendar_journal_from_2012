<p class="dream">All set and readky to go, I looked down and realized I was naked.  Then I realized
I must be able to do something about it so I manifested clothing, and my wallet and cell phone.</p>

<p class="dream">Was in a hurry, and they said I had to bow with my hands over my head at each
point with flowers.  There were many such points so I walked backwards out of the maze and went
along a different maze which had fewer flowers.   I walked up the path for a bit and the floor came
up to meet the ceiling and it was really cramped and I couldn't figure out how to get out.  I
noticed a guy coming in through the ceiling and went over to him.  He had just gone down through a
trap door in the ground to get outside, and I was headed out and he goes &quot;you shouldn't go
out there; you'll likely be killed.  It's a war between Hamas and Israel.</p>

<p class="dream">I considered my options and went back down the way I had come and found an empty
bench seat and began to cry on the table.  A woman came up, complimenting my crying like it was
heartfelt.  [yeah?  That's why I'm crying.] I thought, and explained I was stuck and couldn't go
outside like I wanted.</p>
