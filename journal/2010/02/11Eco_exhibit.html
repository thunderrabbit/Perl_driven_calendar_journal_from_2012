<p>Emiko invited me to see an exhibition featuring myriad (50?) companies with an ecological focused
business model.  The first thing that I found interesting was a zipper chain thing that zips
together into a quite strong rod/structure/thing.  That company's
URL: <a href="http://tsubakimoto.com/">tsubakimoto.com</a>.  They may have a video of it in
action.</p>

<p>The second is a warm pack with liquid inside that when heated to 100C for 5 minutes will turn
translucent, and remain clear after it cools down to room temperature (and below, I assume).  Then
when jostled abruptly, it will turn opaque while releasing a good deal of heat energy that it
retains for an hour or so.  Wow!  Their url
is <a href="http://www.sanki.co.jp/">www.sanki.co.jp</a>.  I doubt a video would effectively show
the heat release, but the site may feature something interesting.</p>

<p>Emiko bought some lightweight modeling clay, which I agree feels quite light weight, but I don't
know what I'd *do* with it, so I wasn't interested.</p>

<p>I've also been carefully declining all pamphlets offered, even in English.  Not interested in
what they're selling, not interested in carrying paper, and it's not as eco friendly as a good ol'
URL.</p>
