<p>Lesson with Emiko tonight.  I gave her four or five books that Soness had given me to use as I
pleased.  They sat in a bag at work for 6 months and I was like, &quot;jeez&quot; and decided just
to offer them to Emiko.  They're actually about the right level for her, so she took them all.</p>

<p>Tonight, because the Pink Cow has Dr Sketchy's, we met in Mark City and had a lesson augmented
with ice cream.</p>
