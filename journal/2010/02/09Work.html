<p>Work was aight today.  Alfonzo was all, &quot;yo watch this to see if it looks right,&quot; and I
watched him code some changes to some files for about 30+ minutes.  'twas a bit boring, but I
enjoyed the mental break.  Then I got to work on some search classes that use an abstract class that
does most of the heavy lifting, taking into consideration the importance of various types of
matches.  Pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Though the search classes were originally my idea, Alfonzo put them together awesomely.</p>
