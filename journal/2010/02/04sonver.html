<p>Hung out with Joanna, Tallulah and Mike tonight in Kichijoji after Joanna and Tallulah's last
performance in Japan.</p>

<p>Mike's got a lot of interesting stories!  He's been in Japan for a while.  He was on Nijima when
Mijima blew up 10 years ago and stayed when people were evacuated until it got to the point they
were evacuated by helicopter after 3 days at a house that had been scheduled to host 40 people for
10 days.  Empty beach, plenty of food, plenty of volcano to watch.  Awesome!</p>

<p>Tallulah was telling me one of her favorite songs by NIN is &quot;A Warm Place&quot;  That's on
the album Broken, I think.  Right?</p>

<p>She's halfway from Sydney, so I asked if she knew Anikiko.  Nope.  I guess Sydney is bigger than
small enough for all musicians to know each other.</p>

<p>Oh, very interestingly, when I was telling her why I had come to Japan, and that I had found PB
and sorta stayed for that reason, she goes, &quot;are you Buddhist?&quot; and I was like,
&quot;wha?&quot; because how the heck did she discern that? I answered &quot;I've never said 'I am
Buddhist,' but I share a lot of the same precepts.&quot;</p>

<p>Though I originally went to see Joanna, I found out she's married.  Cool.  Next lifetime,
perhaps.</p>

<p>They're going to Hakone tomorrow.  I hope they enjoy a lovely lovely time!  Man I would love to
go.</p>

<p>After the show we were hosted at a bar/interior store in Kichijoji owned by the girlfriend of the
brother of the guy from the band Hekireki who owns the shop where Tallulah and Joanna played.  They
gave us a bottle of wine and water for me, plus snacks for all and we quite enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Might just hang out there again, かな。。</p>

<p>Joanna was telling me about the comraderie that's implicit between musicians.  I guess it's
similar to people who have sailed on PB.</p>
