<p>I must admit I probably can't realistically write a web browser.  It would certainly take a
while for me to learn how to enable offline access to information using Gears.  However, one or
more people working together at Google were able to create Chrome.  And Gears.  And Gmail, which,
on Firefox, enables offline access to emails.  So why not do the same with Chrome?</p>

<p>I know they want it to be a lean surfing machine, but to not incorporate an incredibly useful
part of my Gmail experience seems strange.  Now, persnaps (I just made that up, useful when a really
good idea comes up in brainstorming), given that Google makes money when people are online, they are
focused more on ubiquitous access to the intertubes moreso than variants of offline storage.</p>

<p>But until access reaches ubiquity, I want my email!!</p>
