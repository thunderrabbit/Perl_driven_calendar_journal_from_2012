<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>On 2 February, I sent in my application to join the 69th Global PB Voyage, leaving in mid
April and returning in mid July.  I'm applying to be a partner for  Hibakusha, special guests
who lived through the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki, in getting their stories out to
the world via the intertubes.</p>

<p>Don't know yet if I'll be accepted, but I'm optimistic.</p></li>

<li><p>I live alone now that Soness is on vacation for two weeks.  I'll be able to hopefully adjust
my schedule to wake up earlier and be more rested for morning meditation.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't yet told my student+friend Emiko that I may go on PB, but I have told Traci.</p></li>

<li><p>I-group hasn't met in a while, it seems; we keep cancelling for low attendance reasons.</p></li>

<li><p>I've not yet been in touch with Hinako, on whom I immediately developed a crush when I met
her over a month ago.  I have her contact info now though, so I may email her....  I haven't yet,
though cause I don't want her to say &quot;no&quot; or not even say anything.</p></li>

<li><p>I met Joanna and Tallulah on Wednesday, totally fell in love with Joanna solo on electric
cello (and looper) so when she finished her set, I went immediately up with cash in hand, &quot;I
want your CD&quot; and she was like, &quot;wow!&quot; and when I heard she had another CD, I pulled
out another 1000 yen.  &quot;I'd like your other CD too,&quot; and got some pics and hugs and it was
great.  Went to see them again in Kichijoji last night for their last show in Japan for a while.  Hung out with
them + Mike, who was helping coordinate+translate for them, and the band Hekireki, members of which
work in a cool bar in Kichijoji that doubles as an interior store during the day.</p></li>

<li><p>I've barely started a project to rewrite my journal index using Python + Django.  It's just
got a Hello World to show that it's running for now, so I shan't link it yet. django.robnugen.com</p></li>

<li><p>I've got to move a bit of money to the US to pay for my Amazon Storage, about $4.  The money
is so minor; it's the currency conversion that's more of an issue.  Actually I don't even know that
my GoLloyd's account... in fact, I'm sure my GoLloyd's account is pointing at the wrong account
number cause they closed it without notifying me when I had zero balance.  Wamu customer service
went down the crapper and never looked back.</p></li>

<li><p>Currently girlfriendless, though sometimes Emiko and I are a bit cuddly.  I really don't
know what she'd like optimally, but I'm enjoying the non-committed platonic play.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer CD drive doesn't always read CDs and doesn't usually spit them out on the first try.</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone has a buncha games on it.</p></li>
</ol>
