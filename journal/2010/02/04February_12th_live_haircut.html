Yo Rob!

Wassup man, hope uve been enjoying ur week.

If you are willing to be the canvas for my hair show on the 12th, then you'd only need to make sure
your head is shaved so its ready for the pattern [like a blank canvas]. Anything between 3mm and 5mm
all over should be ok.

Because I have limited time on the stage, I wouldnt have enough time to shave it myself, so il be
doing just the pattern.

Let me know if you're up for it mate!

PEACE
