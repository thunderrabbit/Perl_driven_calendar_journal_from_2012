<p>Improv-a-Go-Go featured the funniest line ever.  Before playing the question game, they asked for
a relationship between two people.  I yelled &quot;tie salesman!&quot; cause one of them was wearing
a tie.  Then someone else goes, &quot;and hippy!&quot; cause the other one looked slightly less well
dressed than someone wearing a tie, and it was really funny to imply him a hippy.</p>

<p>The scene started and the tie guy was selling ties, spending some time looking &quot;do you think
I only carry paisley ties?&quot; &quot;are you sure that's paisley?&quot; &quot;did you want
paisley?&quot; and then the hippy, who missed a line after having gotten sidetracked with a virtual
refer, went off stage, and put the virtual refer into the tie salesman's mouth.</p>

<p>Next guy came on, and they kept the same scene, but now the tie salesman was blitzed and he
stepped back from the tie rack and goes, &quot;are those really ties or are you just fuckin' with
me???&quot;</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!</p>

<p>I spent a bit of time explaining it to Emiko, who humored me by agreeing it must have been
funny. (*)  We had just had our weekly lesson, though she hadn't done homework so the lesson didn't
last a full hour.  Maybe a full half hour.</p>

<p>(*) Shasta and I agreed it was the funniest line of the night.</p>
