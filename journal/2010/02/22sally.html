<p>I'm writing this after the fact, but I think Monda 22 Feb was the day I heard from Sally who said
her husband had walked out on her 2 weeks before.  I was like, &quot;Doood!&quot; and expressed
several other expressions of shock, cause, dude!  I chatted with her on Skype for a while and
discerned that she's much better composed than I guessed she would be.  When I heard she had gone
ahead and done the trip they had planned for their first year anniversary, but did it alone, in an
area remote enough that there was no cellular coverage, for a week, I thought wowwwwwww; that was
probably the awesomest thing she could have done for herself.  Good onya mate!</p>

<p>She's looking carefully at the whole situation: the difficulty of them being newlyweds, in a new
country, removed from family, and having just moved within the previous month...  wow tough stuff.
They had each gone to counseling, but not marriage counseling, though they had made an appointment
just before he left.  She went to the appointment alone.  Good onya mate!  So I'm glad she's staying
sane despite the changes around her.  Sally is such an awesome friend and awesome human.  I know she
will come out of this with shining colors.</p>
