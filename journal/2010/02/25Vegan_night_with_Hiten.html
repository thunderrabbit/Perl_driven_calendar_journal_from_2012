<p>Hiten emailed me, &quot;when are you going to The Pink Cow?&quot; and I told him today for vegan
night, so he was like, &quot;cool; I'll be there,&quot; and actually we ended up walking in together
cause I nearly passed him on the street up to The Pink Cow except that he recognized me.  I was
like, &quot;yo&quot; <em>dang what's his name?  Arturo?</em>, but didn't &quot;remember&quot; until
he introduced himself to someone else.  Man, I didn't even remember that he and I had met six months
ago at The Cow and found out we both know some of the same peeps from UH in Taub!  When he was like,
&quot;yeah, remember we met here and both realized we went to UH...&quot; and he told the rest of
the story, I was like, &quot;oh yeah!!!&quot; cause it did ring bells in my brain.</p>

<p>I'm sure I'd remember more if we had met more recently.</p>

<p>We reminisced about the bridge that floods up near my dad's house and ice cream socials at UH and
the loud kids on 3rd floor Taub.  Good times.</p>
