<p>OMG.  <a href="http://www.sonver.co.uk/">Joanna plays the most awesomest cello music</a> ever
ever ever on this dope looking wooden skeleton electric cello.  Completely immersed in her ipote,
sonver energy pours through the strings into the air we breathe, passionate music simply alive with
angels playing through her.</p>

<p>Each part of her music has its own flavor and feel; when she loops them and plays them all
together it's like an sonver orchestra for the senses.  Ears enjoying each carefully layered sounds,
eyes enjoying her long black outfit and cool wooden electric cello, spirit enjoying the presence of angels,
mind enjoying the delicious happy feelings, and brain enjoying that she often plays with eyes
closed, all make for a exquisite event.</p>

<p>I giggled when she said &quot;this is the best drum machine ever,&quot; while pulling out
a hairbrush.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was awesome.  I got pictures with Joanna, and will go see them (*) perform again tomorrow
night if I still have a crush on her.</p>

<p>(*) them = Joanna and Tallulah; who are playing on tour.  Apparently Joanna is the backup
musician, but I must say I like her music better.  Tallulah plays awesome guitar and awesome vocals
that made me smile more than once.  But man, Joanna's cello... just tip top superlative...</p>

<p>I still have a crush on Joanna; I'll almost certainly go see her after work tonight.</p>
