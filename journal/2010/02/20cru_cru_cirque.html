<p>Instead of bevvies, I joined Emiko and Taki in Ikebukuro for the final moments of their meal and
then we headed to a stage called P.A.C. where we saw a pretty cool performance, that while not
necessarily technically perfect, was extremely creative, and required a pretty good deal of strength
and agility from its three performers.  It was no Cirque du Soleil, but neither was the size of the
crowd.  We had a chance to talk to the performers afterward.  My favorite part was them juggling
three big white yoga balls.  Second favorite was a performance broadcast sideways on screen to make
it look like a guy who was laying down was actually sitting up, and when he looked like he was lying
down, he was actually standing up.  Quite clever use of an imposing building support column on the
stage.</p>
