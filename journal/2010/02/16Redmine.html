<p>We use <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> to handle issue tracking at work.  I
realized a great thing about it.  I can use it as a way to get things out of my brain.  It used to
be that my brain would overload with trying to keep just a few things in it, &quot;gotta fix this
class, therefore change how that code calls the class, and I need to ah crap I forgot the first
thing,&quot; so now I can just make tickets for each thing, and keep my brain clear.  That's exactly
what the Getting Things Done book teaches.  Write everything down so you don't have to remember
*anything*.  Just enjoy life!</p>
