<p>Emiko and I went skating at the seasonal outdoor rink in œªÀ‹Ã⁄.  Fortunately, there was a bit
of precipitation, so not many people were on the rink.  Even more fortunately, the temperature was
right around freezing, so the precipitation was snow!  She was a bit shakey at first, but got much
better during the hour or so we were out there.  Zipping around the small track, I fell twice.  The
first time I thought I was just ridiculously clumsy, but the second time I realized what happened:
there's basically a brake on the front of the skate!  I skate without brakes on my inline skates,
so the front brake threw me off, and by off I mean onto the ground!</p>

<p>A group of about 10 English speakers appeared after a bit, and one of them was doing some strange
jump thing, so I was like &quot;yo yo whatchoo doing?&quot; and he said he was trying a new jump
that his friend the professional skater was teaching them.  So I went to her and she taught me the
trick of the front brake: it's not a brake, it's a toe pick, and it's not a way to stop, but a way
to jump!  I can basically skate fast and lean forward onto the left toe pick and jump as hard as
possible, landing on my right skate.  Cool!!  It took me about 4 tries to become comfortable with
full speed jumps.  I was like &quot;thank you!&quot; to her and she was like &quot;no
worries!&quot; and &quot;pretty good jumps!&quot;  Nice.</p>

<p>Turns out she's not professional, though she'd like to be.  I didn't trade name nor contact info
with her, though part of me wants to have.</p>

<p>Emiko got tired before I did, then came back out and we skated some more.  Then got tired again
and that's when I learned how to jump.  I got a bit tired, plus my kneecaps were a bit bruised from
my two tumbles, the second of which was more ninja like, as I rolled right back up and kept
skating.</p>
