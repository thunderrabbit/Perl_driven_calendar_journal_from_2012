<p>Wow!  Though I have no photographic proof, I just
saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Yellow">Dr Yellow</a>!!  I'm on the shonan shinjuku
line going north, and Dr Yellow was going south on the shinkansen line (of course, cause Dr Yellow
isn't a human doctor, but a short bright yellow train that checks the shinkansen (bullet train)
tracks).</p>
