<p>I arrived around 4:15pm to meet with Moonie before her trial lesson with Asako (?), who never
showed up.  Turns out she never confirmed our meeting time for 5pm, but I didn't even notice that
until Moonie was like, &quot;and what's her name?&quot; so I looked up the email and realized though
I had confirmed the student's first choice of lesson time, she hadn't reconfirmed with me.  Dang.
So I apologized to Moonie and we just chatted a bit until she had to work.</p>
