<p>Last night I discovered (haha, like I'm a talent
scout) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Ciaela">Ciaela</a> on Youtube, a site that allows
anyone with an Internozzle to present a series of images and sounds (usually sychronized), in a
descrete unit called a &quot;video.&quot;  These &quot;videos&quot; of images and sounds are then
made freely available to anyone else with an Internozzle, much to the apparent chagrin of those who
own old school media outlets.</p>

<p>Anyway, Micaela is cute, and I'm impressed with her ambition to learn Japanese when she first
came to Japan back in '05.  I think that's what she said.</p>
