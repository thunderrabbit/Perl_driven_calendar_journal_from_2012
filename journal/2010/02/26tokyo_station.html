<p>Went to Tokyo station to walk around with Emiko.  We got beverages at Ig Cafe on the fifth floor
of some building and sat on some cushioned seats outside the cafe, facing a wall with some carved
plates on it.  Because Emiko had said she read an article about exploring caves in the Tokyo area,
I was like, &quot;wow; I wonder if these are natural formations?&quot; as we rode up the escalator
in the big cave of a building.</p>
