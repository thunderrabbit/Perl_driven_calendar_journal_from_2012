<p>After the eco thing, we went to The Pink Cow for our lesson.  We first spent about 30 minutes in
near silence as she did homework and I worked on a maze.  I intend for it to be a two sided maze,
printed across two pages of my book, so I made little crossover points along the outer border of
the page, allowing for paper cropping, so the crossover points are basically long black bars that
extend to the edge of the paper.</p>

<p>I wonder how many pages of maze I can do this way without getting bogged down.  I'm guessing
five.</p>

<p>The restaurant was relatively quiet so I got to hang out with Moonie a bit.  She's so cute!</p>
