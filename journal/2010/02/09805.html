<p>If I have to get to work by 9am, I like to take the 8:05 train, which goes straight to Shibuya
(and beyond)
with just one stop between Chigasaki and Shibuya.  Today, ironically (*), I was unable to get a
ticket for the 8:05, so I got one for the 8:26 train (which leaves from a different platform).  The
guy smurfing tickets was like, &quot;you need to go to platform five,&quot; and I was like,
&quot;yep!&quot; and turned away for a bit.  Dang.</p>

<p>Last night in I-group, I spoke about getting antsy/pissy when I'm late for things, and a solution
came to mind: leave myself more time to go places.  So I left Chez Soness this morning at 7:45am,
rode TJ Bike gently and slowly to the station, without squishing any of the little kids who walk to
school around the same time.  Got to the bike parking lot so early that fewer than 30 percent of the
spots had been taken on the third level.  Ambled over to the train station, and boop; no more 8:05
tickets were available.</p>

<p>Aight, this is intractable; I'm not prepared to be pissy about missing the train because some kid
says I have to be on a different platform.  I just went past him using the stairs adjacent to the
escalator where he was posted.</p>

<p>He didn't say anything (I don't know if he saw me or what), and I'm thankful for that.</p>
