<p>This entry is called &quot;tsunami nashi&quot; because, in Japanese, tsunami means tsunami, and
nashi means, in addition to pear, nothing, as in, there was no tsunami despite the warnings, police,
and maps saying it could be two meters.  I went to the sea to watch.  We got nothing.</p>

<p>But the good news is I met a guy named Yasuo who actually met me, saying 「津浪見に来たの？」
(but I ignored him at first cause there were, in addition to &quot;a guy every 20 meters watching
the ocean,&quot; as I told Alfonzo, several guys in uniforms telling us how we weren't allowed to be
there,) and then &quot;Hello?  Did you come to watch the tidal wave?&quot; and we started chatting
and I found out he also lives in the neighborhood of Chez Soness.</p>

<p>Though I left him in the proverbial dust of Soness's yellow bike on my way to the train station,
the trains (on the Tokaido Line) are *still* stopped (and have been since before 1:20pm when I first
arrived to head up to Ebisu for Mice and Men by TIP), so he caught up with me and now we are eating
at the tempura shop inside the station.</p>

<p>Tokaido Line is still stopped, but Yasuo talked to a guy who was like, &quot;yeah the wavelength
of tsunami is pretty long, so probably stopped until evening.&quot; I was like, &quot;no way!&quot;
and he goes, &quot;way&quot; and though the conversation didn't get the trains started, he did
suggest taking the Sagami Line to Atsugi, then the Odakyu Line to Shinjuku, and Yamanote to Ebisu.
It should all be free on my train pass, though I don't know if I'll have to show it to the guy at
the various windows, or if I can just beep on through.</p>

<p>Said bye to Yasuo, who is going to study or something in the area.</p>

<p>Nice.  The guy at the end of the Inokashira Line in Shibuya erased from my PASMO any trace that I
had used the Odakyu Line today.  (not for secrecy nor security reasons, but just so the ticket gates
wouldn't charge me.  For some reason the ticket gates haven't been programmed to allow free access
on tsunami days.)</p>
