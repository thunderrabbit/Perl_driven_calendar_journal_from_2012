<p>We sought sustenance and found a sushi shop in the &quot;Casual Dining&quot; area.  Not so
casual about the prices, 130 yen to 1000 yen per plate = 2 sushi each.  I mean 130 is fine, but
most things I wanted were at least 280 per plate.</p>

<p>Okay, so anyway, it was fine, and the plates were pretty.  I noticed one of the shrimp heads had
fallen behind its partner which remained on their plate.  After a few revolutions, the lagging
shrimp head was removed from the conveyor.</p>

<p>I wondered how long it would take the staff to identify the different plate designs just from
the edges.  They were different enough that it could certainly be done.  I figured it would take
about a day of practice to do it confidently enough to not need verification.  Or maybe, I thought,
maybe the plates each have an RFI tag which can be scanned and thereby priced.</p>

<p>We got full after about 11 plates between us and it came time for my questions to be answered.
The waitress took apart our stack of plates, sorted them, and punched in each color's quantity into
her hand held thing.</p>
