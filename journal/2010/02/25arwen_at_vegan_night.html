<p><em>ARWEN!!!</em> came to vegan night tonight, and, after much encouragement that she and her
friend could squeeze in, came to sit at our table.  After some people left, including Hiten, I came
to sit by her, and after we talked for a bit about PB, Yuki, who had been sitting quietly across
from us, did some amazing magic tricks with cards.  Like really wow!  How'd he do that???  He had
each of us (three people) choose a card from the deck, at the same time, and then as we
&quot;called&quot; our card aloud, he popped it out of the deck.  Like at the same time.  Then for
the last one he got the wrong card, but then held it in his hand and magically it turned into the
right card.  OMG!!  so cool and we were right there watching his every move.  How'd he do it?</p>

<p>Though she left before I could say bye to everyone and walk to the station with her, Arwen is so
funny.  How does she do it???</p>
