<p>Slight snowfall last night so that it looked like a few inches on a car and few sprinkles on
trees, but none on the ground, and now that I'm on the train 1/3 of the way to work, I don't see
any.  I sorta bet the &quot;few inches&quot; on the car wasn't more than an inch.  The car was
white so its paint blended with snow.</p>

<p>I'm a bit late headed in to work, precipitated by Alfonzo going, &quot;yeah, make it 10
tomorrow,&quot; and then furthered by my forgetting that an hour later at work doesn't mean an hour
later starting out on the train.</p>
