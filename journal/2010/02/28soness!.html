<p>Just as I sat down in the upper deck seats, Soness called!  In a beautiful synchronicity, she
was in Shinagawa, ready to get on the same train as me.  Sweet, so I rotated the seats in front of
me to convert them into foot rests and we got to hug and chat all the way home.  I hadn't really
gotten to talk to her since her trip to north america (Vancouver and her hometown in Florida), so
that was really nice to bond.  She'll be headed out to Honkers soon for NLPT training, so that's
really cool too!  It's been my greatest pleasure to see her fantastic reformation, from sobbing
broken hearted to beautiful strong woman.</p>
