<p>We had our second US for Okinawa meeting tonight.  This time at the PB office in Takadanobaba.
Kimi, a woman who found out about us from our action in Yoyogi, joined tonight's meeting.  She'll
help do some copy editing over the next few days.  I'm going to ask a few of my peeps if they know
some peeps who are interested in this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Big hug to Rose at the end for being such an awesome human.</p>
