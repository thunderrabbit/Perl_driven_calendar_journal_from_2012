<p>Soness forgot her camera and asked me to mail it to her.  Went to the post office and they were
like, &quot;yeah is there a battery in it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yeah, um, we can't send batteries through the mail.&quot;</p>

<p>I took the battery out.  &quot;There's no battery in it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, um, please wait a moment while we confer.&quot;</p>

<p>And they had a meeting, then came back, &quot;uh yeah, is there a memory card, an esss deee card
in it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;  Are you afraid its going to explode in a vaccuum?  I'm pretty sure it's safe.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, um, please wait a moment while we confer.&quot;</p>

<p>And they had a meeting, then came back, &quot;okay, you can keep the memory card inside the
camera and send it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;good.&quot;  wowwwwwww.zzzzzz</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, just fill out this form with your name, address, phone number, and the recipient's
name, address, phone number, the package contents, digital camera, and be sure to write &quot;no
battery&quot; below that and put the date here and sign here.&quot;</p>

<p>I did that, and then they produced another piece of paper, an <em>invoice</em>, she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, now just fill out this invoice with your name, address, phone number, and the recipient's
name, address, phone number, the package contents, digital camera, and be sure to write &quot;no
battery&quot; below that and put the date here and sign here.&quot;</p>

<p>I did that, and she carefully folded it and put it into a plastic sleeve where no one will see
it until the end of time, unless Soness decides to open it and see that I sent her a digital camera
with no battery.</p>

<p>I will say, on the positive side, the camera should be perfectly safe, wrapped like a 4 year old
in the snow.  I was also granted permission to write a note to Soness to explain that she'd need to
get a battery.  I assume she will be able to buy one in Vancouver, but she may just end up with a
new camera.  (are you happy now, camera manufacturer, changing battery shapes to force such
purchases?)  ANSI, help!</p>
