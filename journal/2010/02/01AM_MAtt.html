<p>Matt came to couch surf at Chez Soness last night, but hadn't gotten confirmation from Soness
beforehand; she would have said no cause she has a big photo shoot to do today and needs to prepare
for that instead of playing hostess.  To help Soness, I helped Matt get out of the house early
(6:30am), and got him to an internet cafe with a shower this morning.  This was during the time I
needed to get my bicycle parking pass so TJ Bike can park in the parking lot during February, so my
morning went 5:40am wake up, call a taxi for 6am, oh not available so 6:30am, TJ Bike to bicycle
parking lot, get bike pass request form, TJ Bike back home, taxi with Matt to station, talked to
koban for directions to internet cafe, walked with Matt and three bags to internet cafe, dropped him
off, walked back to bike parking, got my bike parking pass, walked home, sat in meditation 15
minutes, then rode TJ Bike to bicycle parking lot with just enough time to not rush and still get on
8:05 train.</p>
