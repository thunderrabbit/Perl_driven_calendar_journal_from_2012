<p>Big fun of course with the GET Challenge today.  We basically split up into group and visited a
museum each.  My group and Jon's group both went to a music museum, which I found cooler than I
expected in that they had a bunch of old timey juke boxes (semi flexible metal discs with holes
though which air blew to play the drums/pipes, or to make some type of visual thing move).  The
were really cool, and made me wonder about the market for them, back in the day.  I mean, how many
could have been made?  Was there a disc industry of people making music by banging holes into
discs?  Who bought the players?</p>

<p>The coolest one for me had a scene on the front with a variety of characters doing a variety of
things, from a guy taming a wild alligator, to a goose chattering, a woman feeding balls to a
monster, and various other things I don't remember.  Such incredibly intricate parts, all with
their own timing.  Who made it?  How?  How does it work????</p>

<p>My granddad would say, &quot;you can take it apart and *see* how it works.  I want to know how
your electronic <em>calculator</em> works.&quot;</p>

<p>I got a gave lots of hugs from ah I forgot her name and threw away the paper, a fifty+ year old
woman who was super genki.  She invited me to join them for beverages afterward, but I declined.</p>
