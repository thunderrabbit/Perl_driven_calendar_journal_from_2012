<p class="dream">Near some wealthy women in Tokyo who were talking about their need for a massage,
and I was like, &quot;have you tried Thai massage?&quot; and they were like, &quot;what's
that?&quot; and then one of them was like, &quot;oh, is that religious massage?&quot; and I go,
&quot;it's not religious, but it is spiritual,&quot; and then they were getting on a train and had
to go before I told them that I could give Thai massage.  But I was a bit more optimistic about
being able to give massage in Tokyo.</p>
