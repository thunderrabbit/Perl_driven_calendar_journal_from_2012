<p>Learned Cat's name again during lunch today.  This time was after a more interesting discussion
about epp (though I didn't mention that name), tantra, Powers of Ten, living with awareness, and
festivals in Melbourne, where she lives.  &quot;Hmmmm; maybe I should learn your name...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... C - A - T,&quot; I spelled, after remembering having had the discussion before.</p>

<p>I noted my desire to find her on Facebook, stay in touch, and move to Melbourne.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>She left, and Erin sat where Cat had been.  She's from Vancouver, so I asked, &quot;do you know
Audrey Howatson?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes I do!&quot;</p>

<p>I did a dance, running out into the street!  Whoohooo!  It worked!</p>

<p>She went to high school with Audrey.  I sailed on PB's Topaz with Audrey.  Awesome!!</p>

<p>Quietly at our table Raquel was sitting.  She's from Peru, but I couldn't think of anyone I know
from Peru.  &quot;I'm the first!&quot;  Yep!</p>
