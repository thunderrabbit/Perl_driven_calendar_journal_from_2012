<p class="dream">Outside at night, we watched two police officers call in some support when a
routine traffic stop became a fight with drunken beligerants who were put into prison underground.
I was curious as to what it would be like, so went down as well.</p>

<p class="dream">Trapped inside a building was supposed to be funny at first with rubber skulls but
things began to get scary with rubber skulls that moved by themselves and monsters coming to get
me.</p>

<p class="dream">Running away from the rotting filth coming from one area, looking for a sign of
light in the back of the rooms along the underground hallway, I saw something that looked promising,
but I'd have to get past some corpse skeletons.  Pushed them aside with a bicycle frame and then
ran to jump and break through the wall and made it ouside with them chasing me, but I flew away
faster than they could fly with their broken bodies.</p>

<p class="dream">Got back to the meeting point where my hopefully new girlfriend was sitting, and I
sat in optimistic silence or a bit, and then popped the big question, &quot;would you be interested
in dating me for the foreseeable future?&quot;  and she was like, &quot;mmmmm yeh naow when you ask
like that I don't know let's just see how it gos,&quot; an I was like, &quot;d'oh!!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Then a plastic toy arrived which I opened and turned on; its soundtrack had
been replaced by something that kept saying something gibberish and Lisa's name, and Shawn's anme
and Shane's name, and I turned it off and said, &quot;Lisa, take care of yourself,&quot; and then
turned to Shawn and Shane and asked if they knew how to create decrees and walked them through the
process of invoking a decree to protect themselves from the person or entities who had created this
toy.</p>

<p class="dream">While reciting the protection spells, I woke up.</p>
