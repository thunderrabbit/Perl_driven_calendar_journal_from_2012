<p>Had to push hard to get anything close to a decent price for a taxi; dude wanted 900 baht at
first, and I was like, &quot;no way,&quot; and he went to 800.  Two women who were sharing the same
taxi were given the price of 500 by their counter rep, so I planned to pay that much as well.</p>

<p>Chatted with them on the way from the airport to Phuket town.  Ali was most talkative because
Jess's ears also hurt from some sort of sinus thing.  They're both just out of uni in The Bay Area
of northern California, and wanted to do this trip before embarking on their next adventures.  Job
for Ali (I didn't ask her what), and law school for Jess, because she &quot;likes to
argue.&quot;</p>

<p>They were in Chiang Mai for the past couple of days, and plan to head to Vietnam after chillin'
in Phuket area for a bit.  Interestingly, they said their friend got to stay just one night in Koh
Phi Phi and said it may have been his biggest regret of his trip, having pushed it to the end and
had to head back sooner than he wanted to leave Koh Phi Phi.  I'm glad, therefore, that I'll be
there a five days.</p>

<p>I told Paige I'd be on the 8:30am ferry, but it was fully booked when I arrived at the counter,
so I got passage on the 13:30 ferry (500 baht).</p>

<p>Arrived at my hotel first, and I gave them my card because they're also going to Koh Phi Phi
(&quot;tomorrow or the next day&quot;)</p>

<p>Got out and the guy was like, &quot;800&quot; and I was like, &quot;500&quot; and he continued to
give me 200 baht change for my 1000 baht note.  I was like, &quot;dude, no,&quot; and walked away
without giving him any money.</p>

<p>He didn't pursue me; I had expected him to be like, &quot;okay okay 500,&quot; but he just stood
there and then eventuallly got into the car and was driving off by the time I had woken up the
clerk behind the counter and gotten 500 baht note to give to the taxi driver.</p>

<p>I really wonder if Ali and Jess were like, &quot;omg wtf&quot; during the time that I hadn't
paid.  I may ask them if they write me.</p>
