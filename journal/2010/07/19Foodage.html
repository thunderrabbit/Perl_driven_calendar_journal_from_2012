<p>After visiting Mint, Dah, Natalie, Shawn, and Shane in their classroom after class, during which
we did some random physical exercises, including frog jumps (though they were calling the gorilla
jumps (um, guys, I'm pretty sure gorillas don't jump, and if they do, I don't want to be around)
for some reason) and I tested Natalie's gluteus timing (off) and trained her to get back to correct
timing.  (that was something I learned in the class with Trayl.)</p>

<p>Shawn finished up a massage with someone while Shane was two-stepping with Natalie, and Mint
headed out to do whatever.</p>

<p>Ate dinner with Shane and Shawn after that and Shawn got me up to date on the latest (not so
good) antics at ImmEco, including terribly dirty pool, being kicked out of their room (for which
they paid ahead 1 month) for one night, and last night having to deal with ten drunken Aussie girls
in the pool at 4am.  Dang.</p>

<p>The food was good.</p>
