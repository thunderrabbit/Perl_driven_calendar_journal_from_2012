<p>I slept for a bit and then Neir came home and we chatted a bit and then went to dinner at Cosmic
(for my fourth time.  (During my four visits, I got 4 cheeze pizza twice and 4 cheeze calzone twice.
Though they've got the same ingredients, I like the pizzas better, cause there's less air
involved.))  I'm counting each four cheese item as 4 cheeses, so I've therefore had 16 cheeses so
far here on Phi Phi.</p>
