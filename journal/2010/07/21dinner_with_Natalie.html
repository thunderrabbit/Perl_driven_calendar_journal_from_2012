<p>We had Padthai, and talked about our respective significant relationships.  Then we had dessert
(sharing my favorite, kohnamkrok (sp), and her favorite, roti), and then getting tasty beverages
(yogurt drink for me and soft drink for her).</p>

<p>I'm a bit overfull, but happily home, safely and soundly.</p>
