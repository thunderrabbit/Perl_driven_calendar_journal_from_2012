<p class="dream">Flying over a river over a waterfall, I noticed the bright blues and whites o ice
covering the river and trees and nature all around and in the river.  I knew I could do anything,
so I flew super high speed over the snowy ground to watch the river below, and then flew backwards
up the waterfalls to do it all again.</p>

<p class="dream">The second time, some dogs wanted to follow me, but I thought they might slip on
the ice and get hurt, so I willed them to stay back, so they did.  I flew back into a room where
Avery and some others were waiting, and I began to lose the ability to fly, but still knew I was
dreaming.  I thought I could hear snoring, and I was like, &quot;I wonder if that's my body?&quot;
and I wondered in what position it was resting versus my dream body floating in air.</p>

<p class="dream">I looked up and saw the ceiling, and was like, &quot;let's go!&quot; wanting to
fly upward through all the ceilings, but didn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>hmph.</p>
