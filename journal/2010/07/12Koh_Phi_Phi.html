<p>Met Neir and Paige at Sea Frog and we're now at <del>Churun</del> <ins>Chunut</ins>, room 10,
while Paige and Darren are a bit up the hill from us.</p>

<p>Supa special thanks to Neir, who has solved my cash problems, giving me 3200 baht.  The hotel is
1400 baht for the week, and food should hopefully be less than that.  I just paid him back $100 via
PayPal.</p>
