<p>Met Linh at Sunshine to let her practice massage on me.  Olivier is here as well; I want to ask
him how he's funded his bicycling adventure.  Saw Trayl for a bit, and two others are here from
Linh and Olivier's class.  I was 15 minutes late, so told Linh I'd give her 15 minutes of massage.
She wanted some work done on her back, and I think she liked it.</p>
