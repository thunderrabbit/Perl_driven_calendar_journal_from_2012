<p>Presently chilling outside the immigration office, on a chair, next to a table, in a little
covered area that includes a smaller covered area fully stocked with fruits, cakes, coffees, tasty
beverages, a cashier, and a cash register.</p>

<p>For 50 baht (150å†† ($1.70)), I got a M-size banana, 300ml OJ, and 400 cc of banana cake.</p>

<p>Several minutes ago, I completed the process of turning in my request for visa extension.  The
process included</p>

<ol>
<li><p>writing my name in a log book</p></li>
<li><p>waiting for the guy to come and read the list of names until he reached my name</p></li>
<li><p>get a number from the machine</p></li>
<li><p>wait for the counter peeps to call the number</p></li>
<li><p>go get photocopies of the front page and Thai visa pages in my passport</p></li>
<li><p>find out I can only get a 7 day extension (wtf?)</p></li>
<li><p>oh wait, 30 day extension (whew!)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Though one might quickly think the logbook of names is a waste, one might later realize it gives
one benefit.  When writing our names, we write the reason for coming to the immigration office, so
when the guy gets to our name, he knows which thai-scripted button to press on the machine, thereby
putting us in different numbered queues, which allows individual counter agents to focus on only
certain types of paperwork requests.</p>

<p>Different solutions include</p>

<ol>
<li><p>allow no visitors to Thailand</p></li>
<li><p>require all visitors be fluent in reading Thai</p></li>
<li><p>offer translations of the meanings of each button
<li><p>dispose of the concept of &quot;countries&quot; and &quot;immigration&quot;</p></li>
</ol>
