HI Audrey!!!

Guess who's in Thailand for 3 months, taking Thai massage classes, largely on your implicit recommendation?

Me!   And I'm loving it here in Chiang Mai, with 2.3 weeks to go on my 3 month adventure!

Guess who's across the hall from me in the school?  Erin N!!

At lunch, she was like, "I'm Erin," etc and then when she goes, "from Vancouver," I go, "Vangroovey;
do you know Audrey H??" and she was like, "totally; we went to high school together!!"

I did a little dance and ran out into the street in celebration!  Whooo it worked!  I know someone
who knows someone!!

She said you're instructing yoga now; awesome.

Guess who lives on Koh Phi Phi, just 12 hours away from me?  Paige D!

I went to see her and her boyfriend last week.  omg what an island!  It's a bit too much party-time
for me at night, but I sure loved exploring the jungle and coast during the day!

I always hope you're doing well.  :-)   Thank you for being great and inspirational.

In other news, my cute rabbit Francois is traveling somewhere on his own, so now I'm traveling with
a Cow and Bear, each with their own websites: <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">http://u.cow.fly2.nu/</a> <a href="http://abj.fly2.nu/">http://abj.fly2.nu/</a>
