<p>Air took me to the clinic this morning to have them scope my foot; I got a little scrape that
didn't quite heal as quickly as I normally do, so I thought there may be some benefit to having it
scoped by someone knowledgeable about these things.</p>

<p>Good stuff: the doctor's native language was English.  His fee was 50 baht (enough for two
lunches).  Registration at the clinic cost 10 baht (enough for a bottle of water at a grocery store,
but not a convenience store).  The 1/2 tube of cream I had remaining (purchased for athletes foot)
was deemed acceptable for my current ailment, therefore cost 0 baht (enough to watch TV in a mall).
He did suggest some soap which I bought for 155 baht (enough for five lunches and three bottles of
water hahah).</p>
