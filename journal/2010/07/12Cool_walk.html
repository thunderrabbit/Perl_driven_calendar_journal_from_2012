<p>Just went for a nice walk in an interesting area by the sea.</p>

<p>It was like a concrete boardwalk over some land that slowly filled with water as the tide came
in; I took a video of its progress, including me (*) standing on the land that was slowly claimed
by the water.</p>

<p>(*) my head wasn't visible; haha</p>

<p>Walked back to the hotel and the distance seemed shorter on the way back.  Hmmm.</p>
