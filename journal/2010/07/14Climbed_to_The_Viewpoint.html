<p>I took the long route to The Viewpoint, not knowing it was the long route, but I got to see
goats, so that was cool.  Oh wait...  not really cool, but now I know which is the short way, so
that's cool.</p>

<p>Got several pics of U-Cow with various trees and rocks, and even a humming bird.  Also with some
people.  I'm planning to switch his website software from Mediawiki to Image Dropbox.</p>
