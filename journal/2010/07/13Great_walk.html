<p>Woke up early to catch the low tide so I could go rock hopping after climbing up to The View
Point. I turned away from the road that said View Point in favor of a road that seemed to head more
toward the beach, and by beach I mean rocky coast.  I slipped twice during my four hour adventure,
both times while on rocks.  No bruises or slices resulted from those, but I did get a few little
scratches from shells attached to rocks.  I had to abandon the dry rocks for a bit to get around
some plants (trees, vines, etc) that had taken over all horizontal surfaces.  The super sharp
shelled rocks were not my idea of comforting, especially with waves pushing me around.  Eeep!</p>
