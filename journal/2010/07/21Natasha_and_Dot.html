<p>I am officially having a great class with Dot and Natasha.  These have been really fun moments.
Natasha and I oscilate between lazy and genki, silly and serious, always having fun and taking care
of each other.  We were just doing fun twists called Washing Machine, and then stretches called
Banana Boat and Boogie Board, but we renamed the second one to The U-Cow because the body ends up
in a curved U-Cow shape.</p>

<p>Dot has given us tiger grass drink every day, and today, she gave us refresh pills, and has been
feeding us starfruit and white chocolate along with tea, yesterday giving tamarind and snacks,
Monday giving oil with 108 uses.</p>
