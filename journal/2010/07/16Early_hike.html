<p>I walked + ran up the steps to the Viewpoint from 6:37 to 6:53 am, planning to meet Pa, and
hopefully Pinoi.  She and her friends came around 7:30, but Pinoi hadn't woken up by the time we
left for Viewpoint 3.  Got some good pictures of me on an unfinished floor, and then walked toward
the way I had come up the first time, and said bye to them when we got to the road.  I went up to
find my sunnies at Loh Moo Dee, and they went down to go to work.</p>

<p>I got some good pictures of U-Cow with fish (and a ton of pictures of just water or just U-Cow
or just fish) out in the reef after having sat down in the water during the lovely warm rain that
fell.  Yummmm so fun!!  I was just sitting in the water, enjoying the cute infrequent waves, and
enjoying the rain.  I hadn't taken a shower in a while, so my shirt needed a bath!</p>

<p>Went to Loh Moo Dee desk and found no one there.  I saw some shades hanging about the place (not
spirits (not alcohol, but ghosts), but sunnies), but not my sunglasses.</p>

<p>After lunch, but still ostensibly a hike, I walked along the beach to get to the climbing wall.
Was thwarted by trees, houses, and a slightly bloody toe, stubbed on a sharp step.</p>

<p>On the way back, I was nearly thwarted by a monkey who thought I was trying to thwart his
consumption of something delicious in the garbage.  I walked around him, balancing on some boards
in the process.  (the things I do for monkeys.. sheesh)</p>

<p>After that I chatted with Joey for a while (sitting with our backs to the water, he was telling
me about Chad after having asked a lot of questions, and knowing the area code of Houston from a
song), and then I went to see Pa before getting on the ferry.</p>

<p>Pa was sleeping at her work for lack of customers.  I chilled with her on the chairs and then
went to get some pad thai, though didn't have enough time to have a sit down meal.  She orderd some
to go and then we went to the dive shop to get my bag and then I gave her a hug on my way to the
ferry and she headed back.  It was kinda weird; I had to her I have a girlfriend, but at the same
time, I kinda brought it on myself by going to say HI to her, meeting her this AM for a hike, and
going to say bye to her; I could have just left it at the first chance meeting.</p>
