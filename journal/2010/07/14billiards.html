<p>Neir and I went to Reggae to play billiards, and I tried to ignore the Thai boxing ring being
used in one section of the bar.  We finished one game (he won), and a girl came up, put 30 baht on
our table, then walked away.  We were like, &quot;mmm well I guess they wanna play,&quot; so we
played mixed doubles.  I was with Blair from London, and Neir was with Sarah from England
(Newcastle?), who studies chemistry.  They met in China or something, and have been traveling
together for 6 weeks, through southeast asia, and soon down to NZ.</p>

<p>The games were fun, though U-Cow and Johnny didn't get much action.  Neir is going scuba diving
tomorrow, and has to be up at 7am, so turned them down for going to the next location.  I carefully
declined as well; my tired brain would try to sort out a way to smooch them, and that's not what I
need now.</p>
