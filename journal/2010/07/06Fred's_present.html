<p>Today I spent a good bit of time putting together Fred's present.  It's basically the pieces of
a drink bottle cap which, when turned, open the interior seal of the container.  Pretty cool.  I
took the pieces apart and wrapped each one separately, so the puzzle is to see if he can determine
what it is without seeing all the bits.  If he does it after seeing the first piece (just the
plastic ring), I'll be incredulous.  If it takes him two pieces, I'll be amazed, and if he does it
after three pieces, I'll be impressed.  If it takes him four, then well, yeah he better know
it by then cause that's all the pieces.</p>
