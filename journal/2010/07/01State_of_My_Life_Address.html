<p>I don't reallllly have enough time right now, but I'll briefly do an SOML:</p>

<h1>state of my life abbrev</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I live in ImmEco room 4217 in Chiang Mai, Thailand</p></li>

<li><p>I'm taking 8 hours of thai massage classes per day this week and last week, and 6 hours of
classes per day the three weeks before that.  6 hours are
at <a href="http://www.sunshine-massage-school.com/">Sunshine Massage School</a> (which I highly
recommend), and 2 hours per day with <a href="http://www.sinchaimassage.com/">Sinchai</a>, the blind
man who's pretty famous (which I do not so highly recommend).</p></li>

<li><p>This week at Sunshine I'm taking Assessment and Treatment with Trayl as the teacher.  Air
(my thai massage teacher for 4 weeks) and Zen are co-students.</p></li>

<li><p>Been hanging out with Air, Shawn and Shane a lot</p></li>

<li><p>I used to go to the pool after school but no time recently</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://abj.fly2.nu/">Auto Break Johnny</a> has some 200 pictures on his site.  I'm
pretty happy with the software, but need to make a couple of tweaks still.</p></li>

<li><p>Been doing five qi-gong animals in the mornings, but need more time to do them properly, so bye!</p></li>
