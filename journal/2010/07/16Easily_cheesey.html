<p>Ate cheeses 19 - 23 on my 4 cheese pizza today by adding parmesian cheese to the top of whatever
4 they used.  Neir was witness, though he didn't see me eat all the first 18 cheeses.</p>

<p>(I've been counting each 4 cheese pizza / calzone that I ate as 4 cheeses, and just been adding
them up, counting 1/2 of a 4 cheese pizza as two cheeses.)</p>
