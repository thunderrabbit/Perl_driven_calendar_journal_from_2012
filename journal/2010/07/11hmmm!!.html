<p>I just went wandering around my new neighborhood with laptop open, looking for free wireless
signals.  Didn't find any, but I did find an ATM and decided to see if I can get money on my credit
card, and I could have, had I brought my credit card.</p>

<p>Oh snap.  I don't have either my bank card or my credit card.  Apparently I didn't transfer them
when I changed (back) from my bluejean wallet to my old black wallet with chain.
Dammmmmmmmmmmn.</p>

<p>So I've got 868 baht on me now (after having spent 500 on taxi, 500 on ferry ticket, and 400 for
hotel room (that does *not* have free internet access.  wtf)).</p>

<p>I guess I'm going to ask Paige for a loan tomorrow, or offer my thai massage services, or somethin'.</p>
