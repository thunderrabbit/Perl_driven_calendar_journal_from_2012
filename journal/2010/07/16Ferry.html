<p>Aw man I was so tempted to jump across to Joey and Romana's ferry.  I wasn't allowed to go to
their ferry on the dock level, but I easily could have jumped the rail at the second level.  Hard
to know who would see and who would care.  Easy to know who would not want to miss his flight by
getting into legal trouble in Koh Phi Phi.</p>

<p>So, I stayed on my ship and went to the front.  Though I had big fun getting splashed at the
front, the cost was one sandal, which blew away with the wind.  Dang.  The other sandal got blown,
but stayed 2/3rds on the ship, chillin' behind rope-tie for the duration of the voyage.  Hmmmm I
wonder if I can get an identical one and where one new sandal and one old one hahaha.</p>
