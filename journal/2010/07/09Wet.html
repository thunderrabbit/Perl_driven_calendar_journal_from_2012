<p>Going to the pool at ImmEco, by way of the vegetarian shop I like.  It's just started raining, so
I won't take my computer, but I will take U-Cow and camera.  Main goal is to get Johnny from
Avery.</p>

<p>Great great great fun in the pool today, our best day yet!  Started with Sita and Adrianna (from
South Africa) chatting a bit in the shallow end of the pool, and then they left and Avery arrived,
then Shawn and Shane arrived, and then Sita came <em>back</em> because she got lost on her way to
class.</p>

<p>Awesome antics included four (4) life rings used for flotation, ring toss, rolling along the
ground, rolling in the water, seats, handstands, foot stands, leg catchers, and more!</p>

<p>Videos to come.</p>
