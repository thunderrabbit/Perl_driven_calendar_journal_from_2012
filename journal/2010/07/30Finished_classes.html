<p>So, today was officially my last day of my last thai massage class during this adventure in
Chiang Mai.  It's been great, and I'd love for it to continue, but I told Soness I'd be back, I told
Alfonzo I'd be back, and I told Yogasan I'd be back, plus Emiko, Yurika, Traci, etc.</p>

<p>Man; I've got less than a week remaining in my three month adventure!</p>

<p>The class, Advanced + Stretches, featuring Trayl as the instructor and Shawn and I as students,
featured a lot of cool alternatives to a lot of the stuff we do in the beginner sequence.  We won't
use all of them, and may not even use most of them most of the time, but we have them available.</p>
