<p>Tokyo seems just a bit less appealing now that dating Lisa apparently won't be an option in April.</p>

<p>Could just have been a timing issue.  Maybe next lifetime.</p>

HI Lisa!!

I just saw on Facebook that you're married!   Congratulations!

I have just finished reading an awesome book by OSHO.  I'm sure any/all of his many books are great.
This one is titled _Tantra Vision: The Door to Nirvana_.  I plan to offer it to you when I get back
to Tokyo.

I hope you're feeling happy and blessed, loved and lovely.

   blessings
    - Rob!
