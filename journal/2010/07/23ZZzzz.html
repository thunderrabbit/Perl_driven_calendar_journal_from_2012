<p>Fun night tonight.  I'm just now getting to bed.  After chilling at Rooftop Bar, and by chilling
I mean that Natalie (NL) and I were dancing to the often phat beats being spun while
everyone <em>else</em> chilled (until I chilled next to Erin from Vancouver who knows Audrey from
Vancouver, talking about her friend who does not yet know/admit that he's gay), we (Natalie, Raquel,
David, Anne, and I), walked to Reggae bar (not far) which, to my dismay, just played reggae
music.</p>

<p>I went in a bit begrugingly, and skipped out after 45 minutes and headed to the club that had
been playing hip hop when we came in.  It was dance music by the time I got there, but still quite
yummy for my feet, and I had a good dancing time for about 30 minutes before walking home 30 minutes
to Imm Eco on foot, and then 20 minutes to my apartment on Bouncy Black Bike.</p>

<p>Oh, at Rooftop Bar, the floor is some kind of bouncy / weak surface that seems to be sheets of
split bamboo across periodic rails, and then plastic grass mats on top of the bamboo.  I couldn't
dance too bouncily on it, and Trayl confirmed later that some people had broken through the mat in
the past.</p>

<p>That was when he was saying &quot;bye&quot; and heading out with Mint (yummmm I love mint), and
included that he overheard me telling the waitstaff &quot;I won't fall&quot; when the guy was
telling me I shouldn't dance on the wooden rail, which I had deemed much stronger and more stable
than the bouncy bamboo mat.</p>

<p>Trayl goes, &quot;he doesn't know you as well as I do,&quot; which I took as Trayl agreeing that
I wouldn't fall.  Nice.</p>

HI Elle!!

Thank you for lovely chats and songs tonight!

I realized the near-perfect gift for janette, who spells her name with a lowercase j, at Uncommon
Objects...  do you know of a place to buy silk fabrics here in Chiang Mai?

Whether or not you know that, please know that I wish you the best this weekend whether you fly to
Pai or fly through the sky with us.  AND I look forward to seeing you next week in Sunshine.

   blessings
   - Rob!
