<p>About <del>halfway</del> <ins>one-fourth (dang)</ins> through the flight, and my tummy is hungry,
my ear hurts, Johnny and U-Cow are safe and happy, I remembered my sunnies, book and hat, I just
ordered some spring rolls, and my computer's battery is 93% full.</p>

<p>My tummy is relatively full, my ear still hurts (but perhaps not as annoyingly), we're now
nearly halfway through the flight, and I just wanted to say that I *think* I'm beginning to get a
sense of what ... ah dang I forgot.</p>

<p>Um, but I was thinking that our experience of time really changes everything.  Hungry / full /
pain / pleasure / battery at 93% before and 88% now / hot / cold / hat / glasses / U-Cow.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I think I intellectually am beginning to understand the idea that things are
temporary.</p>
