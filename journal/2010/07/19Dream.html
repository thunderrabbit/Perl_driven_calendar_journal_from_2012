<p class="dream">Climbing a really big tree</p>

<p class="dream">In a hotel, I went from my room directly into the onsen area, and was there about
10 minutes when Fred came in from a tough day at school.  He asked me about my day and I told him,
but I didn't ask him about his day until he offered.  Turns out he had had a rough time on the
school bus, with its new type of seat belt, that was more like a cage than a seat belt.  &quot;They
could see I had been crying, &quot; he said, &quot; so they put me into the seats near the driver,
and they are seats with a gate in front that ensures people stay there.  It was fun at first, but a
few minutes down the road and I realized it hurt.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I checked the clock, and it was 4:50pm.  I hadn't told the clerk what time I
started, but decided it would be easier to tell the clerk we had started at 4:10, than to try to
explain I started at 4:10 and Fred had just arrived.  Went into the room and found the reception
desk for the onsen and was trying to speak Japanese, &quot;すみません、あの、１６時１０分から始まりましたんだけどう。&quot; and I woke up.</p>
