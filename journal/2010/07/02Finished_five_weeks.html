<p>I've just finished five consecutive weeks of classes at Sunshine Massage School, four weeks = the
two-week beginner class twice (with Air as the teacher), and just now finished Trayl's Assessment
and Treatment class, which I'd like to take again.</p>

<p>Zen, who also took this class with Trayl, said he'll change his yoga classes as a result of this
class, and I'll definitely be looking more carefully for the actual causes of chronic pain instead
of just treating the pain temporarily.</p>

<p>Air ______ed (*) the class, so didn't get a certificate.  She learned a lot of terminology, I'm
sure.</p>

<p>(*) what's the verb that means attend a class, but not for credit?</p>

<p>Across the hall, Shawn, Shane, Ellie and two other women have finished the beginner class with
Dot as their teacher.</p>
