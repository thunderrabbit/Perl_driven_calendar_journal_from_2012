<p>I called Paige just before she was getting on a boat to go diving and told her my three news
items:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'll be on the 13:30 ferry instead of the 8:30 ferry</li>
<li>I don't have my bank card</li>
<li>I may have an ear infection</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm really happy that I didn't say, &quot;so I need to borrow money,&quot; but instead, &quot;so
I'm not sure what options I have,&quot; regarding my lost wallet.</p>

<p>She said no problem on all three, with a pre question of &quot;but you have enough to get
*here*, right?&quot; for the second, and explanation of &quot;though they're not doctors, the
pharmacists all know all about ears here,&quot; for the third.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>Headed out to find some food and a beach.</p>
