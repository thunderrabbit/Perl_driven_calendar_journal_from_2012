<p>Ate lunch with Sita and another woman from Trayl's class.  We had arrived early enough that
pumpkin was still available.  yay!</p>

<p>We (Sita and I) talked about where we (Shane, Shawn, Sita, Avery, and I) will go out tonight
(with Dot to a festival?), spoke briefly about Avery and then about eye colors and eye color
preferences.</p>

<p>When Sita called him, Avery asked if he could call her back, cause they were having &quot;dog
issues.&quot;</p>
