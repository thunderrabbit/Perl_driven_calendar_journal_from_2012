HI Paola!

I hope you are doing well, and am faithfully following my promise to let you know if my financial
situation in Japan starts to look...  how do we say in English?...  pristine?  clean blank slate?

I recently wrote this to our dear Emiko:

------------ begin email snippet to our dear Emiko ---------
I'll arrive back on 7 August, and go
straight to The Pink Cow for a Peace Boat party.  I hope I have enough money to get from the airport
in to Tokyo hahahha

I honestly want to keep traveling...  maybe ride my bicycle to India!

Given that my former employer may not immediately have work for me, I'm looking at the possibility
of going to the US in late August, and possibly going to Texas to work for my brother on his PhD.  I
really miss my family and friends in Austin.

Emiko had jokingly (?) said I might be able to work for you by digging an onsen in your yard.

I don't know how much longer I want to live in Tokyo.  I feel some obligation to my friends to live
there, and I know from emotional and spiritual point of view, that's not a very good reason.

I definitely want to see you again, at least "one last time" for a farewell party.  I think I want
to get my bank account padded and fluffy, but I actually just want to travel around the world on my
bicycle, raising money for my efforts for an orphanage or elephant sanctuary or something.

You seem to have a deep wisdom and financial sense below your delightfully fresh personality.
Where'd you get that?  Is it real or my imagination?

=============

Two wild adventure ideas:

(1) includes spending $2000 US to fly to San Francisco and joining some friends to attend Burning
Man http://www.burningman.com/ , a wild week long festival / city in the middle of the desert, where
my animals would be welcomed wholeheartedly.

Find a ride to Austin, Texas and get paid to hang out with my brother to work on his PhD.  Hopefully
help him finish it more quickly with a little cheerleading and brain support.

(2) Find my way to India and let India be my guide.  (As you may know, you love India, while I've
never been there before)

===============

In Koh Phi Phi, I lived in a room with a man who was afraid of getting a mosquito borne sickness.
He got denge fever.  I had a lovely time exploring the island.

I trust my angels to keep mosquitoes away, but haven't yet trusted them to keep the food coming in
and just drop all my belongings.  except my computer; I love my computer!!!!!  ( could i drop that
too?  )

Thank you for listening.   Can you be my sugar momma?
