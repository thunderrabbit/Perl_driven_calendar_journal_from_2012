<p>The only bad news: I thought I took video of some barefoot silk wearing walkers, but hadn't
started recording.</p>

<p>But then I recorded at least 5 minutes of video as we rode up alongside some thousands of people
walking up the hill to Doi Suthep.  I woulda recorded more, but my camera battery indicator started
blinking, and I don't have my other battery handy.  D'oh!</p>

<p>I'll put the vid on youtube soon.</p>
