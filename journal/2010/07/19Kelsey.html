<p>I met Kelsey yesterday during lunch.  She's teaching at the university across the street from the
vegetarian place I like.  She's from Michigan, but has lived in OZ most of her life, I think she
said....   Most amazingly, she's going to Tokyo in October, so maybe we will meet up!   That's
right around the time Colleene Beanie will be there; maybe they'll become fast friends.  :-)</p>
