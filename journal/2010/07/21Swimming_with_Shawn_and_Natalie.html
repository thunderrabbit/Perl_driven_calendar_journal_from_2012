<p>Went swimming with Shawn and Natalie at Imm Eco, talking about Mericka and wtf to do about its
insane &quot;leaders.&quot; Got out when we got cold, and it started raining soon thereafter.
Natalie shared some papaya with me while it rained as we watched from under the balcony of my old
building.  She's just done her (clothes) washing, and taken a shower, and I've just been surfing the
internets, and now we're about to go get some foodage.</p>
