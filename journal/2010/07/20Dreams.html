<p>dreams I've had tonight:</p>

<p class="dream">At work, bored bored bored and actually decided to just leave, but then realized
it was only 4:pm but that I was suppposed to be there until 6pm, so uturned around to go back and
then realized I hadn't had lunch, so this was a good reason to have left, so grabbed a sandwich from
a shop with really huge sandwiches on display outside,  the guy asked me what kind I wanted and I
told him and got it with shrimp.</p>

<p class="dream">On the Yamanote line, in the very front of the train and it took off and rolled
right up to a wall and then rolled back, and I was like, &quot;whoohooo!&quot; becasuse I had never
had that experience on the line, and a guy was like, &quot;why exciteed?&quot; and I go,
&quot;cause I like roller coasters?&quot; and he was a bit confused because Yamanote line is not a
roller coaster, and we sorted out that it had just done that beause the trains ahead of it were a
bit faster than expected probably and that we would leave at least by 12:34pm, possibly sooner.</p>

<p class="dream">Michael Jackson up on stage wearing a wig and singing a song about being a notorious
woman with funny lyrics and then changing his costume to sit in a wheel chair while I was fixing my
car Scott outside in a kinda bad neighborhood, while watching a 3D hologram movie of Michael Jackson
playing a guy who was in a war and lost his limbs.  The movie started to get a bit scary so I turned
the channel and decided to leave and was looking for my keys and found them on the roof of the car
with a pocket knife blade pulled out.  I hadn't done that, so I assumed it was someone trying to
scare me away, and I figured I should give them a reiki blssingg but woke up before I could.</p>

<p class="dream">In a group English lesson outside, watching two women in white dresses with blue
dots pick up a rather large wedding cake from the side of the road.  I was like, ”おもくない？”
and they were like, &quot;who said that?&quot; and finally saw me, and go &quot;no, it's not too
heavy,&quot; and they went in one door and then out came a whole slew of people wearing brides
maids dresses to match the others and they went up the steps of a big house singing a wedding song
and the apparent bride came out all shocked and happily hugged each one and we got up to join the
fun and she hugged each of us.  I go &quot;congratulations&quot; when she got to me, and someone
else was like, &quot;you must join!&quot; as there was plenty of food, given that the wedding was
around thanksgiving and already pumpkin pie was on the table.</p>

<p>Over many of my dreams thus far tonight, focusing more on the earlier ones, I have had a weird
over-dream feeling</p>

<p class="dream">of video recording everything, and wondering at the possibility of recording
something unique, and that recording will somehow affect something</p>

<p>man it was weird, but I can't quite capture the feeling now...</p>
