<p class="dream">During a war, hiding in a trench under a ping pong table that looked like the
bottom of the tunnel to people looking in, a guy at the front of the tunnel was lobbing knives into
the tunnel, but I was safely under the table.  I threw a shuriken at his chest but didn't kill him,
and woke up as we started to fight.</p>
