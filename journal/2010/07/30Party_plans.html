<p>Tonight is Japanese buffet party time for several students of Sunshine and associated friends.
It was going to include a birthday cele for Elle, but she decided it would distract her from
visiting with her mom and sister who are in town.  I plan to meet her tomorrow for fabric purchases
for janette.  (Elle's mom can take them back to Austin, and deliver directly to janette!!)</p>
