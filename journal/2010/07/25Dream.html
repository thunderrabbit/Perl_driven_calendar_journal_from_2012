<p class="dream">Playing soccer in a hallway but just me and one guy against one other guy, and the
referee would whistel once when we kicked it out and then twice when the ball was thrown back in.
We wre supposed to kick the ball down the stairell t the endof the all, that was the single final
decision of who would win.  We got down to the end and I was ready to kick it, and the guy grabbed
the ball with hi hands though it was illegal to do so.  I was like &quot;wtf,&quot; cause this was
the one moment in the gme that everyone should be clear on the rules.</p>

<p>I woke p and noted that the referee's whistles were brought to me by a bird singing
outside.&quot;tweet&quot; and &quot;tweet tweet&quot; over and over.  I wonder how the timing woeks
out.  In my dream it seemed like the ball went out of boundas and *then* the whistle was blown, and
back into bounds *before* the whistle was blown...  but not with a huge time delay..  hmmm / wow!</p>
