<p>Air called me tonight (unusual), and asked if I could give her a lower back massage.  No problem.
She came to my room and was looking pretty ragged.  Seems to have pink eye in her left eye, and says
her lower back is hurting, her throat is hurting, and her right ear is hurting.</p>

<p>I worked on her back and we estimated that was a result of her sitting for long hours at work,
and relatively unrelated to issues of her head.  She was telling me how a previous doctor (a few
days ago) had been like, &quot;here's some pain medication; kthxbye,&quot; and she was like
&quot;wtf&quot; but went with it.</p>

<p>Now she's like wtf fo realz and worried that she may not be able to work tomorrow (wow), so I
offered to drive her to the ER.  Kinda had to tell her, &quot;okay let's go,&quot; cause she didn't
want to bother me.</p>

<p>Dude; no worries; I was just farting around online, and an ER visit is always fun!</p>

<p>except not as fun when the TV is on in the waiting room, and Thai TV seems to be worse than
Japanese TV.  worse = more annoying.</p>
