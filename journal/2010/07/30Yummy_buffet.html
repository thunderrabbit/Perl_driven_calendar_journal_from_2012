<p>The buffet was great.  I started with ice cream, and finished with the same, but explored some
healthy options as well.  Johnny got naked and went home with Claire.  U-Cow got some funny photos
and we nearly hung him from the chandelier intentionally and then accidentally when Melanie batted
him and at the top of his arc he hit a ceiling support, but would have landed near the top of the
huge chandelier.</p>
