<p class="dream">DJing at KTRU, I had gotten the next set set up, and ready fr the next show and
then went to do something outside the station for a bit.  The station was on the side f a hil in
Thailand with traffic nearby but no one would really mess with it, so I left it unlocked.  I got
back and the next DJ was waiting and said in a very respectful way that it might be better if I at
least trn off the microphone so outside noisw ouldn't go out over the air, and turn on &quot;the
blue light&quot; to make the station look locked.  I agreed, and looked in to my brain to swee why
I hadn't done that, and I realized that it was that I didn't feel qualified to do that bcause it
wasn't really my station, and then I realized, well if it's not mine, then I should better take
better care of it.  Hmm.  I thanked him for his feedback and woke up.</p>
