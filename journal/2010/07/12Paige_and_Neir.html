<p>Went back to Paige's dive shop after eating at Papaya, the first restaurant she recommended (same
prices, but bigger portions) where I took pictures of the cat (and Johnny) in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Chatted with her about diving mostly, and then some about B and her plans for after PhiPhi.</p>
