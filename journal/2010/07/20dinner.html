<p>Met Lin who had just been talking to Shawn on the phone, and we all ate together.. indian
food.. basically nan and a bunch of curries and a lassi for everyone but Avery (Sprite) and Lin
(water), plus then some roti.</p>

<p>Best thing about going there; Sita towed me with her motorbike.  Nice.  That seriously helped me
get there pretty quickly.</p>

<p>At the end of the night, as we were hugging Avery and Sita who are going to Pai tomorrow for an
overnight (and skipping their respective daily tasks (volunteering for Avery and Trayl's clas for
Sita), I hopped on the back of Sita's motorbike and she gave me a lift 20 meters to my bicycle.  I
gave her a kiss on the back.  She's quite hot, but too smokey and fiesty for me.</p>
