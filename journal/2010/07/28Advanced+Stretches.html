<p>Practiced Advanced+Stretches on Linh for 10 minutes after she practiced on me for 40 minutes the
stuff she's been learning in her first beginner class with Dot.</p>

<p class="date">1:07pm ICT Wednesday 28 July 2010 (day 14735)</p>

<p>This is the third day of class, and the first day that the positions Trayl's been showing us
have been named and written on the whiteboard as we learn them.  Much nicer for memorization.</p>

<p>Today is also the day that Linh took me for dessert after lunch and I gave her a ride back on
Bouncy Black Bike (once we got off the main street, so really only about 50 meters!).  <!-- She offered
to give me her extra phone and let me stay free in her apartment, but I declined. --></p>

<p>Today is <em>also</em> the day I poured water slowly outside the window to see how little water
would drip all the way off the lower roof, or how much water could be poured on the roof without
any dripping off.  I'm not sure which game I was playing.</p>

<p>Shawn is the only other student in this class with me.  It's been nice; we're both from the US,
so have similar senses of humor.</p>

<p>Air will join us for part of class after lunch, but I'm not sure why, nor what she'll do with
her two students.... hmmm!</p>
