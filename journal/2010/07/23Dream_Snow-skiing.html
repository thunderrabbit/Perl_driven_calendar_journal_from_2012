<p class="dream">Skiing up a slope  I overheard a guy talking to another guy about their next plan,
&quot; hey you see that group over there; they are all talking to that guy I told you about; let's
go join them and they do a four hour course that's really dense and by the end of it you will be an
expert skiier.  I did not have tie to join them, nor interst in joinging a group that bg, so just
went past them to go around the circuit one more time.</p>

<p class="dream">Got to the top of the mountain and started zooming down next to Mike lender, and
got going fast enough that I was able to fly down the mountain just above the surace of the slope.
I simply lifted my feet up a bit and then I  was flying like superman over the snow.  The slope
suddenly went steeply down and I stayed flying straight so was suddenly many hundreds of meters in
the air.   </p>

<p class="dream">I started going a bit too high to come back down properly, so I grabbed onto a
chandelier to stoop myself, and then  just let myself drop down into the soft snow, safely right
beside Mike.  I was like, &quot;aight race to the bottom?&quot; and  started to pull myself with my
hands to the top of each little mogul, and he ws sorta waiting for me to catch up cause he was
already on his skiis.  I tried to grab his leg  but then finally got  enough speed to sgart skiing
again and made it to the bottom where Mike had beome a woman who &quot;I found a fried potato
wrtapper in the snow; you took it out of the register didn't you?&quot; and I go &quot;no, but at
first I was going to say, 'well that proves I was there first so I won the race!' jokingly, but no it
wasn't my wrapper.&quot;</p>
