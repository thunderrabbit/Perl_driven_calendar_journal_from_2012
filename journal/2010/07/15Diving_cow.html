<p>I didn't dive because it would blow my budget and my ear's still a bit infected, but U-Cow got
to go down for a few happy snaps with Paige and Neir.  He also went off the boat before Brett saved
him so gallantly.</p>

<p>The setting = beautiful.  The sun = mostly sunny.  The ocean = quite blue and ten meters
visibility.  The rocky islands = hella cool and I want to come back and jump off them into the
water.</p>

<p>Most amazing to me = each island is basically sheer vertical rocks sticking right out of the
water.  Their bases were eroaded by said water, given that it's been sending waves their way for
what must be several months now, at least.  How quickly must they have risen and then stopped in
their current positions to let the water wear away at their bases??!!??</p>

<p>&quot;Or,&quot; said Stu, &quot;how quickly did the water level drop?  Cause these are limestone
which pretty much means they were coral reefs.&quot;</p>

<p>Dude.</p>
