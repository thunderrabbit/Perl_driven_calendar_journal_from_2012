<p>I just took a shower, as in, just a rinse and didn't get my head wet.  My right ear is ringing,
and seems unwilling to pop (equalize pressure), but can hear properly, so at least that.</p>

<p>Still raining.  I've taken my contacts out and *now* I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>actually, after I lay down I realized my right ear was throbbing with each heartbeat.  I checked
its hearing ability, and it's about 70% normal.  If I rub my thumb and fingers gently together I
cannot hear it (with my right ear), but if I rub them firmly, I can.</p>
