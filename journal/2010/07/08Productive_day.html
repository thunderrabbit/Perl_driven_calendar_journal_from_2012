<p class="date">5:49pm ICT Thursday  8 July 2010 (day 14715)</p>

<p>Today I got up relatively early (early enough to eat free breakfast at ImmEco), ate free
breakfast at ImmEco, went to my old room 4217 at ImmEco for some diligent coding during which I
added prev and next links that honor the current tag selection when viewing images
on <a href="http://abj.fly2.nu/">Johnny's site</a>, then took a nap.</p>

<p>After eating a late lunch (barely made it to Rak Yen's shop before she was closed (she actually
had everything cleaned, but opened a tupperware of leftovers for tomorrow and gave me a takeaway
bag for today)) out by the pool, I chatted a bit online with Avery and Air, and now am back at 4003
to let Air practice her sequence for tomorrow's class on me.  yay free thai massage!</p>
