<p>Avery invited me to join him today riding motorbikes around a mountain near Chiang Mai.  I
balked at first, and he was like, &quot;well if you wanna go email me a time and place, and I'll
meet you.&quot;</p>

Hey Avery

I'd like to join you guys tomorrow on your motorbike adventure...  I've gotten permission from Air to borrow her bike.

Can I meet you at the "parking lot" of North Gate at noon?

Hey mate

I was at north gate from 11:50 to 12:35, but since I hadn't clearly stated in person that I would come, and hadn't gotten confirmation after sending my email last night, I've headed back to my apartment to chill.

I hope you have a fantastic day roaming the wild yonders around Chiang Mai!

  peace

<p>So, in short, I didn't join him.  I did, however, chill for 20 minutes in a tree near the gate
while waiting.</p>
