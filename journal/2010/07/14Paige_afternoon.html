<p>Chilled with Paige this afternoon and traded a few movies; she gave me Addicted to Plastic, and
a couple others.  I gave her Loose Change and a couple of others.</p>

<p>There was a new cat that Paige and Stu believe has ringworms, so Paige was trying hard to fend
off its cuddles without touching it.  Mozzies started getting pretty bad outside where we were
chilling, so went to our separate rooms.</p>
