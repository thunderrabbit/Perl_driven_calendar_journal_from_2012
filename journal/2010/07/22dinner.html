<p>Went to dinner with Erin N, Natalie, and Raquel.  Oh wait, not dinner, but ice cream at Bud's.
Natalie and Erin were the most conversationally inclined, talking about yoga and India and yoga and
Thailand and more yoga.  I rather enjoyed listening to them, and got some ideas for next
adventures.  Hmmmm Tokyo?  Hmmmm  naw, not really interested.  Hmmmmmmm.  Money?  Hmmmm.</p>
