<p>I'm here at ImmEco for a wifi-free breakfast, as in there's no internet available where I'm
chowing free breakfast on my last day here in the resort away from home.  Funds have fun a bit low,
so I'm not paying 10,000 baht for a month of resort life with cleaning service, breakfast, pool and
usually available internet, but 3,500 baht for a month in an apartment where internet is free, water
and electric are extra, and pool and room cleaning service DNE.</p>

<p>Saw Shane and Shawn for a couple minutes on their way out of breakfast and off to tai chi
classes.  They're here at ImmEco for 3 more days, I believe.  Not sure where they'll go after that,
but I understand they'll attend classes at Sunshine a couple more times.</p>

<p>Haha I asked one of the helpful employees and she goes, &quot;yes, no internet.  I'm sorry,
internet accident.&quot;</p>

<p>I think that means their service is down, and they're aware of the outage.</p>

<p>Um, it's back!  I guess that means they did *not* know about it.</p>
