<p>With Joey (Chad (Sarah) + Netherlands) and ロマナ (actually she's from Ambon); we've just eaten
in Burger King (though Joey and I had tuna sandwiches from Subway) in the Phuket Airport.  He's the
one who jogged up to the Viewpoint the first day I was hanging out there three days ago.  Very
friendly; got a picture with U-Cow and ran back down to have breakfast with Romana.</p>

<p>Joey and Romana met in Netherlands a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Joey used to play soccer professionally; he seems quite fit.  Though I didn't ask him about that,
I did ask him about Chad (*), about which I knew only that it's in Northern Africa.  He was telling me
about the political situation of corruption and French quelling revolutions to get rid of the 16
years and running leader.</p>

<p>(*) which is only &quot;Chad&quot; because of western influence, forcing cultures and tribes into
grids on a map.</p>
