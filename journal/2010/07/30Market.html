<p>Linh invited me to join her, Dot, Yannick, and two others from their class at Wararot (sp)
Market, where Dot planned to show them some shtuffs.  Linh noticed some red leopard print fabric and
suggested it would make a great shirt for Johnny, so I bought 1/2 a meter (the shortest they'd
allow) for 50 baht (150 yen ($1.30)).  Not sure when there's time to make a shirt, but Linh seemed
optimistic.</p>
