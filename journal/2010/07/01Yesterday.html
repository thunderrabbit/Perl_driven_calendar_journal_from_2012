<p>Yesterday at school, I climbed up the stairs using the little smidgen of steps on the outside of
the banister, and when the landing got in my way, climbed up the banisters.  Max was watching, and
actually encouraged more creative climbing: &quot;now can you climb down the stairs in a different
way?&quot;</p>

<p>I slid *slowly*(!) down the banister, basically with full hand brakes because of a solid nut
cracker at the bottom of the thing.</p>
