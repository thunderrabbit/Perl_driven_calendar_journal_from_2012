Hello Mr Michael John Grist

I am Dr Noboku Unobtanium Wafflehaus and would like to wire the SUM of 4 hundred billion quadrillion
Starbucks Franchises to your account.

Please keep this under great scrutiny and confidentiality, and I have no idea why I'm writing all
this, for I just wanted to say good job again on your writing about the <a href="http://www.michaeljohngrist.com/2010/07/writing-blog-3-bad-guy-motives/">motivations of Bad Guys</a>.

As a Good Guy, I shall simply mention I saw two little typos in one phrase, and deemed them worthy
of your examination:

I'm having fun in Thailand, and will be headed back to our island home soon... not sure if I'll have
work or otherwise the desire to stay there much longer, but we shall see.

    blessings
     - Rob!!

ps: it'll be hilarious if this message gets canned as SPAM.  I hope our previous correspondence keeps it in your inbox.
