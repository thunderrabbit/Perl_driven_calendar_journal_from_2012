<p>Though it's moving slower than I had hoped, I guess two hours is two hours.  In the van from my
hotel to the port, I met two young women celebrating (?) having finished their first year of school
in London.  Haven't got their names, yet, but they've got Johnny and U-Cow.</p>

<p>They're 2 of about 10 or 20 people from their school, all traveling on various iteneraries
around SE Asia.  These two plan to stay in Thailand, hopping from island to island and possibly
coming up north.</p>

<p>After introducing them to Johnny and U-Cow, I was told about Jim Duggan, the name of a rubber
rat who has met the Queen of England, and traveled around much of the world.  He apparently has a
page on Facebook.  I dunno if I'll make U-Cow or Johnny a FB page, but I may, and then try to
friend the rat.</p>

<p>The ship features some 100 seats, many of which are taken by a group who seems to be from
Ireland.  They were late getting to the ship, but the ship was later than that even, as the crew
was loading up some vegetables and shtuff.  The deck is fiberglass, painted gray, and gets pretty
hot in the direct sun, but cools quickly.</p>
