<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I live between Big C and the train station in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in a big apartment for
3500 baht per month, featuring private bathroom, and a bottle opener the shape of an air
conditioner right outside my window.</p></li>

<li><p>My finances have largely come to an end; I'm down to my last 4500 baht in my wallet (though
I should get part of my deposit back from the apartment), so I probably won't be doing much this
week, though Flight of the Gibbon (zip lines) might just be my last zinging fling.</p></li>

<li><p>Over the past year, and especially while I've been away, my I-group seems to be disbanding;
we'll prolly have one last meeting in August or September, but</p></li>

<li><p>I don't know how much longer I'm going to stay in Tokyo.  My work plans with Alfonzo might
not be coming through, and work with Fred in Austin might.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm excited about the idea of going back to see my bro and mom, though nothing is set yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been working on <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">Uncle Cow</a>'s
and <a href="http://abj.fly2.nu/">Johnny</a>'s websites, using Image-Dropbox on Github.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been riding Bouncy Black Bike around town, though he's a bit small for me.  TJ Bike is
hopefully waiting safely and patiently in Chigasaki bicycle parking.  Not sure what I'll do with
him if I head back to Texas; I still want to do a mega bicycle ride.  I guess I can get funding or
raise money for something by riding, similar to the funding model for MS 150.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer (white MacBook), features 問題児 sticker on the cover, a pink label written by
Tik (which was used to label the extra key to the lock that she held for me in the ImmEco office),
and a sticker featuring a yin/yang spiral thing with i-ching bars surrounding it covering the apple
shaped light on the cover.</p>

<p>On the inside, the Get Firefox sticker is largely gone, and there's some identifiable
remains of a DQ logo on a napkin that I used to cover the sticky left over from the Shark energy
drink label that I recently removed.</p>

<p>There are also three stickers from プリクラ booths in Tokyo on the inside cover, and a red
sticker with white capital T just to the right of the camera on the top inside cover.</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone hasn't seen much use in the past three months.  I think the last person I called
was Shara (a few times), two months ago.</p></li>

<li><p>Most recent new software is Minefield, the pre beta version of Firefox 4.0.  BUT, at one
point it was like, &quot;update available,&quot; and though it listed the same version, 4.03b_pre (I
think), it no longer had Tab Candy button!  wtf??  So I'm not using it any more.</p></li>

<li><p>Aight; everyone is here for dinner so bye!</p></li>
</ol>
