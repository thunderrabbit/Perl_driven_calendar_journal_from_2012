<p>Trayl had invited everyone to his house at 6pm last night.  It was super raining as the time
came to leave, but I was set on going, despite only h having my normal clothes and bBouncy Black
Bike to get there.  Fortunately, it pretttty much stopped raining as I headed out.  I got there
around 5:35, so a bit early, but then Elle saw me from a nearrby Japanese restaurant where she was
chilling.  We sat and chatted for abit; talking about hr book by Tom Robbins  &quot;Alseep in Frog
Pajams&quot; I think, which she really thought was good.  We talked about other stuff as well, but
I think just normal &quot;what's up&quot; chitchat.</p>

<p>She actually wasn't going to go too Trayl's party even though we were literally next door to the
apartment buidling.  I convinced her to go and we were the fist ones there at 6pm straight up.  I
was like &quot;in Japan we can't be late because last train enforces the finish time of
parties.&quot;  So it was me and Elle and Trayl and Mint for a bit and then more people slowly
arrived; Raquel with some yummy cheese and breadsticks to add to my fruit slices  Natalie, Raquel,
Anne, Mint, Trayl, David, Elle, and I all chillin' in a cirlce around a cute feast of fruits and
cheese and bread, whith copious red wine and around, plus soft drink for Natalie and water for me.
Nice times with lots of pictures that I'll put up soon.  Hmmm I guess I shoulda gotten permission,
but oh well.</p>

<p>Sicha, and Mandy arrived later, ad then Erin arrived after that, featuring the most awesome
ingredients for awesome goat cheese plus avocado, plus tomato on grain crackers.  Nice nice nice.</p>

<p>I found out that Mandy knew Avery from Portland, not out of some super cool small world, but
because they had basically come to Thailand together..  Avery had mentioned that he came &quot;for
a woman&quot; but he never divuldged any details, nor even said she had moved up from the south
where they had both been originally; I would never have guessed that she was the one.  It was only
after she goes, &quot;I'm fron  Portland, and I go &quot;do you know Avery?&quot; tat she mentioned
enough for me to piece it together.  Wow!</p>

<p>After four hours had suddenly elapsed, Trayl kicked everyone out, and four of us went to a club
called Warm Up.  Elle was going to go but then backed out at the last minute; I was bummed cause I
wanted to keep playing with her.  She's going to Pai tomorrow, which as I write this is today.</p>

<p>I rode my bicycle with Erin  in coversation to her place at Tip Top Thai, where Avery had also
been staying, and then she gave me directions to Warm up, with one critical left vs right flaw, but
everything else was good.  I went too far and could sense it because there were no more interesting
venues ahead, so I asked two guys at an outdoor bar, and the one who answered happened to live
right by warm up.  he gave quite perfect directions.  Nice.</p>

<p>Natalie found me as i walked in looking for them across the multiple bar spaces and four
different dance areas with live music in two and drum and bass in another, and I never saw the
fourth.  I never left the drum and bass room util I left a few hours later..  We had gotten there
pretty early and had the dance space to ourselves, which was good because I had a lot of energy,
and yby the time I was tired the space was getting filled up.  Oh thre was one super cute girl
there with cute nose and braces.  She was way too young and I'm guessing only spoke Thai, so I
didn't even talk to her, but just enjoyed watching as she and her freidns took pictures of each
other and themselves.  Didn't get U-Cow or myself in on the photo session with them, but dat's
okay.  Mint, Anne, and Natale were in our own little group, enoying dancing, and Anne buying
driinks for us.  Mint and I played a foot stepping game, basically with super fast dancing feet
trying to step on the other's feet (all without shoes, of course).  She got me a few times and I
got her like once and a half.  Fun times.  I think Natalie got a picture of it, but who knows how
easily one will be able to tell what game we were playing..</p>

<p>I noted that the cuite girl's cute nose looked just like Mint's, and I was like, &quot;hmmm!
maybe it's common in Thai women,&quot;  hmmm!</p>

<p>I was getting quite tireder than I had been after 30+ minutes of speedy dancing, and 15 minutes
of slower dancing, and was ready to head out, but then I realized that it was also cause i was not
in our group, but watching the other group, kinda inadvertantly feeling alone, so I joined our grop
and danced for at least 20 minutes more.  </p>

<p>Then i headed home, hugged Natalie bigtime cause she's leaving today for India, and not sure
about Anne, bu gave her a hug, and will see Mint on Monday at school.  Rode Bouncy black Bike home
for 30 minutes and was a bit bummed to see my favorite little store closed, but they were open
enough to let me buy one bottle of soy milk beacuse I could point right to it through the chain link
fence.  I couldn't explain that I wanted chocolate as well, which I had bought the previoius day.
Not sure why they didn't know the English word for chocolate.  I said &quot;same same
yesterday&quot; but the answer was about Monday travel something something, so I acknowledged that
and took my soy milk and left graciously.</p>
