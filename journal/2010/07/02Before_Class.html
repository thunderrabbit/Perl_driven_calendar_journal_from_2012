<p>I've really been enjoying Assessment and Treatment with Trayl
at <a href="http://www.sunshine-massage-school.com/">Sunshine</a>.  I'd like it to continue for
another week, I think.  Trayl knows a lot.</p>

<p>I'm here early to meet Air for a bit to help her prepare for the test.  Trayl speaks quickly, has
been using lots of terminology, and pronounces words inconsistently.  Sometimes &quot;masSAGE&quot;
and sometimes &quot;MAssage.&quot;  I can see that's hard for Air to pick up the finer bits.</p>

<p>buuuttttt, apparently I'm a bit more interested in helping (?) her than she is in my help.  We
were supposed to meet 7 minutes ago, but Air isn't here yet.</p>
