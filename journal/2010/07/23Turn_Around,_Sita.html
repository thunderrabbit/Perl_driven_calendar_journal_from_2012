<!-- people: Sita, Avery -->

<pre>
Turn Around
Every now and then I get to hang out with Sita and at the end give her a hug
Turn Around
Let me see your ass and then if I'm lucky I can can give it a squeeze or a rub
Turn Around
Take good care of Avery and I'm sure he'll treat you just fine
And when you see his tanlines and his package you can say it's all miine!
Turn Around, there's Avery
I wish you both a fun and happy life!

<p>Or something like that; I've just re-written this while we're here at Rooftop Bar, kinda
ignoring everyone else, so I'll get back to the group her now.</p>

<p>Bye Sita; bye Avery.  Hopefully just for now.</p>

<p>Big fan of those two.</p>
