<p>Going to a dam now.</p>

<p class="date">5:55pm ICT Sunday  4 July 2010 (day 14711)</p>

<p>Good times at the dam.  It would certainly be fun to stay overnight, but we're heading home now.
Had lots of fun swimming, eating, climbing, jumping, cowing, and videoing some of our antics, plus
antics of some kids in the next group over.</p>

<p>youtube vids coming soon.</p>

<p>Marie, from France, but distinct from each Marie in my recent beginner level class, loves to
climb.  She was climbing various structures in the cave, and tried valiantly to climb two trees
about 50 meters from the houseboat we had selected.  She said she couldn't, due to pain (in her
legs?).  Two years ago, a rock broke and she fell 300 meters while climbing, and used her arms to
drag herself (including two shattered lower legs) for three days to help.  Her partner was stuck up
on the mountain until help returned.  Nice.</p>

<p>I saw her scars.  Wow.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Sita for bringing my video camera out to the tree after I had climbed up it,
and thanks to Pax for helping get it up to me so I could video my jump.</p>
