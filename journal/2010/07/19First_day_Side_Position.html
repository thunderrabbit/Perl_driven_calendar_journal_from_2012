<p>Today was the first day of my class with Dot teaching me and Natasha (who I met in Senshai's
class, and who took the beginner class with Air over the last two weeks).  Dot has a nice aura
about her, and likes to chat about random things.  Shawn figures she's trying to distract us from
thinking too much while giving massage.</p>

<p>She just got back from a trip to Taiwan, so must be a bit tired, for while I was massaging
Natasha, Dot fell fast asleep, sitting upright, but slowly slowly slumped over.  I thought Max might
come check on the class while she was sleeping, and wondered about a way to wake her up at the
optimal moment.  She woke up on her own, five seconds after Max appeared silently in the doorway.
Not sure why or how she (unconsciously) knew.  She looked a bit embarrassed and then tried to do
something useful by waking up Natasha to see if I was applying the right amount of pressure.</p>

<p>I was; don't worry.</p>
