<p>This evening, after an afternoon nap, Neir and I went to see the video Stu put together for us
after taking lots of video footage during the day.  I bought the DVD before the viewing, and he was
like, &quot;this is the only copy so far; let me add some more footage of you and the animals and
burn a new one for you.&quot;  Sweet!</p>

<p>The video features a lot of Paige's smiles, which, I quite appreciated.  Semi-arguably, Paige's
smile is the reason I'm on Koh Phi Phi now.   Most amazing on the video was an octopus changing
colors to match its surroundings.  Wowwww...</p>

<p>After that, I went to visit ฤๅ (Pa), who recognized U-Cow at the Viewpoint a couple days ago.
We chatted until she got a customer who wanted an oil massage.</p>

<p>Then I headed to Seafrog to meet Paige and Neir so we could go to Sports Bar to play the Thursday
Trivia game.  We got fourth place (of like 8 or 10 teams).  The team (the rest of the Seafrog
employees) against whom we were primarily competing got 2nd place.  Dang.</p>

<p>Our answer of Antarctica for &quot;world's largest desert&quot; was counted as wrong.</p>
