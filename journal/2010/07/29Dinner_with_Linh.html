<p>Went to dinner with Linh after school tonight, and sat talking with her for about 2.5 hours at
her favorite desssert shop 9the one with tapioca bals and a variety of sweet sauces).  She invited
me to her place and I acepted given that her housemates were there so we wouldn't be alone.  They
were watching Josie and the Pussycats which, despite my best efforts, distrcted mefrom talking too
much with Linh.  The middle half of Ghost Whisperer was next, and I was happier to be distracted by
that, but it was still a bit silly.  At 8:40 I headed out, with a goal of making it home by 9pm.</p>

<p>Success!</p>
