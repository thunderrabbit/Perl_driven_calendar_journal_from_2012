<p>Air helped me find a new place to live; my rent at ImmEco comes due soon, and rather than pay for
the teeny room for another month, (and not live in it for a week of that while I'm in Koh Phi Phi
visiting Paige,) I've got a new WAY bigger room with free internets, private loo+shower, and no pool
and no free breakfast.</p>

<p>So tomorrow and perhaps each day until my ImmEco lease runs out, I'll go chill at their pool
after having breakfast.</p>

<p>Internet connection doesn't work yet, though they've got four servers(?) downstairs. (I think
they must just have my line turned off. (??))</p>
