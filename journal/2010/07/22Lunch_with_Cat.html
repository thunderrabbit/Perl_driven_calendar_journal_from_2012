<p>Totally awesome conversation with Cat today at lunch.  From her pov, awesome = the discovery
that there's a women's version of <a href="http://www.mkp.org/">Mankind
Project</a>, <a href="http://www.womanwithin.org/">Woman Within</a>.  She had been talking about
her partner and mentioned that he did MKP, and I was like, &quot;mankind project?&quot;  and she
goes, &quot;mankind project,&quot; and I go, &quot;mankind project??&quot; and she goes,
&quot;mankind project,&quot; and I go, &quot;me too!  mankind project!&quot;</p>

<p>And she's like, &quot;wow!&quot; and before she could continue, I was like, &quot;go do Woman
Within,&quot; as if she knew what it was.  She's like &quot;what?&quot; cause she didn't know what
it was.  &quot;Woman Within, it's the women's version of Mankind Project,&quot; and she totally
flipped to finally hear it existed, and wondered why oh why none of the men in MKP OZ were
apparently talking about it, etc.  Awesome.</p>

<p>From my pov, awesome = her description of what I might be interpreting as &quot;needy&quot; in women
is actually &quot;trusting&quot; in women.  Argh; I can't articulate it quite yet.  Nevermind.</p>
