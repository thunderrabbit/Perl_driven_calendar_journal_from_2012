<p>But first, I'll be taking two weeks off from the school (because they have
no advanced classes scheduled for these two weeks), and go down to Koh Phi Phi to see my friend
Paige from PB!  She's a dive master teacher, has looked up my diver's license, and said she'll be
happy to descend slowly while I let my ears pop at their rate.</p>
