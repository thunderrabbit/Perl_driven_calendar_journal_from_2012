<p>Pooled today, mostly chatting with Sita and Shane who told us some amazing stories after i gave
Sita a nec massage, at her request, after Avery and Shawn went to do some reflexology in Shawn's
room.  The massage for Sita was mostly reiki, shiatsu, and some thai massage.  She had oil that she
got from Dot today so I used that as well.</p>

<p>Shane was telling us amazing stories for a bit over an hour, which nicely filled the time until
everyone was ready to eat.</p>

<p>Oh, to get there, I rode my bike (bouncy black bike) right up onto the pool area and around to
the corner where Shawn and Avery were waving, so to leave, I rode off the double step, which wasn't
as interesting as we had hoped, so maybe a spill into the pool would be good, and we headed to a
place at the night market.</p>
