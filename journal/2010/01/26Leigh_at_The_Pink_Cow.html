<p>Tonight I went to The Pink Cow to see Leigh the rapper+hair artist who does live hair cutting on
stage there.  Tonight he was rapping, though, for Australia Day, cause he's British..  Wait, what?
Well, anyway, his backup musicians included a digeridoo and circular breathing, Jon on shakuhachi,
plus Hide on guitar.  They were on stage for the first time or so, a band with no name.</p>

<p>After their performance he promoted his next live hair cutting: Friday 12 February.  Be there or
be square, cause he'll be there cutting my hair!  I ask him whose hair he'd be cutting, and he was
like, &quot;prolly Hide's again,&quot; and I was like, &quot;how about me??&quot; and he was like
&quot;cool!&quot; so I believe that means &quot;let's do it!&quot;</p>
