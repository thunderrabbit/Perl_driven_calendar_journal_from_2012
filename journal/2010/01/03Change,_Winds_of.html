<p>On the way there and back, I rode the train with David; we talked about upcoming societal
changes, including economy and &quot;2012&quot; which I basically said I had heard three general
things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;It&quot; is already happening, a gradual change in humanity's consciousness focused
around 2012.</p></li>

<li><p>The planet is traveling through a portion of the universe that's more energetic; it will
push everyone forward in their personal growth.  For people to whom this is a new concept, it will
be hell.  For people who've been doing their work and have a framework with which they can
understand their experiences, it will be more bearable / fine</p></li>

<li><p>Every N00,000 years, the continents begin to shift around at the pace of a human walking.
Not fast enough to cause tsunami the size of Eiffel Tower, but fast enough that people will go,
&quot;d'oh!&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>He said a friend of his said a big change is coming soon.  I guessed either</p>

<ol>
<li><p>official disclosure that our governments have been chatting with extraterrestrials</p></li>

<li><p>free energy machines will be released</p></li>

<li><p>economic collapse and chaos</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully the second one.  I think that would be best for us.  Seems like that would let humans
take care of our own problems.  The first option seems more like &quot;come save us!&quot; and the
last option would probably lead to us taking care of ourselves, but with a bloody revolution in the
interim.</p>
