<p>Though I'm a bit late for work now, I wrote Soness a nice note after cleaning the place up for
her arrival tomorrow night.  I've got to stay out tonight, well, I'm <em>choosing</em> to stay out
tonight because I'm going to do an ISIS session with Rebecca tonight in ÂçÄÍ (Otsuka), and again
tomorrow morning in ÂçÄÍ, which is basically 1.5 hours from Chez Soness.  I'll get my sleeps there
tonight and come home on Thursday night after work.</p>

<p>I wrote a note which I left for Soness on the clean coffee table in the clean living room, with
the door shut so Nibbles can't unclean it while we're gone.  Nibbles' litter is clean; Nibbles' food
area is clean (and dry), and the sink trap is clean.  And the birds even have food.  And the nearly
full kerosene jugs are in the shed, and the kerosene heater is full of kerosene.</p>

<p>I cleaned the tub and filled it with clean water (which, thanks to the wonder of Japanese tubs,
can be heated in 20 minutes <em>from ice to nice</em>.  (It would probably take more minutes if the
water were actually ice, but it can heat the water from 8C to 43C no problem.)  The laundry is
pretty much all clean, except for her non-cotton/non-fabric-I-can-identify items.  The clean laundry
is pretty much all folded, except for her complicated items with parts I can't identify, and which
don't even have arrows to indicate which way is up.</p>
