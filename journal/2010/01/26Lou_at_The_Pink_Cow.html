<p>Though I went to see Leigh, when I walked in I saw Louise McLeod!  Wow!  How great to get to hang
out with Lou at The Pink Cow!!  I hadn't really gotten to talk to her in years, since back when we
worked at Gaba and used to watch movies at her place.  Got to hear the great news of her next few
years' plan of writing five books and going back to OZ to go back to school for education and
theater.  Awesome!  I still have a lovely crush on her even though she's well below my dating age
range; she's only 27!!</p>

<p>When she heard about the hair shaving, she was like, &quot;cool!&quot; and wants to have Leigh
cut hers in May.  I introduced them and imagine it's as good as confirmed!</p>
