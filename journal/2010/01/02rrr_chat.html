<p>Chatted with Rebecca and Richard for a bit, answering their questions about what to do with a few
days in Tokyo.  Basically suggested Harajuku + Meijijingu, internet cafe, capsule hotel, love hotel
(if you're a couple, you should go), Tokyo Dome City, Hakone for two days, Kamakura and the nearby
island, kaiten sushi, Shinjuku park, and agreed they should check out Akihabara and the fish market
if they are interested.</p>

<p>I was gonna meet Rebecca on Monday morning, but we moved that to Thursday morning, so I will go
out there on Wednesday night for ISIS and camp overnight, and then ISIS again Thursday morning,
which I think is the day Soness comes home!</p>
