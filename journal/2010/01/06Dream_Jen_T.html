<p class="dream">With Jen T from PB, talking about our voyages and plans for the
future... basically just hanging out.  Soness called me all &quot;what's up?&quot; and when I told
her, she was like, &quot;how old is she?&quot;  and I asked Jen who said &quot;twenty.&quot;
Soness goes, &quot;I heard her.  She's too young for you don't you think?&quot;  And I was like,
&quot;we're not doing anything but talking!  Plus,..&quot;  and Soness interrupted me, &quot;and
aren't she and Taka still together?&quot;  I was like, &quot;yes; they're married I was just going
to say that,&quot; and the scene shifted to being on a bus with a little marble game rolling
chaotically with the lurching of the bus.</p>
