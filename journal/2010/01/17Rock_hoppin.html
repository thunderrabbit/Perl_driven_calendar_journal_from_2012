<p>After Soness and I had breakfast at noon, we went to the beach where she went running and I went
rock hopping.  Actually I first went to the wall where the robot used to live under the sand, and
when Soness came running by, we did a passing low-five hand slap and she went on her merry way.  I
ran up the steep still-broken-via-typhoon beach and kinda cut my right big toe.  Ooops!  I ran to
the rocks to rock hop, leaving little blood spots with each step (hee hee), and left a few more
blood drops on the rocks.  Ran up the T of the rocks, down one wing and then across both wings, and
then back and bink(!) I blipped another hole in my left big toe!  yay!  Matching blood spots!  I
drizzled some blood on a rock while standing enjoying the sun and then headed back to the bikes
where I found a little bit of bamboo on which I carved I LOVE YOU and left it in Soness's bicycle
basket.  Headed back home and jumped on my computer.</p>
