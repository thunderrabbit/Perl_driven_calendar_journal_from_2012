<p>I'm excited!  Couple weeks ago,
I <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=10333148&id=816205715">broke off part of my
toenail</a> running up the steps in Kyoto station.  I noticed yesterday that it's lifted away from
my toe..  The toenail is still in place, but only attached on the left side of my toe, not the
right.</p>

<p>Paola, my yoga instructor said, &quot;you're just as excited as a kid at Christmas.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes!</p>
