I made it to 8:44 homeliner as well so yay!
The washer spin cycle was winding down, so I grabbed the blue sheets and hung them upstairs
Went back down and the washer was washing again!!!
Ran back up and grabbed the sheets and tossed them Back into the washer!
Barelybarely made my train. I'm still not quite back to normal breathing
