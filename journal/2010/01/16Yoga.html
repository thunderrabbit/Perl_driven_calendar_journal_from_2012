<p>Fun time at Yoga today, with lots of treats, both before and after class.  I think it's about
time I start paying for a new set of lessons.</p>

<p>This time I chose the spot near the window, and John was in the middle, with Emiko next to the
book shelf.  Paola asked if I wanted a snack or something before class, and I was like,
&quot;sure!&quot; cause I hadn't yet consumed anything.  She made tea and gave us some of the
incredible flakey coconut treats from her supplier in India.  Wow so so amazing!!  The most
difficult yoga poses for me today involved arm strength, like holding my arms straight out and
holding my head slightly off the ground while upside down on my elbows.  Tough stuff!</p>

<p>After class, more treats, including the flakey coconut stuff, some ほしがき, and something
another student made, plus more tea.  So so yummy!!</p>
