<p>It took a bit of time for me to realize that my code wasn't working correctly cause I was
calling the wrong module in one case.  It processes the same things as the module I was using, but
in a slightly different way, so needed not be used in this case.  Once that was corrected, things
worked mo smoover, but still not smoothly enough to finish even this task which I guessed would
take 3 hours.  Um, 10 hours?  16?</p>
