<p>Did Morning Pages this morning on the train, from 8:45am to 9:00am.  This morning is the first
time I've written morning pages since summer or fall last year, but Soness is leading The Artists
Way as a workshop in Takadanobaba for the next 11 Wednesdays (with a two Wednesday break in
February), so I figured I can charge forward with the group.  Gotta getta copy of the book
again.  Maybe there will be one at Good ¤Ê¤ó¤È¤« Books in ·ÃÈæ¼÷.</p>
