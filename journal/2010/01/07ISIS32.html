<p>Rebecca paced fingertips on belly again, and immedialtely recalled being trapped under rubble in
China having wanted to be vulnerable to my family but just working hard and making them work too
hard and didn't go into that too much but feeling the craving to be vulnerable and how it gets
confused with sexuality and feeling the creative power of connection with infinite energy and
there's something blocking it society wrapped around a little it inside that wants to keep me from
sharing the infinite with everyone who's open to experiencing their own infinite power.</p>

<p>Feeling he huge charge and wanting release and not wanting to let go or lose it, I ust want to
hug and hug and share and love and thank you  thank you.</p>

<p>It's been suggested that ejaculation wastes lefe energy.  I can certainly imagine so, as
ejaculation has often put me to sleep at night.  I wonder if I can simply sit with the energy and
not release it wastefully.</p>
