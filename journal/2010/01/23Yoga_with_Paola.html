<p>Had a lovely long day at Paola's house today.  Emiko and I had our Saturday lesson from 12:45pm
to 14:45 as normal, and then stayed for lovely food and conversation with two students from Monday,
Taki and May, plus May's husband Ryo.  I quite enjoyed meeting Taki, who I'd describe as able to see
the good sides of everyone.  Ryo was amazing at a game I have on my iPhone, basically placing
mathematical operator between four numbers (and parenthesis around pairs or triplets) to make a
result of 10.  (e.g. 1 ? 4 ? 5 ? 9 = 10).  May had great hoopy ear rings and taught us some Arabic.</p>
