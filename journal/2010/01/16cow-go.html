<p>Cow-Go international night at The Pink Cow featured a full house.  Emiko and I were there from
like 5:30pm, when Lina and Stephanie started their French lesson.  Lina looked so happy afterward,
so I'm reallly glad about that.  Steph had to jet off to work starting at 7pm, but Lina stayed and
joined Emiko and I, who had already been joined by 服部チルド who met me
on <a href="http://www.mondaiji.com/">mondaiji.com</a> a few days ago.  She didn't speak a whole lot
of English, but she told me she liked my paintings, and that they were very &quot;outside art&quot;
which is apparently a Japanese-English phrase.  I'm guessing it basically means &quot;out of the
box&quot; or &quot;not mainstream&quot;  ..</p>

<p>I also met Boomer (new Pink Cow
employee), Kenya, Naoki, Jimmy, Masae, Sachi, Naoko, Naoko, Tomoko, Tomoko, Yumi, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Tomoko and I became friends on Facebook, and she recommended a cute little game on iPhone called
Rocket Bird.  It's cute and free.  Left with her and Yumi, and walked right out of The Pink Cow
(instead of left) and then said bye to them with a hug each at the main street between Omote Sando
and Shibuya.</p>

<p>During Slang Bingo, I chatted with Greg and Andy from ultimate, who, like me, haven't really been
to ultimate recently, but talked about going.</p>
