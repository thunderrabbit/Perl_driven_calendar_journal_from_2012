<p>US for Okinawa made a statement in Yoyogi Park yesterday.  I may remember to post a copy of it here:</p>

<pre>
All of us at the peace action network, US for OKINAWA, have assembled here in the park today to
express our concern about the enormous burden that U.S. military bases are placing on Okinawa.
Already, U.S. military facilities occupy nearly 20% of Okinawa Island, and even the U.S. and
Japanese governments agree that Futenma Air Base poses a great safety risk to nearby residents and
agree it should be closed. However, we are appalled that closing Futenma is contingent upon
constructing new military facilities in Henoko, another part of Okinawa Island. A majority of local
residents in Henoko are strongly opposed to this new construction, and we can understand why.  It
would simply shift the problems of contamination, noise pollution, and safety hazards from one part
of Okinawa to another, and would also destroy much of the fragile ecoystem of Oura Bay. This will
likely lead to the extinction of the dugong from Japan, as well as yet again deny Okinawans access
to part of their traditional land and water.

We want you all to take a moment to imagine Yoyogi Park being appropriated from the general public
in order to construct a new military base here.  Imagine this park being surrounded by barbed wire
and soldiers who will threaten to kill you if you enter it without permission of the
U.S. government. Imagine all the beautiful trees being cut down to create runways, shooting ranges,
and weapon stockpiles.  This is just an imaginary scenario for us, but this is basically what the
people of Okinawa have experienced and are being threatened with yet again.

It's time for the U.S. to engage more with the rest of the world through diplomatic, economic, and
cultural ties rather than military means, and to stop adding to its collection of 1,000 military
bases around the world.  And it's time for the Japanese government to say loud and clear:  &quot;Shut
down Futenma&quot; and &quot;No more new military construction in Okinawa.&quot;

<p>We had a great turnout!  Video cameras and signs, musicians and artists, lots of onlookers
signed our petition or joined the video compilation &quot;I'm for Okinawa!&quot;</p>
