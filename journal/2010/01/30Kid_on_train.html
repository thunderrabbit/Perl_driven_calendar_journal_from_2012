<p>The boy squirming in the seat ahead of me peeked back at me between the seat and the window.  I
smiled and he hid, but came back, and during the trip we made faces at each other.  His mom
apologized repeatedly, and gave me a KitKat for my efforts.</p>

<p>At one point I took a picture of him and uploaded it.  I'm (slowly!) getting closer to having
pics easily placed in journal entries.</p>
