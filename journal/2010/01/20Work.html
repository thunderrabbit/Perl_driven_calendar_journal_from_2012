<p>After nearly finishing changes to four files yesterday, I used SVN to show the changes between
now and when I started the changes, and wrote out four to-do lists itemizing all the changes in the
four files.  Showed them to Alfonzo last night and we was like, &quot;um, you gotta change this and
that,&quot; and so I did those this morning (though I don't remember what they were).  From about
noon:15 to noon:45 I tweaked the to-do lists, and then embarked on the great challenge of
implementing all those changes on 4 x 12 sets of files.  Eight of the sets were largely the same (so
they certainly should have been written as classes in the first place) but four had extra
modifications around which the tweaks turned out not toooo difficult to implement.</p>

<p>Finished the changes in 6 hours, and then did some testing and found, to my delight, they pretty
much do the right thing!  (at least in the case of the identical ones.)  I found a bug which, by
its nature, almost certainly appears in all of them, but there were several different tests which the
code passed perfectly.  Hoooray!</p>
