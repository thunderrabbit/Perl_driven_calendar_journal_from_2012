<p class="date">1:53pm JST Saturday 30 January 2010 (day 14556)</p>

<p>Today was Emiko by the library, then me, then May, then next to the window was Jon, Paola's
well-fed husband (I don't mean he's fat; I mean Paola cooks wonderfully).</p>

<p>New poses today: up dog, and some sideways thing, like a cross (feet together, hands
outstretched, body, legs, arms straight) with only one foot and one hand touching the mats.</p>
