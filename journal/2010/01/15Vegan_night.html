<p>Pretty full house at The Pink Cow tonight for vegan night!  I was the second person there, right
after Alexi from Russia / San Francisco.  People filtered in and I kept looking for Arwen, but
welcoming people into seats around &quot;my&quot; table.  First Allyn across from me, then Satomi and __zu__ (I
think) in the couch area, and then Miki next to me, then Rick across from her, and then Bruce at the
head of the table.</p>

<p>Allyn <del>asked</del> <ins>quizzed</ins> me a bit in Japanese, asking how to spell yen in
Japanese, &quot;en&quot; and then &quot;like Ebisu, right?&quot;  &quot;right&quot;  &quot;well why
do they write &quot;yebisu&quot; sometimes?&quot;  &quot;I guess it's from the old style hiragana,
which are written on the curvy road in Nikko...&quot;  &quot;okay; you passed; you passed.&quot;</p>

<p>Next question was about some fish, with kanji 秋__ but crazy pronunciation.  I had no idea.</p>

<p>Then he asked a joke Q.</p>

<pre>
What kanji is
　森　
木木木    ??
</pre>

<p>No one knew.   &quot;六本木！！！&quot;  &quot;Haahahahhahah!!!&quot;  I laughed.  &quot;That was
good.&quot;</p>

<p>Found out Miki's kanji is 美樹 which I had no idea there was such a complicated way to write き.
Cool!</p>

<p>Allyn pointed at my NIN logo and was like, &quot;what's that kanji mean?&quot; and Miki was
like, &quot;you don't know????&quot; and no one else at the table knew besides me and Miki.
Hmmmmm!</p>

<p>I was poked in the side by Yuki of Yuki and Mina when I went to get dessert, so I sat at their
tiny table for two near Traci's spot.  Found out that Yuki has been off work for six months, and
lives reallllly close to where I work!  We coulda been going to lunch many days a week (save for
how busy I've been), and she starts work on Monday.  Awesome!  She said it may just be three days a
week so lunch is still an option.</p>

<p>U-Cow showed up on my shoulder after I had left him up on the couches and Yuki and Mina were
like, &quot;wtf?&quot; and I was laughing my proverbial eyes out when I was showing them how Ami
used to have U-Cow nurse on me (through my shirt), and then look up with his pleadingly innocent
look whenever I would look down.  OMG so so funny!  They were like, &quot;笑うすぎ,&quot;
(&quot;he's laughing too much [at his own joke]&quot;  Dude.  it was <em>funny!</em></p>
