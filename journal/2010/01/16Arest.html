<p>I had a nice rest last night; slept fine for 7+ hours.</p>

<p>Soness, who wanted to be up at 7:30am, hadn't gotten up by 10am, so I went upstairs to check on
her.  She was like, &quot;I couldn't sleep at all last night..&quot; cause she's been so worried
about income and stuff.  I'm like, &quot;oh mate, you can always come downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p>As I left today (for yoga), I was like, &quot;dood; though we have no formal commitment, you have
my resources; you'll be fine for a couple months if you need.&quot; She was happy to hear that.
<!-- She burst into tears and I held her for a few minutes in a standing hug. --></p>
