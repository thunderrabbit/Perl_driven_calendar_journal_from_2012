<p>Emiko and I had our second karaoke lesson tonight.  Had one some months ago; perhaps October or
before.  Today we were in room 708 of a place up on 道玄坂.  Sang 1.5 hours of English songs and
then switched to Japanese for the &quot;only one&quot; song by Smap, &quot;島唄&quot; by someone,
and &quot;ペッパーけいぶ&quot; by Pink Lady.  I might enjoy learning those
a bit more, though it would take a lot more to sing them well.</p>

<p>Before that, I stuck with old favorites of Eminem and Nas and &quot;Be Our Guest,&quot; plus
Madonna medly, and tried a couple songs I had never seen/heard/sang before by artists I had never
seen/heard before.  They went vaguely well.  I guess.</p>

<p>We went to have sushi, and got 1 plate eaten and two more ordered before a guy started smokin'
right beside us.  I was like, &quot;dat's it I'm outta here,&quot; and we left.  Went across the
street to _Thanks Nature_, a delicous smokeless option for healthy food.  After having a quiche
each, we looked at the どらえもん book she loaned me and she helped me finish off the first comic from it.
Yay!</p>

<p>We walked through the Mark City (mall) and I dropped her off at Ginza Line before heading down
to Shonan Shinjuku Line on which I'm not headed home.</p>
