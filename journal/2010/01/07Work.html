<p>We shifted completely off the old system so our new site lives at www instead of new.
*luckily*, I had what I liked calling, &quot;the last existing visit to the old site,&quot; and
clicked on all of its links to make sure they refreshed to the correct URLs on the new system.
And I do mean *all* of them, including the ads.  Alfonzo did an excellent job of keeping all the
old links working, actually in the apache .htaccess file.  It took a lot of itme to craft all of
them, but he did it.</p>

<p>Anyway, through my link checking, htaccess did its job perfectly, but someone hadn't made
certain the DB records on the old system stayed in sync with the new DB.  They were out of sync in
a couple of places that I found before I had to go to my lesson with Yurika.  Fortunately, though
there were a few more, it was all cleaned up enough that Alfonzo said I didn't need to go *back* to
work at 8:30.</p>

<p>yay!</p>
