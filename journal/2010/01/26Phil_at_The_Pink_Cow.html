<p>Phil Crowder also performed at The Pink Cow tonight.  He's from Sydney originally, but now lives
down on the Leisure Coast where he enjoys copious nature and surfing goodness.</p>

<p>After his set, and after Lou left, I sat down next to him at the sound board and chatted about
life and all things adventuresome.  Told him about Clairvision and PB; he told me his latest
adventures, focused finding himself after leaving a long relationship.  I got to learn a lot more
about sound boards than I ever knew before.  Traci was like, &quot;when you sit in this seat, either
you gotta do the sound or let us climb over you to do it.&quot; Either way sounds good to me!</p>

<p>Er um, anyway, Phil and I connected on FB and he got me a drink (OJ) and headed back to the
stage to join the jam session.  Ah; I should have bought him a drink as I was leaving.</p>

<p>Said bye to him between stanzas of whatever song they were singing (it reminded me of Hotel
California but I'm pretty sure that wasn't it) and headed out.</p>
