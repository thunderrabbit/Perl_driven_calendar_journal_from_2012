<p>Heading home after my most recent ISIS session with Rebecca.  It was all over the proverbial map.
Her finger was focused right on the top of my right hip, which felt ticklish and I wanted to squirm
away, but stayed with it.  Glimpsed a vision of being near Jesus Christ out in a mountainous desert,
but didn't stay with that vision very long.  Floated around in nice loving spaces, and wasn't very
responsive as I was nearly falling asleep, but then was practically shocked awake as Rebecca started
actively pressing on the side of my hip, and really activating some energy points!  I could feel
tingling in my hands and felt my skull being crushed, and just stayed with the tingling until it was
all over my body.  My stomach started to gurgle, and lower back started to hurt (on the left), and I
wanted to move and run away, but stayed with it.  I saw a vision of me scooping up snow from the
ground five inches deep, and then had the sense that I slipped on the ice and busted my ass,
paralyzing my legs.  So much shame that I had to be cared for my others, and so much sadness that I
couldn't walk outside in the gardens any more.  As a monk, I wasn't allowed to express any earthly
desires, so just stayed clammed up for the rest of my life until I just gave up and died.</p>

<p>Rebecca got back into digging into my leg muscles, prodding down the side and top of my right
leg, activating tons of energy in what I've come to know as my etheric body.  Wanted to run away or
at least squirm, but stayed in the energy, despite pain in my lower back.</p>

<p>Rebecca said she perceived a great amount of energy in my lower column, and sensed that it was
blocked by something.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>I do have a lot of energy.  This I know.</p>
