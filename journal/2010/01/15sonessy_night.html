<p>Soness had a rough day yesterday, getting emails essentially saying she might be fired from World
Family for being upset that they still hadn't invited her back to work two months after they said
they would after she got suspended for hollering at her manager because he lied to her for over four
months about an ongoing issue involving the safety of the children.</p>

<p>And Yuji hung up on her, and maybe something else.  Rough times.  Her neighbor came over and
they commiserated (he lost his wife and kid recently cause he hasn't had work in a while).  The
table held four soda cans and ¤Ê¤Ù (veggie soup) on which they had been chowing.</p>

<p>Finally went to bed around 2am after listening to her stories.</p>
