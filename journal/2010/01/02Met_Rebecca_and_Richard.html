<p>Took a taxi from Otsuka to Amy's mom's house and arrived as planned at 10am.</p>

<p>Hugged Rebecca and Richard and gave a brief synopsis of my Japan history; learned Richard is
in university west of London for computer science (learning Java), and told them I had wanted to be
on the building team in OZ, but will go for it next year, in OZ or maybe Cali, if the property gets
sorted out.</p>
