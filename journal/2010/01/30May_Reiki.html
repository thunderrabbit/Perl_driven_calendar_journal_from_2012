<p class="date">1:49pm JST Saturday 30 January 2010 (day 14556)</p>

<p>Before joining yoga lesson at 12:45, I met May (who Emiko and I met last Saturday at the First
Annual Yogasan Winter Indian Dinner) for a little bit of reiki on her shoulder for about 30
minutes.</p>

<p>May joined me-an-Emiko's yoga lesson, but I had to leave early for RC class in Tachikawa at
3pm.  I'll be plenty on time for it, assuming trains run on time (and they always do, especially on
the weekend).</p>
