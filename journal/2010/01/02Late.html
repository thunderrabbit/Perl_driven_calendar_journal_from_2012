<p>Have been on the train for an hour now, mostly writing to Sabina and reading about Trac, which
seems to not natively support git.  Not yet decided if I will continue using Trac for this
project...  Ah!  I have a <del>reasonable</del> solution:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Temporarily abandon my git repository for python journal</p></li>

<li><p>Use this Trac installation with SVN to trac a django installation to be my journal</p></li>

<li><p>...</p></li>

<li><p>Rule the multiverse with Python!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because of the fourth item, I just crossed out the word &quot;reasonable&quot; above.</p>
