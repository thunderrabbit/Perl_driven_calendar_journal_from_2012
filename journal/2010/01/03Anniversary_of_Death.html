<p>Death and Takeshi's wife Yuko are celebrating their one year anniversary together.  Here on
earth, men from my I-group supported Takeshi at the ceremony which featured about 30 people, 20 of
whom spoke for about five minutes about how the year has been for them.  Overall, I found it
interminable, but the people who cried brought through me some compassion for their experience.</p>

<p>I met a Jesuit priest named Scott something with whom I chatted for most of the after-ceremony
meal, paid for by everyone's donations at the funeral a year ago (maybe 500 in attendance).</p>
