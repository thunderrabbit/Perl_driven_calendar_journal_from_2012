<p>Headed to work now; I planned to go after Takeshi's thing, but forgot about that when I was
getting ready, so I didn't bring my computer.  Gah.  Had to head back to get my machine.  Am now on
the train listening to &quot;Black Number 1&quot; by .... um... <del>Thorn</del> (*), I think.  Yeah pretty sure,
and the album is called _Bloody Kisses_.</p>

<p>(*) Ah, not Thorn.  The band is Type O Negative.  I bought this album a long time ago (back at
1/2 Price Books on Waugh Drive back in like... 1997 or so.  1993?  Well, it wasn't before then
cause the album was released in August 1993, according to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I keep noticing I want to get an email back from Yukiko.  Do I like her?  What's going on here?
I don't even know her!!  Last thing I wrote included</p>

Hey Yukiko!!

Thank you for chatting with me so long on New Year's day!!!

I watched The Reader, and can't say it was my favorite movie in the world, but certainly interesting
characters. 

Oh, so also i wanted to suggest you do not watch Pulp Fiction; it's full of wanton violence, so
unless you like that stuff, don't watch the movie without me there to cover your eyes.  :-)

   Love Love
    - Rob!
