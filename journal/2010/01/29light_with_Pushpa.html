<p>Last night Pushpa and I met at the moai in Shibuya, then Yamanote Line + Chuo Line to Koenji
where we watched a dance/performance called &quot;LIGHT, Part 32&quot; with supertitle _Kei Takei's
Moving Earth Orient Sphere_, as part of the ongoing project _Kei Takei LIGHT Series 1969 - 2009_.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed it, but at most points in the show, when trying to summarize it to anyone who
might ask, &quot;how was the show?&quot; I thought, &quot;I hated it.&quot; Slow, agonizingly slow,
dark, pitch black, weird lighting, weird sounds, boring, itchy, pointless and cool are all words
that come to mind.  Thoughout the whole show it was either &quot;nothing's happening&quot; or
&quot;what's the point of that?&quot; but at the end, well, <em>something</em> had apparently
happened, though neither Pushpa nor I could say what.  Neither could Petya who happened to be there
as well.</p>

<p>There were two old guys in the audience who were applauded after the show, so we went to greet
the one seated near us.  We chatted a bit, and then he invited us to join him for a tasty beverage
in the restaurant upstairs.  Though we were sorta at the end of the conversation, we accepted and
went upstairs.  He's Akio Hayashi, and his name is in the program (with a lot of Japanese text after
it) though I don't know in exactly what he did for this show.  He intends to attend all the
performances (four total: two today (Saturday) and one tomorrow), and told us a bit about the
collaboration between him and another director type, with different artist background.  I'm not
sure if that was part of this project, or *is* this project, but if it *is*, then why is his name
in the *middle* of other names and not at one end, or at least offset somehow?</p>

<p>Drinks ordered: beer for Akio, chai for me, and carbonated mineral water for Pushpa.</p>

<p>On the way out, we saw Laz, our connection to the performance.  Pushpa had emailed to
congratulate him, but he replied that he was awful.  Well, *I* thought it was awful too, but didn't
*notice anything Laz could have done to fix it.</p>

<p>On our way home, Pushpa and I agreed that it may be interesting to see some of the other
performances in the series.  Maybe.  On the back of the program I see our chances will be in May,
(LIGHT Part 7) and August (LIGHT Part 27).</p>
