<p class="date">11:04pm JST Thursday 21 January 2010 (day 14547)</p>

<p>tonight was the inagural night of a group of 12 who named ourselves US for Okinawa, with long
term goal of bringing peace to the world by reducing the world's military forces.  Short term goal
to let Hatoyama know that there are non-Japanese who are also opposed to US military
moving/expanding its bases in Okinawa.</p>

<p>My personal belief includes ideas that only people who make money from war actually <em>want</em>
war.  The rest of us just want peace and maybe some quiet while we're at it.</p>

<p>First action will be in Yoyogi Park on Sunday January 31st.  Meeting at 1pm near the fountains
and then we'll have a media action event at 2pm.</p>
