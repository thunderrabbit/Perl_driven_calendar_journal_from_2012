<p>Wow!  Ami called me!!  I definitely miss her and enjoyed chatting with her a bit while on the
way home.  She said she had seen Jei who also works in Ginza so they chatted a bit.  I got Ami's
address from her cause I want to send her a sheet from a doggie clothing magazine.  It shows a
woman and her dog, and labels them ママ and ワンワN, respectively.  If it said マミ it would be
perfect, but close enough.  I'll send that with no letter and no explanation.. or at least that was
the plan ,but I couldn't find Ami's adress anywhere in my records.  Dang so I had to ask her, but I
made her promise not to tell herself, so she pretended to be Yuko for a moment and I asked for Mrs
Watanabe's address.  Ami broke character, or perhaps expanded her character a bit and asked me to
please tell her why I wanted to have her address.  I told her &quot;てがみ ”ウィch目案s”レッテr”

<p>Ah crap.  I just wrote a bunch of English while in Japanese mode.  (*)</p>

<p>I'm actually writing this while on the train to work the next day, and we *just* went under the
bridge where Ami and I  said our last goodbye, with tears.</p>

<p>While speaking with her, I was like, &quot;yeah why don't we just get back together...  this
whole idea of perfect relationship is probably crap; I can spend my whole life looking for the
perfect parner, etc etc and then I was like, &quot;oh yeah she wants kids.  TV, and kids are deal
breakers for me.  No TV in da house, and no kids at least for now; probably not ever.</p>

<p>(*) cause I still can't see, I'm not going to transcribe it exactly (yet??) but I said something
like, &quot;which means letter, (hand paper) but that's not quite right.  Anyway, I'm not
going to write her a letter cause that would take too long and therefore break my promise to send
her something today.&quot;</p>
