<p>Felt pretty genki going in to work today; I woulda guessed I'd be groggier given that I didn't
take particularly special care to sleep a lotta hours.  Was it because I meditated just before
bed?  (If so, Sabina gets big props for her great idea!!!)</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>we finished!</em>  Our massive web project is up, and except for a few hidden points
that only Alfonzo and I know, it's done done done, and we can get back to normal working hours
instead of the crazy 14 hour days on holidays and stuff...</p>

<p>(I hope!!!)</p>

<p>To share my enthusiam on the way out of work, I wanted to call Yukiko, but didn't want to give
her special favor as I'm officially *not* of the girlfriend-having variety now.  So I called Akiko,
who I can favor without any concern that she'll think &quot;<em>oooh la la!</em>&quot; (*) She didn't
answer.  Ah well.</p>

<p>(*) I doubt there would be any problem with Yukiko from her end, but the phone call would prolly
bring <em>me</em> closer to <em>her</em>.  I don't need that right now.</p>
