<p>Got to work right around 5pm and left a bit after 10pm.  Got nearly a full page of fixes fixed,
covering about 5 pages on the website.  I made one pair of changes on two different pages, and need
to make them on one more slightly different page tomorrow.  I think it's only different because it
was written at a different time.   Man we shoulda been more careful with duplicating code.  There's
scads of it, and little differences between them all.   I worked last week at merging some of the
pages to use a parent object via PHP class _____ extends ______.  Finished two pages that way, but
not sure that I'll have time to do any others before this shiz is due on the fifth.</p>
