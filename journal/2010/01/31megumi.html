<p>Before the US for Okinawa date was set, I had invited Megumi to dinner cause I've not seen her
in a while.  She became unavailable for the Wednesday we had scheduled, and by that time the US for
Okinawa event had been scheduled, so I invited her to join us for that and then we could go have a
tasty beverage.  Walked down the big street from Harajuku to Omotesando (I think it's called
Omotesandodori) and found a little cafe she had visited before, featuring a drink called TXpresso,
which I thought was a typo E ==&gt; T, but turns out it's &quot;Tea expresso,&quot; and seems to be
an expresso made with tea instead of coffee.  I had a vanilla one of those and cheesecake; Megumi
got a chai and chocolate cake.</p>

<p>Conversation included my plans to apply for ÈïÇú¼Ô partner for PB 69th voyage, and her ideas for
movies / documentaries, from silly and fun, to cultural analyses, to oh man I forgot the third
idea.  We shifted to more personal growth work and talked about some of the ways people can do
personal growth work in Japan, included RC and the Barbara Brennan (sp) [school].</p>

<p>I like Megumi.</p>
