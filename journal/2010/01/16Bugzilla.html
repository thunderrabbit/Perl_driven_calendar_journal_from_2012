<p>After clicking &quot;One Click Install&quot; to install Trac on my site, I found a simple glance
at the instructions didn't complete the installation and setup.  So I'm going to try installing
Bugzilla on my site, and if dat don't work, Redmine.  I'm hoping I can configure
bugz.robnugen.com/directory to use the same Bugzilla installation to run project &quot;directory&quot;</p>

<p>The first directory may be &quot;python_journal&quot;</p>

<p>(sniff)  Nice knowin' ya, Trac.</p>
