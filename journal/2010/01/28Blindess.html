<p>Being legally blind without corrective lenses hasn't stopped me from appreciating being able to
navigate pretty well in a fuzzy world, so long as it's relatively well lit.  Though I'm not wearing
my contacts now, I recognized the actually blind man who often (always)) rides the 8:05 train to
Shibuya.  Each day that I've seen him, someone will escort  him to the line and then onto the train
where there are enough physical landmarks that he can easily find a seat.  Today I happened to
approach the line at the same time as he, asked if he was on the &quot;8:05, right?&quot; and
showed him to the line and then onto the train once it arrived.  Part of me wanted to ask him
several Qs to &quot;get to know him,&quot; but that might be just cause he's blind and I feel sorry
for him.  Tehre's another guy who I see a lot on the train who I have wanted to meet, but have
never chatted with him, so why should I with a guy just because he's blind?  Hmmmmmm.</p>

pRight now i'm largely typing this blindly.  I can just barely see the  fuzzy line underneath the
fuzzy set of lines is slowly growing, and recently into its second fuzzy line.   I wonder sometimes
what it would be like to be rea... well, for *me* to be really blind, after having een me wtih
ability to see and really use my eyes to make money as a programmer.  I've done experimental
experiences for example going from my room in Sakura House Motosumiyoshi to the shower downstaris,
taking a shower and cgoing back to my room, all in the middle of the night with no lights on, and my
eyes closed.  The house was relatively small, so lots of physical landmarks I clod continuously
touch all the way..  almost all the way.  The table in the kitchen was slightly dynamically
positioned, and the charis around it even more so, so I had to be careful through that zone.

<p>Sometimes I will walk with my eyes closed to see how far I can go without crashing..  well,
that's only if I look ahead say five or ten or twenty meters and say &quot;aight let's walk
to <em>there</em>&quot; and see if I can make it without spooking myself into opening my eyes.  In
these experiments, I rquite enjoy the sense of knowing how far along the N meters I've traveled.  I
can almost exactly know as I'm crossing the exact point I had chosen before clsing my eyes.  How
does that work?  What is that sense called?</p>

<p>Sometimes I even do that while ridingTJ Bike.  Then the distances are well more than when
walking..  20 meters minimum.  Obviously a bigger component of the spookiness is the time required
to traverse the distance.  I've ridden maybe fifty meters that way.</p>

<p>But what would full time blinness do for me?  I guess it would force me to switch to massage and
ISIS as ways to make money, instead of being online all the time.  That's interesting.  And it'd be
a bit tricky to navigate my surroundings, but apparently it can be done.  Hmmmmm.  I'd certainly
walk a blot more slowly.  Hmmmm.</p>
