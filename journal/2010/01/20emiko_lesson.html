<p>Emiko did great homework before her lesson.  I'm thankful for that; it gives some direction for
the lesson, and helps me actually correct things that will likely stay in her mind more effectively
than just yammering about whatever.</p>

<p>After checking her homework we yammered about going to see Avatar, but in 3D instead of just the
2D version.  I hope it looks awesome with polarized glasses instead of red/green filters used by
cavemen.</p>

<p>I wrote to her friend Akiko to invite her as well.  Options are this or next Friday, or the
next Sunday or Tuesday.</p>
