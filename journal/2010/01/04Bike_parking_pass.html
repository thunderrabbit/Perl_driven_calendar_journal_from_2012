<p>Was in line around 5:35am to get a bicycle parking pass for myself and one for my sonessy
housemate Soness.  She'll be back home in a few days!</p>

<p>The next +500 yen train to Shibuya was at 7:04am, so I bought a ticket for it and went to the
ramen shop to chow warm ramen &quot;oh nevermind it's closed,&quot; and went to Dotour coffee shop,
closed, so went out to another coffee shop, closed, and finally found a fast food restaurant that
was open.  Asked what was available without meat, and got a salad sanwich and a fish sandwich,
kinda bummed to pretend fish isn't meat, but oh well.  At the fish sandwich and then cracked open
the salad sandwich to find bacon in it.  Took two big bacon-free bites before taking it up to the
counter to get a new one.  Didn't yell at the girl, nor threaten a lawsuit, but just got a new
bacon-free salad sandwich.</p>
