<p>Today is the day I met Hinako.  Plus points: doing her work (personal growth), bilingual
(Japanese, English), healthy (macrobiotic, works out (aerobic (swimming, running), yoga)), super cute (super
cute smile, super cute nose).  Other points: only 28 years old.</p>

<p>Well, no matter; I'm not lookin' for anyone at the moment anyway.</p>

<p>I went today just because my mate Tatiana was co-organizer for the workshop.  Had a super great
time.  So tired, so forgive my short entry.</p>

<p>Hinako has been doing RC work for over 10 years, so when I told her I have a crush on her, she
was like, &quot;great!&quot; and &quot;I've had thousands of counseling crushes, so it's totally
great and I totally understand.&quot;  Awesome.</p>

<p>Near the end of the dinner break, she asked if anyone would like to walk outside for a bit, as
she hadn't yet been outside.  <em>would I ever!</em> and amazingly(?) no one else joined.  We went
to a nearby park and swang on the swings.  I tried climbing over the swing set, but didn't make it
even half way across.  Also, it was better to fall at the slightest chance than to have the
slightest chance of falling while above where she was swinging.</p>

<p>Headed back to the building and she asked about my plans for summer.  I told her about PB
possibility, and plans to do Clairvision meditation in either case.  She said someting like,
&quot;well, I would love to have you in our [RC] community,&quot; and I smiled.</p>

<p>During the last class of the workshop, Hinako came over to my side of the circle, and didn't
barge in between me and Yumiko, whose back I was rubbing a bit, but scooched in on the other side
of Yumiko.  I switched my right hand from Yumiko's back to Hinako's back for a bit, then back to
Yumiko till the end of the class.</p>

<p>After class, and therefore the workshop, before walking out with Emma, I heard her say to
Hinako, &quot;see you on Monday!&quot; and I said to Hinako, &quot;thank you for being okay with my
crush.&quot;  She said, &quot;it was good for me too.&quot;</p>

<p>Later, when saying bye to Emma I was like, &quot;see you Monday!&quot; and she goes,
&quot;really?&quot; and I go, &quot;if she'll be there, I'll be there,&quot; and then &quot;I'm
just kiddin', but I sure do like her.&quot;  Emma goes, &quot;you'd be welcome, but we should
probably give some advanced notice next time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.  No worries.&quot;</p>

<p>During the past two days I've had happy visions of Hinako's smile in my mind.</p>
