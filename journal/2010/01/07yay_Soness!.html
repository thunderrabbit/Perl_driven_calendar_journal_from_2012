<p>Got to drink tea and hug chat with Soness until she fell asleep against the couch.  She's so
cute!!  She told me all about her adventures in Thailand, and I'm so proud of her growth.  She's
improved from level 5 climbing to level 6-B!  (I think!)  It was a grand accomplishment for her,
repeatedly climbing to higher heights, including solo swimming climb!</p>

<p>Her biceps are definitely larger, and she's got some new back musculature, the name for which
I've forgotten, if I ever knew.  Basically that connect from under shoulder blades down around to
ribs, or something.</p>

<p>She met a guy named едеже╕ (sp) who may come to Chigasaki in July during his travels.  He's in
Nepal now.  &quot;Speaking of July,&quot; I said, I might be leaving Chez Soness in August,
depending on scheduling for PB and Clairvision.  Soness said, &quot;I don't want you to go..&quot;
Oh mate, I don't want to go either.  I love Soness so much.  But I gotta follow my dreams.  After
caressing her hair for some 20 minutes or so I fell asleep for a bit as well.  Then sent her off to
bed around 2:30am.</p>
