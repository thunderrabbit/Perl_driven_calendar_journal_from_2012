<p class="dream">In some kinda private situation with Sabina, and discussed the possibility of
kissing her, given the great age difference, and she was like, &quot;I know how to kiss!&quot; and
was like &quot;really?&quot; and she goes, &quot;yeah!&quot; in a kinda way that said, &quot;of
course!&quot; and &quot;let's do it!&quot; and &quot;why didn't you ask before?&quot; so we kissed
and it was really lovely and gentle, lasting for just a few seconds.  Then we sat back, Hmmm that
was nice, and went back at it for a bit until I woke up.</p>
