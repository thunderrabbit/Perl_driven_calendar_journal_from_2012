<a class="note">(original version written with my eyes closed:)</a>

<p>Phat Pat and I were plaing the balance game, but while really far away from each other.  He was
up on a balcony in line, and I was down on the ground standing with my toes behind a line.  We kept
trying to throw each other off balance with our funny moves.  Peoeple around us ewere like,
&quot;wha???&quot; but we didn't care cause we were having fun.</p>
<p class="dream">Some kind of worlwide problem occured, or at lest city wide, and people needed o
be given bicycles and sandwiches to get them started on their way home; I was in charge of gettting
the andwiches made, and the bicycles prppared.  Preparation for sandwiches was simple a slice of
bread, spread peanut butter, spread  green pea salad, anotehr piece of bread, in a bag with an
apple.  Bycycle preparation involved cutting the lock on the bike in such a way that it could be
determined that *we* cut the lock, and would reimburse the owner later.  It was determined that if
we cut the chain just below the lock thre would still be a link left on it and that weould prove we
had done it.  We got the first bicycle and sandwiche ready, and opened the gate to give it to the
first perosn in the short line.  I was like, &quot;we're going to need some help&quot; so I asked
Petra if she could help, but she couldn't and I asked if we could get two volunterers.  I put one
in charge of sandwich making, and the other in charge of bycycle chain cutting.  The sanwich making
went well enough, and I saw athe table  covered in bread slices with check peas spread acros them.
The bicycles weren't going as wel.  We ssmed to keep runing out of bicycles and chain cutters and
the guy was like, &quot;I'm nt feeling so hot,&quot; and another guy was like, &quot;I'm going to
tinker with this bicycle,&quot; referring to one which had a huge fish tank strapped to the
back.</p>

<p>Throughout this, people kep coming in the other door asking if we had seen the pit bul.  I was
like, &quot;Michael brought the pit bull by a little while ago, and then another guy came loking
for teh pit butll about 30 minutes ago.  He had a big fuzzzy white dog, but the pit bull had
already left.  Now you're looking for the pit bul, but he's still gone.  I don't know where the pit
bull lives, so sorry aobout that.</p>
