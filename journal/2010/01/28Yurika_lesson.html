<p>I enjoyed a good lesson with Yurika, for which I'm thankful.  Her homework was largely perfect
so we spent some time with my iPhone, looking at <a href="http://how-to-spell-its.com/">how to
spell its</a> after she had a question about the meaning of &quot;it has its ups and downs,&quot;
and was surprised when I said it's a relatively common phrase.</p>
