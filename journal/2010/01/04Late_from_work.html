<p class="date">11:11pm JST Monday  4 January 2010 (day 14530)</p>

<p>Left work at about 10:10pm, and am now arriving at Ofuna station, where I'll need to switch to
another train to get the rest of the way home.</p>

<p>Basically was at work 14 hours today.  Pretty long time for a holiday.</p>

<p>Sunday, I'm taking the day off.  :-)</p>
