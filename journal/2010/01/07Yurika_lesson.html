<p>Yurika and I had a good lesson as usual.  We looked at her transcription of the English portions
of a weekly conversation available online.  It's called Cross Cultural Seminar, featuring a guy who
I like to call —Ω¿Ë¿∏, and Susan Iwamoto.  According to Yurika, they have over 100 more weeks'
worth of material available.  We just did episode 37, and our next lesson will be in 3 weeks, so I
imagine they'll be two weeks farther ahead.</p>
