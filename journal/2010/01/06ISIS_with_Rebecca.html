<p>Fingertips on my belly, where I felt weakness, &quot;like just below there or just above, I'd be
strong, but right there it's weak.&quot;   Easing myself into the weakness I kept clicking out,
into any other distracting thought.  Don't want to go there.  Went there anyway, and felt little
and small and confused and &quot;I don't know what to do.  I just don't know what to do.&quot;  I
hear that mantra on lots of levels in my life.</p>

<p>Found myself as a military leader, like for an army of 10,000 men.  We were in a hopeless
situation, completely overwhelmed and no way to win nor really even get away.  It felt like grabbing
onto a slippery cone, with no chance of grasping it; the tighter I hold, the more it slips away.</p>

<p>Stayed with that feeling until there was nothing to do but be.  Just be.  I felt my hands
getting warmer, and my feet as well.  Feeling into my hands, I suddenly heard ringing more loudly
in my ears.</p>

<p>Began to fade into sleep repeatedly, with visions of John Travolta spinning a tin can around in
his hands, and then of me dragging a big plastic tub with cold water in it.</p>

<p>The water felt like my energy, or my life force, disconnected from the infinite life force.  I
can reconnect to the infinite energy force.  Hey but why, if everything is <em>one</em> anyway, how
can I be disconnected?  Because at some level my consciousness is pushing it away.  Ah.</p>
