<p>To the Pink Cow after that for Japanese Lounge Night featuring Shamisen Master Kumiko, and her
posse of Shakuhachi, Koto, and Shamisen players and masters.  Soness and Pushpa came, plus Soness's
couchsurfer Wade who I met in April (?) at the 4th annual BBQ.  My student Emiko came with Masae,
who we met last Sunday at Cow-Go International Night.</p>

<p>Emiko and I are developing a fun sibling rivalry relationship.  I definitely like her, and
definitely get on her nerves.  She puts up with it, but perhaps doesn't mind.  I'm not actually
sure, but it's fun.</p>
