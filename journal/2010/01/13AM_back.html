<p>This morning I made it back to meditation for 20 minutes and then rock hopping!  I hadn't done
either before work for a pretty long time.  Man it was sooo cooold!!!  I wasn't able to hop all the
way to the top of the T, nor along one wing.  But I did enjoy seeing the water pretty high and
blowing effectively toward Enoshima.  Only one hardy surfer in the water.  Well, only one surfer,
and I'm sure he or she could be described as hardy.  I could hardly stay ten minutes!  Granted, I
was barefoot, but I did have on gloves and my NIN With Teeth skull cap.  Can't seem to find the knit
caps Hitomi made for me.  Hopefully they're at work or somewhere I'll find them soooon.</p>
