<p>Sunday and Monday acted as my weekend, and I enjoyed mega chillin'.  Slept until noon on Sunday
and got out my Clairvision KTs (Knowlege Tracks) to see how far along I had gotten, and where to go
next.  Seems I have finished Valley of Light, and am on to Fu Xi's Mountain, though I must say I
haven't been doing the morning meditation; I haven't been able to drag my butt outta bed early
enough after not going to bed early enough in the evenings.  Half due to chatting with chatty Soness
(who sometimes can't get herself to <em>her</em> bed), and half due to internetting with
interwebsites (which seem to never sleep at <em>all</em>!)</p>

<p>I went to the beach on Sunday to rock hop (chilly and painful but fun and はさしぶり！) and to
see 田中 de la playa, who's actually 田中 de los interwebios, but I met him on the beach.  He lives
in an internet cafe (same price as my previous apartment) and uses unlimited web access to study
languages.  He also works, though I don't know where.</p>

<p>In other weekend news, I have essentially finished Kevin's
website <a href="http://www.shamanism-asia.com/">Shamanism Asia: explore multi-dimensional
consciousness</a> which basically describes in different languages the courses that he teaches.
It's not quite finished, so don't click just yet.  Hahah really?  okay, nevermind.  Go ahead and
check it out.</p>

<p>Um um um, got to chat with Soness on Sunday and Monday nights.  We went to dinner on Sunday at
Za Watami where I think she told me about her trip to Thailand and upcoming plans for hanging out
with [The] Sorcha and NHK and a photoshoot today.  Oh, and we talked to Jon de la Martini, who will
come visit on Thursday!</p>

<p>I replaced the washing machine drain hose (hmmm we need a new word to replace those four) so
water will pour down the drain instead of the floor.  Soness brought home a cute metal trash can
that I assembled.  Last night I cleaned up my &quot;room&quot; (carpet in front of the couch) and
read a couple chapters of _Autobiography of a Yogi_ before conking out to sleep at 2:30am.</p>

<p>Right now it's 9:30am, and my train has arrived in 品川.  Time to transfer...</p>

<p>to the 山の手 line, where I got a seat, but now I want to get up to take a pic of this
interesting advertisement.</p>
