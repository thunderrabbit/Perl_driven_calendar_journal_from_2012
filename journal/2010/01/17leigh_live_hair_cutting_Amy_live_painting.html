<p>I posted several pictures online (but haven't worked out a way to easily put them in my journal)
from the Pink Cow performance art of Leigh (guy with girl's spelling) live hair cutting, and Amy
live painting, and Peter live DJing..  I'm not sure why the term &quot;live&quot; is used, but
basically &quot;on stage,&quot; and &quot;in front of a live audience&quot; are equally or more
accurate.  Anyway, big fun, especially with a whole paparazzi of people taking photographs of the
event.  Lots of Leigh's friends came out, including Lee (girl with guy's spelling (&quot;we took each other's
names!&quot;)).  Amy's partner in painting (whose name I've forgotten) wasn't there tonight.  Turns
out Amy is leaving Japan for 5 months starting in March or so.</p>

<p>My Pink Cow friend Yuki came and we chatted a bit about her starting work tomorrow, and about
her friend Kevin (who works for Metropolis (she used to work at Metropolis)) showing some slides
tonight.</p>

<p>My Kagoshima friend Will came out, and performed as well, but I had to leave before their band
started.  He said he would email me before their next gig.  Nice!</p>
