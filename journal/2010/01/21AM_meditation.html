<p>At 7:45am my alarm chimed and I was like, &quot;erm,&quot; and went back to slizzle, but then I
heard Soness getting up upstairs so I sat up and began my meditation, setting my timer for 21
minutes (1 minute to get settled, 20 minutes to breathe).  She came down before the timer finished
and carefully didn't talk before I opened my eyes and greeted her with &quot;Good morning!&quot;
Until then, I remained conscious of my breath, posture, and crown chakra as much as possible.</p>
