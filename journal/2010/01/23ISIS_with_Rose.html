HI Rebecca!!

I just wrote to Annette after leading an ISIS session for my friend Rose.  She seemed to quite
benefit, and I'm happy about that.

Welcome back to Boulder!  Welcome back to Cali soon!

I haven't heard back from info@CV about possible building team, but I'm optimistic.

In other news, I may have two chances to sail on PB: once from April to July, and the other from
July to October.  wow oh wow

No plans for the US nor A, but building team in California might just do it.  Hmmmmm..

     See you in the space
      - Rob!

<p>This was the first ISIS session I've guided in almost a year.  I'd say it went pretty well.  Rose
was like, &quot;よしっ！&quot; afterward, with a big smile.  Nice.  She had done three or four
sessions with Helma before Helma headed to OZ.</p>

<p>Rose's boyfriend Tada came in during the session, but Rose chose to continue.  That was cool.</p>
