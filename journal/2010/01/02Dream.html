<p class="dream">Back in the US, on some sort of road trip (to SWUUSI?) hanging out with a woman who
was traveling a similar direction through Texas.  Saw my mom and ran up to her to hug and say
HI.</p>

<p class="dream">On a train with a kid diarrheaing everywhere.  I was grossed out and woke up.</p>  

<p>Ah crap I'm late!!</p>
