<p>Though she was a bit late getting out, I helped Jaime get packed (or she would have been super
late) and to the station.  She forgot a few items, including her jacket and rabbits, but we can
send those later.  Sad to see Chef Jaime go, but glad she's going to see her family for Christmas.
Thanks, Jaime, for all the yummies, funnies, love and music!</p>

<p>Been cleaning and washing clothes, etc.  Trying to get the house back to normal before Soness
gets home.  Got two m-sized piles for Soness to scope; she and Jaime are the same size, so there
may be some clothes Soness wants / owns in Jaime's piles.</p>
