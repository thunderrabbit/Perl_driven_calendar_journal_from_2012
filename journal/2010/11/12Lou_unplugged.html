<p>Though I will readily admit I am low on fundage, I have decided to go see Loustar AKA's show
again tonight at The Pink Cow...  I was swayed by the video put up by
Jason, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=457666554869&comments&ref=mf">Loustar
Live in Tokyo</a>, in which I can see and hear clearly how much fun it was!!  Whooo!!</p>

<p>I'm *reallly* going to try to see Lin tonight as well, if at all possible.  I think she's going
to see SAW 7 3D with a friend who really likes the series of movies.  I've never seen any of them,
but Lin said the story is actually quite intriguing.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>In the end, she didn't get to play, which sucks, but Lin and I got to hang out with her cuddly
close at The Pink Cow, which ruled!</p>

<p>She'll be in Tokyo for a while longer (two more weeks?) so I'll certainly get to see her perform
again.  Awesome.</p>
