<p>Okay!  So that was harder than I hoped.  However, doing the preparation for the past couple of
days <em>*really*</em> helped.</p>

<p>I logged in as they wished and used vi.</p>

<p>I solved the first one in about 20 minutes.  It seemed quite fast, but when I saw the clock, I
was like, &quot;holy shit 20 minutes????&quot; cause I had had a flash of taking a break before
number 2, but no time for that!!  I got about halfway, but I did not finish the second question in
the remaining 40 minutes.  I got the code for 1/2 of the processing done, and it compiled, but gave
a segmentation fault when running.  Dammmit.  I know the error is tiny.  I *really* hope they give a
lot of &quot;plus points&quot; for writing in C.  (They said they would give plus points, but I
don't know how much that factors in.)</p>

<p>The third question would have taken me over an hour, just by itself.  Probably a day, actually,
cause I'd need to do a lot of research.</p>
