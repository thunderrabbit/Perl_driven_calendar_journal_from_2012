<p>Holy crap Soness's show is *great* this season! I'm reallllly glad I got to see it; this was
actually the final performance, so <em>whew!</em> just in time.</p>

<p>I teared up three times during the show, once for her personally getting a nice solo (whereas
she didn't really get one in the last season's show), once for a なつかしい song from the previous
season, and once because they made the really good point that we (humans) are all one because we
have tears that taste the same.</p>

<p>Boom!  Can't dispute that, can ya????</p>

<p>She's still signing autographs for a passel of kids, and I'm chillin' in the same hallway, my
pockets stocked with water (for her), Pocari Sweat ((mmmmmm, sweat) for me), and throat lozenges for
any of the cast who may need them.  I got them just for her, actually, but it might be nice to have
bought enough for them seriously to have enough each.</p>
