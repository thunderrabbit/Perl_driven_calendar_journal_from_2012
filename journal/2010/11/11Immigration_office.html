<p>Went to the not-so-busy immigration office &quot;near&quot; Yokohama station (it's closer to
Shin-Sugita station, and not even really close to that), and found out pretty much what I already
knew.  I can look for an IT job and sign a contract as late as 22 Dec (when my visa expires) but
otherwise I need to apply or a tourist visa by that date.</p>


<p>I knew that already.  I kinda knew this next part, but now I have deets: If I get a job as a
programmer, I can apply to work as an English teacher (up to 28 hours per week).  If I get a job as
an English teacher (changing to Humanities visa), I cannot work as a programmer.</p>

<p>I didn't know this:  to work as a masseur, I need to change my visa to Skilled Labor, and for
that probably need a certificate from somewhere.  Or I just need to find a company that doesn't
really check these things.</p>
