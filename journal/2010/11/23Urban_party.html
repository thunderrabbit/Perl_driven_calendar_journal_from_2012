<p>Today Jenn and Chris had a party at their house from 1pm.  For the party I canceled my plans for
Japanese Lounge night, but it turns out I can go to both!!  But it also turns out I'm a bit weary
of people so I'm headed home to chillax.</p>

<p>Met a cool kid named BJ, aka Bill Junior, aka William Baptist, who was pretty entertaining all
around.  His sister Kia was in town from H-town (Katy, actually) so we chatted a bit about where she
lives exactly.  I had heard of the street names,... Fry Road and something.</p>

<p>Downstairs was lots of food and lots of Wii action and two fish tanks featuring two turtles and a
heat lamped bridge between the tanks.  Upstairs was Chris's room with a small jungle gym, two fish
tanks featuring some axolotls and a puffer fish.</p>
