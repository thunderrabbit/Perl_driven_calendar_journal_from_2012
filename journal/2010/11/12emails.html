Hey Travis!

Thanks for asking again about django; I'm a bit sidetracked, but I have been composing a question
for you... I wanted to get some code up on github first so I could show you examples.  Right now,
though, you can see the data which I'm trying to process at http://dev.pekoneko.com/statistics/

Quick version of my question:  how do I display QuerySets that may need some special display depending
on the values in the rows?  Templates aren't really smart enough, it seems.  Maybe by including
templates within templates, but even then, how does the parent template know *when* to include the child?

Speaking in general terms, I am retrieving a QuerySet which returns many rows from many
one-to-many relationships.

A --&gt; a
A --&gt; b
A --&gt; c
B --&gt; d
B --&gt; e
C --&gt; g
C --&gt; i

When I display these, I want to show the one as a title, and then the many related records below that

&lt;div class='title'&gt;A&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;a&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;b&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;c&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class='title'&gt;B&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;d&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;e&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class='title'&gt;C&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;g&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;i&lt;/div&gt;

BUT, the template doesn't have the logic to keep track of last item.title to see if it's different
than current item.title and display the new title as a title instead of just div.

So (getting to more specifics) I've written a function called beautify() which takes the QuerySet
and returns an array of dictionaries (correct term??) that looks something like this when printed
without processing:

	{'count': 2L, 'four_digits': u'3455'}
	{'answer': u'(3+4-5)*5'}
	{'count': 3L, 'four_digits': u'0019'}
	{'answer': u'0-0+(1+9)'}
	{'answer': u'0*0+(1+9)'}
	{'answer': u'(0+0)+(1+9)'}
	{'answer': u'(0-0)+(1+9)'}
	{'answer': u'(0*0)+(1+9)'}
	{'answer': u'(0+0+1)+9'}
	{'answer': u'(0-0+1)+9'}
	{'answer': u'(0*0+1)+9'}
	{'answer': u'0+(0+1+9)'}
	{'answer': u'0-(0-1-9)'}
	{'count': 1L, 'four_digits': u'4444'}
	{'answer': u'none'}
	{'count': 1L, 'four_digits': u'2828'}
	{'answer': u'2+8*2-8'}
	{'answer': u'2-8+2*8'}
	{'answer': u'2*8+2-8'}
	{'answer': u'(2-8)+2*8'}
	{'answer': u'(2*8)+2-8'}
	{'answer': u'2+(8*2)-8'}
	{'answer': u'2-8+(2*8)'}
	{'answer': u'2*8+(2-8)'}
	{'answer': u'(2-8)+(2*8)'}
	{'answer': u'(2*8)+(2-8)'}

The lines with 'count' and 'four_digits' are basically the title lines, and the 'answer' lines are
the items that should be printed below the titles.

I have a sinking feeling that the templates can't even do enough logic to process this elegantly. I
could possibly use {% is_equal %} but 'four_digits' is not always defined, so it's clearly a flawed
process of outputting ...

I think I should search Google for [process queryset before template] or something like that..  for
now this email will just be in my journal; I can't bear to bother you much before I've tried a bit
harder on it.  :-)
