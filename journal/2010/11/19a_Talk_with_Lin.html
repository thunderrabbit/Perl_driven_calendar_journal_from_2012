<p>She brought up a topic difficult to say but dear to her heart.  &quot;What's your vision?  Do you
have a vision for the future, where you want to be 10 years from now?&quot; I said no at first, but
that's not quite true.  I have a vision of sorts (have a space where I can create art, receive
clients for healing, and do meditation workshops), but I don't have a plan for how to get there.</p>

<p>I get blocked at the money issue; how to find the money to get the space or build the place, etc
etc..  but,</p>

<p>I know ways to visualize the reality I want.  Wende and I did it to find our house.  I did it to
find Lin.  Write it down; bless it; feel it; manifest it.  That's The Secret.</p>

<p>So maybe if I reframe my idea so that I'm just looking for the right space I'll be able to find
it more easily; I don't have to create it from scratch.</p>

<p>Internet cafe now to snooze.</p>

<p>I think it might be useful for me to learn vi.  I can understand one of the arguments against
emacs; it does require some finger contortions.</p>
