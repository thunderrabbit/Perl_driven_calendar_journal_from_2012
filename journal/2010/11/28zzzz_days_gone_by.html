<p>Days and days have gone by without me writing....  that is, without me writing in my journal,
but I've been writing a lot of code and a lot of emails.  Recently wrote code to do a little
mini-test in PHP.  <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/Julien7/blob/master/rand7.php">Can you
create rand(7) given rand(5)?</a></p>

<p>It had taken me about an hour to figure out the solution he wanted.  I was pretty happy with my
first solution, though it wasn't exactly balanced.  The second solution (which he preferred, and
which I coded) was balanced, but had the problem of being less efficient in choosing an answer.</p>

<p>Yesterday and today I've been working on learning Ruby on Rails, and finally turned to Stack
Overflow to get an answer.  Since the chat room wasn't responsive, I sent the question to
vark.com</p>

<p>On SO chat: <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/151952#151952">how do I tell
rake db:migrate to use production DB, or how to I tell my server to use dev DB?</a></p>

<p>On vark I don't see how to link to a specific question.</p>

<p>Well that was a long sidetrack; I'm going to bed.</p>
