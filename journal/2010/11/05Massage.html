<p>The day was great; I had 4.5 hours of paying clients and 1/2 hour free to the woman who arranged
it all.  Awesome!  She had even brought in a massage table (with face hole), and had two big mats
brought from the gym.  Most of the massages were on the mats; 1.5 hours of massages were on the
table.</p>

<p><em>And</em>, Sorcha emailed me to see if I wanna work on Thursday during Japan Music Week's
Australia Night!  Whoo hooo!!</p>
