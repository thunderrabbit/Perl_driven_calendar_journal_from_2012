<p>Sweet.  Lin came to the show at La Mama tonight (last night; I'm still awake) and there was a
supa-cool hip-hop performer there named <a href="http://www.loustar.com.au">Loustar AKA</a>, and
though I've not yet figured out why she has AKA on her name, I figured out how to dance to her
bumpin' beats.</p>

<p>As soon as she set up and started playing like the first couple sounds, I was like [shooop]
straight in front of the stage.  I danced Rob's Crazy Dance for all of her songs, and she even
reached out over the keyboard to take my hands at one point, *and* when she freestyled at the end,
I was the star of Loustar's first verse!</p>

<p>I told Lin, &quot;I'm going to go get her CD, and autograph, and a kiss.&quot; Lin goes,
&quot;okay go go&quot; without any qualms, which is exactly the feedback I need to ensure I will not
smooch any other women.</p>

<p>At the very end, after Lin left, Jaime was like, &quot;Lin is *so* *cool*.
Lin <em>wins</em>!!&quot;  Which means I win.  Whooo!!</p>

<p>While we were all chilling at the Pink Cow listening to Sorcha play keyboards, I gave Loustar two
foot massages while Jaime slept with her head on my lap.  After her massages, Loustar slept with
her head on my other lap.</p>

<p>She has offered to come to Chigasaki today to receive a massage from me.</p>
