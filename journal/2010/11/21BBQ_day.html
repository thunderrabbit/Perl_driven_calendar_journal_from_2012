<p>By the time Lin and I got back from the station to Chez Soness, the place was deserted; Maggie,
Jesse, Soness, Joel and Jaime had all gone to the beach.</p>

<p>We joined them and had a lovely lovely day, with lots of peeps in attendance....  The sun set
and we got beautiful pics, and then...</p>

<p>And thennn....</p>

<p>The full moon came up and it stayed light outside.  SO Beautiful so awesome; the sun has been
down for 4 hours and we just got back from the beach where Veronique brought makings for s'mores
and we chowed those, got hungry again, and Joel threw down some beef, then chicken and we had moon
lit yummies, and everything was great great great.</p>
