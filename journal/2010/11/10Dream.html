<p class="dream">On top of a pier, peering down occassionally, I could see a guy talking about his
previous business of moving drugs from Peru to Japan.  He had a white van floating on the water, and
an audience of like 15 people.  When a barge sped by with a huge rocket on it, he started to
apologize and I wondered to whom he was apologizing, and it turned out he was apologizing to the
rocket, and then a police van floated up and he jumped into his van and sped away and they pulled
away and caught him on the other side of the bay and pulled out all sorts of guns and shouting stuff
like &quot;stop that stupid citizen&quot; and &quot;how stupid citizen can you be?&quot; and the
gunman/agent who had a huge shotgun shouting at the guy and pointing the gun at the guy's general
direction was actually looking at me, all the way across the river, and he shot at me with a pistol,
and the bullet hit me but was stopped by the cloth of my hoodie.  &quot;Hahah can't get me!&quot;
and I woke up.</p>
