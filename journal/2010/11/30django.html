<p>After all that, I sat down to get some good coding done on math.pekoneko.com; I had implemented
two of Travis's suggested changes last night (move beautify() outside the Answers class), and now
was ready to do the next step (give Answers a customized Manager class).</p>

<p>Sat down to code and got an email from Lin inviting me to meet her tonight in Yokohama!  Whoooo!!
I was like, &quot;I'ma try to get some coding done&quot; and got just a bit done; the custom class
is created and being used, but doesn't do more than just return the results of self.filter().</p>
