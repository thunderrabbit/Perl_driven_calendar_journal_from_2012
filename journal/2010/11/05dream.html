<p class="dream">In a magazine listing the band Beetlejuice was listed as Jealous Contemporary
Christian music, with picutres of the artist sitting next to a dinosaur scultpture named Namaste,
and in some various other pictures taken in Oklahoma.  I had been looking at the magazine while
waitig for Lin's mom to come back from a shopping trip she was getting things ready for teh wedding,
and I was a bit neavous thining maybe this was a bit too fast, but didn' really have time to tell
Lin, and her mom didn't speak English so I couldn't tell her.</p>

<p>I've been asleep since about 5pm when I got home and no one was home.  Weird. I started to work
on my Mathocheater but was too tired to figure out the documentation regarding pagination, actually
I didn't even get to the pagination bit; I was just reading about the types of objects that do
pagination and was falling asleep so I went to sleep.</p>
