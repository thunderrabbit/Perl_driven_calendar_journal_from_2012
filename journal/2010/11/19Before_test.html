<p>So today's the 1 hour test I have with a company called Surgespace.  It's supposed to be written
using vi, which makes me not quite as happy as if they had said emacs.  I *might* be able to use
emacs here to remotely edit files there; just gotta remember the filename syntax.</p>

<p>Ah, <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000983.html">thanks Jeremy</a>:</p>

<p>In other news, ironically, my lower right shoulderblade features a knot below it, from a bit too
much programming, <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/sea-review/">preparing for this
test</a>.</p>

<p>Gotta go get some foodage.</p>
