I've read several discussions of passing char * in C.

[stackoverflow - passing-an-array-of-strings-as-parameter-to-a-function-in-c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/486075/passing-an-array-of-strings-as-parameter-to-a-function-in-c#486095)  
[stackoverflow - how-does-an-array-of-pointers-to-pointers-work](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1015944/how-does-an-array-of-pointers-to-pointers-work/1015970#1015970)  
[stackoverflow - pet peeve: char * are not arrays](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/423823/whats-your-favorite-programmer-ignorance-pet-peeve/484900#484900)  
[drexel.edu - C tutorial: char](http://einstein.drexel.edu/courses/Comp_Phys/General/C_basics/#character)

Many of them include discussions of arrays, but I want to stay away from that.

I'm writing a sample program to teach myself about the passing of `char *` and `char **` in C.   This is an exercise in passing char *, without using (pointers to) arrays. Also no concerns for execution efficiency.  :-)

    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    
    int get_args_works(int, char **, char **);
    int get_args_broken(int, char **, char *);
    char *get_string(int, char **);
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
      char *string_works;
      char *string_broken;
    
      get_args_works(argc, argv, &string_works);
      get_args_broken(argc, argv, string_broken);
    
      printf("in main string_works (%p) = %s\n",string_works,string_works);
      free(string_works);
    
      printf("in main string_broken (%p) = %s\n",string_broken,string_broken);
      free(string_broken);
    }
    
    int get_args_works(int argc, char **argv, char **string)
    {
        *string = get_string(argc, argv);
        printf("in get_args_works %p string %s\n",*string,*string);
    }
    
    int get_args_broken(int argc, char **argv, char *string)
    {
      string = get_string(argc, argv);
      printf("in get_args_broken %p string %s\n",string,string);
    }
    
    char * get_string(int argc, char **argv)
    {
      int i;
      char *string;
      string = malloc(40);
      
      // placeholder in case -s switch not found below
      strcpy(string,"-s switch not found below");
    
      for(i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++)
        {
          if(argv[i][0] == '-')
            {
              switch(argv[i][1])
                {
                case 's':
                  // release above malloc(40) for "-s switch not found below"
                  free(string);
                  // make room for storing variable
                  string = malloc(strlen(argv[++i]) + 1);
                  // the argv just after -s
                  strcpy (string,argv[i]);
                  break;
                }
            }
        }
      return string;
    }


You can also view the [same code on github](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/sea-review/blob/327bcda133ada7a124be423400e72fef997e5e5d/stackoverflow.c)


The above code is somewhat self documenting.  `main()` passes two variables as parameters to their respective `get_args()` functions.

Each `get_args()` function calls `char * get_string(int, char **)`, using the exact same call.

`get_string()` works fine; it does a `malloc()` and returns the pointer back to the calling function.  That code works, and each `get_args()` function receives the return value as I expect.

But then, when they return to `main()`, why does the doubly dereferenced pointer get back to main, but not the singly dereferenced pointer?

I can see that if I dereference the pointer (`&XXXXXX_works`) when sending as a parameter, it works.  But why?  Isn't it already a pointer?  Why does it need the "extra" (*) dereference when sending as a parameter?

I'm hoping for a winning answer that explains how you (yes, you) conceptualize sending char * as a parameter vs receiving it as the function's return value.

(*) it seems extra to me, but apparently it's not.
