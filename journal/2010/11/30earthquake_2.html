<p>Soness started talking to Yuji again, and saying something about an earthquake (the one earlier
today was apparently 6.4 or so) and was all nervous, and I was like, &quot;dood no worries!&quot; (I
didn't feel one anyway) and asked Yuji to tell her the same.  He did, and I told her I was going out
with Lin tonight and may be back late / tomorrow, but probably tonight (but mayyybe tomorrow), but
anyway, see ya!</p>
