<p>Now we’re arriving in Shimbashi, and I’m just about to go to a lesson with Emiko and then meet 
Lin.  Lesson with Emiko is from 6:30 to 7:30, but I had to get out of the house early because
Soness had her kids' lesson at 4:30 to 5:30, and if I were to leave the house at 5:30, I'd not make
it to Tokyo in time for 6:30 lesson with Emiko.</p>

<p>I imagine I will be able to meet Lin at 8:15; I'll tell Emiko that we are planning to meet tonight.</p>

<p>omg.  I'm sitting here on a chair on the platform in Tokyo station, playing Words With Friends on
my iPhone, and a woman walked up to me and gave me 20,000 yen.</p>

<p>I just said ども and she was already walking away.</p>

<p>I put it in my pocket and wondered what had just happened.  I pinched myself and felt the pain; I
stood up and jumped and didn't fly.  I'm not dreaming.  I just got $200 for chillin' here...
Sweet.</p>
