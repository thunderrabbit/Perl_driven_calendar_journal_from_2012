<p>In the immigration office, I met Daniel, and Bun, a couple from Thailand.  Bun (pronounced like
daniel &quot;boon&quot; more than like a hotdog &quot;bun&quot;) does Thai massage!  She gave me
the name of a shop in Yokohama: Laksa, but I had no luck searching for it.  I have their phone
numbers; I might be able to get an address from them.. Hmmmm.</p>
