<p>Lin had her palm read yesterday and the guy was like, &quot;you'll never have a problem having
money, but you're not good at saving money.&quot; Today her entire bonus for a big sale went to her
landlord for the bi-annual &quot;renewal fee&quot; (which is basically a Japanese thing where the
landlord says &quot;suck a nut&quot; and people just pay it).</p>

<p>Lin's family had a bit of an issue this evening so she wasn't her usual self.  We had a bit of a
fight because I was more focused on music (hey, Nine Inch Nails!!) than on her family.  Fair enough.
I'm glad we had the fight and got that out of the way.</p>
