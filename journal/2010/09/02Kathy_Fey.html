<p>I contacted Kathy Fey to tell her the latest haps:</p>

Just letting you know that after my trip to Thailand, I've been offering healing massages to my
friends and other people for money.  Thank you for being an inspiration for me!

<p>And she replied</p>

It's always nice to know you've been a positive influence in someone's life! Glad to hear you've
begun a new world. I believe I was around your age when I made the same choice. I encourage you to
let go of results - be there for your clients. After 19 years I still love my chosen profession.

Love, Light and Lots of Laughter,
Kathy

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>And then I was all</p>

<pre>
Yay!

I'm glad to hear I've not waited too long.

I hear your advice about releasing the results.  I will do my best each time.  :-)
