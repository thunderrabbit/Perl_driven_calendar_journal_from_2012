<p>Lin and I have just arrived at 5th Station on Subashiri guchi of Mt Fuji.  I'm leaving my computer in the car though.</p>

<p class="date">5:30am JST Monday 20 September 2010 (day 14789)</p>

<p>Back at home.  So tired.  So happy.</p>

<p class="date">9:05am JST Monday 20 September 2010 (day 14789)</p>

<p>Now I'm at work, and will try to capture some of the climb.</p>

<p>3:30am woke up on Sunday at 5th station lodge and started out at around 4am.  Got to the top at
2:30pm, stayed for an hour 20 minutes, then headed down at 3:40pm, reaching the flat pavement of 5th
station at 7:30pm.</p>

<p>The daylight weather was bright and sunny, and pretty hot all the way up to the top.  It started
to get cold and we put on all our warm clothes, but didn't really need them past 9th station or so.</p>

<p>Like the first time I climbed, the route down seemed to take longer than it should have.
&quot;Is this some kinda joke????&quot; I kept thinking.  We were jokingly saying もうううう, and 
まだぁぁ？やっだぁぁ！</p>

<p>I enjoyed the gravel covered route down, jump-skipping at high speed toward our destination.  Lin
couldn't go down quite as quickly, so I waited for her &quot;at that red sign down there,&quot; and
then &quot;at that white sign, or maybe it's a person.&quot; By then, though, it had gotten a bit
too dark to skip down the hill, so we went down at Lin's マイペース.  I helped her step down some of
the steeper root clogged routes, and we just silently trekked down after it became apparent we would
never reach the end.</p>

<p>On the way up, we met a couple at 7th station (?) and saw them again at 8th station, and at the
top.  We got some pictures together.</p>

<p>On the way to 8th station, I had some genki energy and &quot;ran&quot; ahead of Lin.  I fell
asleep waiting for her (only 30 minutes behind me), and they pointed me out to her, which was good
cause she might have thought I went on ahead!  eep!  I had hung U-Cow over a bench near where I was
seated so she'd see him, but he didn't moo or anything useful to attract her attention.</p>

<p>Food on the way here included quesadillas to go, but I may have been optimistic about my hunger.</p>

<p>Rain reminded me I didn't bring rain coat, so got twin plastic tops and bottoms, just in
case.</p>

<p>Chatted and chewed until midnight then slept till 3:30, but I woke up at 3:15 with no alarm.</p>

<p>I have had a bit of a sinus headache since we got to fifth station. It's not too cold outside now.</p>

<p class="date">7:34am Saturday 7th Station subashiri trail, mt Fuji</p>

<p>I was just talking to Marie on my bananaphone, telling her the latest news on peeps we knew in Thailand.</p>

<p>Weather is immaculate. If only we didn't have all this heavy winter gear, it would be perfect. Hahaha</p>

<p>Not sure if we'll finish the whole climb and descent before it gets cold again, but I hope we need the warmth.</p>

<p>janette's quilt, Soness's Mt Fuji staff and Johnny and U-Cow are with us.</p>

<p>Right now there are 15 people at 7th station, including a family with a 8 or 9 year old boy.</p>

<p>Some high school or college kids have an aerosol can apparently full of oxygen, but after they
put its nozzle over their mouth and nose, depress the lever, they're like "I don't know if it's
doing anything...." ぜんぜんわからないでしょう‼</p>

<p class="date">9:00am</p>

<p>We've reached 8th station, I think, but it might be 7.5th station.</p>
