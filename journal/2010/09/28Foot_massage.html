<p>Headed now to Lin's sister's shop to talk shop with them regarding massage, etc.  Hopefully I'll
be able to flex my major massage muscles on them.</p>

<p>When Lin emailed, I was having trouble getting GoDaddy to buy a domain for Soness; I dropped
that project because I'm sure we'll be able to get an account for Soness later tonight.  Maybe not
even all that late if I just go straight home after massage and not to The Pink Cow.  I *think* I
know where the shop is.</p>

<p>Little Blue Monkey's battery is low; I forgot to charge it last night.  I don't think it will
survive all day.</p>
