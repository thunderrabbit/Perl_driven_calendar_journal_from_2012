<p class="dream">Our cars were parked slightly misa lightned and a car came up and tried to squeeze
in betwen them, pushing one car forwrd adn scraping against the side of the wall and then slipping
past and parking in the driveway.  It was Brandon, and I ran up to  catch him and flipped his car
over in anger and demanded he got out.  He was only a little kid and I realized this anger was the
wrong way to handle him.  My fathr had just arrived, and I was like, Brandon, I'm going to let my
father be the judge; he will treat you fairly,&quot; and my dad come inp was saying to someone,
&quot;it looks like there is a little problem, but not too bad; we can handle this.&quot; and I aid
to him, &quot;Dad; I made a mistake in handling this, and I wonder if you can help.&quot;  He said
yes, and  I let Brandon go and Brandom promplty tried to escape, by saying, I will go look for a
chair to sit down.  I watched him carefully and then when he tried to run away, I ran after him to
catch him.  He misjudged the sandy hill headed down to the street and tumbled down in and I jumped
down the entire hill and was upon him before he could even realize how he had ripped.  I said,
&quot;what happened?&quot; knowing full well what had happened, and he ssaid, &quot;I fell,&quot;
and I agreed.  I took him back up the hill and sat him down next to me.  Brandon, this is my
father, and I love him very much.   I am Rob and my dad loves me very much.&quot;  I thought of my
next line, &quot;10 years ago, we used to fight a lot,&quot; but I woke up before I could say it.</p>
