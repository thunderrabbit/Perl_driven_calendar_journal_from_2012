<p>Yay Bananna going to Europe!!!  I went to the embassy to get her visa back, and took it to the
adjacent embassy to let her get that one.  Thanks to Bananna (and lucky me!!), because while waiting
a few minutes for the second embassy to get back from lunch, I saw a garage door open, a Rolls Royce
roll out, and the garage door close.</p>

<p>When I finished with the embassy, the Rolls Royce rolled back, and I got some courage and gave
the guy my card, &quot;I give high quality Thai massages,&quot; and started chatting with the guy.
Turns out, he climbs Mt Fuji all the time!  He can't join for me and Lin's upcoming trip up the
mountain, but perhaps another time, given that he climbs it all the time!!!</p>
