<p>OMG.  I didn't bring any of my business cards tonight.  I'm out in Shibuya hanging out with Nate
and about to go see Akiko..  I brought Johnny and U-Cow, but didn't bring any biznass cards.  D'oh!</p>

<p>Nate was asking some good questions about Chairapy.  He's purty smrt about this business stuff.</p>

<p>Here in Kinko's I just met the owner of Geronimo Shot Bar in Roppongi.  Didn't exchange info,
given my obtuse error above, but good 2 minute chat.</p>
