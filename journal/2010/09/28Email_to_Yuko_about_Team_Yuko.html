<b>Thank you</b>

Hi Rob,

This is Yuko, the one cannot find the answer yet..

Thank you so much for your art workshop at Rimi’s condo.!
It was so fun and I really enjoyed.
 
I was impressed by your great pictures, too!
Well, art is fun, enjoyable and enrich our lives.  
 
(Sorry for my delay in saying thanks to you as I had been in not good condition these days, now I
recovered though)
 
As you told me “Keep going!” even though I am stuck, I am now trying to keep going taking photos.
I appreciate your kind words!
 
By the way, I heard from Rimi that you named the picture the one we could not find the answer as
“Team Yuko” (&lt;= the other Yuko, right?).
I still cannot join the team though..
 
Anyway, thanks again.
 
Look forward to seeing you again in the Rimi’s event sometime.
 
Yuko
