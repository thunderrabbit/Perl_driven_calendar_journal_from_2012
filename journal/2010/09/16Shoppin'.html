<p>Joel and I went shopping for drawers yesterday, and took careful notes at Shimachu of drawer
dimensions on the piece of paper on which we had written the closet dimensions.  Then went to
Shakey's to chow on the buffet.  (note: pizza that looks like cinnamon apple on the menu might
actually be potato anchovy.)</p>

<p>Went to Yamada to see if they have drawers (very few) and noted that I lost the notes from
before.  I think I left them on the table at Shakey's where they almost certainly were not
saved.</p>

<p>Headed home to digest.</p>
