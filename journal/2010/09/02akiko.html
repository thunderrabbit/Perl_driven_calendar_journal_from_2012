<p>Here at TGI Fridays in Shinagawa, Akiko and I (mostly Akiko) have been poring over the
translation of my flyer-thingy for The Pink Cow Body Works nights.  I got another translation from
Nate, but she thinks it's a bit too formal for the tone I'm trying to set.  He said as much, so I'm
not surprised.  He goes, &quot;it's correct Japanese, but it probably doesn't suit your
event.&quot;</p>

<p>We're full, bu,bu,buuttt, Akiko gave me a postcard for Fred, made of rubber, shaped like fried
ham and egg!  Delicious!</p>

<p>Yay Akiko!</p>
