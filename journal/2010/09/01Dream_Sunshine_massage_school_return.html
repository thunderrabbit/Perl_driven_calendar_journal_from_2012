<p class="dream">Walking down the hallway torward the school I saw Claire who was headed to lunch,
and was like, &quot;hey!!&quot; because I had come to see her, but needed to go to the school so I
said &quot;I'l see you in a second,&quot; and we kept going in our respective directions.  Arriving
back at the school was so happy so normal that I just fit in and though all the faces were new I
knew them all with my heart, walking up the huge lawn with kids playing in the grass, and a music
video being recorded with a small audience watching and some lunch bowls from a picnic had been
temporarily abandoned, so I picked them up and went inside the door, squeezing between people
milling about and finding that the place where bowls were normally turned in had changed because of
the big growth of the school, the bowls kept getting broken when we put them there, so now just take
them straight into the kitchen, and I arrived inside &quot;oh hey!&quot; and I saw a tall smiley
woman with a pony tail and I recognized her as a student who I had seen before, &quot;and she asked
a question with her eyes and I was like, &quot;I was here in April, no, May..&quot; and she was all
&quot;me too!&quot; and goes, &quot;you ddin't come back here just to turn in dirty dishes did
you?&quot; &quot;Um,&quot; and I couldn't explain well that yes I had actually because I'm so
dedicated to the school and the training that it's just a five hour flight no worries and so happy
to be back, I said bye to her and then walked into the kitchen and the woman was looking a the
dishes that were clean thinking, &quot;now I thought we had more than this,&quot; and I turned in
the cups I had, and was like, &quot;now where did I put those bowels?&quot; an went back outside to
find them and woke up.</p>
