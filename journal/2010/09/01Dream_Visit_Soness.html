<p class="dream">The lights at the convenience store were brightly lit, but the stairs going up
beside it were dark for sleeping purposes.  I could hear snoring people as I went up, and lo, I
found Kirk sleeping there, sleeping with his head out the door.  His whole family was living
in that room temporarily, and some of his kids were sitting on the steps leading into his room,
playin quietly with pen lights.  I waved quietly to them and they smiled and waved back.  I headed on
to the next room and past some guys in the living room and poked my head around the corner to my
old room where I had left Soness when I left, and her stuff was not there.  Someone elses's was, so
I didn't go inside, but turned to them in the living room and was like, &quot;Does Soness still live
here?&quot; and they were like &quot;No,&quot; so I woke up.</p>
