<p>Awesome day yesterday giving seven (7) thirty (30) minute massages at an elementary school at
Atsugi naval base.  Super special thanks to Eris for organizing everything; she made it really easy
for me and all the teachers to enjoy giving/receiving metta.</p>

<p>Jenn, who I know via Soness, was my first client!  Wow!!</p>

<p>She got a chair massage, and during my next client, I set up a mat to work on her lower back.
Everyone after her chose the mat instead of chair.  Duly noted.  :-)</p>

<p>Next time I will have them bring a double wide mat so my knees will get more support than just
carpet.</p>
