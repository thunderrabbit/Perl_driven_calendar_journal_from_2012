<p>At his place, I helped Miles take down his ten 32 inch TV monitors, associated support arms and
poles.  Andrew came by for a bit to scope the available goods, and said he'll almost certainly buy
a monitor, and may have some other takers for the others.</p>

<p>Taking apart everything was fun.  We then re-hung his door and moved his mattress so we could
photograph his bed.  I suggested and implemented a vacuum process.</p>
