<p>Today I'm helping Miles take down his AV equipment, and hopefully Andrew will be able to buy some
of it.  Assuming that all finishes on time, I'll head down to Kawasaki to watch Soness in their
show, and thennnn go to The Pink Cow for Japanese Lounge Night, though I don't know if Kumiya will
be there because apparently Toshi is in charge of it this evening....</p>
