<p class="dream">Driving along a highway on CB radio with some guy swho had quit their university
careers to start a business idea, I was like &quot;you should put money into the university account
because if your business fails then you can go back to school and have some credit available, and
if your business suceeds then you tell them to build a stadium with the money and they'll say
&quot;what should we call it?&quot;&quot; and just the to accent my great idea, a supersonic jet
flew super low along the freeway and then right up into the sky ahead of us until out of sight and
we continued driving, and I was going like 40 miles per hour in this old electric pickup truck, and
traffic behind me was clogged a bit so I was driving in the shoulder, and trying to make the truck
drive faster and could hear it grinding upward throuhg its may gears and I couldn't find where I
wanted to go so turned around and was driving back bac back and crying after a while cause I was so
tired. I had my headphones on but no music and peopl behind me were looking for me to help me find
the location, but didn't recognize me and I kept driving until I had gone all the way back to the
beginning and turned into a drieway to collapse and when I opened they door and they saw me crying
they started laught at the irony of having followed me so far and not known it was me.</p>
