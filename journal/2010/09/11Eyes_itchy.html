<p>I was having a dream that my eyes were really itchy and woke up rubbing my eyes cause they were
really itchy.  I took a shower and rinsed them out with saline after washing my face and hair and
entire body.  I thought about Air, who had possibly had pink eye during the latter part of my visit
thre.  I drove her to the clinic after work twice.  Anyway, my eyes feel better, though they're
still itchy.  That reminds me that I've not had glasses for a while (since like February or so when
I left them on the train and never got them back (super surprising in my mind)
</p>

<p>Those glasses cost like 600 dollars so I haven't replaced them due to lack of funding.</p>
