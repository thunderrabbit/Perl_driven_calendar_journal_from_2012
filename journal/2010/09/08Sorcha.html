<p>Last night before Sorcha's gig, I gave her a massage to get her all relaxed and prepared.  She's
like, &quot;when I do my grand tour around Japan, I'm going to hire you as my personal
masseuse.&quot;</p>

<p>Awesome.  For now, I'm happy to support my friend and happy to get the word out there.  Special
thanks to Emiko for shifting our lesson time from yesterday to today so we could attend the show.</p>

<p>In addition to Sorcha, Emiko, and I, Margaret, Kelly and Stacey were there, and we met Natsumi,
Brett, Ai, Yuriko, and Kirsten (sp).  And Steve, who works there at Kimono Wine Bar.</p>
