<p>Pink Cow 10th Anniversary was quite a fun hoppin' event!  Divi, Kumiya, Dale, Melissa
were all there, though not performing their various arts.  Toshi did perform, including my favorite
song on koto; I think its title translates to Diamond Cloud or something.</p>

<p>Leslie came as well!  I hadn't seen her since before Thailand.  I gave her a massage and she
purred.</p>

<p>Leigh was there with his band; I danced until nearly dripping with sweat on the wall.
I <del>fell</del> <ins>stepped</ins> off once, though not intentionally.   Ooops!</p>
