<p>Joel and I cleaned the house yesterday, so now I have a more proper place to do computin' than
with my computer balanced on the arm of the couch.  Now it's on the bookshelf in the left hand
closet space, and I'm on Soness's blue exercise ball as a chair.</p>

<p>Megumi, my 1 TB external hard drive, named after Megumi the videographer I know from PB, has now
been reacquainted with my computer, after a 4 month <del>long distance
relationship</del> <ins>lapse in backing up my computer</ins>.</p>

<p>Soness was reallly impressed and really happy to see the awesome cleanliness we created.</p>
