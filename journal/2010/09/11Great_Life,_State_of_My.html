<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Living in Chez Soness on the living room with Soness upstairs, Jaime on her florr, and Joel
on the floor next to me.  We're a fun awesome family.  Jaime and Joel can cook awesomly.. Joel does
front end design and branding, Soness is our marketing genius plus sugar momma while we're getting
our financial footings.</p></li>

<li><p>Had a great Chairapy night last night at Il-Chanti-Beache restaurant, givng massages on the
roof overlooking the water during a charity event for Room to Read / Beers for Books.  I gave about
13 massages and brought in 13,000 yen for the charity, plus made lots of good contacts of people
who want to have  full Thai massages.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer mouse has been sending random X,Y cordinates to my computer; I gotta get a new
mouse after having had this one for years and years.  So long that I don't even know where I got
it.  I wonder if I can look up its model number somehow.</p></li>

<li><p>I just recently created a website for traveling socks.  I'm not going to be specific about
what socks can be photographed.  Put pictures of your socks
on <a href="http://socks.fly2.nu/">Traveling Socks</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I just slept a few hours, chatted with Soness a bit, and am now (10:24am) headed to yoga at Paola's
house/studio.  The weekly Saturday class features me, Emiko, Lin, Sachiko (I think is her name; she
joined last week for the first time), and Paola's husband Jon.</p></li>

<li><p>I have an agreement with Paola so I can use one of her rooms for massages; I've used it
twice so far, once for David and once for JR and his girlfriend.  Because her space is not always
available, I've started looking (via Emiko, Lin and <del>Mia</del> <ins>Daya</ins>) for places I
can rent by the hour.</p></li>

<li><p>Soness's big iMac has been having some trouble; she may buy a new one soon.</p></li>

<li><p>Ami and I have started entertaining the idea of doing English lessons again.  She said she'd
like to meet every 2 weeks.  We met once two weeks ago, and she's skipping tomorrow, so see her in
two weeks ...  = one lesson per month, so I'm not sure how serious she is.</p></li>

<li><p>I realized recently that I understand &quot;shopping therapy,&quot; in that I do the same
thing with website registrations, new games on iPhone, and new applications for my computer.  The
only difference is website registration is free, the new games I download are free, and the apps I
download are free.  Freee!  But still it's the process of getting new new new new new
shtuffs.</p></li>

<li><p>Fred and I have started playing WWF, Words With Friends, in a way specifically designed to
teach us new words.  Short version of his email:</p>

<pre>
10 points for words we've never known
3 points for words we've seen
</pre>

<p>The words I've learned / practiced using so far:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>10 kanzu: a white or creme colored gown worn by men in East Africa</li>
  <li>10 vitta: a dark single cell layer in liverwort leaves</li>
  <li>3 slew: to rotate, usually along the z axis; a lot </li>
  <li>3 abhor: to dramatically detest</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li><p>Tatiana from RC chatted me recently.  I called her back and we're going to meet today.</p></li>

<li><p>No pets, no girlfriends.</p></li>

<li><p>phone = Little Blue Monkey</p></li>

<li><p>computer = White MacBook</p></li>

<li><p>working for OM on Sundays = 2万円 per week/(Sun)day.</p></li>

<li><p>Need to get <a href="http://chairapy.biz/">chairapy.biz</a> beefed up with pics, and turn on
the blog.  During / after last night, I realized I need to focus specifically on businesses; these
party type events are equally or maybe more lucrative.</p></li>

<li><p>I chatted with Jessica a bit recently; I hope to see her this week, but don't know if our
schedules will match.</p></li>

<li><p>The Shonan Shinjuku Line passes through Musashikosugi (and has for some months now).  I
think that's realllly cool.</p></li>

<li><p>Akiko has been working on translating the text for my Chairapy massage info card.  Need to
get that finished by this coming week.  I will probably tweak the English text a bit to remove the
word 'negative' as part of the term &quot;negative energy&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>One of my clients last night had had carpal tunnel syndrome badly enough that she had to
have surgery.  The surgery was simpler than I thought, and apparently effective.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been sitting crosslegged to write this on the train for 28 minutes now (10:52am).  I
gotta get up to let my legs wake up, or my legs are going to melt even worse when I stand up to get
off the train.  eeep!</p></li>
