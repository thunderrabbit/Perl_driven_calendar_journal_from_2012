<p>Hahah so we went, but couldn't get in for two reasons.  Soness hadn't RSVPed properly (she blames
their website not being Mac friendly), and therefore hadn't received word that she would need to
have high heels instead of a gym bag and shopping bags, and I would need to wear a jacket.</p>

<p>My friend Sandra said it was fun, so I may go to the next one.</p>
