<p>Just capturing this thread to show what I've been doing..</p>

<pre>
I don't honestly remember what goals I said, but I have been working on promoting myself... I have
written to several of my acquaintances who put on networking events and parties, offering my massage
services as part of their events. This approach allows me to see lots of people pretty easily, and
not have to approach businesses wearing suit and tie to get in the door.

Also have finished a sign for my 500yen / ten minute massages at The Pink Cow once a month, and the
English version of a page that introduces my services. Will send it off to be translated today.

How are your projects? (I know you're typing with cell phone, so you can just reply telepathically
if that's easier.) Or how about we meet next week or the next? For massage or just lunch is fine
with me.

&gt; &gt; I highly recommend Rob`s massage therapy.  I felt both relaxed and blessed after the massage.  If
&gt; &gt; you or someone you know is in need of deep relaxation, tension release, and stress relief, give Rob
&gt; &gt; a shout.  Support a man in his mission!
