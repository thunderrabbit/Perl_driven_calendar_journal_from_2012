<p>Last night I went to the beach and stood on the top of the T, looking out over the ocean.  I
even tried to sleep a little, lying down on the rocks, but I got a bit itchy from sand and who
knows what's on the rocks.  Tried to lie down on the wooden deck, but was itchy there as well, so I
headed home to sleeeep.</p>
