<p>Went to Minami Senju for a social gathering at the park, basically to meet new peeps and give
some metta as appropriate.</p>

<p>Met Robert, Azeem, Bozz, Eriko, Eriko, Yuki, Shawn, Michael, Katsu, Lester, Mr Toh, and even a
guy who caught a pigeon, but I didn't catch his name effectively enough to remember it.</p>

<p>Bozz was pretty cool and earnest; I told him about PB, so I hope he gets to go, perhaps as a
CC.</p>

<p>omg I'm falling asleep.</p>
