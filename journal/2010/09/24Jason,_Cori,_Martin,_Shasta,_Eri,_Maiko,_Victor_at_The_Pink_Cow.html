<p>At the Pink Cow for International Night, Martin was the first performer.  He played some cool
originals, but when he started with an accoustic guitar version of Salt-n-Peppa's &quot;Push
It,&quot; I pulled out 1000 yen and requested his CD.  Now, _*strictly speaking*_ he said he wanted
to play an homage to songs from the 80s, and I thought he was going to basically do a collage of
songs, and I really wanted to hear *that*!  I'm sure he'd be able to do it, but this night, he did
not.</p>

<p>He didn't have copies of his CD available, so he yousentme (haha, that's a past tense transitive
verb meaning &quot;used yousendit.com to send me&quot;) his album later that evening. </p>

<p>I was on the front couches eating my customary bean burrito (though I forgot to request NO SALSA
EX GUAC, which is what Naoya knows to type when I order, but Spencer does not yet), and eventually
joined by Shasta, who knows Soness from improv, and with whom I enjoyed laughing off our proverbial
asses about 6 months ago when the line in The Question Game came from a guy smoking a joint in a tie
shop, &quot;are those really ties, or are you just fuckin' with me?&quot; and who I was glad to
know <em>also</em> forgot my name, cause I sure couldn't think of hers at first.</p>

<p>A little bit later, Jason, and his um, friend Cori (sp) joined, and soon Jason said, &quot;I'm
smitten with this place!  I have a bar crush.&quot;</p>

<p>After Martin's first set, I went back to say HI to Brad whose name I didn't remember until after
leaving TPC.  His wife was there so it was cool to meet her.  He entertained us with stories about
visiting museums when they lived in London.</p>

<p>Then I met Maiko and Eri, who were sitting behind the soundboard seats.  They're .5 and .75
parts Japanese, respectively, with Thai and Chinese being the other parts, respectively.  They met
in San Diego at school.  We talked a lot about cultural diffs and languages, plus Thailand.  Maiko
was like, &quot;Bangkok is not big and scary; you should visit next time you go to Thailand.&quot;</p>

<p>Later in the evening we were talking about the US military propensity to destroy countries
unfairly, and how she lost her best friend Victor who joined a special Air Force division after
graduating from Harvard.  We toasted to him, and I wanted to acknowledge or even mollify her
sadness, but it was just last month.  That's tough.  Blessings to Victor.</p>
