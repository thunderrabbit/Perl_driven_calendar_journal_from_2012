<p>Yoga was good today, including lots of static positions designed to open our chests and give some
movement to our thorasic spines.  All that was just so we could do sun salutation with better
stretches.</p>

<p>Afterward, we enjoyed bread from Lin and chai from Paola.  Then Lin drove Emiko and I to Shibuya
station to drop us off.  Lin and I will be climbing Mt Fuji this weekend!</p>
