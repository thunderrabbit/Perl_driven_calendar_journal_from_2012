<p>Yesterday I paid Joel 3000 yen to help get my MASSAGE sign for The Pink Cow monthly Body Works
nights.  He also did the English version of another sheet which sorta explains what I do and what
I'm doing in TPC.</p>

<p>Also sent several emails to peeps, working out ways to spread the healing massage.</p>
