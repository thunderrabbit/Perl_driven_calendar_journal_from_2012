<p>Last night was the third Body Works Night at The Pink Cow, and I enjoyed giving about 6 or 7
massages there, with nicely laminated A4 signs as advertising made by Joel Industries.</p>

<p>I made careful note to memorize Daniel's name, as I had forgotten his name after meeting him last
month.  K was there, as Fudworks nude model this time, getting a cow skull painted on her front,
with white straps holding it on.</p>

<p>Divi painted a nude woman on paper, and Sigfried (sp) painted a woman's face <del>drowning
in</del> <ins>surrounded by</ins> a sea of hair.  Hanjo belly danced for us twice, the second time
while I was massaging Emiko, who had come in pretty late after a different event.</p>

<p>Fun dancing at the end before giving a massage to Mia, from Philippines, who was working at The
Pink Cow for her second day (first was last Saturday).</p>

<p>Joel and I stayed until about 00:30 and then headed to the nearby internet cafe to zonk out.  We
overslept by like 10 minutes so I had to pay 105 yen.  He paid double because by getting a drink, he
went over the next time limit as well.</p>
