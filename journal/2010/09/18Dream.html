<p class="dream">We headed down toward the lake and there was another barking rabbit!  and another!
I was afraid they might bite our rabbit, but they just barked at the same common enemy, unseen to me.
We got to the lake and the barking rabbits jumped in, and I felt one bite me, but it was actually
just holding my thumb really tightly.  We realized it was 4 o'clock, so needed to go back inside
because dinner would be served soon.  On the way in, I realized that in the hotel, I would have the
chance to sleep with Julia Roberts because she'd have her own hotel room, and we had done that before
when both in the same city.  On the way to the top of the hotel, I realized another reason that the
World Trade Center couldn't have been destroyed just because of airplanes.  Because the designers
claimed that it would be able to survive many simultaneous airplane strikes, forgetting about jet
fuel constitutes criminal negligence, so they would be sued for being architectural idiots, but that
didn't happen.  I ran back down the ramp with my hands in the air at 45 degree angles and shouted my
joy to Mike, who was walking up the ramp.  He gave me high five, and &quot;that's right!&quot; and
we headed up the ramp together as a whole slew of costumed performers coming down the ramp, many of
whom had their hands in the air, thought we were just copying them.  Carrying chocolate in one hand,
I was asked if I had more chocolate by a guy who also commented on my wearing yellow and black swim
trunks and a vest, saying &quot;1970's&quot; and I got to the top of the ramp and the line for
snacks was pretty long, so I considered paying them each a piece of chocolate so I could go ahead in
line. I realized that might not be a big enough bribe, so I should just stand in line, but then I
couldn't find the chocolate anyway, so I was walking back down and I saw this girl with amazing hair
that sparkled copper, silver, and gold, and I had seen her before, and was going to tell her I loved
her hair, and I imagined she would say, &quot;well if you love it so much, why don't you get the
same color in your hair?&quot; and I was all prepared to say, &quot;because I don't want to attract
attention to myself,&quot; but I woke up.</p>
