<p>Jessica asked if I could chat with her over tea today, and I said yes but then she said no after
I told her that I didn't actually have plans to go to Tokyo otherwise.  Tuesday was suggested, and I
countered with Wednesday, when I'll actually be going, but she'll be busy.</p>

<p>Maybe later this week.</p>
