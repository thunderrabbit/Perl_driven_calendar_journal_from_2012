<p>After yoga, and after a shower, I gave a 1.5 hour massage to Soness's friend's girlfriend, who
fell asleep, and then 30 minute massage to Soness's friend, who fell asleep.</p>

<p>They paid me more than I thought we had agreed.  Will ask Soness to return some change.</p>

<p>After the massages, we enjoyed chai with Paola and her yoga student.</p>
