Monday, the day after climbing Mt Fujian with Lin, I worked in Yokohama. That included shopping for
lights.

Came home and read some of Mike's book.  It's awesome!!

Tuesday I had completely free and mostly read and slept.

Wednesday, after talking to Soness about the state of the chez, my face featured a few tears and we
hugged. I took out the recycling and then started gently punching out the paper from the paper
doors.

Joel put new paper on while I was hanging out with Pushpa.

Pacific Deli for lunch, chez Soness for sunscreen, park for chatting, beach for mosquito relief, and
then headed back for Pushpa's next engagement.

I waved bye as she took SSL to Shibuya and then I took Tokaido line to Tokyo to meet Emiko for our
lesson.

We went to a slightly too nice restaurant and ate tiny delicious portions for big prices. Emiko
subsidized my meal and I thanked her profusely.

Headed home to find Soness, Joel, and Jaime all chillin' like three bob dylans and we harassed Joel
by talking about cervices lapping up semen during mutual orgasm.

Hahahaha
