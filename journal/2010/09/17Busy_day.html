<p>The past few days have not been busy.  Today I'm meeting Miles to see if I'd like to help him
liquidate his furniture and stuff.  Then meeting Ross to pick up my artwork (it's been there a
while).  Then some time free and then going to The Pink Cow for Vegan Buffet!  yay!!</p>

<p>But first, I have just gone to wash janette's quilt which got some mildew on it after its use in
Thailand (and I bleached the shiz out of it; I hope it kills the mildew cause it certainly affected
the color!!  &quot;now my quilt has some <em>stories</em> to tell!!&quot;)</p>

<p>And I just wrote three days of journal entries, which I'll upload now and then go get the quilt.</p>
