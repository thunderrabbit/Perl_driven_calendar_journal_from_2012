<p>I met Lin in Kawasaki today to work on finishing my website and brochure in Japanese; we ended up
talking a bit more about overall business plan, possible ways to get my visa extended (including
working at her sister's studio, or possibly working at Gaba again), and a bit about our Mt Fuji
climb and her desire to have something like a guest house, and my desire to have something like a
massage + meditation + art studio.</p>

<p>She said she wants to meet Soness and is interested in Feng Shui, so that's a cool connection.
I hope they work well together.</p>

<p>We found a place called Wired Cafe, which allowed free wireless internet access.  This was
helpful for showing her my site and stuff on the computer, so she could really see what I was
talking about.</p>
