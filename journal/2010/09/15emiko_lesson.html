<p>6:30pm lesson with Emiko at Tokyo Station was fine. She had written about the artwork (which she
hated) of a Japanese artist.  She wrote &quot;proudly hated&quot; at the end, defending the right of
Versailles to display the work.  We ate at a Chinese restaurant and then sat near a chocolate + ice
cream shop until we got some ice cream.</p>

<p>I headed home by way of Kita-Chigasaki to save money on train pass, but it was drizzling rain
and not as fun this time as the first time.</p>
