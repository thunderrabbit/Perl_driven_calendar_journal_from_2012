<p>Visited with Jessica today, meeting her near her station.  We found a nice restaurant after a
bit, but then I remembered she had said she was going to eat with her family.  We just continued to
walk around and chat about her latest adventures.</p>

<p>I wanted to kiss her at the end, but it would probably have made things confusing.</p>
