<p>Yesterday, while hanging out at Hollanda Montri, ostensibly to chill with Claire, but
realistically on Skype with a WSJ reporter and Sally in Australly, Claire said, &quot;why don't I
switch my day off to tomorrow and we go do something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cool!  Like what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want to do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jungle Flight!&quot; (zip lines!!)</p>

<p>&quot;Come on!&quot; her way of saying &quot;are you crazy??&quot;</p>

<p>I convinced her I was serious, and she was like, &quot;I'll just watch from the
ground..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No no it's perfectly safe!  Have you ever heard of anyone dying while doing that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;of course not!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, then you can do it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay; let's do it.&quot;</p>

<p>So we're going to do Jungle Flight tomorrow, my last full day in Chiang Mai!</p>
