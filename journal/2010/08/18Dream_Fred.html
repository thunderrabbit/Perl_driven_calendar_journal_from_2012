<p class="dream">climbing down a slightly treacherous area with my bicycle, I came across some wet
concrete, so knew we couldn't ride there as the workers were still lurking about the place.  Fred
saw something amiss, however, and climbed down onto the wet surface, and with little dainty
footsteps that left the rebar slightly visible in their wake, walked across the concrete to the
middle and looked up.  He pulled something down and safely off the concrete, and then people helped
him jump down into a big bucket.  Everyone was supportive of his efforts and not mad about the
concrete being messed up.  I don't know what he did for them, though.</p>
