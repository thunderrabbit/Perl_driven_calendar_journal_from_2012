<ol>
<li><p>Johnny has been at Momoko's for some time; he's gotten some new clothes and I'm looking forward
to seeing him freshly dressed!</p></li>

<li><p>I just reenabled offline accesss for Gmail</p></li>

<li><p>The Chairapy website doesn't have the Chairapy logo at the top</p></li>

<li><p>I need to contact someone about branding + trademarking the name and logo</p></li>

<li><p>Joel, Jaime, Soness, and I are residents at Chez Soness.  Girls upstairs, and boys
downstairs.</p></li>

<li><p>We're all looking for (more) work, though Soness has got a few things going on, and I've got
my OM weekend job + the beginnings of Chairapy.</p></li>

<li><p>U-Cow hasn't been outside in a while.  Today included.</p></li>

<li><p>I've got a lesson scheduled with Emiko tonight, and had one scheduled with Ami on Sunday,
but realized I'll be busy.  Still need to reschedule with her.</p></li>

<li><p>I've just written business-related emails to Tariq, Claire, and Nate.  But I had to do it in
emacs because Offline Gmail, though fully synced, isn't letting me save messages locally.  blah.</p></li>
