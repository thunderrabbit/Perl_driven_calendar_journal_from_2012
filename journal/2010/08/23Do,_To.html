<p>Tariq gave me at least 50,000 yen worth of advice.  Awesome.  Also got to meet Michi, who also
does massage.  She has a firm handshake.</p>

<p>So the basic first steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>get some brochures from other companies</p></li>

<li><p>get some pics</p></li>

<li><p>make a brochure</p></li>

<li><p>roll into offices and sell</p></li>

<li><p>go make sure my taxes are paid up</p></li>

<li><p>incorporate</p></li>
</ol>
