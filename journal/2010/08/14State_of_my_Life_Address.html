<p>I know it's only been a few days, but the difference between Thailand and Tokyo seems dramatic.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>jobless and broke, but I've got a good idea for a business, but I'm scared as shit of
promoting myself.</p></li>

<li><p>the idea was actually given to me by Soness, with her blessing that I do it.</p></li>

<li><p>Soness is in Honkers now, for a workshop.  Without her beaming smile and encouragement, I've
been working like a lazy dawg.</p></li>

<li><p>However, Joel has helped a lot, bringing my logo idea to reality, and helping me align the
image on PDFs to print business cards.  I ordered business cards and shirts, but because of summer
holidays in Japan (Obon), they apparently won't be delivered by Monday so I can use them on Tuesday.
So I bought t-shirts, iron on decals, and blank business cards to try and print everything at
home.</p></li>

<li><p>My right ear is infected.  In Thailand I could just walk into any pharmacy and get drops,
but in Japan I'll need to go to a clinic to determine what kind of drops I need.</p></li>

<li><p>I emailed a friend of Soness's about getting a job at MyGym, which loooooks to be a pretty
cool opportunity to work in a gym, teaching gymnastics to kids!  You know, just as I write that, I
think I should definitely do that, and then do my business idea at night, when everyone needs
it.</p></li>

<li><p>Okay, so I'm going to go there either today or tomorrow.</p></li>
</ol>
