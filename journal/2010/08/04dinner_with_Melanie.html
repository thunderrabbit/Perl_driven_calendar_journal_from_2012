<p>Went to Melanie's apartment tonight to return her book and go to Salad Concept across the
street, by way of a pharmacy on her scooter to buy some ear drops for my left ear (infected).  (for
the record; this is my second ear infection in Thailand)</p>

<p>Salad Concept employees put together salads based on what boxes we indicate on copies of their
ingredients list.  I got croutons, cashews, pumpkin, feta cheese, other stuff,  and three servings of pumpkin
salad dressing, which I enjoyed like pumpkin soup.  Yuuummmmy!</p>

<p>Chatted with Mel about classes, plans, and the peeps around us reacting to animals around them.
We kept mocked my having scoped the body of my favorite waitress when she was walking around by
making body scoping eye motions at everyone around us, or even at ghosts over each other's shoulders
to make the other look. hahahaha</p>

<p>Ice cream at Ice Cream Chic after that, where I got vanilla and white chocolate, and she got
white chocolate and something with caramel.  When I tried a bite of hers, I made a blech face and
was like, &quot;I don't like caramel,&quot; and she goes, &quot;good,&quot; with a smile.
&quot;More for me.&quot;</p>

<p>My ear ache was aching more than I wanted, so I headed home around 9pm instead of challenging
Melanie to a wrestling competition.  She declared herself the winner by fiat.</p>
