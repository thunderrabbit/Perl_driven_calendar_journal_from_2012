<p>I went rock hopping after Joel and I rode to the beach.  Got two big blood blisters on my big
toes.  Nice.  After rock hoppage, I was approached by some Japanese guys who were like, &quot;are
you from?&quot; and &quot;what do you like food?&quot; so sat with them a bit, enjoying some friend
veggies and giving massage to two peeps from their group.</p>

<p>They're from a restaurant down the street from here.</p>
