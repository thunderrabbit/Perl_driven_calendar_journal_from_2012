<p>The battery indicator on my phone was fully green after I had used the phone a while, and I was
like, &quot;yay!&quot;</p>

<p>It continued to be fully green as I used it, and I continued to be pleased with its apparent
performance.</p>

<p>I wasn't as impressed, though, when, still indicating its full chargedness, the phone shut down
due to lack of charge.  And that was *just* as I got an email, probably from David, saying when
he'll arrive.  or that he won't arrive. or that he's lost.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's the first one, but it might be that he didn't understand my message saying
where I planned to meet him.</p>

<p>Ah.  I see him outside, on his way in.</p>
