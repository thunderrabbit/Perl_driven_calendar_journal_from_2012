<p>At Ye Olde Pinke Cowe, I met Kaoru, Rie, Tetsu, and Yoshiya, four people who work in the same
company.  Kanako came in after that and we hit it off well; her English is quite good, and we both
wanna go sky diving.  What more does one need?</p>

<p>I gave a hand massage to Yoshiya, and then a shoulder massage to Rie.  A bit later, in the bar, I
gave a shoulder massage to David, then Kanako.  Kanako was funny because when I first started, with
a moment of meditative centering, she kept looking back at me like, &quot;when's the massage going
to start??&quot; again and again even after David was like, &quot;he does reiki, too,&quot; and
explained what he meant.</p>

<p>Emiko came a bit later than everyone else, and Makoto came some time after that.  Emiko talked to
Makoto a bit about Cow-Go, which definitely helped me because the band was pretty loud and hard for
me to commmunicate with him in Japanese.</p>
