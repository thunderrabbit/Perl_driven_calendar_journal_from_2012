<p>Lesson with Emiko was pretty great; she basically paid for the lesson *and* bought our dinner.
I was like, &quot;naw naw&quot; repeatedly, trying to give her various amounts of money repeatedly,
but she turned me down each time, and finally said, &quot;once you're rich you can pay me
back.&quot;</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>We went walking around near the moat and a water fountain I had never previously seen.  There
were lots of mosquitoes so we didn't stay long.</p>

<p>Saw some pics from Tokyo circa 1914; they were pretty cool.</p>
