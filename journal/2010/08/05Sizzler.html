<p>Lovely dinner last night at Sizzler, featuring Shane, Shawn, Claire, and Linh, my current best
(hungriest?) friends in Chiang Mai.  We stayed for a while chatting after having finished eating,
but then Shawn and Linh had to go do a bit of shopping.</p>

<p>Claire and Shane and I shared a beautiful Present Moment.  Shane thanked me for healings in
massage school, and Claire thanked both of us for having been such good friends for her.</p>

<p>Shawn and Linh returned, bearing snacks for my trip home (choco corn flakes and gummi bears!)
Nice little sugar snack they will be.</p>

<p>We were all featured in a group photo on our way out; I will certainly miss these lovely friends.</p>
