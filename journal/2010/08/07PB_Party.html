<p>Attendees of the PB Party at The Pink Cow included Natty Nat Nat, Nerys, Ai, Carlos, Rachel,
Yoko, Chris, Sam, Arif, and Yuuka.</p>

<p>In addition, I met Michi, Rachel's children Sophia and someone else, Carlos' fiance Kai, Sai,
Gregory, and others whose names I've forgotten.</p>

<p>Natalie doing super salsa, brought comments of awe to some of the people with whom I was
standing.  &quot;omg your friend can dance!&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah; she <em>teaches</em> salsa.</p>

<p>I walked back to Shibuya station with Michi, and rode Yamanote to Shinagawa with her, and she
continued to Tokyo and will transfer to another line and head home in Fukushima.  Far out!</p>
