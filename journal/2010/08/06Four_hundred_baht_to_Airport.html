<p>I'm at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, about 8 hours from my flight back to Narita Airport in
Tokyo, where I don't really want to stay very long.</p>

<p>Just before the last stop on the train, a woman was like, &quot;where you go?&quot; and I said,
&quot;airport!&quot; and she was too, so we shared a taxi, the details of which she negotiated.  It
was 400 baht total, and she didn't ask me for money as she was asked by the baggage handler for a
tip, and by the taxi driver for money to get through the toll booth.  Taxi driver: &quot;I only
have 5 baht.&quot;  really?</p>

<p>I think she said her name was Akoni, and she gave me some food during the cab ride.  I was in
the front seat and she was sitting with her bag in the back.</p>

<p>We arrived at the airport (30 km?) and she paid the taxi driver.  I paid her 300 baht; she said
thank you, counted it, offered 100 baht back, and I said &quot;thank <em>you</em>; you made this very
easy for me.&quot;  I also gave her my card and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.  She goes,
&quot;when I miss you, I will call you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, email is probably better.&quot;</p>
