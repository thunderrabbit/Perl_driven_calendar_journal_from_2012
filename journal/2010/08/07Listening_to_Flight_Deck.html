<p>I found a really interesting station on the United audio selections: the air traffic control
conversations between the cockpits and air traffic control peeps over where we're flying.
Our captain just happened to be requesting a &quot;course deviation 10 miles to the right for
weather&quot; when I came across the channel.  <em>wtf</em> I thought.  Wow!  and I've had it on my
headphones ever since.</p>

<p>(we were granted permission to deviate by ten miles, but I didn't actually notice the
change.)</p>

<p>Later, our captain requested permission to fly at &quot;level three seven zero instead of level three
three zero.&quot;  Some minutes later, we were granted that permission, and I heard the engines
throttle up immediately after permission was granted.  Wow!  Some insight on what's going on!</p>

<p>When the signals got a cit staticky, we were told to switch to another frequency.  The captain
did this and called &quot;radar,&quot; something like, &quot;Radar, United eight eight two&quot;
but got no response, twice.  Then &quot;Radar, United eight eight two, what was that frequency we
were supposed to use?&quot; and flipped to the new frequency and all was good.</p>

<p>Soooooooo, how does it work?  Who chooses which frequency who uses when?  Why doesn't a
certain geographic tower always use the same frequency (like an FM radio station)?</p>

<p>A while ago we were talking to the tower called Singapore, and now Naha.</p>

<p>&quot;United eight eight two contact Naha on one three two decimal three,&quot; I think we were told.</p>

<p>&quot;Radar United eight eight two flight level three seven zero checking in&quot;</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>A convo just went something like this:</p>

<p>plane: Naha Control Romeo Bravo zero five</p>

<p>tower: Romeo Bravo zero five go ahead</p>

<p>plane: Naha Control Romeo Bravo zero five request to cancel I F R clearance and something V F R</p>

<p>tower: (unintelligible)</p>

<p>plane: request ten thousand to nine thousand</p>

<p>tower: (unintelligible) nine thousand maintain V F R</p>

<p>plane: maintain V F R zero five (spoken like yes, sir, you're the boss!)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Man; this is really interesting to me.</p>

<p>The (unintelligible)s above might be intelligible, but I couldn't type them in realtime.</p>

<p class="date">1:13pm JST Saturday  7 August 2010 (day 14745)</p>

<p>How can I look up how this works?  How can I listen to the convo from the ground?</p>

<p>I think we should begin our descent soon.</p>

<p class="date">1:34pm JST Saturday  7 August 2010 (day 14745)</p>

<p>Hmmm there was just now a conversation in Japanese.  I guess English *or* the local language is okay..</p>

<p class="date">1:57pm JST Saturday  7 August 2010 (day 14745)</p>

<p>Just a couple minutes ago, we switched to talking to Tokyo Tower, and we're 14 minutes from landing.</p>

<p class="date">2:04pm JST Saturday  7 August 2010 (day 14745)</p>

<p>I just looked it up:</p>

<h3>flight deck</h3>

<p>Listen for your flight number to hear live communication between the flight deck and FAA air
traffic control.  This feature, unique to United, may not be available on all flights, including
oceanic crossings with limited audio communication.  Available at your captain's discretion.</p>

<p class="date">2:08pm JST Saturday  7 August 2010 (day 14745)</p>

<p>&quot;United eight eight two descend to level 190 [snip] knots 290&quot;</p>

<p class="date">2:24pm JST Saturday  7 August 2010 (day 14745)</p>

<p>Captain just told us over intercom that we're at 18,000 feet, 60 miles out, and will be arriving
in 22 minutes.</p>

<p>I wonder what I heard about 14 minutes before...</p>
