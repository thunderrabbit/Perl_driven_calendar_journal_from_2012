<p>Though it's smaller than I had expected, My Gym includes gymnastic type genki energy that I
really enjoy.  I watched about 20 minutes of a class while talking with Kota, the manager of the
branch.  I could feel myself getting happier and happier about the high level of energy and being
able to work there.  Nice.</p>
