<p>Ami and I met at 18:30, a bit later than necessary because I hadn't been able to charge my phone
while sleepin' at the internet cafe, and chose not to worry much about it today.</p>

<p>We ate at Bubby's Cafe, which I would call a diner, or even a restaurant, but it was good in any
case.  I told her some stories about Thailand, and she told me her latest crush is a Korean drummer.
I couldn't tell at first if she had really met him.  It turns out the hasn't.</p>

<p>I looked for a kids' English app for iPhone, but didn't necessarily find a good one.  Found a
couple okay ones, but they weren't free.</p>
