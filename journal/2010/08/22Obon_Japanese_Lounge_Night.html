<p>Great to see Kumiya at JLN tonight!  Also in attendance: Divya, Pushpa, Emiko, Louise, Kiki,
Soness, and others.</p>

<p>Kumiya invited someone on stage (me!) and taught me how to play the first three notes of the
Japanese song &quot;Sakura&quot;  Nice.</p>

<p>I gave brief massages to David, Vladia and Akina, whose last week is this week.  She will be
headed back to Germany.</p>
