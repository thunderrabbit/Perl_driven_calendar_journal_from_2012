<p>Some time ago (a year?), I sent a donation to WikiLeaks.org, basically to thank them for the
great work they're doing at lifting the veils hiding what happens behind the scenes of the apparent
world around us.</p>

<p>Last night, I was contacted by a reporter who saw my apparent support of the site, asking if I'd
consent to an interview</p>

<pre>
about whether you are indeed a supporter, why you support the site, what you think of its work, what
you think of the recently published Afghan war documents, etc? 
</pre>

<p>Hmm!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd jot a few things before the interview.</p>


<ol>
<li><p>The world would be a lot smoother if everyone were honest / mind readers.  If that were the
case, we could just focus on research, education, relaxation, and love.</p></li>

<li><p>The United States, ostensibly built on liberty and justice for all, has gone to great lengths
to take liberty and justice from its people in covert ways, and from people around the world in
directly aggressive wars, economic, literal, and probably otherwise.</p></li>

<li><p>Around my final year of high school, when it came time for me to register for armed services,
I personally made a decision that I will never kill anyone.  I therefore respectfully declined to
serve.  &quot;Sorry; I'm a pacifist.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>As we watched on live TV the north tower of New York City's World Trade Center spewing smoke, we saw
another plane hit the south tower.  I immediately said, &quot;we're at war.  There's no way that
was an accident.&quot;</p>

<p>Kept watching, and the buildings seemed fine, and suddenly they exploded, identically, in ten
seconds flat.</p>
</li>

<li><p>I bought the official story, but then someone said, &quot;have you heard about WTC 7?&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>World Trade Center 7, which was *not* hit by an airplane, also collapsed on 11 September 2001.
The official report says &quot;This was the first known instance of the total collapse of a tall
building primarily due to fires.&quot; and says, &quot;WTC 7 did not collapse due to fire-induced
weakening of critical columns.&quot;</p>

<pre>
the remains of all the WTC buildings were disposed of before congressional action and funding was
available for this Investigation to begin. As a result, there are some facts that could not be
discerned, and thus there are uncertainties in this accounting. Nonetheless, NIST was able to gather
sufficient evidence and documentation to <em>conduct a full investigation upon which to reach firm
findings</em> and recommendations.

<p>Aight, this is weird.</p>

<p>In preparation for the interview, I read up on WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>It
seems <a href="http://www.legitgov.org/Wikileaks-founder-Julian-Assange-annoyed-911-truth">Julian
Assange does *not* support 9/11 Truth</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that an <a href="http://wtcdemolition.com/blog/node/2901">early WikiLeaks co-founder no longer supports WikiLeaks</a>.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p class="date">3:05pm ICT Wednesday  4 August 2010 (day 14742)</p>

<p>Okay, the interview is over; she asked Qs that seemed reasonable, trying to get an idea of
demographics and motivations for someone who'd support WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>She wanted to quote me on a thing I said, and summarized it as &quot;there seems to be a movement to move money to just a few people..&quot; and I said, &quot;mmmmm I'll write something for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Here it comes..</p>

<pre>
The accelerated shift of money and power to an ever shrinking number of people has got to stop.
</pre>

<p>By revealing what's really happening behind the proverbial scenes, maybe we can help everyone realize we're falsely imprisoned by money.</p>
