<p class="dream">A friend had a large boa or python that was super cuddly and funny squirming arond
keeping my body cool while keeping his body warm.  I was trying to get him to wrap loops around my
body inside my shirt, but he was so heavy he kept falling through my shorts and escaping
downwardly.  I looked down to find him and there was also a little bitty boa constrictor on the
ground.  I picked it up as the bigger snake came down and put it safely somwhere and then woke up.</p>
