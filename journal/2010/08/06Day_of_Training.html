<p>About 20 minutes into the train ride, the novelty of riding a train kinda wore off.  I slept
under janette's quilt for a bit and woke up about 2 hours into the ride, and noticed that
everything was pretty quiet.  <em>Hmmm!  Now's my chance to stand between the cars!</em></p>

<p>I went out between the cars and watched the world whizz by around me.  I saw the ladder for
climbing up onto the top of the train, but have basically decided to wait until I get to India (*)
to do that.</p>

<p>(*) I don't currently have plans to visit India, but after hearing people's stories during this
trip, I've moved it higher on my list.</p>

<p>I took some pics, but then realized video would be possibly more interesting.</p>

<p>I got a slightly sweet video showing some rice fields and a train station whizzing by.  The
video received the designation of &quot;sweet&quot; because I just happened to be filming the track
(rail) below me when the track for the station branched off.  With a slight delay, I tracked the
side track with the camera, assuming something interesting would soon appear on the track.  A train
station fit the bill and filled the screen with its train station goodness, and then I tracked the
track back to our track.</p>

<p>The video got the designation of &quot;slightly&quot; because the station is all blurry and we
can't see its name, but we can see two people standing watching the train go by.</p>

<p>I was between the cars for maybe 20 minutes before it started to rain, so I came inside the
train, and *that* turned out to be just before the train stopped at a station with NAKHONLAMPANC
written on its sign.</p>

<p>We just got lunch.  Only 8.5 hours to go!  (( with that in mind, I don't think I recommend the
train for doing the entire Chiang Mai to Bangkok trip in one shot.  It's fine for doing shorter
trips, esp. if one has something to see or do in the cities where it stops, but 12 hours?  Let me
quote Sita: &quot;yeah nah.&quot; ))</p>

<p>For the record, when Air heard that I had bought a second class ticket (there were no 1st class
tickets available for the train I selected), she was slightly shocked.  Now I know why hahaha.</p>

<p>&quot;In first class you can sleep sleep sleeping, but in second class you can only sit sit
sitting.&quot;</p>

<p>We were just in Phitsanulok (sp), which looked to be about the biggest station we've visited so
far.</p>

<p>I know &quot;visit&quot; isn't quite the right word, but I couldn't think of a verb that didn't
require a preposition.</p>
