<p>Great fun chillin' and chattin' with Travis today at his and Yumi's place in Kyodo.  He's the
house husband, so rearranged his usually busy schedule to hang out with me today.  We made ice
cream, ate it, checked out some music, videos, music videos, programming languages, and he
introduced me to some amazing things called quines I think.</p>

<p>Yumi came home from work as Travis was beginning to cook our dinner, bánh mì, Vietnamese
sandwiches.  Yummy yummy, though with a few too many jalepeños for my tastes.</p>

<p>After dinner, I showed them lots of pictures from Thailand, basically just zooming through the
pics taken on days that I took a lot of pics (and therefore were from the most interesting
days).</p>

<p>Suddenly it was 11:30pm, and I needed to get out for last train purposes.  Made it handily, but
not by miles.</p>
