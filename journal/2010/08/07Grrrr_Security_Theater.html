<p>Fuckin' security theater bullshit.  &quot;Have your bags been with you at all times?&quot;</p>

<p><em>No; I went to sleep and was in Alpha Centari system while they waited.</em>  &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Yes; Shawn gave me a T-shirt; Claire gave me a hug and kiss; the electrical outlet gave me
electricity; the lady at the counter gave me ice; the guy at the other counter gave me a sticker;
you're giving me a hard time; et fucking cetera</em> &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you a terrrrrororrisst?</p>

<p>Yes, because I fucking disagree with these so called safety procedures which do not make us more
safe.  The World Trade Center was destroyed by Cheney and Friends to score loads of cash and start
wars around the world in this New American Century.  <em>they</em> are the fucking terrorists.  Not
you and me, mate.</p>

<p>Then they were like, &quot;aight; stand up on this block,&quot; so I stood up on it, and they
were like, &quot;nah you gotta put your bag down&quot; so I put them on the block with me and when
they tried to take them away I was like, &quot;do not take my bags away from me; they must be with
me at all times.&quot;  She gave it back, and I got to be scanned and reveal the contents of my
pockets when they bleeped off the magic bleeping wand.</p>

<p>Then they went through my bags looking for something dangerous.  Nothing found.  No water, no
toothpaste, no toothpicks.  I think next time I'm going to put something non-stinky but gross in my
bag, like fake rubber dog doo, or tons of rubber spiders; that would be awesome.</p>
