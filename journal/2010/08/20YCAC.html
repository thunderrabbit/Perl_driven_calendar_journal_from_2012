<p>Ian invited me to the YCAC last night, which stands for something like Yokohama Cricket and
Athletic Club.  I invited Joel and we all had a good time.  The club seems to be well-attended by
westerners who have a bit of money.  hmmm.  Joel and I were in flipflops, shorts and T-shirts,
whereas everyone else wore ties, sleeves, slacks, and shiny shoes.  hmmm!</p>

<p>They had the equivalent of a beer and bottle of wine each.  I had orange juice, and an Osaka
Tower, the name the bartender gave for a Kobe Tower with orange juice instead of grapefruit
juice.</p>

<p>For some reason, I didn't remember to bring my new business cards.  Dang.</p>
