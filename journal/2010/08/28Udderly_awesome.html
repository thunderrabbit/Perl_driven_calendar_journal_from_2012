<p>Really great night tonight at The Pink Cow.  At the end, I told Spencer, &quot;you know how they
say 'do what you love and the money will follow?'  Well I think I just fuckin' found it,&quot; after
having done 100 minutes of massages at The Pink Cow's Body+Works event.</p>

<p>Even better, a few people said they would pay me for full body massages in Ikenoue at the Yogasan
studio.  Sweet!</p>

<p>I missed last train to finish the massages, so now I'm in Manboo internet cafe for the night.</p>

<p>This morning, starting at 6am, someone's phone alarm kept going off every 2 minutes..  for about
30 minutes.  Fortunately, I'm an awesome sleeper and wasn't too affected by it.</p>

<p>So, I've done massages paid with food, and I had done one or two for money, but last night
included my first adventure in doing a series of paid massages.  A queue of three people even formed
at one point!  :-)</p>

<p>Between each person, I carefully did an energetic grounding (with water) and noted how good it
felt to do that.  At one point I was thinking &quot;meh&quot; at first, but then I could feel an
unease come over me as I was about to massage the next person.  &quot;I'll be right back,&quot; I
explained.   &quot;I've got to go wash my hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You stay here, and I'll be right back.&quot;</p>

<p>I need a better way to explain that; maybe I'll make a laminated card.  Yes.</p>

<p>After pretty much everyone had gone home, Spencer asked if I'd like to be a permanent part of the
Body+Work night.  Definitely yes.</p>

<p>Sweet.  I've just emailed Joel sketches of the laminated cards that I want.</p>
