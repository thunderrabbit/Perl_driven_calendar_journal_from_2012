<p>Slept late (to 10am) after being up late (to 5am) and then was writing some notes in prepartion
for giving a lecture on self-massage techniques.  Then pulled my boxes out of the shed and went
through them to toss stuff and pulled some books out that I don't want anymore.
Gave <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/8234373">Monstrous Regiment</a> to Joel, and
registered a couple more books to give away at The Pink Cow.</p>
