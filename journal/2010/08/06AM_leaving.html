<p>Right now I'm in the Chiang Mai train station restaurant, having been dropped off by Air, and to
be met by Claire who will bring Johnny, my bear.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p class="date">8:25am ICT Friday  6 August 2010 (day 14744)</p>

<p>Ah!  Claire and Yute have just arrived.</p>

<p class="date">8:41am ICT Friday  6 August 2010 (day 14744)</p>

<p>I'm now on the train, in a quite thoroughly air conditioned car.  The seats are bigger than
economy airplanes, but it looks like the doors will be closed so I can't hang outside the door like
I've seen on the movies.  Ah well.  I *might* be able to stand between the cars, an area which is
*not* surrounded by a shroud as in Japanese trains.</p>

<p>We're moving now.  Right on time, or a minute early (?)</p>

<p>I've got two seats to myself, though I just paid for one.</p>
