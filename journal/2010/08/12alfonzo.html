<p>Meeting Alfonzo and Nate today to see if I can work with them a bit.  I'm thinking they're
thinking nah, but we shall see.  In any case, free food!</p>

<p>To save cash on the way up here, I'm taking the Toyoko Line to Shibuya instead of JR to Ebisu.</p>

<p>Ah dang, I just realized that by being at the front of the train, which usually means I don't
have to walk as far to get where I'm going, I have to walk further to get there.</p>
