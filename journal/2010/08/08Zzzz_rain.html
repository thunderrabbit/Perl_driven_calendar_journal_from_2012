<p>Great fun tonight, a successful night of riding bicycles to Kamakura, riding back in the rain,
and lots of fun in between, including meeting Peter (who I had met before), and three of his
friends, Andy, Alvey, and Claudia, with all of whom (except Peter), Joel and I hung out during the
rain, both riding in it, and waiting it out in a train station, with free watermelon, and by an
aquarium, near where three bikini clad women vanished after having asked for my email address.</p>
