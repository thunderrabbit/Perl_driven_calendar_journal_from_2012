<p>After much gnashing of teeth and iron on decals, we got the logo printed for my t-shirt for
today.  I'm optimistic I can get it done before heading up to meet Soness and peeps in Shibuya.
These will be my first official Chairapy clients.</p>

<p>The neighbor across the fence (beyond the garden) helped me understand the decal directions.  I
could plainly understand their graphic directions for print and wash, and iron, but not for *dry*.
Need to dry the decal.  It's upstairs drying in the sun.</p>
