<p>Massaged Masaki, whose back has had problems for 3 years.  He and I attended yoga lesson with
Paola together, along with Rin, with whom I had planned to climb Mt Fuji in September.  I'm not sure
I can go, though, because of weekend work.  But when I saw her I was like, <em>hmmmm; maybe I *can*
go, after all!</em>  but have pretty much decided not to in the end, so it's all good.</p>

<p>The yoga lesson was challenging, as always, and I kinda overstretched my right quad.  Hmmm.</p>
