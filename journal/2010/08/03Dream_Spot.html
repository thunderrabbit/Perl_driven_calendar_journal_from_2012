Spot came to see me in a dream last night.  How is he doing?  I'm forever thankful that you've cared
for him longer than ever imagined.  okay, your mom, but still.

How are *you* doing?  Why don't you come to see me in my dreams?

Austin is calling me; I may come back for a bit this year.

    love always and ever
      - Rob

<p class="dream">Trying to write in my journal while Spot was doing cat yoga on my keyboard, I
couldn't get mad at him cause I was so happy to see him again.  I wondered how I would be able to
get him back home when I went back to Texas, and thought the best way would be to take a ship back,
so he could live not in a box during the voyage.</p>

Not my mom.  Kevin's mom.  Spot lives at my old house.  He's an indoor
cat now.  He's getting old.  He's got 1 eye and is enjoying the indoor
life with Kevin's mom.  He's got an outdoor, used to be stray turn
somewhat tame (for Kevin's mom only) ladycatfriend we call Bob.  With
his eye having been removed, he was getting infections and had to stay
indoors but when the weather is nice he gets to look out the screen
door.  I don't know why he visited you in your dream but it's nice to
see old friends.  I don't know why I don't visit you - it sure seems
like a cheap way to travel.  :)
