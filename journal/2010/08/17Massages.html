<p>Last night Soness rented an hour of me out to her friends for Chairapy massages in Shibuya.  Five
massages, starting with Karou, then JR, then Henry (I think was his name) then Kei, and finally
Mike.  Henry, whose name I've forgotten, may be ready for a two hour massage.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to enjoy the massages, and I look forward to going back.  Fear abounds about the
pricing, but I know the company can afford it.</p>
