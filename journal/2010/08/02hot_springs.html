<p>After school yesterday, Dot's class went to hot springs near Chiang Mai.  Though I'm not in the
class, Dot invited me and I was happy to join because I had never been to this part of the city.
(It's far enough away that it's probably not Chiang Mai, but I didn't hear a different name.)  We
had enough people to fill two vans.  I sat beside Andreas and his girlfriend Anh.  Andreas, from
Italy, and I talk talk talked all the way, taking funny pictures of U-Cow, including with U-Cow
leashed with Andreas' long dreadlock, etc.  Anh, from Thailand, was acting shy, but we got a picture
of her with U-Cow as well.</p>

<p>We had just over two hours to play at the hot springs when we arrived 10 mins before 5pm.  From
what I could tell, they've got a couple of geysers, one of which continually fills a small pool with
near boiling water (95 C?), and the other which continually sprays into the air, and then flows down
a little trough in the ground in which people can rest their feet or swim.. ... Hmm now that I think
about it, swimming is probably not encouraged, but I swam in it a bit.</p>

<p>But first, I went with the bulk of the group to the far end of the trough to go where swimming
was encouraged, for the mere price of 50 baht.  The pool was not directly fed by the trough, but by
warm water pouring from a faux rock structure made to look like a cliff with waterfall spilling
over a cliff.  The water was hazy with particles, though I know not what.  Several of us romped
around in the water and took pictures with U-Cow, including a cool one with water spiraling off him
as he spun flippingly in the air.  He was visually in front of Olivier in the background, which is
cool, but made U-Cow a bit more difficult to see.</p>

<p>I sough hotter water, so walked to the hot end of the trough, and nearly busted by ass walking
*in* the trough, but arrived alive and intact where several people in a group took pictures with
U-Cow, and pictures of me and U-Cow, including swimming in the pretty hot water (40+ C?).</p>

<p>I talked with a man from Taipei who told me retirement at 55 in Taiwan requires one to have
worked in the same company for 25 years.  Wow!  I wonder how the federal government benefits from
having people stay in one company...  He was retired from chemical engineering work which had him
working with Japanese companies, so he and I spoke a few sentences in Japanese.</p>
