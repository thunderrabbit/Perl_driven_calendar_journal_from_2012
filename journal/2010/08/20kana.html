<p>After the YCAC, we were hungry again, so Joel showed me where Kana works.  We had nan and Joel
had curry.  As we were talking with Kana, I could feel how tired / horny I was.  I just wanted to
smooch and smooch her.  Joel asked if there would be 花火 at the festival, and someone may have
said, &quot;I wanna see hanabi,&quot; and I said &quot;I wanna be where Kana be,&quot; but
fortunately, only Joel heard.</p>
