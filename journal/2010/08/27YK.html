<p>YK saw me in Shibuya station; he and I had each planned to take the 23:03 Shonan-Shinjuku Line.
He welcomed me back to Tokyo and told me he's about to start up a bit of a hiking group.  Then he
told me about an awesome hiking place called Sea of Trees in English, or 青木ヶ原, a place which
apparently strikes fear into the hearts of most Japanese for all the suicides that have happened
there since the idea was popularized by a book in the 1970s.</p>

<p>YK said the place is 35 sqare kilometers of rocky undulating tree covered magnetic rock, so
magnetic compases don't work properly inside.  Off the trail, people get quickly lost, and many (try
to) get so lost that they can't get back out.</p>

<p>He says it's his favorite place in Japan because it's <em>so quiet</em> inside the forest.  No
animal noises, and no noises at all save for wind in the trees.</p>
