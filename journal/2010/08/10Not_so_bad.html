<p>Hmmmmm  A week ago, I expected I would cry upon arrival in Narita (like I did when coming back
from OZ).  I didn't, and actually felt pretty much better than I thought I might.  When Soness
finally got back last night, she suggested a really good idea: massaging people in their office
chairs.  IT peeps who may need it most are least likely to get up and get massaged.  So if I go to
*them*, then they may have a better chance at receiving a treatment.  Awesome.</p>

<p>So I brainstormed some names, and came up with Chairapy: chair therapy, and will buy it soon, if
I keep on liking it.</p>

<p>I even have an idea for a logo.  hmmmm; I can do this!</p>
