<p>Had a super headache after doing too much computer stuff yesterday; man I need some Chairapy!
Soness tried to cure my headache with a game that basically tried to use my brain to move my
headache to a tiny location in my head, but it didn't work.   at all.  I went to the beach, which I
didn't think would work either, but would be cooler (less hot) than being inside.</p>

<p>Ami called me so I talked with her a bit; she'd like to study English again.  We agreed on
Sunday 22 August.</p>

<p>Turns out I can't meet her that night as I'll be at Japanese Lounge Night, but I'm sure we'll
sort out a different time.  She's mentioned the desire to study twice to me since I've been back in
Japan.</p>

<p>I went to sleep last night with my super headache, and woke up without it, as expected.</p>

<p>Thank you, Headache Fairy!</p>
