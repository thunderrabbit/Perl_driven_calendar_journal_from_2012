<p>A Doutour overlooks the Shibuya terminal (*) of the Tokyu Toyoko Line.  Fred and I ate there
first thing after he arrived in Shibuya on his trip to Tokyo a couple years ago for Christmas, so I
enjoy those good memories each time I see the cafe.</p>

<p>(*) not the terminal for much longer!</p>

<p>I ate there this morning, thinking about Fred, before taking the 7:30am Limited Express to
Yokohama, where I'll meet Ian for a thai massage at 9am.</p>
