<p>Today I went to the tax office and was like, &quot;I wanna pay my taxes,&quot; thinking they'd
be able to look my name up (like Santa Claus) and tell me what I owe.</p>

<p>They couldn't.  Or they didn't, but in either case, I was asked to bring back as much
documentation as I can and try again.</p>

<p>This is all in preparation for starting Chairapy with a clean tax slate, on which I'm not tax
late..  um.  sorry.</p>
