<p>Claire and I just did a zipline course (1500 baht per person, including lunch), and, shockingly
enough, I forgot to bring Johnny and U-Cow! OH
NOOoooooooooooOOOOOoooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo00000000000000000oooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOO0oes!!!</p>

<p>I did bring my camera, so got lots of pics.  Mostly of her because she was more focused on not
falling than photography.</p>

<p>We were the only two in our tour, so with two guides, Mike and Shai, four people completed the
course with 100% survival rate.</p>

<p>When we first arrived at the first station, before Mike went over the rules (starting with
&quot;don't unhook your carribeaner (sp) for any reason&quot;), I climbed up on top of the ziplines,
and was standing on them before he made it to the platform.</p>

<p>He goes, &quot;what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm standing on top of the ziplines; what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>He didn't tell me to get down, which is good because I kinda doubt he would have understood the
joke when I started to get down by dancing disco.</p>

<p>Lotsa pics going up soon.</p>
