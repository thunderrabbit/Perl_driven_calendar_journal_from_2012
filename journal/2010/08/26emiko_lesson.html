<p>Lesson with Emiko tonight was super great for me, because *after* the lesson, she drafted an
email in Japanese for me for my hopefully first corporate Chairapy client.  I already gave her the
lesson free for writing the first reply last night, and now I've told her that if I get the client,
I will give her a percent of the net pay.</p>
