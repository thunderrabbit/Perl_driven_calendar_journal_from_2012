<p>I just tried to create an account with a website, and noticed a couple problems.</p>

HI

I found a bit of a bug in your account creation process. When I created a new account using the
password below, I was told it was an invalid password.

Even though I received that message, the account was created anyway.

That's the bug.

Worse, however, your system is insecure because the passwords are stored in plaintext in your
database. That's bad.

To handle them properly, you should hash the passwords with salt and store the hashed password. Then
when someone loses their password, you create a temporary password, hash that and store it in the DB
while sending them a link including the plaintext version.

They click on the link, the password in the URL is hashed and compared to the DB, and if it matches,
remove the DB entry and then show the user the change password page where they can change their
password.

Here's some more info:

Please note that md5 is no longer considered secure for password hashing.

Thanks
