<p>Last night saw LA for maybe the last time.  Chatted with her a bit, seeing her pictures from
Anchorage, Alaska, which she loves.  She loves the nature, and loves to talk about the beauty in
Alaska.  I enjoyed just talking with her and her smile.  Gave her a big hug (stable hug with no
patting on either back) and namaste.</p>

<p>Saw LA again this morning in Imm Eco reception.  Now we've just shared probably our last hug for
a while.  She's off to Nong Khai to volunteer teach at a school or something for a couple weeks or
more.  I think she'll be back, but maybe not before I'm gone.</p>
