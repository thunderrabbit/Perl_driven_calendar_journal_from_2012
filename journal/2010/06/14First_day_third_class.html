<p class="date">3:39pm ICT Monday 14 June 2010 (day 14691)</p>

<p>Have now essentially finished the first day of my third beginner course.</p>

<p>In the class are me, Marie, Marie, Maude, and Lars with Air as our teacher.  I have worked
with Lars and Marie, but not with Maude nor Marie.</p>

<p>After lunch, I received 45 minutes of leg work from Da (who fills in when bodies are needed to make
the class numbers even) and then gave her 1.25 hours of leg + side massage.</p>
