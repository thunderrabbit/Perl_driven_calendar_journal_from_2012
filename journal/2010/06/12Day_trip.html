<p>Air drove me on her motorcycle to a cool temple on a hill.  The temple included a school for
young monks (monkies?) and some huge beautiful paintings on the walls, depicting the chains of the
real world vs the freedom of nirvana.</p>

<p>Further along the road to an animal research center place that had monkeys in reallllly too
small cages, and I was like, &quot;I want to let them all out!&quot;  They were going stir crazy in
their cells, some of them alone, or up to four monkeys in one cage.</p>

<p>Recorded a bit of video of some cute piglets, and then some video of peacocks flying themselves
up at the top of their cage, and one of them escaping.  Nice!!</p>

<p>Now we're in a little shop on the side of the road having noodles and veggies.</p>

<p>Air said her head hurt a bit after climbing 300+ steps (and driving motorcycle all morning in
the sun) and is taking a quick nap in this temple with a view overlooking Chiang Mai.</p>
