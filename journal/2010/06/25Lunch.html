<p>Air took me on her motorbike to the vegetarian restaurant, where we were joined by another
student at Sunshine whose name I've heard and forgotten.  He's from South Africa, and apparently
knows the guy who was indicted for setting a lot of Capetown mountains on fire with a careless
cigarette toss from a gondola.  He denies it, but has been stuck in SA during the legal process
(which has gone on a couple years now).</p>
