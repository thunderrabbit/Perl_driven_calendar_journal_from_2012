<p>Today is the last day to learn new sequences.  Face massage.</p>

<p class="date">4:31pm ICT Wednesday 23 June 2010 (day 14700)</p>

<p>Traded face massages with my preferred Marie in the morning, and then after lunch traded
freestyle thai massage with Lars.  He did chest, both arms, and one side for me in an hour and a
half.  I did his legs and back for him, including my full body weight on his back.  (it started with
my kneeling body weight on his back, then Air standing on his back, and then me standing on his
back.)</p>

<p>Lars showed me a couple of pressure points around the knees.</p>
