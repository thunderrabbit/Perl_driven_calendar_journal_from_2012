<p>Just saw Scott leaving Imm Eco.  He had started out in our Thai massage class, but dropped out
after two days cause he was feeling sick, with the intention of attending the class that would start
the next week.  He chilled and watched TV for a few days, but then some stuff came up and he decided
to go down to the south islands.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, I saw Stella and her friend leaving.  Turns out they are moving into a house
instead of Imm Eco.</p>
