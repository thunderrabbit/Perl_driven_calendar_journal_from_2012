<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I lost my precious ring.  It had elephants walking around the band, each holding the tail of the
elephant in front of it.  Maybe I can find another.</p>

<p>During class, I had put it on U-Cow's tail, as he was hanging from my back pack.  Rode my bike 25
minutes (in the bumpy style of my riding, with traffic, over curbs, etc) toward my next massage
lesson with the blind guy whose name I still don't know how to spell.  Starts with an S, like
Senshai or something.</p>

<p>I went past where I thought it should be, so turned around and saw Da behind me.  Wha??  How
random that she'd be right here too!!</p>

<p>She pointed to her ring finger, and then to U-Cow.  Oh snap.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> she might have followed me all the way from the school to tell me.  Wow.  I
didn't realize that until I already left her, headed back to North gate to find Avery.</p>

<p>Got a new one that's pretty much as identical as I could reasonably expect.  560 baht.</p>
