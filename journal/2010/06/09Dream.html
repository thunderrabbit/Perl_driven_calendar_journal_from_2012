<p class="dream">Shawn was like, &quot;is that a sandstorm coming?&quot; and the house owner was
like, &quot;aoo yes; we better seal up the house&quot; and we started closing all he windows. I
wanted to close them with tomething opaque, but the best they had was glass and some plastic
venetian blinds.  In fact, the first thing I started to close was glas window slats like my room at
ImmEco  I closed everthing I could, but when I looked out the window I just saw blue skies, though
we were in a valley with a mountain quite near by, I  didn't see any indication of a storm, sand or
othrwise.  I told Shawn, and he was like, &quot;you don't see it now, but when it comes, you will
know it's a sadsotrm.&quot;</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>
