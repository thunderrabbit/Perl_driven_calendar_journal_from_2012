<p>Chatting with Lars a bit this afternoon about languages.  Trying to remember where Bjork is from
and whether it's Bjørk or Björk or something else.</p>

<p>Air asked him to lead a Tai Chi class tomorrow at 7am, but he's saying, &quot;it's not basic Tai
Chi...&quot; so I wonder how that will go.</p>
