<p>My plan for the test today:</p>

<pre>
 5 mins feet
20 mins energy lines
10 mins single leg
10 mins other leg
 5 mins stomach
 5 mins chest
10 mins arm
10 mins arm
flip over
10 mins legs
15 mins back
flip over
15 mins face
</pre>

<p>This morning, we chose little slips of paper labeled A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2 in order to
figure out who would be matched with whom.  I chose C2; Maude, with whom I worked yesterday, chose
C1, so we were partnered again today.  Similarly, the Maries were paired yesterday and today, and
Lars worked with Dha yesterday and today.</p>

<p>My plan proceeded pretty well!  I did something like 10 mins on the feet, which was perfect
because she asked me not to work on her stomach.  Nice.</p>

<p>Now I have a certificate of completion of 180 hours of thai massage.  Sweet-o.</p>
