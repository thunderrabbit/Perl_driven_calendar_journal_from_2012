<p>Just had a pivotal experience in my life.  Hanging out by the pool with Avery, talking about
comics including <a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> and <a href="http://qwantz.com/">Dinosaur
Comics</a>, a woman came up all HI to Avery and then explained, &quot;I was just at the school
getting a treatment from Ohm, and I asked her about getting some reiki.  She said to come to Imm
Eco and ask for Rob.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's me,&quot; I smiled.</p>

<p>I sat with her for about 20 minutes, requesting reiki energy for her body, trip to Cambodia, and
connection with her angels.</p>

<p>Afterward we were chatting, and she asked about U-Cow and Johnny.  I told her a short version,
including Francois.</p>

<p>She has a friend with many many pictures of a bird, but no website yet.  Perfect.  I gave Lucie
my card to offer a free fly2.nu site to her friend.</p>
