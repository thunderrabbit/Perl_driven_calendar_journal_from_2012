<p>In Senshai's class, I found out that Natasha got mugged last night, which I guess is why she
didn't come to Sunshine school today to be a case test for us.  Gah.</p>

<p>At dinner with S S and C, I found out that Claire has been stalked by a guy who's changing his
name online (multiple accounts) to try to get money etc from her.  We advised she walk away.  I
told her about Soness's story.</p>
