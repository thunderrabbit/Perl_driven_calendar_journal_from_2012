<p>Great class today with Trayl teaching Assessment and Treatment.  Basically being able to look at
a body and see what needs to be stretched, strengthened, or left alone.  Even just by lunchtime, I
knew I wanted to take the class again.  It's a 30 hour course.  Good times ahead.</p>

<p>Today we learned some basic terminology and concepts, and a few little exercises to evaluate and
support a person's breathing habits.  Zen breathes quite well.  Air and I are chest breathers.  Not
sure about Trayl.</p>
