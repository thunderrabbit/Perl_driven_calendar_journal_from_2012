<p><a href="http://tribeofbrooke.blogspot.com/">Brooke</a> wasn't there.  I was like,
&quot;whut???&quot; and then &quot;what time is it?&quot; to the woman who had greeted me.  Ah; just
8pm.  She arrived a bit late because her taxi picked up the passengers from a different taxi that
had become immobile for some reason.</p>

<p>Brooke and I are both from North America, both concerned about exploitation of people, and both
reading existential books (if that's the right word).  _The Power of Now_ by Tolle for her (though
she preferred _Be Here Now_ by Ram Dass), and _Tantra Vision: The door to nirvana_ for me.</p>

<p>However, there is a point for which we're total opposites: she's allergic to bananas.</p>
