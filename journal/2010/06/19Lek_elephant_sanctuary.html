<p>Headed back from chilling with elephants today
at <a href="http://elephantnaturefoundation.org/">Elephant Nature Park</a>, the home of 31 elephants
who have been rescued from abusive/dangerous/neglected situations.  Lek is the founder, having
bonded with an elephant from age 5 to 13, and making this her life work.</p>

<p>Several pics and some vids coming soon to an internet tube near you.</p>
