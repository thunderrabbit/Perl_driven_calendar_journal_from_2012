<p>I was Air's model today for sitting position.  She chose me because Da wasn't available when we
started, and Air said I already knew the positions so wouldn't need to see them to take notes.</p>

<p>Maude treated me in the sitting postion, and then I consulted her when it was time to exchange,
because I actually <em>did</em> need to see the postions and take notes, so I did this while Air
worked on Lars.</p>

<p>After treating Maude in the sitting postion, I moved on to face massage, and spent a lot of time
in &quot;shampoo&quot; because Maude said it felt good.</p>

<p>Marie and Marie worked together this morning.</p>
