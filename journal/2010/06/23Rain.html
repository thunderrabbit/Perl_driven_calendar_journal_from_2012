<p>Got home from 5-7pm class with just a bit of sweat.  Got into the shower to remove the sweat,
and when I got out, I heard water pouring outside.  Hmmm.  Then it slowed so I hopped on my bike
(Orange Number 2) and it started pouring.  I was utterly soaked by the time I got to Shane and
Shawn's old guesthouse to ask about the restaurant I wanted to find.</p>

<p>They didn't know, but they did know the names of the bridges, and I realized I had turned right
when I shoulda turned left, because I did *not* know the names of the bridges.  (now I do, or at
least do a little bit more)</p>

<p>Arrived just exactly at 8pm, but thought I was super late.</p>
