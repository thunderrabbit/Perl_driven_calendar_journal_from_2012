<p class="dream">Mrs Beasley had a contract with the local jail to watch the prisoners in her yard when the jail
could not.  She employed some local youth to help her.</p>

<p class="dream">The youth, being youth, were easily distracted at times, and didnt have as much life experience
to know what was what.</p>

<p class="dream">Mrs B removed the sign that said something like &quot;sign Mrs B watching prisoners&quot; and I
didn't know if it said &quot;this sign is removed while Mrs B is watcing prisoners&quot; or the other way
around.</p>

<p class="dream">She went inside and was not watching the prisoners (I didn't see any anyway) and one of the youth
was struck full in the face with a flying car door that fell right out of the sky.</p>

<p class="dream">I couldn't watch, but kinda watched with the corner of one eye.  The youth was okay, but lost her
mind and was planning to swim through a tube in the ground, and her two friends thought it was a
great idea so they joined.</p>

<p class="dream">They got to a place where a guy was pulling rocks from out of the tube and placing them on the
ground outside it.  The rocks were plenty heavy, like bowling ball siized, and the tube was full of
water; this was a plan full of folly in many respects.  The three girls were watching the guy and
began to follow his instruction on holding their breath underwater to remove the rocks.  They
counted the sequence of twenty words, ten numbers from one to ten and then some names  didn't
really recognize as anything, but maybe cloud names or angel names.</p>

<p class="dream">I left them and went to see Mrs Beasley who was  talking to her friend in the living room.  The
friend was talking about the latest gossip or so, and then there was a knock at the door and in
walked a woman who looked like the angel Gabriel from the movie Constantine.  (curly
blonde hair).  She was an angel, in fact, and had a small parchment and began to read,</p>

<p class="dream">Representing Mat and Don, I hearby offer you the sum of one trillion dollars, if you have just
been preaching the name of the lord Jesus Christ during the moment of my arrival.</p>

<p class="dream">And the room was a bit silent, and I began to sense that the friend of Mrs B always *did* preach
Jesus, but just hadn't gotten to it yet this time around, and I went out after the angel,
&quot;excuse me, but don't you think it would be more effective if you were to visit people while
they were alone and have given them a full chance to comply with the rules on your parchment?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">No answer, and I walked toward her putting my arms out to her.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Will you marry me?&quot; I inquire, putting my arms around her.</p>

<p class="dream">She goes, &quot;no,&quot; reading my future, &quot;you become a thief and besides,
when will you be home?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I said, &quot;really?&quot; and &quot;mmm true.&quot; but then gave her a kiss.  Her sleeve puff
was in the way of her lips as we flew.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;nice effect with the sleeve there,&quot; I commented.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Mm,&quot; she agreed.</p>

<p class="dream">I persisted with the kisses, &quot;but isn't it so nice to kiss in the physical?</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Mmm,&quot; she agreed and began to kiss me back.   We kisssed and kissed as
she flew us somewhere,
and while we were flying, I go, &quot;or perhaps you could set up the knockng sound as an alarm for
yourself.  You could hear the knocking, put the TV on pause, and then appear at the location and
say, &quot;well hello, might I inquire as to the contents of your present coversation?&quot;
&quot;why yes, I was just suggesting to the Young Lord Helms that he might find the likes of Jesus
Christ in his heart could be quite beneficial.&quot;  &quot;Oh really?  I must say that is splendid
news, for I am here to offer you one trillion dollars for having done the very same.&quot;
&quot;etc,&quot; I completed, and dispensed with the fake British accent.</p>

<p class="dream">She didn't answer, but perhaps entertained or was perhaps entertained by the idea.</p></p>

<p class="dream">Then she dropped a zinger, &quot;how is it that a guy like you has come to live in the basement of a woman like Mrs Beasley?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I began to cry after I thought about the answer, &quot;I don't know... It seems that I keep trying
to do everything myself these lifetimes instead of relying on help from you, and I end up needing
help from humans who aren't really in a position to help.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">She didn't answer, but accepted mine.</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>

<p>wow.  Kissed by an angel.</p>

could not.  Se\he employed some local youth to help her.

The youth, eing youth, were easily distracted at times, and didnt have as much lie\fe experience
to know what was what.

Mrs B removed the sign that said something like &quot;sign Mrs B watching prisoners&quot; and I
dn't know if it said this sign is removed while Mrs B is watcing prisoners&quot; or the other way
around.

She went inside and was not watching the prisonres (I didn't see any anyway) and one of the youth
was struck full in the face with a flying car door that fell right ouft of the sky

I couldn't watch, but kinda watched with the coorer of one eye.  The youth was okay, but lost her
mind and was planning to swim through a tube in the ground, and her two friends thought it was a
great idea so they joined.  

They got to a place where a guy was pulling rocks from out of the tube and placing them on the
ground outside it.  The rocks were planety heavy, lie bowling ball siized, and the tube was full of
water; this was a plan full of folly in many respects.  The three gilrs were watching the guy and
began to follow ihis instruction on holding their breath underwater to remove the rocks.  they
counted the sequence of tw  twenty words, ten numbers from one to ten and then some names  didn't
really recognize ansas anythng, but mabe cloud names or angel names

I left them and went to see Mrs Beasily who was  talking to her friend in the living room  The
friend was talking about the latest gossip or so, and then ther was a knock at the door and in
walked a woman who looked like the angel facing Keanu Reaves in the movie Consantine.  (curly
blodne hair).  She was an angel, in fact, and had a small parchment and began to read

Representing Mat and Don, I a heaby offer you the sum of one trillion dollars, if you have just
been preaching the name of the lord Jesus Christ during the moment of my arrival.


And the room was a bit silent, and I began to sense that the friend of Mrs B always *did* preach
Jesus, but jst hadn't gotten to it yet this time around, and I went out after the angle,
&quot;excuse me, but don't you think it would be more effective if you were to visit people while
they were alone and have given them a full chance to comply with the rules on your parchment?&quot;

No answer, and I reached her and put my arms around her.
