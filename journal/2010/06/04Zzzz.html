<p>I've been going through the installation process of image-dropbox for Colleen's bear Monty's
website.  It's not going as smoothly as I had hoped.  I'm having the most trouble with the .htaccess
files.  Showertime now.</p>

<p>Hmmmmm  I think I might know what the problem is...  Johnny's site is installed in
domain.tld/directory/html  while Monty's site is in domain.tld/html  I just want the html part to
vanish. </p>

<p>Bedtime now.  Tomorrow, Wayne and I will have breakfast before 8am and then join Shane and Shawn
for a daytrip to see ... some peeps.</p>

<p>Today we're going to see Kayan Lahwi.  (I didn't know the correct name last nigt.)</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kayan_%28Burma%29&oldid=362473738">Kayan
(Burma)</a> in Wikipedia:</p>

<pre>
In 2006 some of the younger women in Mae Hong Son started to remove their rings either to give them
the opportunity to continue their education, or in protest against the exploitation of their culture
and the restrictions that came with it. In late 2008, most of the young women who entered the
refugee camp removed their rings. One woman who wore the rings for over 40 years also removed her
rings. The women report temporary discomfort which faded after three days. The discoloration is more
persistent.

<p>Sigh.  I must say I've wanted to see the rings (coils) for a long time.</p>
