<p class="dream">Was at a political rally to show off how great the United States military power
was, and at the climax, they launched a rocket with multiple stages, and it launched and went up up
up about 200 meters before slowing down and failing back and the lower stge crashed down right into
the crowd on the ground in the stadum, and then the upper stage began rocketng just bfore it hit
the audience, and rocketed upward alog the curve of the stadium, effectively roasting a path of
people on its way up.</p>

<p class="dream">Thought scared, I trusted my angels to keep me safe, and  stayed watching and a
guy came to me asking for water so I went into my bathroom and turned on the coldwater so he could
get into the shower, but he said he didn't need that much.</p>

<p class="dream">Seretly I was glad the rocket failed, so perhaps the people in US would revolt and
get the country back on track with effective leadership and no corruption.</p>
