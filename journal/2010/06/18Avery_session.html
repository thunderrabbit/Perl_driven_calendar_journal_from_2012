<p>Avery came over for a massage session tonight.  I was like, &quot;though I don't have a
prototype for this massage, I was considering mixing in some reiki as I'm inspired, if that's okay
with you,&quot; and he was like, &quot;I have never had reiki intentionally given to me,&quot; or
something to that effect.</p>

<p>We chatted most of the time, with conversation ranging from the blind masseur who teaches, to the
spirituality of the Vatican, from the awesomeness of The Last Supper (which he has seen), to the
un-awesomeness of The Mona Lisa (which I have seen).</p>

<p>I started with reiki on Avery's feet, and then did some thai massage type things on feet and
legs, though not in the order I learned in class.  Didn't do energy lines, but moved up to reiki
his stomach for several minutes.  Chest and upper arm thai massage, then flipped him over for some
reiki on his back where a woman in the park recently introduced some pain to his spine.  He said it
was much better, and then I popped his back in a couple of places, with techniques I have used for
years, plus some extra oomph that Shawn suggested, which did the trick for each pop.</p>

<p>Moved up to his neck, but figured he should be back on his back, so had him turn over again and
pressed some pressure points, plus a few techniques that Avery taught me (feet on shoulders,
finger tapping on forehead).</p>

<p>Nice.</p>
