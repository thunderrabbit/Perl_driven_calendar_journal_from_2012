<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I live in Imm Eco, my resort away from home, in Chiang Mai, Thailand!</p></li>

<li><p>I'm in the middle of 3 months in Thailand, most of which I'm spending in Chiang Mai (2.5 months), most of
which I'm attending Sunshine Massage School (9 weeks X 30 hours per week)</p></li>

<li><p>Tik is my favorite receptionist at Imm Eco.  She works basically from 3pm to midnight, or 2pm
to 11pm.  She recently helped me move from room 1111 to 4217 (because Imm Eco moved everyone out of
my building to do some roof repair).</p></li>

<li><p>On Friday I finished my 2nd two week Thai massage course, with Shane, Shawn, and Wayne as my
fellow students.  Air taught the class, her first in English!</p></li>

<li><p>Have made some videos featuring U-Cow in the pool at Imm Eco.  Fun times.</p></li>

<li><p>Online, have <a href="http://abj.fly2.nu/">Johnny's website</a> with several pictures.  I'm
hoping to get U-Cow shifted to a new easier-to-use website.</p></li>

<li><p>I've finished two beginner courses of Thai massage at Sunshine Massage School.  One with Ohm
and the second with Air.  I'll take my third course starting Monday with Air.</p></li>

<li><p>Been hanging out with Shawn, Shane, and Wayne from the class a lot.  We went to Tiger
Kingdom, and to an elephant show and snake show (behind the scenes abuse in the first two cases (tigers are drugged,
elephants are mentally broken), and, ignored, but abuse right during the snake show.</p>

<p>Also went to &quot;long neck&quot; village last weekend and met Mana.  I asked curious
questions about her life.  Six years in the village the size of a few sports fields, can't go back
to Burma, but life is better here where water and food are more readily available.  She learned
English and Thai by listening to tourists for 6 years.  In the village, they still speak Kayan.  Her
husband regularly makes 100 baht per day (enough for 3 small servings (no drink) at street vendors).
She makes between 0 and 500 baht per day.  It costs 500 baht per month to send her son to
school.</p></li>
