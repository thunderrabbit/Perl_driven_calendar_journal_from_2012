<p class="date">2:31pm ICT Thursday  3 June 2010 (day 14680)</p>

<p>Today is the fourth day of my second class; we're doing stomach, chest, and arms.  Air's sequence
for arms includes a lot more detail than what we learned in my first class with Ohm.</p>

<p>I've mostly been working with Wayne today, though I took a video (1.5 hours) of Shawn getting
massage from Air.</p>
