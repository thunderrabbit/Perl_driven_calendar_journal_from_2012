<p>I'm chillin' north of the north gate of Chiang Mai, ready for hours 9 and 10 with Senshai Sensei.
Avery, Shea, and I have been taking 2 hours from him each evening this week.  Avery attended last
week as well.  I'm not sure if I'll attend next week, because I'll be taking a new class at Sunshine
with Trayl.  If the class requires no homework, then I'll attend Senshai's class for another
week.</p>

<p>Class was good, and included a lot of &quot;change model&quot; between Mike, me, and Senshai.
I'm not sure why Senshai did it that way; I woulda wanted to practice on both Mike and Senshai.
Avery left after the first hour, so I was the only paying student..</p>
