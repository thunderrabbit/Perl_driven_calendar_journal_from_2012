<p>I visited Tik for a bit at the reception desk and asked if I could get a discount on the room
because it's well smaller than good ol' 1111.  She was like, &quot;sorry jack,&quot; and said she
couldn't.</p>

<p>Even so, I got her some water from 7-11 because she helped me with Thai language a bit (and
she's really cute).</p>
