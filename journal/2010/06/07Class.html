<p>Good third Monday of classes today.  After I found out that Air will be teaching the next
beginner course, I was like, &quot;hey Air!  I'll be in your class again next week!&quot; and she
was like, &quot;oh no!&quot; jokingly(?) and &quot;you don't need to take the beginner class again;
you can move on to advanced.&quot;</p>

<p>hmmm!  Though I'm already registered (and paid) for the beginner course, I guess that credit can
be applied to an advanced class.</p>

<p>We'll talk to Max later this week.</p>
