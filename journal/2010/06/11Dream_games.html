<p class="dream">Outside with a group of people who were playing red rover and I joined them
because they seemed friendly enoough. I had been watching as the game started and the first guy who
ran across didn't make it through the line, and then before the nexte person could be called,
someone ran through the line and stole someone back. From there the group just kep growing and
growing, and I joined and the game became to kick balls back and forth, so they were kicking or
throwing little soccer balls and we'd try to kick them back, so everyone had to pay attention to
about every direction from which the balls might come.  I saw one coming but ended up missing it,
but caught another with my kick so that was rewading.  I was just getting into the game and I heard
a voice from behind say my name as in I needed to go now.</p>

<p>woke up and checked my clock.  Ah I need to wake up.  I wonder whose voice that was..</p>
