<p>At breakfast with DJ this morning, we talked about the oil spill and how some people are
thinking BP and the govt are trying to make it a disaster, holding back on the cleanup.  Norway,
for example was like, &quot;no worries; we can do it!&quot; right when it happened, but they
weren't allowed.</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>Wayne joined us with some red breakfast, and I got a picture of Johnny at his plate, who then
immediately nose dived into the ketchup on Wayne's egg.  I started to wipe it off and then Wayne was
like, &quot;actually that was a good picture,&quot; (and I agreed) so I put Johnny's nose back in
the ketchup for the photo op.  Then wiped him off again.  Now it looks kinda like he's got on
lipstick.</p>

<p>Said bye-for-now to DJ, who's going to Bangkok to meet a girl.  He'll probably come back to
Chiang Mai.</p>
