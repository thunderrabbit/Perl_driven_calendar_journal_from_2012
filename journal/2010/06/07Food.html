<p>I got some new food tonight; I went to a stand next to my favorite dessert stand.  I've looked
at the ingredients several times, and never could figure out what it was.  A drink?  Food? Sweet?
Savory?  Spicy?  So I just pointed to a container and was like, &quot;one!&quot; and she was like,
&quot;????&quot; so I pointed to the first item on the menu, and was like, &quot;one!&quot; and she
whipped it up.</p>

<p>First, she whipped a towel off of a big bowel which held the main ingredient: shredded carrots
and cucumbers(?).  To that she added some this and that and served it up. Tangy sweet yummy, with
extra peanuts by my request.  Yum-ish!  Not sure if I'll get it again, but I know I'll get my
favorite desserts again and again and again!!</p>
