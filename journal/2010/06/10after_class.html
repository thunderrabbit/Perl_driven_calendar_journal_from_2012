<p class="date">10:30pm ICT Thursday 10 June 2010 (day 14687)</p>

<p>Today was the last class before our test tomorrow.  Air very generously offered to come to
ImmEco and answer questions for us.  We set up six deck chair pads to act as thai massage mats and
went to work.  A woman named Kathleen from England (who now lives in Hong Kong (but is now in Ohm's
class)) came to watch for a bit.</p>

<p>Shawn and Shane worked on each other.  Wayne and I worked on each other and made animal noises
to mimick the animals around us.  Air answered questions until there were no more, and lay down on
one of the mats for a bit to watch.  I gave her a bit of reiki and massage treatment until she fell
asleep.  Everyone was basically done so we put the mats away and woke up Air and she, Shane, and
Shawn headed home. (Wayne and I were already home.)</p>
