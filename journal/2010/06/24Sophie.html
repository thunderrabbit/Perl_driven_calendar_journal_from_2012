<p>Chillin' with Sophie (from Brighton) in her room (4210) after having dinner (pad thai) together
outside (on the patio) at Imm Eco (resort away from home).  She's studying Thai, and able to read
some.  Yay!  She's wondering, though, why they gotta runalltheletterstogetherinsteadof adding spaces
between words.</p>

<p>She finished a something, and I was like, &quot;you wanna go to bed?&quot; and she looked at me
and goes, &quot;whot?&quot; and I was like, &quot;not like, 'go to bed,' but do you want me to get
outta here so you can sleep?&quot;</p>
