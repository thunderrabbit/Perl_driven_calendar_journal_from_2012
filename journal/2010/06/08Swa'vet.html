Yo baby!!

I'm studying Thai massage in Thailand for 3 months.  What's your address so I can send you a
postcard?

I'm loving Thailand more than Japan..  It's fuckin' HOT here, and I love it!

I haven't been back to Texas in a few years.  I may make it back within a year, but just for a
visit!  More travels are in my blood hahaha

Are you on facebook?  I bet I can find you real quick; hang on.

Oh my God.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Celebrating-Saundra-Swavet-Williams/104209439617618?ref=search&v=wall#!/pages/Celebrating-Saundra-Swavet-Williams/104209439617618">You're with God now.</a>

Thank you for all the light you brought into the world.

   Blessings
   - Rob

&gt; No, I didn't get your postcard, and you know how much I love 'em.  I'm
&gt; getting ready to move to the Northside and was looking at my postcard wall
&gt; and how much I got to take down.  You must be loving Japan.  When is the
&gt; last time you been in the states? 
&gt;  
&gt; Just trying to keep it moving in the business, you know we got to chase that
&gt; paper.  Look out for our next movie, "Elbows & Vogues".  Remember that's how
&gt; we met at the kinko's as we were in production for whatever movie we was
&gt; shooting.  I got some things coming up also that is taking me international
&gt; and hopefully Japan is in the routing.  Keep in touch a little bit more
&gt; often.  ANd email me some pics of what it looks like over there.  
&gt;  
&gt; Holla back baby!

&gt;&gt; Dang girl you're not fuckin' around!  Good job on your success and
&gt;&gt; worldwide website with beaucoup talent and awesomeness to boot!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm still kickin' it in Japan; did you get my postcard a few (?) months
&gt;&gt; ago?  I always keep an eye out for cards but very few say "JAPAN" on 'em. 
&gt;&gt; It ain't like Texas where you can't get a card that *doesn't* say Texas on
&gt;&gt; it! hahaha
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Keep up the hard work and we'll all be workin' hard for you when you take
&gt;&gt; over the world!  Hope you can clean the place up a bit while you're at it. 
&gt;&gt; :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    Love and Light
