<p>Just been playing in the pool with Shane, Shawn, Sarah, Air, Avery, Andreas, and three brothers
whose names I don't know.  One of the brothers swam underwater 1.5 lengths of the pool, like a
dolphin, just zooomed along the bottom.  I was like, &quot;woah,&quot; and tried, and then we all
tried.  Shawn was able to go the entire length of the pool (25 or 30 meters, I think).  Avery and
Andreas went nearly the entire length, Shane and Sarah went about 2/3rds, and I went about
3/5ths (I lost the distance competition).</p>

<p>Big silly fun trying to get into the pool from the diving platform.  I tried to figure out rules
as I went, and decided the key rule should be &quot;slowly&quot; whereas other people were like,
&quot;how about rules like 'don't hit your head'?&quot;</p>

<p>I hope to get the vids up soon.</p>
