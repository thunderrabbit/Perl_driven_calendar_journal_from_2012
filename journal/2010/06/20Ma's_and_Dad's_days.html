<p>For Ma's birthday, I wrote her an email, and for Dad's day, I got him a hammock.  I wasn't going
to get it because I don't have a house, but then the guy was like, &quot;great gift for your
friend,&quot; and then I thought I was doing him a favor by saying, &quot;well today is Father's
Day in the US; you should add that to your sales pitch (just for today)&quot; and he had no idea
wtf I was talking about, and I was like, actually, dad may just love this. and got it for him.</p>
