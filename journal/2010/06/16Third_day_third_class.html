<p>Today included some postures that were difficult for me to learn, as in I pretty much could
*not* do them on the first day I learned them.  Well, one posture, which I call Bridge, which gives
a stretch to the client's stomach.</p>

<p>This morning, I helped teach some of the postures; it really helps me learn them.</p>
