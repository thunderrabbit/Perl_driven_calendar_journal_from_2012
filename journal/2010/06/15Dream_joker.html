<p class="dream">The Joker, from Batman, was performing as a race car driver, and I was his engine,
by wrappeing myself in newspaper, connected to his car.  We were friends and it was a publicity
stunt for which we could make a lot of money, and an extra 10,000 dollars if he wore lipstick, so
at the very last moment, I went to the audience and was like, &quot;someone give me some
lipstick&quot; and a woman pulled out a tube that turned out to be white,&quot; and I went to the
joker and he was like, &quot;I wanted green&quot; and I go, too late&quot; and put it on him so his
lips were white, and I gave him a fake kiss saing 10,000 dollars baby&quot; and toss the lipstick
back to the woman and then went over to the corner of oersized newspaper and yelled, &quot;tell me
to start the motha fuckin' engine&quot; and someone said to start the engien, and I debated telling
them to repeat my fowl language but didn't and I rolled myself dow into the nes paper and was right
near the race car driver by the joker, and I knew it might be a joke and I oculd die at any moment,
bu t I also knew it was the place I could fly o I let myself float aove and behind the car as we
raced down the streets and I made the string connecting us be gently repelled by the street light
posts and so I floated perfetly safe below and between everything metal.  </p>

<p class="dream">Then Ryan McCarthy was chasing us, jumping from light to light like spiderman, but quicker, and was
just about to jump onto my floating baloon when I willed it to be a bit faster and he missed and
landed on the concrete, but recovered nicely and was back chasing again, and then I shortedned the
string a lot and got away and woke up.</p>
