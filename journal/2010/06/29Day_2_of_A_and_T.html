<p>Assessment and Treatment class was good today.  The morning was packed full of information, and
the afternoon went a lot faster cause I slept through a good deal of it during the after lunch
siesta.  Zen and I got some exercises to strengthen things that need to be strengthened, and that
was fun.  For me, pushup plus, and some stuff to strengthen the muscles around my scapulas.</p>
