<p>After some time spent tweaking <a href="http://abj.fly2.nu/">Johnny's website</a>, I joined
Avery at the pool for some waterlogged animal antics.  He dove into the water with the animals, and
swum by the camera with the animals.  I dropped the animals in a splatty way, which seems to have
sorta split Johnny's butt a bit.</p>

<p>This could be a good thing, because after a few hours of hanging, Johnny was still pretty wet,
whereas U-Cow woulda been dry.  Might be a good idea to change Johnny's batting.</p>

<p>The other animal, who still doesn't have a name, may need a batting change as well, but he's a
knit/crochet bear, so a bit harder to repair.</p>

<p>Got back to my room, leaving Avery asleep by the pool, and Wayne came by saying he and the other
two from class were going to the Sunday walking market.  I had left a note for Avery that I was
hoping to eat by 7pm.  He woke up in time and we all went to the market.  (me, Shawn, Shane, Wayne,
and Avery)  I decided to be a bit weird and not take any stuffed animals.  Leaving my room, it felt
like I was missing something.</p>

<p>Got to the restaurant and, &quot;oh!  my wallet!&quot; I *was* missing something hahahhaaha</p>

<p>Avery spotted me 20 baht to pay my taxi fare, and when Wayne gave me 1000 bhat until we got home
(adjacent rooms), I paid Avery back.  Got some prezzies for Soness and my brother, and ordered a
wallet for myself.  The wallets were made of blue jean material, and I was like, &quot;I want the
belt loop *here*, so I can hook it to my chain.&quot; Paid them 100 baht and will pick it up next
week.</p>

<p>Shawn saw a batik sheet that he really liked, but it wasn't finished yet.  He put down 500 baht
and will pay the remainder when it's ready in 3 weeks.  Takes two weeks to dye and two days to dry,
plus a few days to wait for the next Sunday for the market to be open.</p>

<p>We saw Anne-Gaille from my previous class with her um, friend, but no one else I recognized.</p>
