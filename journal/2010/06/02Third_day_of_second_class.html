<p>Today's set of moves seemed pretty easy for everyone to learn.  Only about 10 different
maneuvers.  I gave a treatment to Shawn, then Shawn again, then Shane.  I received from Shawn, then
Air.</p>

<p>Just had lunch at Rak Yen's veggie restaurant (everyone seems to quite enjoy it), and I was like,
&quot;hmmm I don't have my wallet.  I'm not sure if it's in my room or in the classroom.&quot;</p>

<p>I had ridden a bicycle (good ole Number 3), so I took that back to Imm Eco.  Didn't find my wallet in my room
so back to the classroom.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  No wallet here, either.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>I didn't take my room apart to find it...  OH!  I know where it is.  I took off my shorts last
night and my wallet was still in the pocket.</p>

<p>Just finished our afternoon session.  On me, Wayne did the entire sequence we've learned so far in an
hour and 20 minutes.  I did the whole series on him in an hour and 5 minutes.  He said my
transitions were very good.  I feel quite happy that I was <em>basically</em> able to remember the
entire series without forgetting any steps.</p>

<p>Pool time!  (if they wanna swim, otherwise I'll work on <a href="http://abj.fly2.nu">Auto Break Johnny</a>'s website)</p>
