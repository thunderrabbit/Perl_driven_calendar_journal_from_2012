<p class="dream">Helping Karla from FSD who then turned into Traci from The Pink Cow, we needed to
extend the size of the barn, so I went to the local lumber store and asked fro a tape measure to
borrow so we could see what was the existing construction technique.  I saw two patterns, one in
whch the boards lked one another, and one where they weren't allowed to touch each other.  The
second was much more difficult to build, and I went to Trai to report my findings and she was in the
middle of deciding how to rebuild the table saw to be more effective. She basically decided to lop
off 50 inches of table that were never used past the 373 inch points.  I went outside. Living in a
new city, a rough city, I went outside and found a guy in a swimming pool in the back of a Cadillac.
We started play boxing, and his friend tried to hit some pressure points on a him and I was like,
&quot;no&quot; and made him stop, and hit a pressure point on him and he was like, &quot;ow..&quot;
and it was like it hurt more than I thought it should have.  He looked surprised, and I didn't know
if he was faking.  Then the first guy was likke, &quot;aight, I need to give you something, it's a
trigger for a bomb somewhere in Hong Kong.  I don't know where Hong Kong is, but when you flip this
switch you will hear a sonic boom,&quot; and he flipped an example switch and we heard a boom
somewhere in this city, and I was like, &quot;I gotta go,&quot; and the police were aware of the
situation, but not questioning or detaining the right person.  I got back to my building, and some
people were frightenedly coming out, and the elevator was open and ready to go to the 12th flor for
me and I pushed the button for 12 and it started to go up, and then it started to angle up and then
I realized the angle allowed the elevators to start at different points at the base of the building,
but then to share an elevator shaft on the way up the building.  But my theory was blown as the
elevator went back tilting and actually came out of the building, very close to some people taking
pictures on the ground, including that guy Jon.  A woman was like, &quot;can you take my baby?&quot;
to get her away from the danger in the city, and I was like, &quot;okay, you can come,&quot; but
then her husband latched onto the elevator instead of the woman, and he gave me the baby, and then
dropped to his apparent death from the elevator which was still curving around.  it swung down low
by the base of the building, so I got off with the baby sucking on my finger and I saw a woman
feeding her baby, and I was like, &quot;please help me; I've just got this baby and I have no idea
what to do,&quot; and she took me to a shopping mall to get baby food.  Anna Bananna Pie was looking
at the map with me and sorted out how to get there, near a railway station, and we arrived and the
store was a music shop featuring AniKiko's music on CD and LP</p>
