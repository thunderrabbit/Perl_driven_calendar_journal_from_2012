<p>Went to dinner with Shane, Shawn, Sarah, Air, and Johnny at Miguel's last night.  The
three S's went in a tuk-tuk, and I <em>drove</em> Air on her motorbike!  It was my first time to
ever ride a motorcycle successfully, and I could feel lots of fear in me during it.  I was okay when
just riding with no traffic around, but even then, a bit shakey when shifting gears.  With traffic,
I was like, eeeeep and wow.  I had Air drive the last bit from Thai Pei gate to Miguels, because
traffic on the square roads around the city can be a bit nuts.</p>
