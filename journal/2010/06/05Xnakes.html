<p>Before the show properly started, we got to handle some pythons.  Claire was like,
&quot;nope. no way,&quot; when I suggested she touch it.  I kept encouraging her and she got up her
courage and gingerly touched its body as I kept the snake's head near Shawn's chest.</p>

<p>Then the staff was like, &quot;aight the show is starting,&quot; so we all sat down on the
bamboo bleachers. (two levels)</p>

<p>The snake show featured a boa constrictor, two cobras, a king cobra, three little snakes, and a
&quot;copperhead jumping snake&quot;, a cool snake that seemed to be thin but tall along its
neck.</p>

<p>I put Johnny, U-Cow, and their new friend out in the ring before the show started.  They were
there for most of the first snake, a large boa constrictor.</p>

<p>After the handlers harassed the boa constrictor for a while as it tried to bite them, they were
like, &quot;who else wants to come hold it?&quot; and I went out there.  They were like, &quot;hold
its head&quot; and I did, and got some pics with my stuffed posse.</p>

<p>Shawn, Shane, Wayne, some other guy, and maybe someone else from the audience took their turns
holding the snake. Then it was Claire's turn, so I encouraged her again and she was like,
&quot;aight,&quot; after I was like, &quot;if you go out there, I'll hold its head.&quot;  She did,
and I did, and it was great!</p>

<p>They pretty much harassed the other snakes into striking while just out of range of the strikes,
and teased the audience a bit by tossing a rope our way, etc.</p>
