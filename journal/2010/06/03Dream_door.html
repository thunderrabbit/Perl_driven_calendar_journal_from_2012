<p class="dream">Carrying a very light door through the streets, ike dancing with it despite being
in tough neighborhoods, and people were responding well and smiling.  O  I was carrying the door
from our clubhouse to th e other club house, and basically we had needed a door to do something and
then I found this door so I was taking it back, and needed to get a towel. So then I got th towel
and wrapped it around my hand so I could do a towel dance and realized I should ge tthe door again
because I'd need to put it back where I got ti, and started to take it back, and some other guys
from the club were liek, &quot;bah that door is a errible solution&quot; and I knew they weren't
mad at *me*, but at their own inability to do anything useful cause it wasn't like they did
anything bug complained, adn then I saw Doug from ultimate.  &quot;Hey Doug, is this door needed for
anyting here?&quot; and he was like, &quot;yeah; that was is the lock for all the doors once you
get them on, put that one horizontally houtside to lock them all in place.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">ooh!  glad I asked.  I left it there and began taking the towel back when I woek up.</p>
