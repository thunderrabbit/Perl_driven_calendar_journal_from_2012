<p>Super duper special thanks to Tik for helping move my stuff into my new room!  They're doing
roof repairs on my old building so we were asked to move our stuff to new rooms at 8am tomorrow.  I
was like, &quot;um, I've gotta be in class at 9am, so can I move *now*?&quot; and she called her
supervisor.  &quot;yes!&quot; and she helped me move.</p>

<p>I basically didn't want to pack all my stuff because I don't have enough bags to fit the
prezzies I've bought, and it was easier to be lazy.</p>

<p>We took two trips each to get everything moved.  We walked together because she was afraid of
ghosts (as the building had no one else in it); fortunately, we didn't see any.</p>

<p>On the way back the second time, at her request, I piggy backed her part of the way.  (basically
from the pool, beneath the trees between The Barnhouse and the main building, and dropped her off
before we got to the stairs leading up to reception.</p>

<p>I've now got a room that <em>basically</em> overlooks the pool.  This room is smaller, but
features bunk beds.  Yay!  I'm get top bunk!  (U-Cow and Johnny have to sleep on the bottom
bunk.)</p>

<p>Actually U-Cow went swimming today, so he's hanging to dry.</p>
