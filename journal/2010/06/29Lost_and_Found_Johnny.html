<p>Upon arrival at Sinshai's place, I noted quickly that my bear Johnny was no longer riding cutely
on the back of my bicycle.  (He wasn't riding un-cutely either.)  &quot;Oh no,&quot; and I headed
back the way I had come.  I guess the springy thing just wasn't strong enough to hold him, and he
jumped out when I jumped up a curb.</p>

<p>I rolled slowly along the moat, looking for a soaked bear floating facedown, and eventually found
him, facedown, but not floating.  It appeared he was carefully examining the grass.  I didn't take a
picture because I didn't have my camera handy, plus the shot can be recreated at any time (like I
ever will).</p>
