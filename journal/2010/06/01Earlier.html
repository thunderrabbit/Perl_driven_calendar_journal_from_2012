<p>For the first days of my first class, I used to leave Imm Eco at 8am.  Last night I was up until
2:15am or so playing with Johnny's new site software, so my wake up time got pushed back, etc.  I'd
like to shift my schedule back to focus on massage school, and I'd also like to get the site
version 1 up.  Hmmm!</p>

<p>And I also wanna learn Thai....  hmmm!!!</p>
