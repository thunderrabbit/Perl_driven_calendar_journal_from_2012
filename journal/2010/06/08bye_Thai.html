<p>I gave my Thai teacher the proverbial boot yesterday.  Even after my repeated requests, he
wouldn't slow down and teach basics.  I can't yet quickly count in Thai.  So instead of teaching
phrases like, &quot;how much for a single room with private toilet for a week?&quot; I need to learn
words like &quot;room&quot; &quot;toilet&quot; and &quot;week&quot; and phrases like, &quot;how
much&quot;</p>

<p>But even then, just words like, &quot;banana&quot; and &quot;sweet&quot; are more important to
me than &quot;weekly room rate&quot;</p>

<p>kthxbye</p>
