<p>Mana wears about 9 or 12 coils of metal (brass?) around her neck.  I didn't count the coils, and
I didn't ask her about them, but I did sit with her for a while because she had her face decorated
gently with some concentric circles on each cheek and dots on the bridge of her nose.</p>

<p>She's been there six years, and says though she can't go home, it's better than Burma because
here, food and water are readily available, and more tourists, so more income.  I'm not sure what
she would be doing for sustenance in Burma; we didn't get that far in the conversation.  I met her
son Gon (?) and she said her husband was working somewhere.</p>

<p>The tribe is Kayan, and speak Kayan together.  I got the sense that few people know how to write
Kayan.  I don't think she knew how.  But she did write a phone number and her name in
&quot;English.&quot;  I asked if she had an email address, and she was like, &quot;no,&quot; and
then explained, &quot;no lights,&quot; which pretty much summarized the reason.</p>

<p>I wonder about the plausibility of doing a home stay there for a weekend, perhaps.  If I
determine it'd be &quot;good&quot; for the village, or for her family, I'd be interested.</p>
