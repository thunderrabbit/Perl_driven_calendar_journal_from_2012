<p>Met Lin after massaging JR and his peeps.  She works in Shibuya, so it was quite convenient!  We
went to the ramen place that Ami and I visited several times.  The downstairs seating area had
several people in it, including two girls smoking, so we went upstairs and had the place to
ourselves.  That was nice for chatting purposes.</p>

<p>I really like her.</p>
