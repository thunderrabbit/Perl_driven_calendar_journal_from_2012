<p>Um, I'm not quite sure what happened, but it seems 30% likely that I'll move out this week.
Soness was like, &quot;you'll still live with me, right?&quot; and I go, &quot;probably not past
April&quot; (the end of my no-kissing no-sex mission) and she was like, &quot;have I just been
mission support for you?  then I don't want you to stay.&quot;</p>

<p>wtf?</p>
