<p>She likes to sing!  Great fun!  We started with an hour, then went for two hours, most of which
was me rapping (and I did better than usual) and her singing English songs I had never heard before,
oh wait I've heard this one... it had to get to the refrain before I recognized it, but yes.  At the
end, we sang 島唄, and I actually did better than before.  Hmmmm!</p>
