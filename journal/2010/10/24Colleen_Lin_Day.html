<p>Took Colleen to Kamakura where we met Lin and then Scott.  Colleen and Lin went off to see stuff
and Scott drove me to his house where we did a one hour massage + reiki session, and then he dropped
me back off at the station.</p>

<p>Took SSL to Shibuya, walked to Hachiko, and then through Shibuya Crossing, and to Harajuku.
Didn't see many interestingly dressed peeps on the bridge over Yamanote Line, so went down the
fashion street and saw plenty of good stuff.  Tried to get shoes for Colleen at ABC, and then
Oshman's, and then walked to Meiji Jingu.  It started to sprinkle on the way back, and Colleen and I
told Lin the diff between humidity, sprinkling, drizzling, rain, and <em>rain</em>.  Lin was like,
&quot;really??&quot; / &quot;cool!&quot;</p>

<p>Now we're at The Pink Cow, ready for Japanese Lounge Night!  Kumiya is here already, so it's nice
to be here early so we can see her for a bit, though she's super busy and can't really talk before
