<p>Today, after I sent another couple work-related emails, Colleen and I went to the beach where I
enjoyed my cell phone and she enjoyed photographing everything and its dog, including some dogs.  I
found a rope between some of the rocks on the jetty (a word whose definition I did not previously
know) which I've been calling the T, and used it for a stabilizing belt while Colleen took pictures
of a hawk.</p>

<p>Back home we almost took a nap, and then I did take a nap, and then we headed out to Tokyo
Station so I could meet Emiko for her lesson.  We ate at the Chinese place one floor down from the
train lines, and had a nice time, even though Emiko ate almost nothing.  Emiko headed out to Shibuya
after that, and Colleen and I went to Kawasaki to meet Lin.</p>

<p>Great time wandering around Cinecitta, getting プリクラ pics taken, watching the water fountain,
and then eating ice cream (gelato) while I barked with Lin and tried to tell Colleen that the ice
cream wasn't that good because it was actully gelato, but it turns out the likes gelato better.</p>
