<p>Japanese Lounge Night at The Pink Cow was super great tonight.  Awesome koto and awesome taiko,
plus awesome everything else, oh, and awesome flamenco (?) tap dancing.  Totally tight.  And
awesome that Colleen met <del>Rachel</del> <ins>Cindy</ins> who has the week off and will act as Colleen's tour guide tomorrow,
