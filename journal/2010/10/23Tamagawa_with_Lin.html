<p>Met Lin in Kawasaki on my way to meet Colleen at the airport.  We had three hours available so
got some lunch and took it to the river to eat, chat, chill and watch the river go by while
coordinating with Scott plans to give him a massage in Kamakura while Lin and Colleen go see the big
Buddha shaped statue.  Next the the river the air was a tad cold so Lin gave me her scarf (I'm
wearing only shorts and hoodie), and it got a tad colder so we went back to the station to get some
warm drinks, by way of her gym to drop off her gym bag and use the loo.</p>

<p>Found cocoa in Crispy Creme so got donuts and relaxed there for a while, talking about financial
future and business ideas and schooling for the kids, if they appear.</p>

<p>Now I'm on the Narita express headed to meet Colleenie Beanie G Dawg at the airport!!!!</p>
