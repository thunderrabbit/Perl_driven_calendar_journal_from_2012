HI _____

I hope you're doing well.

After I solved the cross-server problem I was having, this took about
3 more working hours to finish.   Clearly, my overall time was more
than 5 hours, but most of that was researching how to do cross-server
ajax requests, which I hadn't had to do in ________.  My total time
spent on this was 14 hours (including research).   As we will be
working as a team, we'll greatly reduce the amount of time doing this
type of research.  :-)

   Talk to you soon
    - Rob
