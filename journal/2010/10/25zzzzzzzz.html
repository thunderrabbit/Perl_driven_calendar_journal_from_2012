<p>Was given 5 hours starting on Monday at noon to do a programming project.  I got stuck behind a
wall of cross site ajax; hint: jsonp, and didn't finish.  I still haven't finished, but I've
finished a proof of concept that I can talk to the server from my client.  yay.  But now it's bedtime....</p>
