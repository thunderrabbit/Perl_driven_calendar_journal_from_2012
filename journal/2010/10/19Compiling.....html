<p>Been trying to compile Paraview on OS X 10.6.</p>

<p>Brief notes to self:</p>

<p>Qt 4.6.2, found by changing the version in the ftp url</p>

<p>ccmake, not cmake</p>

<p>it takes a long time to compile.</p>

<p>So far, I haven't gotten past 45%.  It crapped out saying VTK was compiled for Cocoa, while Qt
was compiled for Carbon.</p>

<p>I wiped the build directory, made sure they were set correctly in ccmake (they were by default
(dammit (cause that probably means it won't work (as I don't think I've changed anything else)))),
and am compiling again.  So far it's at 11%, and it's been 22 minutes.</p>
