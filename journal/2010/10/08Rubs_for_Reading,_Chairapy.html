<p>Chairapy was quite successful raising funds via Rubs for Reading.  I imagine we made 15,000 yen,
and should get an email from Diane with a final number.</p>

<p>So, basically I gave 15 or so chair massages, and nearly as many copies of my business card.
Feeling so happy the entire time, I never lost momentum or やるき; I was just like, &quot;this is
awesome.&quot;</p>

<p>Lin came by for a while to say HI; I was glad to see her.  Diane told me later, &quot;Lin is so
nice!&quot; and &quot;I didn't even recognize who she was at first [and still liked her].&quot;</p>

<p>I gave massages past my last train.</p>

<p>I did *not* miss the last train to Hinodecho.  Now about to sleep in internet cafe cause I have
to work here tomorrow anyway.</p>

<b>Rubs for Reading . . .</b>

. . . raised 17,000 Yen last night!!!! AMAZING result!!! Also I personally saw people put 30,000 in
donations in Clive's jar so I think the result from this party, once we add everything up, will be
great. Thank you thank you thank you for coming again!! I hope you enjoyed! I'll send a couple of
pictures along.
