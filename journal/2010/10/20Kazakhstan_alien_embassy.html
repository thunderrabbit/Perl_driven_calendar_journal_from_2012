<p>Interesting that Kazakhstan's Alien Embassy is all over the UFO-chaser news, but I haven't seen
any pictures supporting its (planned) existence.  I wonder if any mainstream Kazakhstan newspapers
have written articles on it.</p>

<p>While searching for news, I came across an article on the
site <a href="http://starseeds.net/">starseeds.net</a>, and promptly signed up for membership on
the site as it looks quite interesting.</p>

<p>They have a questionnaire one must fill in before becoming a member.  My answers are in
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags:</p>

<p>What do you identify with?</p>

<pre>
Human
</pre>

<p>What Is Your Origin?</p>

<pre>
Terran (Earth)
</pre>

<p>Please tell us a little bit about you:</p>

<pre>
I've always been intrigued with the idea of alternate realities, starting from a religious
perspective of human / god, and then slowly to simple awareness of different states of consciousness.

Astral projection intrigued me for a while but I never seemed "successful" at it.

Now I've been practicing some shamanistic techniques, related to upper world and lower world
energies, but all still very terrestrial.

In my "normal" life, I'm a computer programmer who sometimes does Thai massage and reiki for people
who enjoy receiving that type of healing.

Via some meditation, a lot of which was through a school called Clairvision, I've become aware of
memories/imagery which could be explained by past life incarnations.  These memories/scenes have always 
been personal in nature, relating to individual human experiences, usually with strong emotional energies.

Just recently, I met a woman named Lin, and on occasion "remembered" past lives with her.  These are
just hints of memories, and hard to distinguish from simple imagination.
</pre>

<p>What made you believe you were a starseed/walk-in or what made you interested in our
community?</p>

<pre>
Easiest answer: I'd like to expand my awareness further.

More practical answer: It seems there are some "negative" forces at work around earth, and I'd like
to ground myself further in my own spiritual consciousness so that I can maintain clarity if/when
things get difficult.
</pre>

<p>Please list any interests or hobbies: (Separate by comma)</p>

<pre>
internet, writing, rock hopping, expanded awareness, stories
</pre>

<p>Religious or spiritual affiliation and or practice If any:</p>

<pre>
I'm spiritual, but not religious.  I believe pretty closely to what I think Buddhism believes,
though I've not studied it closely.  I've recently been reading A Course in Miracles.
</pre>

<p>Have you ever had contact with off world entities?</p>

<pre>
not of which I'm consciously aware, though I have asked/requested such contact at times.  Not for
"support" but just for "proof."

Though I did enjoy reading Bringers of The Dawn, and felt some connection with what was written.
</pre>

<p>What are your views of Pleiadiens, Sirians, Reptilians, Grey etc?</p>

<pre>
I can't really say I know enough to know.  I imagine that some beings are benevolent, some malevolent, 
and possibly hard to distinguish unless I'm closely connected to my inner Self for guidance.
</pre>

<p>Please describe your idea of the current state of affairs, 2012, the shift and first contact:</p>

<pre>
It seems that most humans are being educated through mass media that we are helpless, living in a
dangerous world of terrorists and biological threats.  We're taught that we have to give our power
away to government, and are controlled through manipulation of money, food, education.

These things may be true if we identify primarily with our physical bodies, but not if we identify
with our true infinite selves.  Even though I know this intellectually, how can I really know it,
use it, support others' transition?

Sometimes I think 2012 is just another blip on the calendar, but then some people are talking about
the sun warming the entire solar system, a dark star coming soon, possible solar explosions that
will take down our entire communication infrastructure.  I imagine the reality will be closer to
blip on calendar.  I remember the clock rolling over from 1999 to 2000 and all the hype that came
before it, but then "nothing" happened.

The shift in consciousness that I see happening slowly seems to be gaining speed... I hope!

With countless ET movies, Kazakhstan building a "ET Embassy" and the UN designating an "ET
Ambassador," I think we're on the edge of a mass media announcement that "they're here," BUT I don't
trust that the announcement will be designed for our own good.

I imagine I understand the concept of karma, and that ETs don't want to affect their own karma by
causing too much havoc here, so I think true ET contact would be (1) human-initiated, and (2) gentle.
</pre>

<p>What is your opinion on Fear and Conspiracy?</p>

<pre>
The idea of Fear energy being consumed by Reptilians is interesting, and it makes sense in a way,
but hard for me to verify.

To me "conspiracy" refers to "conspiracy theory" which I often think is "conspiracy fact."  I believe 
the World Trade Center was destroyed by members of the "secret US government" for immediate (insurance) 
and long term (war) profit, plus the creation of fear to keep people seated instead of leading rebellions.
</pre>

<p>What is your opinion of Atlantis Lemuria and inner earth?</p>

<pre>
I think civilization has been on earth far longer than we are taught, but not sure about specifics.
</pre>

<p>How did you find this site?</p>

<pre>
search for kazakhstan space embassy on Google
</pre>

<p>Why do you wish to join?</p>

<pre>
So I can read the article, learn more about my Self, and connect with like-minded people.  If I can
help educate others about the true nature of reality, that would be a great bonus.
