<p>All the programming biznass was done during work with Ian.  Now I'm in KQ Kawasaki waiting for
Lin to arrive; she's a bit later than I understood earlier, but maybe I misunderstood.  I know for
sure we weren't in close communication during the day, so I might have guessed she would be busy.</p>

<p>When I called her, she sounded a bit panicked that she wasn't ready yet; I told her to take her
time.</p>
