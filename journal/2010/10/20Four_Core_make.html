<p>Fred had a good idea: tell make how many cores I have.  In fact, tell it you have N+1 because a
lot of the time is spent writing to disk.  Forget that; I'm going to tell it I have 2*N!!!!  (N =
2)</p>

<p>start!</p>

<p class="date">10:52am JST</p>

<p>24%</p>

<p>Hmmmmmm it's only marginally faster; I'm going to kill this, restart it with 3 cores.</p>

<p class="date">11:24am JST Wednesday 20 October 2010 (day 14819)</p>

<p>With three cores, after 21 minutes, it's at 14%, so that's a lot slower.</p>

<p>killing now</p>

<p class="date">11:32am JST Wednesday 20 October 2010 (day 14819)</p>

<p>making again with 2 cores.</p>

<p class="date">11:58am JST</p>

<p>23%</p>

<p>Hmmm!  So four cores seems to make it fastest.</p>
