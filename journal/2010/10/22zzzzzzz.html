<p>Last night (Friday) I got home at 12:am midnight and Soness told me for two hours how I was
mistreating Lin and myself by not staying on my mission.</p>

<p>On the  good side, she helped me realize I was scared to lose Lin.  So I decided I will tell Lin
that at/after The Pink Cow on Saturday night (which was &quot;tonight&quot;).</p>

<p>I told Lin I wanted to go out with friends moreso than just her and I alone, and at first she was
like, &quot;are you trying to break up with me?&quot; and I'm like &quot;no way&quot; and I was
like, &quot;I will never let you go,&quot; and she goes &quot;thank you&quot; and she added,
&quot;and even though you say that, if you change your mind, let me know and I will
understand.&quot;</p>

<p>And we finally got the deets sorted that though the recognition that I was afraid to lose Lin
came via conversation with Soness, I made the decision myself to hang out more with friends than
just as a couple.</p>

<p>&quot;Great!  so we will meet each other's friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So basically nothing is changed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;right.&quot;</p>

<p>We talked about music and the show at Pink Cow and then I missed last train so she drove me home
during which we talked about everything and nothing.</p>
