<p>Giving a two hour massage to a friend of Sorcha's in Yoyogi park today.  We've taken a while to
sort out a mutually available time.  Today, the weather is beautifully sunny.</p>

<p>Client said she'll bring a tarp, and I've got my 6 kg mobile mat (rolled up in its brown case), a
blanket, towel, sheet, and oil.  I think we can handle any request or contigency.</p>
