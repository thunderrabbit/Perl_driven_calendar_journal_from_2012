<p>I invited Lin to The Pink Cow for the comedy show Mad Cow's Big Night Out.  We laughed and loved
the stand up comedy; my favorites were David from New York, Trevor on keyboard, and Jazz
impersonating Stephen Hawking (omg).</p>

<p>Lin had been worried that she might not understand American (western?) humor, but she got as
many jokes as anyone (not including the impersonation of Stephen Hawking).</p>

<p>We hung out afterward, talking to peeps, and Rachel W gave me an awesome idea for Chairapy.  I
may look into this; wow!</p>

<p>Rachel knows Soness from back in the improv day, so that's pretty cool.</p>

<p>Looked down at my clock oh snap it's 11:10pm!!  We left almost too late for me to catch last
train.</p>
