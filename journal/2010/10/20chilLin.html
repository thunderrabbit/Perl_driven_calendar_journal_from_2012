<p>Emiko gave some chocolates to Lin and I, so I contacted Lin on my way home and we hung out near
Keikyu Kawasaki, talking about false flag attacks, past life experiences, ghosts, heaven, spirit,
God, aliens, Alex Jones, David Icke, and probably other stuffs as well.  That was all just outside
KQ Kawasaki.  10:__pm rolled around so she drove me to Yokohama station where I took the train
(Tokaido line) and arrived home at 12:08am.</p>
