<p>Colleen is here in Chigasaki!!  We just came to chez Soness after eating at Za Watami, after
taking the NEX from Narita to Ofuna.</p>

<p>Ridiculous but true, I somehow <em>lost</em> my old Suica card!!  I just had it today!!!  I put
it in my pocket to remind myself not to use it in my wallet, and then boom it was gone by the time
I got to the airport.  wtf.</p>

<p>Colleen had *just* come down the stairs to look for information booth, and I had *just* come up
the stairs from the train; the timing was <em>perfect</em>!!!</p>

<p>I told her that Lin will escort her around Kamakura while Scott and I are doing massage stuff
tomorrow, and Colleen goes, &quot;does she speak English?&quot; and I go... &quot;mmmmmm, well she
speaks enough that you should be okay.&quot;  What a riot it will be when she suddenly starts
speaking English!!  I texted Lin to tell her the story and that she and I should start with all
Japanese tomorrow to throw Colleen for a proverbial loop.  It'll be great!</p>
