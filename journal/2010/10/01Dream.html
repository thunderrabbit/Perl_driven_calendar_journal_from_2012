<p class="dream">On the top of a building, in the restroom that had no back wall, I was taking
apart the toilet flushig mechanism to see how it worked, or perhaps to repair it and the wind from
outside was blowing the water  i the toilet, but not any sewage, just clean water and looking at
the flushing mechanism I could see ho its spring loaded thing kept water from coming back up, but I
couldn't see how  the hinge moved enough to let the poop down, but I figured it mst work thought it
seemed like it would cause a mess, but then i saw a large amphibian swiming around in the water, so
I went out the back wall of the restroom and the amphibian climbd out onto the back wall.  It was
about four feet long, and had sturdy legs and long tail; it basically looked like a black shiny
large iguana.  My ex ex ex co-worker was there, kissing the iquana cause it was so cute and I took
pictures of her nuzzling its nose and of someone else nuzzling its nose, and ten the co worker put
a lit cigarette near the animal to make it jump off the wall, but I told her NO and moved the
cigarette away to protect the animal and I ws recording as it jumped off the wall; it glided down
down down as we were on about the 20th floor or so and I recorded it all the way down to the ground
level in a park where it started to dig itself a new home.</p>

<p class="dream">We went downstairs and I was showing video to people from the camera and I
rememered i had all these old pictures on it, from when we were driving in the desert and saw some
star wars laser and stuff and coudlnt' tell how people had down it; were they real or CGI or what?
but the video showed different weird things i couldn't explin and then we needed to stop watching
movies and get cleaned up, and I went to the room where I ad been sleeping and all my stuff was
clean, but then I saw on Fred's side and he was not yet clean, so I started to clean up his stuff
and I noticed he had arraged some hinges into the shape of UT Fred and someone else had rearrnaged the
T into an F so it was FU Fred, sna dI started to repair it but then the screws were missing from
the hinged so they kept falling down and i couldn't do it in the tiem aailable to I just erased it
and woek up.</p>
