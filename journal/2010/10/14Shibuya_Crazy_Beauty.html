<p>Went to Crazy Beauty in Shibuya today to evaluate their space for the possibility of doing Thai
massage there.  It's basically big enough, but there's a table in the way, so it would have to be
moved each time I wanted to use the space.</p>

<p>Michael and Yumi each modeled for me a bit to see if the space could be used properly.  Michael
said he would set up Thai massage as an option on their reservation site.  Nice.</p>
