<p class="dream">I climbed up to put a box away at the top of a closet and I saw Bryn down on the
other side of the wall, and climbed over the wall saying, &quot;Bryn!!; hey how have you beAn?&quot;
and climbed over the wall and over the counter to go hug her so bigly like it's been ten years and
only two seconds since we connected.  &quot;I've been having so many dreams about you and had never
talked to you for *real* so *this* time I wanted to make sure I actually talk you you!!!&quot; and
she was like &quot;hey!&quot; and &quot;thanks for that, cause I had been feeling a bit lonely&quot;
and I was like, &quot;I know mate, I saw you standing alone over there and I just, anyway, how have
you beAn???&quot; and she knew how I spelled it and we laughed and she ws like, &quot;can we go lay
down in the hammock?&quot; and I go &quot;sure, but no smooching; hahah&quot; and I told her about
having met Lin and being really happy with her and dating her exclusively.  Bryn asked a few
questions about her and and we were chilling in a room of the church that was apparently used for
kids' classes, as it had some toys in it and included my old back pack.  We were hugging, and
eventually naked but utterly platonic, with no question about that, but just so close that it was
only natural, and then someone came in, &quot;Rob; we still need to test the blood machine,&quot;
and I was like, &quot;oh man I forgot,&quot; and &quot;hahah this is going to look so bad,&quot; and
Lin was out there as well looking for me and I found her and she was like, &quot;the blood machine
is over here,&quot; and I went to that table to tell them how it worked and then woke up.</p>

<p>Oh man, *another* dream about Bryn!!!</p>
