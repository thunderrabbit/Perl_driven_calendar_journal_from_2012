<p>Thanks to Colleen being <em>awesome</em> and coming to Japan, meeting Cyndi who
is <em>almost</em> as awesome (98% as much?), we are in a taiko fucking drumming class!!!</p>

<p>Actually, after 1.5 hours of lesson, I'm chillin' on the side, and Colleen is too, but *she* is
playing the air drums and paying attention, which makes sense because she exclaimed, &quot;I've
just found my new hobby!!&quot;</p>

<p>Good thing she lives in a city that's likely to have a taiko group or two.</p>

<p>This instructor has been playing for 26 years, and recently taught The Black Eyed Peas on their
recent tour to Japan.</p>

<p>And *now*, after having a lovely dinner in an 井境や, paid for by the lovely Divi and Cyndi, they
have Colleen who will do taiko with Cyndi <em>again</em> tomorrow, and I'm heading home.</p>
