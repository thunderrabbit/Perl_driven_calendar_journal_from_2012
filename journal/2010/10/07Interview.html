<p>I've got an interview today with Taka from Michael Page.  He said he has a position in mind, so
that's cool too.  When I left the house, I was late according to my original planned arrival time,
but I should still arrive at the station 4 minutes before meeting time, which I hope will get me to
their office on time.</p>
