<p>Intermission at the violin+dance concert &quot;Cold Sleep,&quot; which, we (Jessica and I) both
agree should have less / no recorded music, and just focus on live violin.  We didn't come to
listen to the radio; we came for a <em>live</em> concert.</p>

<p>We both like the violinist; we would love for her music to be the only thing audible, but</p>

<p>We both dislike the recorded music that nearly drowns out her performance!!</p>

<p class="date">1:45am JST Friday  8 October 2010 (day 14807)</p>

<p>The second act was more of the same, and a performance that should have moved us all to tears
and gotten a standing ovation was met with silence because it was filled with recorded orchestra
instead of silence.</p>

<p>The *last* song of her was a solo, acapella as it were, and we all gave a rousing ovation.</p>

<p>Jessica and I both wrote on the surveys about the show: &quot;boo recorded music; yay
violin!&quot; and tried to talk to the director, but were assured twice we could not.  So,
&quot;please please give our surveys to the director,&quot; we said, with hopes that he would
change the performances on the remaining five nights (tonight was the first).</p>
