Wish you coulda come today; there's a.... what's the word.....  obnoxiously cute bleach blonde
Japanese 19(?) year old girl singing at The Pink Cow, performing alongside a world champion yo-yo
guy.  She's like Shirley Temple singing, and three stooges yoyoing but tries hard, whereas he's an
incrediblest yoyoist who's not even trying to sing cause I'm guessing he can't.  Anyway, it's part of
the crazy culture in Japan that I don't often see up close.
