<p>Lin came over to Paola's at 12:30, which I thought was because that's when Paola's yoga class
ended, but turns out that was just random, and Lin ended up waiting longer than she had expected,
but when they went to put tea away, Lin told Paola that we're officially enjoying hanging out.</p>

<p>We stayed a bit longer, talking about food and looking at pictures from Paola's trip, and Paola
made us sandwiches.  Yummy yummy.  AND, because she's enjoyed hers so much, Lin got a neti pot for
me and one for her sister!!  wowowowooowww!!</p>

<p>After Paola drove us out, Lin drove us to Shibuya, and I joked that now that the news it out
to <em>Paola</em> it's a done deal.  Lin was like, &quot;no, dude; you are always free.&quot;
Perfect answer.</p>

<p>She also reminded me that there's a little truth behind every joke, and suggested that I should
look at that carefully.</p>

<p>ま。そうだね。</p>
