<p>I've been trying to get this djang django installation to work, but haven't yet been quite
successful.  So far I have determined that I need to kill all processes with the name
&quot;python&quot; (and I've been killing &quot;php5.cgi&quot; for good measure), and I've got
Paste set up to report errors as suggested in
the <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Passenger_WSGI#500_Errors_with_Passenger_WSGI_Workaround">server
500 django python dreamhost passenger workaround</a> entry on DH's wiki.</p>

<p>I'm getting the admin screen as described
in <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial02/">Part 2 of Writing your first
Django app</a> tutorial, but when I edit settings.py
in <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">Part 1 of Writing your first
Django app</a> tutorial to include my app, I get a 500 error.</p>

<p>If I restore settings.py, the 500 error is resolved.</p>

<p>If I change the passenger_wsgi.py file according to the workaround mentioned above, I get</p>

<pre>
error while loading passenger_wsgi.py
</pre>

<p>(or something to that effect), whether or not I've changed settings.py.</p>

<p>So it's like the workaround is making it fail more gracefully, but failing each time instead of
just when I've changed settings.py</p>

<p>I tried dissecting passenger_wsgi.py, but that didn't affect the error message regarding the
file.  I replaced the new passenger_wsgi.py with the old one and the admin screen worked again.</p>
