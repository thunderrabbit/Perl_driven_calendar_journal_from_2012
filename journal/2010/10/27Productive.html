<p>I got <em>much</em> further in the project today; I can view all records, delete a record, and
display one to edit, all via json requests from the server.  Last step is to save a record via
json.  So far I have it encoded and sent to the server, but the server can't yet decode it.</p>

<p>Well, actually it decodes down to a serialized string, but not beyond that; I need to
deserialize the string and put it into an array.  I wonder if there's a function for that, but
right now I'm not online.</p>
