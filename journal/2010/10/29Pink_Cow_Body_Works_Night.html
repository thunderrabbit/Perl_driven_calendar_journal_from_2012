<p>Went straight to The Pink Cow for Body Works Night; it was awesomely fun with Sieg painting
paper, Divi painting paper, Spence painting Emi, me massaging anyone, Hanjo dancing belly, Colleen
taking pictures, Lin joining us, someone playing guitar, and DJ spinning wax...  I gave about 7
massages I think, and one guy was like, &quot;we're doing an event in January in Nagano; would you
like to set up a booth there?&quot;</p>

<p>Definitely!!</p>

<p>At the end, we were super-close to missing last train (and I <em>again</em> didn't get to massage
Mia) and Lin offered to drive us home!!  So so sweet!!  I told her the Moe Joe joke, totally
forgetting to not put dogs into the original story, totally forgetting (omitting) the repeated line,
&quot;they were like two ______, two peas in a pod, they were like <em>this</em>, which is pretty
hard for two horses to be,&quot; and ending the joke with a feline.</p>

<p>Lin emailed me when she made it home safely.  So so happy.</p>
