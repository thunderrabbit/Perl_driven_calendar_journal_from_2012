<p>We took a taxi to eat okonomiyaki near the station, because it's crap-cold and rainy ouside.
When we got back, there was a bag with okonomiyaki fixins on the door.  wtf?</p>

<p>And then, omg, Tomoko must have come, not knowing Soness was in Hong Kong.  Dang.</p>

<p>Interesting that she was thinking of okonomiyaki as well!</p>
