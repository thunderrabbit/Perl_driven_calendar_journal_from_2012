<li><p>Last couple of days I've been working pretty diligently on Fred's programming request for
modifying some filters in Paraview.  Since we've only got about 10 days to solve this, I turned to
the paraview list to ask for support.  Got a reply back from a guy who seems to know what time it
is, and I told him to go ahead and start making the changes, and I'll get him the dataset soon.</p></li>

<li><p>Had a brief phone interview with Lloyd at Housing Japan.  I'll send him some code samples
and references, and then have an interview with them on Friday.  Nice.</p></li>

<li><p>Joel and Soness had an argument tonight and it totally triggered feelings of helplessness
from when I was a kid and my parents would fight.  I left the house (not that helpless anymore),
but I was unable to tell them to stfu or anything like that.</p></li>
