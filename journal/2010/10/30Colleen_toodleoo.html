<p>Just said bye to Colleenie Beanie G Bean Dawg; I'm sooo going to miss her; we've had so much
fun!!!  And I've had so much fun watching her have so much fun in Japan, from seeing new places, to
eating new food to playing new instruments to wearing traditional clothes...  it's been a super
experiencial experience for her.</p>

<p>And I've determined she is no longer 13 years old like she used to be 13 years ago.  Imagine that!!</p>

<p>Woke her up to give big hugs and help me put on the plastic pants and plastic jacket I got for Mt
Fuji climb with Lin.  More big hugs and &quot;I love you&quot; and &quot;see you super soon!&quot;
and Joel was like, &quot;do you guys want to make out?&quot; hahahah I was like, &quot;nope!&quot;
and headed out.  I gotta go to work; sigh.  I was hoping to take her to the airport and have that
extra time to chat and finalize all our long term memories for this awesome visit.</p>
