<p>From my wiki of <a href="/wiki/Times:2010.10.29_Tokyo_Dome_City_with_Colleen">The Time Colleen
and I went to Tokyo Dome City</a>:</p>

<pre>Colleen and I went to Tokyo Dome City today!! This was her last full day in Japan, and we had a
great time.

Colleen bought us day passes for 4000 yen each. We kept track of all the rides we rode to make sure
we got our (her) money's worth.

First we rode Tower Hacker (800 yen) 3 times, once on each side.

Then we rode Thunder Dolphin 9 times!! (1000 yen)

(times are approximate)

   1. 14:00 Last Seat!!!! Photo number 444..
   2. 14:20 Front Seat!!! Photo 457
   3. 14:30 condoned line cut seat Six!! 474
   4. 14:40 seat 5 waking/sleeping 497
   5. 14:50 seat 9 scared happy 513
   6. 14:57 seat 9 coyotes 525
   7. 15:04 seat 11 looking away 539 *
   8. 15:16 seat 6 switched jackets!! 558 *
   9. 15:26 seat 4 thinking 580 

Thunder Dolphin has two cameras, the photos for which are combined into one collage for
purchase. After the first few rides, we tried to be a bit funny/creative with our expressions. The
best was when we switcheroo while on the ride, and my second favorite was when I was distracted each
time.
