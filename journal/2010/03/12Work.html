<p>Got two things finished at work today, not including watching a video on how the illuminati are
planning to wipe 50% of the population in a few years (but won't succeed before planet x blasts the
planet to stone ages), and not including calling Paola to make sure it's okay to invite Soness to
the yoga retreat next weekend and telling Soness it was cool after Paola told me it was cool and
Soness saying, &quot;too late; I already booked a trip to go snow boarding!&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, so yeah, made a new table based on another table and nearly finished the management page for
it, based on the corresponding management page of the corresponding table.  Actually about 8 new
files required for the whole thing..</p>
