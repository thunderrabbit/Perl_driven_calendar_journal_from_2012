<p>Lesson with Emiko from 8 to 9pm involved a lot of my apologizing for being so sleepy... She was
quite understanding, and we had a good lesson.  Went a little bit over an hour because my train
in Shibuya was at 21:36.  We took yamanoted line from Ebisu to Shibs and she continued on to Ueno
(completely opposite side of the loop) on her way home to Chiba.</p>
