<p>The entry called Plant Planting was originally called Rock Hopping.  After planting the plant, I
went rock hopping on the T of rocks.  Basically hopped to the top of the T, hopped to the right, and
then across to the left, and then just on the way back mis-hopped a bit and clipped the front of my
left big toe.  Didn't stop hopping until I got all the way over to the right again.  Hmm blood, so I
changed my &quot;no blood; no problem&quot; rule to &quot;not much blood; no problem.&quot; Maybe
&quot;no meat; no problem&quot; would flow more easily.  Pressed the skin flap down onto the toe and
slapped the blood onto my white T-shirt to 'clean' my hand and display my trophy a bit more
prominently, and then got back to rock hopping.  Actually rock walking at that point cause I was a
bit puffed and the NIN shuffle in my headphones had turned to &quot;A Warm Place,&quot; which flows
gently into the ears.</p>

<p>Got my breath back before the music got bumpin' again so I click fast forward a couple times
until getting to a live version of &quot;All the pigs are all lined up&quot; which features both
fast and slow parts.  Back and forth along the top of the T, occassionally seeing little blood spots
from my previous passes until I got even tireder and sat down for a while in meditation, enjoying
the sun and warmer air, plus far less wind than the previous day.</p>

<p>Stood up after about 10 minutes, and saw the foot shaped blood design on the rock.  <em>wow!</em>
and then went gently walking to the base of the T while I got back into the rhythm, and then
realized I should go back and take a picture of the blood splotch, just for the memories and stories
online.  Sat down to get the photo that includes my shadow, and then got up to get the photo that is
fully lit, then rock hopped alternately fast and slow up and down the length of the T, which is much
smoother than the rocks making up its upper arms.</p>

<p>Tired again, so headed off the T to explore a bit.  Found myself near some steps and did a crazy
step aerobics dance thing, up-down-up-down plus spinning and spinning and down-up-up-down spinning
the other way while upping and downing.. supa fun and relatively hard, I think!  I likes it.  :-)
Train has arrived; bye!</p>
