<p>During my meditation, we had an earthquake..  about a 3.4 in Chigasaki, and probably a 4.5 at
its epicenter, somewhere out in the ocean, I bet, within 100 km East Southeast of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Need to look up how correct I am.  I think, according to our &quot;modern&quot; science, the only
thing that could be accurate is the 3.4 I felt in Chigasaki.  No way to tell epicenter location or
strength without 3 stations with synchronized clocks.  Right?</p>
