<p>In i-group, I was all, &quot;I've got fear about the future,&quot; but couldn't quite articulate
it.  Data: I may be out of work at the end of this month.  If so, I'd like to embark on a TJ Bike
adventure, this time with a bit more care taken of TJ Bike so the brakes work and the breaks
don't.  That's all fine and good.  So where's the fear?  I looked around my brain, &quot;ah - the
fear is in promoting myself to actually tell people about the trip; to solicit funding that can go
to the trip and the rest to charity.  Maybe even get a sponsorship with a company to help video
stream the trip live online.  But I don't want a bunch a camera crew peeps around; just a camera on
the front of TJ Bike looking out to see what I see.</p>

<p>David goes, &quot;but wait; you don't even know if you'll be out of work; what's the deadline for
that?&quot; Hmmmm, so I'll talk to Nate today to be like, &quot;yo I'm giving one more week and then
if there's no work for April, I'm going to give two weeks' notice and head outta here for a
bit...&quot;</p>

<p>I'm open to other options, but I just need something to move, one way or another or another.</p>
