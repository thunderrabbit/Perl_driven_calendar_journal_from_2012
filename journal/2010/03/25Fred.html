<p>Fred called me for my 14610th day, all &quot;wassahhhh!!&quot; and I enoyed chatting with him for
a bit.  He's doing well, though Austin is trying to install a light rail system, and finding it
extremely difficult.  Dude.  All these problems have been solved, plus an order of magnitude more,
considering super-express vs express vs local, different train companies running on the same lines,
different train gauges running on the same lines, and different train headings on the same rails.
Plus probably 3 orders of magnitude more people, with a variety of different payment methods.  Yeah,
come to Japan and take some notes, Austin.</p>

<p>Good to talk to Fred, who's riding his bike minimum 30 and 40 miles per day (that's my version of
the story, and I've committed it to the internet.  It's now true.)</p>
