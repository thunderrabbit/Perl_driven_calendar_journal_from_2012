<p>Soness took me out last night to thank me for being such a good (house)mate, and to see a high
energy awesome band.  Ironically, though I pushed my lesson with Yurika earlier, and therefore had
to leave work early, Soness was quite late leaving the house.  I called her at 8pm to meet her in
Shibuya, and she was like, &quot;I'm ust now leaving the house! That was fine; no worries, and I
guess I know to expect lateness from her.  But then she was like, &quot;can you help me figure out
which train to take?&quot; Since I didn't know how long she'd take to get to the station, I guessed
at the train departure time for her, and then the tain that arrives at least a minute earler, and
sent her a screenshot of those times, labeling them &quot;easiest&quot; and &quot;faster,&quot;
respectively, and she was like, &quot;no&quot; and &quot;it's not faster; this one is faster&quot;
and sent me her own screenshot and I was like &quot;hello a simple thanks would be nice,&quot; but
no thanks came, and I was like why the fuck do I do anything for you?  and if you're taking me out,
why the fuck aren't you here? and I spiraled into a pissy rage in my mind and nowhere to let it out;
just wandering around the back corners of Shibuya.  I talked to Emiko a bit about our yoga retreat
this weekend, and then I wandered a bit more than then I saw the nearby karaoke box.  Boom &quot;30
minutes, please&quot; and paid 520 yen and got my own private room to holler.  I yelled and roared
into the mic; every curse word I could think of; fucking verbal garbage spewing forth.  Where does
all this anger start?  I sang &quot;Kill You&quot; by Eminem twice and then a couple of others cause
I had basically calmed down by then.  Headed out 2 mintes before 30 minutes was up and went to
Inokashira Line to meet Soness at Shimokitazawa.</p>

<p>I wanted little or nothing to do with her, but put on my best smiley face and fortunately, once
she sorted out where the place was located, our names were on the list and a lot of her friends were
there so I left them to bounce-dance alone and I went to watch the genki cutie drummer ¤ê¤Ê</p>
