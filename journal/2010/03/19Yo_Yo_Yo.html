<p>Last night after work headed to The Pink Cow to watch a world champion yo-yoer yo-yo and teach us
yo-yo tricks!  I didn't know the biggest trick is that the yo-yos have a clutch to make them spin
without winding down or up!  Basically if they spin fast enough, they let go of the string and just
stay down.  Once I learned how to yo them down fast enough, then "walk the dog" and "rock the yo-yo"
tricks were easy!  I even made up "ride the unicycle" and Black (his stage name) was like, "what are
you doing??" in a joking way. Great fun.</p>

<p>An important part of the fun I had there was frickin' not worrying about looking foolish, being
unable to yoyo, and once I got it to spin quickly enough, not worrying that my throwing technique
was scary and not smoove like Black's, but just effective like mine.  Everyone in our little group
was able to yoyo after practicing.  There was Nao and U, who I think had played with yoyos before.
Nao is hoping to be a boat race announcer, and U already is an actor for kids' TV.  Mutsumi and Katz
were on the other side of the circle, and it took Mutsumi a bit to learn the yo yo sleeper move, but
she got it after a bit. I was like, &quot;just be scary when you throw it, cause that's what it took
for me to get it to spin fast enough 'yeaargh!' and whip that yoyo out there, yo!&quot; Working
while playing, Mallory got the sleeper to work, and the other consistent server girl as well, but I
don't know her name.  The less diligent group included a couple peeps who left early.  Also running
around was K, employed by and taking photos for Black's events.</p>

<p>I invited Katz and Mutsumi to Japanese Lounge Night's first anniversary on Monday night; I wonder
if they'll come!</p>
