<p class="note">(written 12:01pm JST Saturday 13 March 2010 (day 14598))</p>

<p>After dropping Soness off at the train station to catch a train before 8am (she got sidetracked
talking on Skype and made the 8:15am train), I went rock hopping this morning, for the first time in
months, cause the weather is finally warm enough to warrant such barefoot behavior.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing toward the beach like the wind off the ocean, and blowing sand in my eyes
like grains of windblown sand that gets in the eyes.  I enjoyed watching the water kersplash against
the top of the T like ocean waves against rocks, and I even got wet like taking a salty shower.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to rock hopping in the mornings again, like a rock hopper hopping on rocks
again in the morning.</p>
