<p>I iPhoned past Chigasaki, and didn't even notice until Oiso, which is two stations beyond, but
even then, noticed too late and couldn't get off until Ninomiya, at which the Acty trains don't
stop, so had I gone one station further, I'd have been able to catch the Acty going back, and be in
Chigasaki by now I bet.</p>

<p>Anyway, this wouldn't be so bad except I told Emiko I would skype her at 10pm to discuss plans
for going to the yoga retreat next weekend.  Sorry, Emiko.</p>
