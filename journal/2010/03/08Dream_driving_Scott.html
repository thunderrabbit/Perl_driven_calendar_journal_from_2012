<p class="dream">Highway driving super fastly going along with traffic, but driving while surfing
the internet, and sitting in the front passenger's seat.  I wanted an opportunity to switch ver to
the driver's seat, but couldn't find a sefe moment at first without slowin down, so I kept driving
fom passengers seat until we went into a curve that I knew would keep people from changing lanes,
si I did it then, sped up a bit, and then arived at the location marked by two giant wooden doors,
still driving I knew they were supposed to open, but they didn't until the last second ansuddenly I
was inside, driving too fast into a meeting room full of people and tried to curve, but spu a bit
swerved and started skidding, but remembered the unskid technique of driving into the skid and it
gave my tires traction again and I skid again and then retractioned again, and in this way I made
it around the tradk of people.</p>
