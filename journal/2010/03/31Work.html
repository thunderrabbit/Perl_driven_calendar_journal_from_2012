<p class="note">(written 9:56pm JST Thursday  1 April 2010 (day 14617))</p>

<p>Got home around 10pm last night.  Bananna was home upstairs in Soness's room, so I went up there
to chat with her.  Soness was still at her Artists' Way group that she's leading.  Told Bananna
about my day, something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, we had to connect various types of objects to various other types of objects, so we
used a linking system that just listed all the ids of the objects.  I noted that the linking system
was pretty much the same in all cases (add a link, remove a link), regardless of the actual objects
being added.  So I wrote some functionality into the objects' classes that allowed them to link to
each other.</p>

<p>&quot;Alfonzo was like, 'cool,' and a few months later, 'aha,' and abstracted the linking
functionality into an abstract class that all the other classes instantiated,&quot;  (I used the
word &quot;used,&quot; but I digress.) &quot;and that solved the very problem I was having
yesterday.</p>

<p>&quot;So that was the good news!  I used his new classes and was able to write the page I wanted
to write but was having big troubles cause the code I was using had gotten all crusty like old
peanut butter that had turned into peanut brittle,&quot; (now I'm just making shit up I didn't say
at all, but it's April Fool's Day now as I write this so it's okay) &quot;and I was like, 'ugh!'
and hated it all, especially since after he wrote the new classes, all of my code was not so much
superfluous as completely useless.</p>

<p>&quot;All except for two parts, it turns out, so I'm glad we commented it out instead of wiping
it altogether, but in the end it was all good.  How was your day?&quot;</p>
