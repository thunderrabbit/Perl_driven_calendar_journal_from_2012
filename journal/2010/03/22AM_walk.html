<p>We had a silent walking meditation this morning at 6am; we headed to a spot on the beach
boardwalk (ceramic tiles, actually) and did 10 sun salutations (sequence of yoga positions).  I did
a bit over 9.5 of them; I got too tired to do all of the left leg on number 8.  Emiko laughed.</p>

<p>I did the whole thing (25 minute walk each way and yoga) barefoot and before I put in my contacts.</p>
