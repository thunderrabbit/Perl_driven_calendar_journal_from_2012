<p>Late yoga yesterday was more therapeutic yoga, where we didn't have to use much strength, but
basically get into different stretchy positions, and simply rest in the stretch.  Most of these
were done on our backs.  A couple with butt against the wall and legs splayed, and one stretched out
backward over the table, which was reallllly hard for me, and took a while to recover.  Paola said,
&quot;as long as your head doesn't actually fall off, it should be okay.&quot;

<p>I opted out of the next couple of poses, but still did the elbow stand for a bit.  (I can do it
with Paola standing on my arms between me and the wall so my shoulders/elbows don't collapse my head
into the floor.)</p>
