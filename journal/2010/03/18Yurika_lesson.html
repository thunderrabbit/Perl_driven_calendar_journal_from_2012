<p>Great lesson with Yurika, though she *didn't* do her homewoerk; we looked at some of her previous
homework for some final quesitons.  I think it might be better to work on fluency for her instead of
just listening and transcription.  She used to memorize passages of her homework back in EV days.
That always impressed me.</p>
