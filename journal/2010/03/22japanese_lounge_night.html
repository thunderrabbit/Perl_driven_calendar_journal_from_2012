<p>Emiko and I went to Japanese Lounge Night at The Pink Cow for the JNL 1st year anniversary
event!  Emiko bought flowers for Kumiya, who was taping Japanese Lounge Night signs to The Pink Cow
sign when we arrived.  She had on a purple kimono tonight, which I don't think I've seen her wear
before, but I can't say I really pay attention to that kind of thing.  But I don't remember
thinking before, &quot;wow; that's purple!&quot; when seeing her.</p>

<p>Divya was there, painting a dragon on stage behind the other performers for most of the
evening.  I chatted with her a bit before things got started.  I think she said the dragon she's
painting will be at TPC permanently, and the big dragon on the ceiling will be moved to location
better suited for its size.</p>

<p>The restaurant was quite busy; Moonie was in the kitchen, and I didn't see her come out a single
time.  Akina was the server today, and I told Traci that Jude said HI.</p>

<p>Met Igor (from Ukraine and Florida), who hadn't previously been to The Pink Cow, and a couple
other peeps with whom I didn't really chat.  Anthony, one of Kumiya's shamisen students was back,
after a few month absence.  Oh, and we had a special drunk &quot;guest&quot; who availed herself to
the mic a couple times to cheer the performers on, and say &quot;ありがとう!&quot; and
&quot;Spaciba!&quot; which is my transliteration of a word in Russian that I think means 'welcome.'
Traci very gently ushered her to a table each time, and eventually the woman and her quiet friend
left.</p>

<p>Leigh, Akira, Jon, and their guitarist, Hide (I think) all came to perform again.  They've come
up with a name for their band now: Acid Blue (I think).  I didn't think I could make it awakefully
until they performed, and just before they got on stage I was all, &quot;yo Leigh, I'm super tired,
so if I rock outta here before y'all are done rockin' out, don't think it's because you're not
rockin' out enough,&quot; and he was like, &quot;it's all good; it's all good; we're happy to have
you as long as you're here,&quot; which I appreciated.  :-) (At the same time, I gave a hug to Yuri
who was there as Acid Blue videographer but didn't talk to her all that much.)</p>

<p>But, once they started rockin' out (actually I daresay <em>before</em> they started, I had
already asked a woman if I could have her sit on the wall right *here* so I could dance behind her
(without blocking her view)), I was already up on the wall dancing, and did my wall dance for their
whole set.  But perhaps I made it only because it was a short set to allow time for the myriad other
performers who performed tonight.</p>

<p>Once they finished, I was finished, and gave everyone hugs and headed out, with a burrito for
Soness.  Now on Tokaido line; it's 10:48 pm, and we're about 10 minutes south of Yokohama.</p>
