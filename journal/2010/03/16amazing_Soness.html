<p>Went back to Bic Camera, and thank goodness I went back with Soness, even though I was not in the
mood to look for her near Hachiko (I'm sorry I was so grouchy, but crummy day at work, as previously
mentioned, but the good news is that now I know I'll have free time in April and beyond!
whoooooo!!!)...  Anyway we went to Bic Camera and they were like &quot;yeah we can't take this back
because the tape has been cut,&quot; and I was like, &quot;doood&quot; and Soness was like,
&quot;dood&quot; and we were both like, &quot;dood&quot; and I gave up instead of throwing a fit,
and Soness, with her incredible smile and tenacity, got them to take it back, &quot;just this
time.&quot;</p>

<p>Not *only* did they take it back, but the correct (I hope!) router was 40 yen cheaper.  Aww yeah.
No restocking fee or anything so I'm prettttty sure they will just resell it no worries.</p>

<p>After buying the router, we got a phone for less than 2000 yen, and then looked at digital photo
frames, but the one Soness wanted wasn't in stock, so we headed out....</p>

<p>to The Pink Cow where she and I are now eating a bean burrito and guacamole chips,
respectively.</p>
