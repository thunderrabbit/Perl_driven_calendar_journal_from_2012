<p>This morning I snuck on the train again because I didn't leave the house early enough to get a
ticket before the machine retired for the day.  I didn't see the same flaw in their security as last
time, but I was able to jump on by running past the door guy as if in a rush and just briefly
flashing an old ticket.  I doubt I can get away with it every time, but it worked today.</p>
