<p>Anna Bananna is home!!!  So great to get to talk to her after her amazing adventures in Hokkaido
at The Little Red Ski House, although, actually I think she let me tell stories more than she told
stories!!  Because she broke her wrist, she showed me the X-rays online and I showed her the x-rays
and <a href="http://surgery.robnugen.com/">pictures during clavical surgery</a> from when my TJ
Bike trip came to a sudden end.  Anyway, she's interested in doing PB and vipassana, so I was
encouraging her to do those for sure.  So great to see Bananna!!!</p>
