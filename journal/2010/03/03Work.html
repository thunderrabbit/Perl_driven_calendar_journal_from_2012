<p>After a shockingly difficult time getting Eclipse to do the right thing, basically wasting a
full day of productivity, I switched to NetBeans, and looks like I won't look back.  Basically the
issue was with the synchronizations in Eclipse (or is it Aptana? I've never really understood which
is which); we couldn't get them to go to a new port and once I finally said frackit and deleted
everything to start over, I couldn't get the upload on save script to work.  Blah.</p>

<p>Today I got a new page nearly written.  Well, the template is written, but it still doesn't save
the data yet, but its ease of being built saved the day.</p>
