<p>Before RC, I met early with Tatiana who was feeling a bit upset about some stuff.  We chilled in
the park near the station and she said she didn't know if she'd be willing to stay through the whole
class today.</p>

<p>Hinako led the group today.  The most interesting thing she taught actually counts as the most
interesting thing I've heard in a long time.</p>

<p>Given that true leadership requires thinking about the people one is leading, and given that
leaders tend to be emotionally isolated given that they need to be leading all the time, followers
should support their leaders so they can continue to think well of their followers.</p>

<p>We did a session of appreciating Emma, who has been leading our group for about a year.  She was
able to yell and cry and did so more than I've ever heard her do before.  Awesome.</p>

<p>We played a new game based on follow the leader, but as a flock.  When the leader turns, everyone
turns, and whoever is in front is the new leader.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Tatiana stayed for the whole group despite her previous concerns that she'd not be able to.
Awesome.</p>
