<p>Fred and I chatted a bit; he plans to do the MS 150 this year!  He added some
&quot;challenges&quot; to his MS 150 page; basically, if people give more money, he'll do a more
difficult ride.  Like if people give $25, he'll take a hillier route, or if they give another $25,
he'll make a top speed of at least 35 miles per hour.  For $200, he'll hit a top speed of 50 miles
per hour.  Sweeeet.</p>
