<p>OMG!  Musashi Kosugi is now bigger!  It somehow magically extends all the way from Musashi Kosugi
of the Tokyu Toyoko, Meguro, and Nambu Lines all the way to a new Musashi Kosugi on the Shonan
Shinjuku Line!  Wowwwwww!!  Is there a tunnel?  Does it actually connect?  Wowwww!!!  I gotta scope
that out!  (Out that I gotta scope?)</p>
