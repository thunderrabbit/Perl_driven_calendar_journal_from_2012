<p>Emiko and I had a karaoke lesson tonight.  We sang all English songs for the first hour, all of
which were slow except for Skater Boi by Avril Lavine (sp, and I'm not online to check).  Then
during the second hour some Japanese songs were included, including one I liked, but can't remember
the lyrics now.  私の恋が風に乗るよ。 I think that's correct, and I imagine it's enough to identify
the song.</p>

<p>We split a salad and chicken nuggets and fries.  As a joke, I divied up the food by putting the
nuggets on my plate and the fries on hers.  Funny funny.</p>
