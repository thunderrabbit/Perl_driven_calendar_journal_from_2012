<p>I was snoozin' before midnight last night.  basically got home and was petting Nibbles kitty and
nearly fell asleep while waiting for laundry to finish.  I took that as a sign, to skip my normal
routine of catching up on the latest on /., ATS, and Project Camelot, and just going to
sleeeeeeep.</p>

<p>Contacts out, teeth cleaned, zzzzz</p>

<p>This morning, I woke up around 8:30, did some contortions intended to stretch my quadraceps (my
homework from yoga instructor Paola), and then sat in meditation for 20 minutes from 9:10 to
9:30.</p>

<p>Came out of meditation thinking I should do another bike ride around Japan.</p>

<p>Decided to start researching streaming video via cellular connection; apparently it's possible
via ustream's apps.  Got sidetracked and read some /. and decided to try 
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hackernews</a>, and found some good ones, especially
considering my new job status of &quot;pending&quot;
hahahaha: <a href="http://blog.gism.net/?p=310">11 Rules of Happiness</a> (all the same stuff I've
read before, but with an extra oomph), and, dovetailing
nicely, <a href="http://coconutheadsets.com/2010/03/02/what-i-learned-raising-a-million-dollars-for-a-startup-with-no-business-plan-and-no-financial-projections-while-drinking-a-beer/comment-page-1/">What
