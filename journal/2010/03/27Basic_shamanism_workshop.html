<p class="note">(written 9:31pm JST Sunday 28 March 2010 (day 14613))</p>

<p>Recently (few months ago?) my friend Kevin was made the official Foundation for Shamanic Studies (FSS)
Trainer for Asia  (I think that's the correct title).  He's got a vast amount of training in
various spiritual traditions; I love listening to his stories!</p>

<p>Anyway, though I've taken Kevin's own beginning shamanism workshop (twice), I took this one
because of its official FFS sanctioning, by which I'd therefore be able to take their more advanced
workshops.  This day we did a process I hadn't previously done: rock divination (I almost like
&quot;rock oracle&quot; better, but it's the wrong grammar).  Basically ask a question, gaze at a
rock until we see something that reminds us of something (anything), and then tell what that
something means for us (right now).  Repeat some variety of 7 times, add up the results, and presto!
we have an answer from the rock.</p>

<p>The other processes were all ones I had done before, though this time I was more successful at
sleeping than experiencing any interesting under world or upper world stuff.   I wrote
&quot;zzzzzzzzzzzzz&quot; several times in my notebook.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>I sat to Kevin's right, and sitting to my right was Joasia, and to her right, her friend Maia.
Joasia had on bright pink fuzzy pants which she made from a bedspread or something.   They were
really neat.  Doubly neat is that she had just been living in Hokkaido, and knows The Little Red Ski
House, where Anna Bananna has been working for the past few months!!  Woww!!  She didn't know
Bananna, but certainly they have mutual friends.</p>

<p>Talked briefly to Mari, the cute girl across the circle from me.  Long brown hair, soft doe
eyes.  She and I made eye contact a few times and smiled at each other so I definitely wanted to
say HI.</p>
