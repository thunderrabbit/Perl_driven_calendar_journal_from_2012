<p>Emiko and I had our lesson today and then walked around  a bit.  Found a manga character action
figure shop to which I reacted like, &quot;who buys this???&quot; and she was like, 
&quot;なつかしい&quot; (good memories).  I was like, &quot;all I see is plastic.  What would I do
with this?&quot; She said she remembers the characters' stories, sometimes 40+ years of stories have
been written.</p>

<p>About the actual figures, I explained, &quot;I mean, I can appreciate that someone took the time
to model this particular character; that took talent; that's art.  But, to make a million copies of
it in plastic, I just can't see the point.&quot;</p>
