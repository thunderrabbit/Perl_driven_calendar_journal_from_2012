<p>Day 2 of the workshop didn't include any processes I hadn't previously done, but again when I
did them today it was mostly sleepy sleep time for me.  Sigh.  BUT, when I did the power animal
retrieval for Barnaby, I made sure to stay awake and not waste so much (any?) time &quot;going down
the rabbit hole&quot; (I'm using The Matrix language, not language that Kevin used as instruction
during the course).  I went down a volcano a bit, but then used a trick Kevin has taught us (in
each course), &quot;trust that it's working,&quot; and I began to see animals.  Perfect.  Saw a big
animal a couple of times (showing its teeth), and I was like, &quot;aight; to prove it, can you be
a bit more subtle?&quot; and it was gone for a bit and I saw another animal, &quot;oh maybe that's
it,&quot; but then the first animal came up behind me and nuzzled the back of my neck.
&quot;whooof!  okay!  That's good!  I just need to see you one more time&quot; and it came up
playfully on my left hand side.</p>

<p>Four appearances = contact, and I took the animal's spirit-energy into the middle world and gave
it to Barnaby.  Nice process.</p>
