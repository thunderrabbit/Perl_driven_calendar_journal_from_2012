<p>Got to talk to Australly Sally today after work, and might even talk to her some more once I get
home!  I'm headed that way now.  She said she may still be awake.</p>

<p>She's looking carefully at her shiz during this mess of her husband leaving and wanting a
divorce; it sounds like he's not willing to take any responsibility for the situation.  Hmmm.</p>
