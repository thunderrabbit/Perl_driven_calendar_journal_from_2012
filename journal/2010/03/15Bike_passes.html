<p>This morning I got our bike passes for April.  Well, I got the form that guarantees we can buy
bike passes for April if we go back to the bike parking lot with form filled out and 1500 yen by
April 1st.</p>

<p>It took a lot less time in line to get the passes today.  I know the line starts moving at 6am,
and I know I was able to get passes on the 15th of February at 7am, so I figure I have about an hour
window to get to the bike parking place, not have to wait in a stationary line, and still get passes
to get bike passes.</p>
