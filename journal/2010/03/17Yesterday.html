<p>Yesterday work went relatively well; I got nearly a full page written.  </p>

<p>After work, I met Emiko for our weekly Wednesday lesson, and then we went to The Pink Cow
(by way of Bic Camera to get three phone cords to finish up the wireless connection cleanup in Chez
Soness).  At The Pink Cow I neded to chat with Mike about Cow-Go; he'll have his first trial lesson
on Sunday with a possible new student.  Then I was sitting with Emiko enjoying what I could hear of
the Improv-a-Go-Go when Liu came in and asked if she could sit at our table. omg, yes.</p>

<p>I hadn't previously met her, but I was immediately like wowoowwowo and ready to drop everything
to hook up with her.  Fortunately for me, I was chillin' with Emiko and didn't want to ditch her, *and* I
had just told Soness I'd catch a train home with her.</p>

<p>At home, Soness pointed out, after I cried sobbingly that &quot;the only way I know how to relate
to women is through sex,&quot; isn't actually true; I thanked Soness for our close connection
without sex or romance, and, despite making this a crazy run-on sentence, Soness reminded me that
that was how I came to Chez Soness in the first place.  I didn't find the girlfriend part, but I
found stability when I lost my job last year, and she saw a pattern of me looking for a girlfriend
for stability when my job stability goes away..</p>

<p>Last night I tweeted &quot;omg Shiu&quot; because for a brainfart second I forgot her name,
deleted the tweet, and tweeted &quot;omg Liu&quot; this morning.</p>

<p>As I was leaving The Pink Cow last night, I said to Liu &quot;see you Friday!&quot; in a direct
flirting way, and then &quot;if you come [here, to The Pink Cow to see the yo-yo show
tomorrow (Friday)].&quot;</p>

<p>sorry for scatterbrained entry; I'm writing without my contacts so I can't see to edit very easily.</p>
