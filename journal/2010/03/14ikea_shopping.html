<p>Soness and I went to Ikea to look for a desk and yellow curtain; she's ready to release her old
desk, get a more feng shui happy desk, and put a curtain in the middle of the living room to give
me a bit of privacy at night.  Wow!</p>

<p>In the 45 minutes we had remaining after dinner of swedish meatballs and something else, we
didn't find the optimal desk nor curtain, but bought some pictures, candles, and ice cream, and met
Ulli and Sara(h) at the bus stop.  Chatty chattery between Soness and Ulli at the stop and on the
bus, and then I chatted with Ulli a bit while walking from the bus to Shin Yokohama station.  They
seem pretty cool, and knowing Soness, we'll see them again, probably for the 5th annual Chigasaki
BBQ, if not sooner.</p>

<p>Arrived home, pulled the TV and VCR/DVD player out of the closet where I've been using them as a table (TV
is not connected, but Soness used the DVD player to watch movies), and will release them soon cause
I set her DVD player on her computer to region free.  Changes are happening!</p>
