<p>Soness is back in town!  She went to Hong Kong for NLPT training (training to be a trainer),
which is something I've been interested in trying for myself.  Seems like I may be able to!</p>

<p>She apparently arrived in Haneda around 5:45am, and has a fitting at 9am, and then rehearsal,
and then teaching her kids' class at 4pm.  Busy busy day!</p>
