<p>There's a site called <a href="http://www.therationalradical.com/">The Rational Radical</a> which
features a podcast called &quot;<a href="http://www.therationalradical.com/podcast.html">Blast The
Right</a>&quot; I have never listened to the podcast, but I did sign up for its emails in June
2007.</p>

<p>In answering the question below, I looked back through my email archive to find fewer than half
of the 70+ I received were marked as &quot;read&quot;</p>

Hello Jack

I had stopped reading Blast the Right because it seemed to be so us-vs-them.  "Look at what *they*
did, those stinky right wingers!"

My preference is to cultivate inner peace, understand every one of us is doing our best with the
tools and knowledge we have.  ( everyone!  including Hitler, Cheney, GW Bush, Obama, Oprah, Gandhi,
you, me, and even the kids who taunted us in school. )

I meditate each morning; I try hard to remain aware of myself and my breathing throughout the days.

I honor the work you're doing to put together Blast the Right.  I know it's a lot of work, and that
you're doing it on a volunteer basis (right??).  You're helping to wake up a lot of people, which
will certainly benefit the world.  Thank you for that.

   Blessings, and thank you for asking
    - Rob!

    Hello,

    I noticed you unsubscribed from Blast The Right.

    Since I'm always trying to improve the podcast, could you tell me what led you to cancel your subscription?

    Thanks!

    Regards.
