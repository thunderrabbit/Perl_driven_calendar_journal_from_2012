<p>325 meters from the far end of the nambu line platform, oin Musashi Kosugi, one can get trains
on the *new* Musashi Kosugi platform for the Shonan Shinjuku Line, Saikyo Line, Narita
Express.. wow!  I told Jen, &quot;our big-little Kosugi is getting bigger!&quot;</p>

<p>Last night on the way home from The Pink Cow I called Soness but didn't reach her, so took the
train home alone and when I heard the &quot;next sttion Musashi Kosugi&quot; I flipped out again (
have heard it before, and it excies me each time) and was like, &quot;dood!&quot; cause I had free
time to explore it.  There's not that much to see yet; the hallway from the new form to the old
nambu form has white sheet metal walls and asphalt pavement.  The walls feature plexiglass windows
showing construction outside; I bet the whole area is going to be shopping extravaganza, bringing
the overall desireability of living in the area to a new high (or low).  I'm pretty excited for the
change, but don't really plan to go shopping there anytie soon / ever.  But maybe they'll put in a
movie theater; that would be cool!  Then we could reminisce about all the times we could have gone
to the teater in Kosugi for antics instead of going out to Kawasaki.  Oh joy!</p>
