<p>I know from my years of work in i-group and other places, the anger my seem directed at someone
or caused by someone, but I know it's all an internal conflict.  &quot;You realized your anger has
nothing to do with this man; he is just a mirror for something inside yourself.&quot;  And I
realized that it was something about me that was angry.  Basically that I ASSumed she would arrive
at a certain time, though we hadn't agreed on one.  and that I therefore cleared my schedule by
moving lesson and skipping Pink Cow plans.</p>

<p>That I wanted a &quot;thank you&quot; for &quot;helping her&quot; with train schedule might be a
sticking point, but
doesn't seem quite right.  Maybe I didn't feel my work was valued; that she just ignored me.  frack,
I don't know.</p>

<p>Tha other thing is that I wanted to keep a fight from breaking out on a 'date' she planned, and
the other reason is it would have caused a fight had I brought it up in an unsafe way.  AND, she was
so bubbly kawaii that she wasn't in a space to listen to anything, much less that.  (these are
judgemtns, not facts).</p>
