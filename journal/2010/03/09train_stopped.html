<p>Good thing I rushed to get this train!  The announcer was like, &quot;in a moment, we'll be
arriving at Chigasaki,&quot; and the train slowed normally, and then slowed suddenly and stopped,
about 200 meters before the platform.  And we've been here for 12 minutes, by my reckoning.  Nice
way to stay out of the sloppy snowy rain!</p>
