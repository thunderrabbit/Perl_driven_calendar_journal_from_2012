<p>Bananna was like, &quot;my day was relatively boring compared to your day; I've just been going
through my stuff [that accumulated during 3+ months at The Red Ski House in Hokkaido].  And I took
a bath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you take a bath like *this*?&quot; I asked, holding up my arm.</p>

<p>Because I was lying on my back, the joke didn't translate; see she broke her wrist three weeks
ago and still has on a brace which she can't get wet.  I sat up and tried again and she laughed.</p>

<p>Bananna is so nice.</p>
