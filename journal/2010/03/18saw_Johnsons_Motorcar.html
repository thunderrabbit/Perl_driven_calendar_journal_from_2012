<p>When we arrived, and confirmed my hunch that it was Johnsons Motorcar, I stripped down to shorts
and t-shirt (no shoes) and went down to the dance floor with Soness.  We bounced for a bit near
Kelly and Spring Day, and some of her other peeps, and then I was like, &quot;fuck dis&quot; and
kept making my way across the audience to where Rina the drummer was playing.  I bounced on my bare
feet for basically all of the songs that were bouncy.  Just continuous bounching on my toes for
maybe a total of thirty minutes or more.  It wasn't really that tiring though, so I was glad about
that.  I can feel it a bit in my calves today, but not much.  Thank you, calves.</p>

<p>Beautiful Lou came by and tapped my shoulder to say HI.  I hugged her bigly: my one friend who
Soness also knows, but I didn't meet through Soness. (there's also Jimmy, but he's not in Tokyo.)</p>

<p>Rina was her usual cute self smiling bigly and drumming like a rock star.  Though I didn't get any
great pictures of her, I sure enjoyed watching her drum while I bounced.</p>

<p>The show ended and I wandered around a bit, still with copious energy and still pissy at Soness
a little bit, and  waiting for her to finish social butterlication.</p>
