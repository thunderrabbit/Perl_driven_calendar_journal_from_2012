<p>Got home around 8:40pm, just as Soness was like, &quot;I gotta go to Co-op for veggies for
dinner!&quot; and she did that while I hung her laundry (lots of socks).  Then we made dinner
together of soy milk veggie nabe.  So yummy, easy, delicious!!</p>

<p>AFter dinner she got on Skype, blasting the audio through her stereo, which triggers all my
triggers and makes me a bit crazy; I finished computering and got into the shower to try to get away
from the noise.  She was talking to Vivien (I think) in Vancouver (I think) and they were blah blah
blah about boys and whatever girls talk about, and I mean that's fine; it's great, even, but just
turn down the volume a bit, eh?</p>

<p>When I finished my shower (it was long), she was still gabbing, and I was like, &quot;can you
wear some headphones or something?&quot; and she was like, &quot;Okay I gotta go because my
housemate has to go to bed, and I have to go to bed too,&quot; and that's fair enough, and sounds
like a good place to say, &quot;okay bye,&quot; but they went on to like three or four other topics
(though, yes, they were only a few sentences each, each) but it's like dang bro; just stop
gabbing</p>

<p>And by that time I had balled up face down on Soness's bed (I almost never touch her bed, but I
didn't know how much longer she would be) and she came upstairs to apologize lightly, and could see
I was upset.</p>

<p>I know that there are other ways I could handle this.  I could have said, &quot;hey Soness;
you're being too loud and might wake up your neighbors,&quot; but for some reason I couldn't do
that and tried soft approach of suggesting headphones, etc.  Anyway, I acknowledged that it's hard
for me to confront her, and that triggered a solution in my mind, and I basically said, &quot;I
love you, even though you're a noisy girl,&quot; and we got it sorted.</p>

<p>I really do love her, and I love that we trigger each other so see our own issues.</p>
