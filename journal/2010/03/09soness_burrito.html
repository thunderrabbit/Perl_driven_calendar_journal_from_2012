<p>As I was leaving the rat race presentation, I saw that Soness had asked if I could bring home a
burrito.  Eeep!  Too late!  Gotta catch my train!</p>

<p>Told her my work news about glorious free time, and she's excited about the possibilities for TJ
Bike trip around Honshu.  Me too!</p>

<p>Ideas for the trip:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>live video streaming</p></li>

<li><p>live GPS streaming to online map</p></li>

<li><p>human powered energy source to gps and phone</p></li>

<li><p>Tokyo north along east coast, then south along west coast.  Hokkaido?  Wakkannai?</p></li>
</ol>
