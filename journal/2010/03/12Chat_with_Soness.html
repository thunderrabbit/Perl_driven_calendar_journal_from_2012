<p>Soness told me that Daniel's name popped up on her wall (or something) in Facebook.  (He's her ex
husband who conned her out of $30,000 while cheating on her with multiple women, ended up taking her
job, and, so far, has gotten away skot free. (I'm using &quot;skot&quot; instead of &quot;scot&quot;
because he did end up having to pay her some money in their divorce settlement.))</p>
