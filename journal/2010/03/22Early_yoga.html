<p>Got back to Nobi beach house around 7:30am and got some hot beverages and then did yoga for a
couple hours.  omg I was soooo tired I could barely do anything.  Both Jon and Emiko were like,
&quot;we're genki!!&quot; and I was like, &quot;dood I'm done,&quot; and we all gave it a good
go...  BUT, it turns out they were tireder than they believed; we were crap compared to normal.
Paola was doing head stands and leg raises and L-stands and neck stands like normal, and we were
more like jelly rolls.</p>
