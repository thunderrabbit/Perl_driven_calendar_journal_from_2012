<p>Now that I have only a couple minutes before getting off the train, I figure I can write an SOML
address.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Soness and I live in Chez Soness in Chigasaki</p></li>

<li><p>I have work for the rest of this month, but may not have work in April or May or June.  If
that's the case, I plan to take another TJ Bike adventure, but more fully connected to the
interwebs during the ride.</p></li>

<li><p>I've got 700,000 yen in the bank, so I can be jobless for a bit, but I am considering
prudence in not letting my finances dwindle to dust before I seek work again.</p></li>

<li><p>No girlfriend</p></li>

<li><p>Soness recently went on some kind of training seminar for NLPT and has invited me to join
some of the future ones.  Hmmm!</p></li>

<li><p>I-group has been three or four men per night.  Takeshi hasn't attended recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been meditating each morning for 20 minutes, and in the past couple of days, I've been
less sleepy during it.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently renewed fly2.nu and isfuzzywilltravel.com.  robnugen.com is my main website.</p></li>

<li><p>No pets</p></li>

<li><p>Was listening to AniKiko, the artist formerly known as Kiko when I went past Chigasaki on the
train.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been &quot;working on&quot; a bunch of mazes to make a maze book, but the project has
sorta stalled.  Dang.</p></li>

<li><p>If I lost my computer, I'd lose today's journal entries, but not much else.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't had any earthquakes recently that I've noticed in Japan, but I did go to the shore
to see the tsunami after the 8.8 quake in Chile.  No tsunami came, but I met a guy named Yasuo.</p></li>

<li><p>It's just today gotten warm enough that I went to rock hop on the T.  Fun, though a bit wet
cause it was sooooo windy!  I'm greatly considering making this a daily routine, taking Carla's
advice of wake up early and get adrenaline flow to make it easy to wake up.</p></li>
