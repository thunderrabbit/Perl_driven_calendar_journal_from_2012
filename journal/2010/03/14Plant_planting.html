<p>Went rock hopping yesterday after waking up nice and late.  ((Hey!  I'm 14600 days old today!
Only 400 days to go on my non-kissing program.  Wooohoo!))  um, so anyway, on my way to the beach, I
carried the plant that had lost all its long stemmed leaves during winter while living in the shower
room of Chez Soness. Soness is actively appling feng shui techniques to the house, and
&quot;dead&quot; plants don't fit the bill.  I planted the plant in a wooded area near the beach and
took careful note of its location so I can check its progress during the summer.  Yay for
growth!</p>
