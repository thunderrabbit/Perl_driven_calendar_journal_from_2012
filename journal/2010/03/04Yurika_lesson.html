<p>Great lesson with Yurika, of course, cause she's a great student with great homework and
questions.  We're up to Seminar 40 by Susan and Usagi Sensei in Cross Cultural Seminar.</p>

<p>His name is actually (transliterated as) Osugi Sensei, but I like Usagi better because it's the
transliteration of Ñ½, which means rabbit.</p>
