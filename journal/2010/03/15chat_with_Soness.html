<p class="note">(written 8:22am JST Tuesday 16 March 2010 (day 14601))</p>

<p>By the time Soness got home, I had taken a shower and bath and was about ready for bed.  She
chatted for a bit about her day, during which someone was like, &quot;I don't want to hear that
stuff, cause it makes you sad,&quot; when in fact, it doesn't make her sad anymore.  I was like,
&quot;it probably makes him sad so he doesn't want to hear it,&quot; and I told her about my
original process in MKP where I symolically gave back to my father his sadness that I had taken upon
myself.  That process helped me distinguish between my emotions and others' emotions.  Good
stuff.  Soness seemed pleased with the insight.</p>

<p>Due to the number of photons triggering even more signals for my headachey brain to process, I
was like, &quot;can you turn this light off?&quot; referring to the light above my head. (I was
lying down on the hot carpet in the living room.)  She did, and then went away, and I was like,
&quot;I wasn't trying to kick you out, I'm enjoying our chat,&quot; and she goes, &quot;I wasn't
sure,&quot; and I go, &quot;my signal to tell you I need to sleep is when I say 'I need to sleep,'
so you should be able to tell pretty easily.&quot;</p>

<p>She sat by my legs on the couch again and chatted more and then went to her computer to check
email and stuff.  She was quiet for a while and I fell asleep and then, Great news!  She's getting
some requested days off to do a training this summer.  whooo! and I was like, &quot;because you were
quiet for so long, I had fallen asleep.&quot; &quot;oh, sorry,&quot; and I asked a couple Qs about
the days off and she got quiet again azzzzzzzz I fell asleep just to the point where &quot;oh!  this
is such great news!!&quot; startled me awake again, &quot;gasp; Soness..&quot; &quot;oh,
sorry,&quot; and she told me a bit more and before it could happen again, I was like, &quot;can you
tuck me in?&quot;</p>

<p>She goes, &quot;now *that* is a good way to get me out of here,  :-)&quot; and I was like,
&quot;you can stay; I just wanted to finalize our conversation for the night,&quot; and she hugged
me and closed the closet door next to me, and the Nibbles' doors near my head, anzzzzzzzzz</p>
