<p>Last night we had grilled veggies, chicken, beef and fish outside.  Whole grilled onions were
great; small green peppers were great. I didn't like the mountain potatoes all that much.  They're
kinda sticky and pastey.</p>

<p>Jude and Ji cooked, and we all ate and ate; it was great!  No ice cream, though.  Too full, and
too tired.</p>
