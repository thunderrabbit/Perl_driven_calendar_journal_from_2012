<p>After work we went to a darts bar for a 4000 yen all-we-can-drink-for-2.5-hours party that
featured some junk food and fast food type food.  Alfonzo beat someone at darts, and then beat me at
darts, and then got his ass handed to him (260 to 0) at darts.</p>

<p>Nate and I chatted a bit about the future of the company.  I suggested he give it some more time
before saying fail.</p>
