<p>Went to chat with Traci at The Pink Cow and learned her new plans for Cow-Go.  Cool!  So it's
lookin' like it could get a good influx of estudiantes.</p>

<p>Also Mallory asked if I wanted to &quot;get on the massage train?&quot; meaning give her a
massage while she was massaging Moonie.  I'm always up for giving a massage so I pressed on her
shoulders a bit while she was like, &quot;oh awesome&quot; and then switched to reiki and she was
like, &quot;I can feel you're doing something,&quot; and &quot;it's like a tingling in my
shoulder.&quot;  Nice.</p>
