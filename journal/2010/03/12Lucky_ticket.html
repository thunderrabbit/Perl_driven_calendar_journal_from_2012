<p>Got to the train station at like 8:41am for my train at 8:44am, but the ticket machine stops
vending tickets for this train at 8:39am (I think).  I went down to the platform as the train was
arriving, wondering if I could show one of my old tickets to the guy (he barely looks at them) and
get on (likely), or pay him 500 yen to let me on (unlikely).  Once I got there, though, an extra
door was open on the train, into which a few people were ducking, so I got on too!</p>

<p>I don't mean &quot;duck&quot; like it was a short door to some mysterious part of the train, but
sorta sneaking on version of &quot;duck.&quot; Seems strange that this trivially easy way to
&quot;beat the system&quot; exists for this train, but it might.  Also, we haven't reach Shinagawa
yet, so it's <em>conceivable</em> that this particular train car/section will be checked by a
conductor while in route (unlikely).</p>
