<p>Yesterday, Soness got an email from her university (employer) saying she hadn't yet turned in her grades
for classes.  She was like, &quot;dang; why couldn't they email me the day before, when I was still
in Japan??&quot; cause she's now in Honkers.  So I got to mail them for her.  No worries on that.
But before mailing them, she had to fill in all the grades on the scantrons.  She hadn't, though,
so I got to do it.</p>

<pre>
It was secretly a bit fun to systematically draw perfect numbers in the correct boxes, plus not
having to pay to mail them... whoohooo!  icing on the cake
</pre>

<p>That's part of my reply to her thank me email.</p>
