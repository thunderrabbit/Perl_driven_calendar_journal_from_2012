<p class="date">9:40pm JST Wednesday 24 March 2010 (day 14609)</p>

<p>Working on another version of our website.  Basically an iPhone version.   Alfonzo was like
&quot;naw you don't need to do that, do this&quot; when I asked him how to do that, and then after
I did this, it turned out we shoulda been doing that.  Dammit.</p>

<p>That was a solid hour wasted, just before 7pm when I went to my lesson with Emiko, so I went back
to work after the lesson and essentially made up the hour.</p>
