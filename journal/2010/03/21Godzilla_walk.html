<p>Jon, Emiko, and I went again today to play in the park guarded by Godzilla.  Slid down the roller
slide three times and then found some rope net tubes, through which we all squirmed head first.  Walked
down to a lookout and I ascended the stairs and circumnavigated the lookout all while walking
outside the rail.</p>

<p>Got several pictures of the net tubes, and a couple of the roller slide.</p>
