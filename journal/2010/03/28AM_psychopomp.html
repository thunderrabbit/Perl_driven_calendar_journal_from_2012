<p>Ah I just flashed across this memory.  This morning after I woke up at 4am to renew my internet
cafe time, I wasn't really falling asleep so I offered to do some psychopomp work.  &quot;Bring me
to a soul who needs help crossing over,&quot; and was in a pretty sleepy state so I didn't try to
view or get a lot of information, but I was like, &quot;hey how's it going?&quot; and felt the
negative reply.  &quot;Ah that sounds difficult,&quot; and sit a bit, and then once I felt the
presence of a helper angel, &quot;oh hey here's someone to help,&quot; and let the angel connect
with the soul.</p>

<p>I did this process twice and then fell asleep as the third one was finished or mostly in
progress; I have the sense that it was also completed successfully.</p>

<p>My understanding of how it works: a human dies, but doesn't know they're dead (or doesn't know
how (or that they deserve) to cross over for shower and debriefing).  Their guardian angels are
there to help them cross over, but, being at such a higher level of resonance, they are invisible to
the human soul that's focused on its own troubles.  But the soul can see me because I'm still at
crude human level of resonance.  So the simple task is to help the soul see his/her angels, simply
by shifting their awareness just a bit.  Then they're like, &quot;oh!&quot; and they handle
everything from there.</p>
