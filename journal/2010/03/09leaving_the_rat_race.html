<p>Went to a presentation by Brad Hall(?) called &quot;leaving the rat race,&quot; in which he
basically described his steps from Wall Street to Maui, where he converted some used up land into a
lush farm with all variety of yummy food.  That's exactly what different peeps have been saying,
&quot;get off the grid before the shtf.&quot;</p>

<p>Met Michaela and Crysti, who both happened to have taught classes for kids with unique
requirements for normalized living.  In Crysti's case, she had 18 kids in a class (where the legal
limit is 12), and in Michaela's case she had classes where each kid had a dedicated
para-professional with them all the time (in school).  Wow.  I thanked them both multiple times for
their efforts.</p>
