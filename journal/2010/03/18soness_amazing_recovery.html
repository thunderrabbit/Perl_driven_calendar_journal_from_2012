<p>On the train, on the way home, though at first I let the crowd separate us, I sat by Soness once
the crowds thinned out.  She was in such good spirits that she sang aloud for me the song that
makes her think of me (&quot;I need your therapy&quot; sung by India Arie) and though people stared
at she, Soness kept singing beautifully, and my heart softened dramatically, and I realized she does
love me.   Oh Soness, how can I be mad at you for not loving me when you're so sweet like this???</p>
