<p>&quot;Let me tell ya sonny, when I was a boy, we didn't have pervasive access to the interwebs!  In
fact, sometimes we had to pay for access!  Can you imagine that?  Well, it's true!  And our
connection wasn't built in!  We had to carry around devices to connect.  You don't know how easy you
have it!&quot;</p>

<p>Now, I know that we're still living in the stone age of connectivity, limited in bandwidth and
transmission speed, and I know our little phones are technological marvels of our time, working hard
to give us continuous access while connecting along an evershifting landscape of cell towers....
but dang, why does it take so long to get reception after coming out of the tunnel south of
Yokohama?  I had to wait a full two minutes!</p>
