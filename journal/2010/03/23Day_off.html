<p class="note">(written 8:46am JST Wednesday 24 March 2010 (day 14609))</p>

<p>Yesterday, for the first time in a long time, I took a day of work.  When I went to sleep on
Monday night, I could feel a little tickle of soreness in the back of my throat.  I didn't think
clearly enough to gargle hot salt water (an old voodoo trick I learned), but went straight to bed.
When I woke up, I could defomtot;u (sorry I just sneezed) feel a pain in my throat, and thought,
&quot;gah; I don't want to take a day off so close to when I'm done working!&quot; but after a bit
more contemplation, I was like &quot;bah humbug&quot; on work and texted in sick.</p>

<p>Soness made me some tea, and some more tea, and some vitamin C drink mixed with something else,
and got chicken soup ready for me to heat while she was at rehersal.  I heated the soup, drank more
tea, ate the soup in the shower, rested in bed, Skyped with Tatiana for 1.25 hours, and tried to
watch _Green Zone_, but the DVD rip I downloaded was DRM protected (and I didn't try to find
software not already on my computer that could read it), so watched _Daybreakers_ instead.  It was
pretty good, actually, though I haven't been movie-watching enough to likely see it again.  Gargled
with hot salt water, and did neti, soaked some lentils at Soness's suggestion, and then zonked out.</p>

<p>Slept until Soness got home, and then I was Sneezy McSneeze for most of the rest of the evening.
Not sure how the neti may have affected that.  Soness brought home veggies and asked how the lentils
were going.  &quot;Great!&quot; and semi exclaimed.  She was like, &quot;hmm!  These aren't
lentils!&quot; She was in such a good mood though, that it didn't even phase her, and we had onion,
pepper, lentils (from a can), broccoli, and maybe more, all mixed into a lovely soupy soup.  Yum yum
yum!!</p>

<p>It was nice to hang out with her while preparing the food.  I chopped onions and pepper, washed
and ripped broccoli, then chilled out again to rest while she put it all together.  So delicious,
and so great to have her super genki mood lighting the house.  She's really transforming herself
and her life.  :-)</p>
