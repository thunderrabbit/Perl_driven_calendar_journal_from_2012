<p>Wowow what a great great day today we've had at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jude.brand">Nobi
Bed and Breakfast</a>!</p>

<p>I just found
a <a href="http://maisassygirl.blogspot.com/2009/04/nobi-bed-breakfast-day-2.html">day at Nobi Bed
and Breakfast</a> that's almost identical to ours today.  In our case, though, it's day 1; breakfast
will be tomorrow!  I did everything barefoot, including slide down
this <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_y7r2oWlMYfA/SewnFE2DYAI/AAAAAAAASqA/0ADlKEfNfdE/s1600-h/RIMG2039.JPG">suberidai</a>
(that's not me in the photo).  So fun!</p>

<p>Tonight, we went to the Nepalese restaurant that's SO YUMMY OMG and then walked back along the
beach.  I'm thinking my TJ Bike trip should be entirely along the coast.  I should circumnavigate
honshu on the coastline.  On foot!!  Barefoot!!!</p>

<p>Ooops got sidetracked there.  Um, so super delicious and then came back to watch some bubbles
flow up a blue tube of goo and then Paola came!  Big hugs to her and then we all played Scrabble
and *then*, when Jude was showing us how to do the hot water, she changed the temperature and the
little automated voice says &quot;temperature changed to NN degrees&quot; (but she says a number
instead of NN and she says it all in Japanese).  Jude said, &quot;she just said, 'temperature
changed to 43 degree'&quot; and Paola goes, &quot;what what's it to her?&quot; then points at the
box, &quot;you need to mind your own business!!&quot;</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAa!!!</p>
