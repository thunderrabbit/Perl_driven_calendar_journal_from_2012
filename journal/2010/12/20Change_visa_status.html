<p>I'm at the ward office now, 2 days before my 3 year Engineering visa expires.</p>

<p>I've not had programming work since spring, though I've been seeking work since August, when I
got back from Thailand.</p>

<p>There appear to be 4 occurences of the capital letter I above, meaning me.</p>

<p>Me thinks that I should be able to easily switch to a Visitor visa; pretty sure I did that some
years ago, when I had qit work at Gaba and started travels with PB.  I did not have to go the full
blown Immigration office at that time; I just did it at my local ward office.</p>

<p>Today, I talked to the first person and made some noises in Japanese and English, with the
intention of expressing my desire to switch to a tourist visa.  She was like, &quot;I don't think
you can do that without a job...&quot; and I was like, &quot;hmmm&quot; and she goes, &quot;do you
have time?&quot; &quot;yeah.&quot; &quot;aight take this number; it may take a bit,&quot; and I took
the number and had a seat, which I continue to have now.</p>

<p>I wonder if she thought I want to extend my visa despite not having a job.  Though I would
*love* to do that, I can't imagine why she would have to go ask to confirm if that's okay.  (It's
not (though I've heard that (for several dollars under the table,) it's possible).)</p>

<p>So now I've talked to a couple of people who have told me a lot of stuff in Japanese (a lot of
which I don't understand, but can just go with the flow of really exceptional customer service in
Japan which means we don't usually have to think too much).  Now a young man who speaks a bit of
English is &quot;checking my history in Chigasaki.&quot; I wonder how much information he has
available.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>They couldn't do it at the ward office.  I went to Immigration office and they couldn't do it
there either.  The law has changed since last time I was able to just go to the office and get a
quick change from workin' to travelin' visa.  Another issue is the amount of time I have been out
of work (more than 90 days).</p>

<p>But, they had a pretty good solution: within the expiration period of my visa, bring back proof
that I'm leaving the country by 20 January (allowing me to pay for non-holiday tickets) and they can
give me a short (temporary visitor?) visa until then.</p>

<p>I'm glad Lin was able to translate a bit for me.  I feel a bit sad/embarrassed because she was
all, &quot;you gotta get on this visa thing,&quot; and I kept being like, &quot;ah it's no problem;
I can just switch like <em>bing!</em>&quot; .... but I was wrong.  gah.</p>

<p>One little panic was regarding holiday plans with Lin.  I super-hope we can still hang out.</p>

<p>we can still hang out.</p>
