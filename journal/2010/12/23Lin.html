<p>Lin has been working working working working so much recently.  I really want to be an optimal
mate for her, which at this point (now that I have my visa and can stay in Japan), seems to look
like making some money, either through JOB or business.</p>

<p>We're going to be chilling during the holidays, though; I look forward to that.</p>
