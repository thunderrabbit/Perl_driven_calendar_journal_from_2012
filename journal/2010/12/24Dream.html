<p class="dream">Mr Van was my safe zone.  I had  gone to a rich girl's house and picked her up for
a date.</p>

<p class="dream">My Dad's house was adjacent to some grouchy guy's house, who was like, &quot;grouch
grouch grouch&quot; at my dad for no good reason.  My dad just ignored him, but I decided to
befriend him just to see what would happen.  I went over to their back room and picked up his
daughter who was really rich.  She was drunk, though, because she wasn't happy, and was bored with
her life, trying to get away from all the people trying to get her money. We were in Mr Van,
chilling in a remote field; she was sleeping druunk in the front passenger seat and I was sitting in
the front dirver's seat when a cop came up and was like, &quot;you can't be here,&quot; and I was
like, &quot;actually it's okay; this is her land,&quot; and the cop was like, &quot;who?&quot; and I
showed her who was in the passenger seat and she was like, &quot;did you get her drunk?&quot;
&quot;No; she was drunk before I picked her up; I don't drink at all,&quot; and I was glad to have a
test, etc, and the cop went off to get a test and then I noticed in the trees a lot of criminals
lurking around, killing each other for the chance to get access to the money, and I yelled to the
cop, &quot;you better get back here; it's not safe!!&quot; and she ignored me, but then didn't come
back, so I jumped back into Mr Van and was safe and woke up.</p>
