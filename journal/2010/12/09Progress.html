<p>Got the first chapter of the second half of Mike's Dawn book finished.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Got drag and drop to work, have an edit plugin working, and a rotation plugin working, but now
gotta figure out how to make them work together.</p>

<p>Have abandoned the idea of using &lt;canvas&gt; to output image files.</p>

<p>Have not abandoned the idea of going to bed very very very soon.  I wish I had glasses so I could
keep programming until I just fall asleep.  I'm not going to toss these contacts until this weekend
in Nobi with Lin.</p>
