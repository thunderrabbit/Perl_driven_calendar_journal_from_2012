<p>Great fun tonight with Lin and Sachiko at Outback Steakhouse.  We laughed and barked and teased
and played; it was just so much fun.  Lin poured tons of pepper on her steak and Sachiko and I both
were like wtf?  Sachiko sent her steak back for more cooking, and Lin and I were both like, &quot;of
course you should have it the way you want it!&quot; I continued playing the talking sugar stick
game long after they both gave up and were in tears watching me play.  Such great fun fun fun!</p>

<p>I was really surprised at how relaxed Sachiko was with me and Lin barking. hahhahahaha</p>
