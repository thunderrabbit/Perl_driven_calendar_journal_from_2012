<!-- tags: paypal, sucks -->

<p>My US Paypal account has effectively stolen $200 from me; they noticed I used the account from
Thailand and want me to verify my US residency before I can move the money.  Well, I don't live in
the US anymore, and I don't want to close the account; just give me the fucking money. Grrrr.</p>
