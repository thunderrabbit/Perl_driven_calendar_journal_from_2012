<p>Found <a href="https://github.com/clearideaz/jQuery.rotate/">https://github.com/clearideaz/jQuery.rotate/</a>
and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/">http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/</a>
which seem to do similar things, but in very different ways.  I'll have to scope them both to see
which I like.</p>
