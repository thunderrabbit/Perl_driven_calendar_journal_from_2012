<p>So far today, Soness and I have mostly been cleaning the house; she went through all her clothes
and I helped vacuum seal those that she won't need during winter (although winter seems to be taking
its time to arrive (yay!!)).  I transferred 7000 yen to Charlie for a course I'll be taking in a
couple weeks, and revived my Japanese Paypal account so I can pay JB for his work on Fred's
programming project.</p>
