<p>Trains on Tokaido Line and others were suuuper late tonight.  Strangely, some trains were far
closer to on time than others; I wonder how they sort that out.   My train was 90 minutes late, the
next train was 30 minutes late, then the next train was 90 minutes late...  (measuring to 1
significant digit).  Interesting!</p>

<p>This was lucky for me because I would have missed the last train cause Lin and I were chillin' in
Kawasaki (actually we were chillin' because we had heard from Soness that the trains were late (she
was stuck in Tokyo Station (which begs the question: how did she end up there??))) and then,
&quot;oh ship!! the last train is in 7 minutes!&quot; and I would have missed it by 3 minutes, except
that it and its friends were all something like 60 minutes late.</p>
