tacked on to his friend's birthday party.  Good to see him, and also Gemma, who I randomly see
around Tokyo (and always remember her name for some reason), and chatted with David, and Don Morton,
and Sachiko (from Yoga) and Lin once she arrived.</p>

<p>Tonight was stand-up comedy night (Mad Cow's Big Night Out, a monthly event at The Pink Cow).  I
left right after Peter, whose set was after Jazz, who was after Nathan, who was after someone else I
forgot.</p>
