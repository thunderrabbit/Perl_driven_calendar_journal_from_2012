<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-profile/">django-profile</a> rules.  It's taken me a
couple of days (with huge interruptions, such as Christmas), but I got it up and running, and I've
got really thorough git repository logs to show how I did it.  I *might* just write a little thing
explaining how I got it set up.  Email me at this domain (any username will do) if you are
interested in such a tutorial.</p>
