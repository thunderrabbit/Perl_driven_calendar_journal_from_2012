<p>Got on the train going the wrong direction, so now I've missed last train.</p>

<p>Will meet Lin soon in Shibuya.</p>

<p>I'm like, &quot;um, where are we going?&quot; as we missed the exit for Kawasaki.  I thought it
would be best for her if we sleep there.  She intends to drive me to Chigasaki!!</p>

<p>Just stopped in a McDonald's for a snack to help her sleep.  French fries and tea for her.  The
rest of her french fries and strawberry shake for me.</p>

<p>Car was too cold to sleep much.</p>

<p class="date">4:00am JST Sunday  5 December 2010 (day 14865)</p>

<p>We stopped by 7/11 near Chez Soness and I bought Lin two 元気 drinks.  I so totally want her to
get home safely.  She refused to let me pay for a hotel for the night.</p>
