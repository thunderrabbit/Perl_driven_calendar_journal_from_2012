<p>Lin and I enjoyed a nice walk along the beach in Nobi with Jon and Paola.  The sun shone
brightly; Lin and I barked happily, and we all looked for shells and cute rocks, though Paola gave
all hers away, and declined to keep any offered to her.  Lin mentioned that she would like to
polish stones, and I recalled having a rock polisher back when I was like 10 years old.  Hmmmm;
could be fun!</p>

<p>Paola told us about &quot;Make my trip,&quot; which can give great prices on travel plans.</p>
