<p>wow Wow Wow!!  Soness just got me glasses, because I lost mine about a year ago on the train
headed home from work.  I still wonder why they were never turned in.  Did they turn out useful for
someone else???</p>

<p>These are a cool blue, and 25% off the labeled price, which we didn't find out until the checkout
clerk was like, &quot;hey; wait; these frames aren't that expensive!!&quot;</p>
