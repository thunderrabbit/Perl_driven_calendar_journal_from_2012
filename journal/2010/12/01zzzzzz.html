<p>Today, Soness and I went to the beach.  She ran, and I rock hopped until I stubbed my toe, then
rock hopped some more, but slowly.</p>

<p>Then, she got more bananas so I could finish making banana bread in the rice maker!!  It was
great!</p>

<p>THEN, she made dinner for us; it was great!</p>

<p>Then meditated and realized a Facebook app might be the perfect vehicle for her new web idea.  I
will try to write some sample FB apps in Python before trying the real thing.</p>
