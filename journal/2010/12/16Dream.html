<p class="dream">On the Yamanote Line headed from Shinjuku toward Shibuya, there was an expensive
train running along side us.  I looked over and saw several people dressed as clowns in that
train.  They all looked a bit bored so I waved and  some of them waved back, and I pointed at my
nose to indicate that I thought the one with her nose painted like a puppy dog was cute.  She
reacted happily and was like &quot;hey hey,&quot; patting her friends to tell them some guy thought
she was cute.</p>

<p class="dream">Both of our trains stopped in Harajuku, and they all got out.  I wondered if they
expected me to get out or if they would be waiting on the platform to wave bye when my train
passed.  I almost climbed down the ladder to get off in the same station as them, but then I
decided not to.  The ladder was pretty long, like seven rungs down to the platform. My ex girlfriend
Ami was down there and I said HI to her from the train.  Then the train started moving, but it was
going the opposite direction than it had been.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;Ami, why is the train going backwards?&quot;  and she goes,
&quot;I don't know.&quot; and I was going to pull the emergency switch to get the train driver's
attention, &quot;hey man you're going the wrong way,&quot; but I figured it would be a useless
endeavor.</p>

<p class="dream">Before I could do that, some young travelers asked me, &quot;do you think we can
go up to the third floor?&quot; and I was like, &quot;if there's no lock or rope blocking it, then
sure.&quot; and they debated going up to see what was up there.</p>

<p class="dream">By then we were cruising through some wide open country, the conductor announced &quot;The next
staition will be Chigasaki,&quot; and I was like, &quot;wowo!  how fortuitous!&quot; and then he was
like, &quot;and if you look out to the right, you'll see the King's house.  It's the traditional
looking brown one.&quot;  I thought, &quot;wow!  The King.   just like in Coming to America..&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">So I settled in for the ride to Chigasaki and I heard the long droning tones of the
song by Godspeed  you Black Emporer, and I  was like, &quot;I bet that's Matt  Troutman,&quot; and I
headed  back and it  was.  He  had a  scraggly beard  and looked  a bit  like a  hermit, but  it was
definitely Matt..  Wow.  &quot;How's it going, man??&quot;</p>
