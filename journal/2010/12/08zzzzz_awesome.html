<p>Sweet.  I've gotten some code working that allows me to drop images onto an area of my web
browser and then those images appear on the same browser window on which they were dropped.</p>

<p>The code is basically proof of concept alpha quality (where alpha is lower quality than beta),
so tomorrow I'll sketch out more carefully what needs to happen, and then beef up the code some.
I'm reallly happy about this.  I *might* actually use this to populate images on fly2.nu sites.
Maybe.  And maybe a quick way to embed pictures in my journal.  Gotta figure out a robust file
naming method.  YYYY/MM/DD/original_filename will almost certainly be okay for my journal.
Probably can even do away with the DD/</p>

<p>For Soness's project, I'll probably randomize the file names.</p>
