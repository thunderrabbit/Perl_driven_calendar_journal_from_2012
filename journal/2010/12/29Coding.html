<p>Today I've been coding a lot; I can now create new primary objects in the database with a single
click on &quot;new&quot; and it HTTP 303 refreshes to the edit screen for said object.
Perfecto!!</p>

<p>Only problem won't bite me for a while; the 7 digit random codes must be unique but aren't being
checked.  I don't know a hella quick way to check them without 5 lines of code or so.  Hmmm</p>

<p>Lin is coming over soon (yay!!) so I gotta clean up.</p>
