<p>Today after getting TJ Bike from the bicycle parking lot, I met Kana as I entered the gated area
of the apartments.  She invited me in for tea after I offered her some of the banana bread I had
made (in the rice cooker), and we chatted over tea and Aji, her cat, who's no longer quite a
kitten.</p>

<p>I enjoyed beating Aji in fights by holding him by the scruff of his neck.  How interesting to
watch him just go limp.  It's like going from Hobbes with Calvin to Hobbes near parents.  So
funny!!</p>

<p>I offered Kana a massage because I need the practice, and she readily accepted.  She's pretty flexible.</p>
