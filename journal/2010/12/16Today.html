<p>Took a bit of a nap while Soness and Tomoko were having their lesson and Yuji cooked yummy
dinner for us.  He made gyoza (I don't know a name for them in English).  yummmmmmyyy!!!</p>

<p>earlier, I took Jaime's suitcase of goodies to the local conveni to have it sent to her friend
in Meguro.  I hope it gets there.  The phone number Jaime gave me didn't seem to have a person
featuring the name of her friend.</p>

<p>Confirmed with Lin some of our holiday plans:  chill out at home.</p>
