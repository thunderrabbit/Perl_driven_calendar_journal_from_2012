<p>This entry is just to capture a moment(!) in which I'm a bit like &quot; awww man... &quot; but
will keep going, just in case it actually works as promised..</p>

<pre>
Ironic that my genius includes internet related stuff, and the people who *need* my expertise might
not be able to buy things online!  I paused the lesson at the halfway point, and took a nap on the
edge of giving up and asking for my money back.

BUT I figured I committed to going through the course, so I finished this lesson, and I'll trust the
process.
