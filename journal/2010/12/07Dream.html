<p class="dream">Guests were over and we were all chatting and having a good time.  I noticed that
two of them didn't like the free tea offered, and tha was okay; I know it wasn't that tasty
anyway.  That's why it's free!  It was served in little paper cups.  One woman put her in the trash
can, though the cup was full of liquid, and then her boyfriend, who was kindof in the printer
closet, put his cup haphazardly on the printer, tipping it sideways so it might spill.  I was lie,
&quot;don't pur that on the printer, and he was like, &quot;what?&quot; and began to pur the drink
on the printer!</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;no!  Don't pour that on the printer!&quot; and he kept doing it,
and I jumped up and pulled him out of the room, though it was too late; the entire cup had been
dumped all over the printer, and I hit him Japanese comedy style in the back of  the head (I hate
that) and pushed him toward  my parent's room door.</p>

<p class="dream">Back inside, I got a towel and cooled down a bit while cleaning up the juice.  It
didn't seem to totally destroy the printer; it was just on the outer casing, and then he came back
in  wondering why I had pushed him over there.  &quot;Hey look I'm sorry; I should n't have hit
you.  That wasn't cool, and I should never have done that.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;It's okay, I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;But I just couldn't understand w you were pouring the juice onto the
printer.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;That's a *printer*??&quot; he asked incredulously.</p>

<p class="dream">Hmm.  I guess we need to implement a little education program.</p>
