<p>Went to Pink Cow Connections for their end of year event at The Pink Cow, featuring Anthony Blick
presenting some TED videos for us.  Pretty neat to see short vids about the power of networking, the
power of a movement, etc.</p>

<p>Met some quality people, and may get some massage work out of it.  One guy had a really good
idea for how to get Chairapy going in corporate settings.  Sweet!</p>

<p>David bought Soness's dart board for 3000 yen, and Traci told me Body Works Night
is <em>tomorrow</em>, not Saturday.  Wow!</p>
