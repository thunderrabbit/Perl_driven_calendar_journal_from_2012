<p>Lin got an email she thought was a bit strange, and asked me to interpret it for her; she thought
maybe because the guy wasn't a native English speaker that she couldn't understand it properly.</p>

<p>Turns out, the message was fake; it was equivalent to the messages assuring me that I've won
$4.5,000,00.000 billion Pounds in the Quality Assurance Sweepstakes of London, England, Ltd.  But in
this case, they were specifically targeting her industry.</p>

<p>The first email looked fine &quot;we'd like to buy your product,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>So she replied and they were like, &quot;send your address to our bank at
$big_bank@hotmail.com&quot;</p>

<p>and she did, and they were like, &quot;not your email address, your mailing address; we have a
big cheque for you.&quot;</p>

<p>And she called me instead, going &quot;wtf?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at the first email while listening to her, and my alarms started ringing when she said
they asked her for her bank info.  Then I looked at the email she sent to the bank and I saw
hotmail.com.  Aha.  I was like, &quot;um, what is the bank's email address?&quot;</p>

<p>She diligently read it back to me, including the hotmail.com, but didn't notice the problem.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, and what is your email address?&quot;</p>

<p>She told me, including her company's domain name.  She still didn't notice, but I knew she was
tired after long days at work.  No need to waste her time more than these guys already had.</p>

<p>&quot;Why does a big bank have a hotmail.com address, but your company has its own domain for its
email addresses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh My God,&quot; etc etc.</p>

<p>I told her to tell her boss so the company can be made aware that this type of thing.</p>

<p>Here's the emails they sent, in case it helps anyone not get scammed:</p>
