<p>Yesterday I went to Nogata for a class led by Charle B-something.  He does healing work, NLP,
and some other things.  I didn't know about the NLP before attending the class, but...  the best
part of the class was meeting Alistair (sp) who recently went to Brazil and experienced some cool
things down there.</p>
