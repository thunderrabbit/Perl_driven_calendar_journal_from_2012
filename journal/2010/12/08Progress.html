<p>I got a droppable area on a page, and nearly got its color to change when a file hovers over
it.  For a moment, I had the .php file reacting when the image was dropped, but now I'm getting a
JSON error that the PHP file doesn't exist.   It exists.  Not sure what changed to make this error
come up.  ARgh.</p>
