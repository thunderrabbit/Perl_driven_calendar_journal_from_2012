<p>Woke up at 9am yesterday and did two loads of laundry, cleaned the kitchen, wrote WELCOME HOME
YUJI! on some paper, gave Nibbles her auxillary litter box, and headed out to meet Lin at Kawasaki
station.  Met her at noon, and we drove to Nobi beach house, arriving at 1:45pm.  Walked along the
beach a bit, though the wind was super blowy and we chose to get off the beach and climb the
mountain.  We paused for a bit to see some open area off the trail, and then headed over the ridge
to see the Godzilla statue and roller slide.</p>

<p>Though less windy, it was still pretty breezy there and we didn't stay long.  Back over the
ridge and then back to Nobi beach house, where Richard and Yuko had arrived for the party.  Despite
guests, we lay down to take a nap.</p>

<p>People collected around food outside on the grill, and Jude said, &quot;food's ready,&quot;
while walking past our room's open door.  Yum!  Headed down.</p>

<p>Met Marcellus, a really cool guy who actually lives in Zushi, which is pretty close to
Chigasaki.  *AND* he's interested in doing something rather similar to what Soness is doing with
her <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=128149483913669">Artist's Way classes</a>.  I
explained this will be her third time to lead the group so she pretty much knows what she's doing,
and he'd be awesomely welcome to join the class.</p>
