<p class="dream">With both my parents at the office where my mom had received some extra network
cables to send information, but hadnt't been able to check her cables in a while so they had gotten
backlogged behind the wall.  We were able to pull some through, but there were still more that had
to come through, so we pulled the shelves apart and I actually climbed into the ductwork on the
ground and grabbed the cables that had been sent, but couldn't go through.  Each cable was about an
inch in diamater and had three prongs sticking out so they could be inserted into her computer or
something.  I saw some people walking in the ductwork, like walking down the hall and I knew that
was their job to deliver the calbes and that I wasn't supposd to be in there.  He didn't see me so I
didn't get into trouble.</p>

<p class="dream">But I was late getting out of there; I had ten minutes to get to the plane and ran
downstairs and through the security area and then through the mall where they want us to shop and I
didn't see signs for my gate, but then I looked outside the airport and saw the other terminal and
assumed my gate must be there and I walked through the mall to it and saw some people boarding and
found that it was my flight. I and I saw a plane with a propellor that had all its blades pointing
forward for easy storage, but they would be tilted outward for flight.  That was cool, but I didn't
have time to watch it in action.</p>


<p class="dream">I arrived back in Thailand and saw I was roommates with Shawn so that was cool, and
read the note he had written on the door something like, &quot;the rabbit is back and there's going
to be a fun pool party&quot; and then we were at a party where a girl was told by her boyfriend or
someone that she should 'go crazy' and do some drugs or join a circus and so she was learning
massage and then people encouraged her to try some pot.  She did and I was watching from across the
trable, but didn't join them.  &quot;no thanks.  I don't smoke.&quot;</p>
