<p>Lin came by after her company's end of year party and she drove me to Yokohama.  I told her about
my plans for making money online, and she told about her friend's experience losing a lot of money
to some scammers who assured him he had inherited big bucks from a dead relative.  Wow.</p>

<p>We hung out in her car for a bit and now I'm on the train headed home.</p>
