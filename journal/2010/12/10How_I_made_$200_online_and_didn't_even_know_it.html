<p>True story!</p>

<p>Soness was like, &quot;we should listen to this webinar about how to make money online!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You want to listen to it with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ま。 sure!&quot;</p>

<p>And, though I had stayed up until 6am the previous morning, I woke up when she started rustling
around downstairs.  Started taking some notes.  Same ol' blah blah blah about the Internet
Phenomenon and really guys it works; you can make $M0,000 in a few months, etc.</p>

<p>As a kinda gimmick, one guy was all, &quot;I'll make one now while you talk,&quot; and the other
guy talked, wasting 40 minutes of my time about success stories, etc, etc, etc, and then the first
guy was like, &quot;aight; done!&quot;</p>

<p>And he had made a page pimping some pimple medication on hubpages.com, so I made
an <a href="http://hubpages.com/profile/thunderrabbit">hubpages.com</a> account as well.</p>

<p>They basically let anyone write about anything &quot;nice&quot; and put ads next to the
articles.  I knew I had signed up for a Google Adwords account already, so that was the first
affiliate account I tried to connect.</p>

										     alt="18,158
										     yen, on hold" class="left" /></a>When I did, I saw an amazing thing.</p>

<p>Wow!!  I did a little happy dance.  18,158 yen are chillin' in Google's account, waiting for me
to tell Google my bank info!  Wow!  Wow!  Wow!!</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;holy snappers!!!&quot; and equally enthusiastically, &quot;wtf did it come
from ????&quot;</p>

<p>I click click clicked a bit, and found the source: YouTube.  Back in March, I had agreed with
YouTube's suggestion that I allow them to put ads on my popular videos.  Sure; it can't hurt, can
it?</p>

<p>It didn't hurt at all.  It hurt so little that I forgot all about it.</p>

<p>Google didn't forget, and click by click, 20 yen at a time, 1000 yen on good days... boom:
$200.</p>

<p>SO, I found the least popular of my videos, and wrote a hubpage for
it: <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/thunder-dolphin-roller-coaster-at-Tokyo-Dome-City">video while
riding Thunder Dolphin roller coaster at Tokyo Dome City</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe anyone can do this!</p>
