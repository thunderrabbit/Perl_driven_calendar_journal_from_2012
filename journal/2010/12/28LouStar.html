<p>Went to see Loustar last night at The Pink Cow.  She gave it her best, and everyone on the dance
floor loved it.  And we were all barefoot, dancing on the wall!!  I got to chill in our faux
backstage with Loustar and Angie, while Leslie and I shared a Pink Cow burrito.  Yummy yummy!!  I
look forward to Loustar's world tour!  Awesome.</p>
