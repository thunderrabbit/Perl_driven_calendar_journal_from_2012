<p>The Truth is a chapter in Mike's new book.  I've had the distinct priveledge of reading his
first draft, offering critiques, kudos, and some downright ovations for his incredible story
writing skillz.</p>

<p>The awesome feeling is of being inside his world, a city of a broken population, featuring a
variety of species and castes, where everything comes to life with his percolating imagery and
emotionally driven dialogue... and being able to adjust the reality when I see something amiss.</p>

<p>I've got my version of his world in my head, and I can shove things around like in a lucid
dream.  What incredible power!</p>
