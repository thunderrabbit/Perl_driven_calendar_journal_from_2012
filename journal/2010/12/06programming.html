<p>I abandoned further use of the rotatester I put on github, and am now using one on my web server
at ~/git/.  I would put the filename, too, but it doesn't end with a dot so either the resulting
sentence or the filename would be incorrect, whereas ending a sentence with a directory, and a dot,
is fine.</p>

<p>As of now, I got the slider to rotate an image, but it's hard coded to that image.  Need to make
it attach to any image I want.</p>
