<p>Just hung out with David from (no-longer-meeting) I-group in Ebisu for a couple hours after his
10 day vipassana meditation.  Congratulations to him; he seems to have gotten more out of it than I
did.  (vipassana, not today's meeting)</p>

<p>He's going back to N'aleans for a month to see if he wants to stay.</p>
