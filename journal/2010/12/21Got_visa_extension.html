<p>Last night I called Sur at Number 1 Travel (033-2056-073) and he got a 27,000 yen ticket
(inc. tax) for me to fly to Korea on 17 January 2011.  This morning I brought that info to the
immigration office and they granted me a visa extension because I had the flight info (though I
haven't actually *paid* for it, the itenerary was good enough proof).</p>

<p>I asked them if I still have to go to Korea even if I find a job before the visa expires, and
they basically said, &quot;it's uncertain,&quot; which I take to mean I'll be going no matter
what.</p>

<p>When I come back from Korea, my American passport will grant me 90 days temporary visitor
status.</p>

<p>What I didn't ask: how many times I can do visa runs to get 90 day extensions.</p>

<p>I plan to bring some Korean yummies to the immigration office peeps.</p>
