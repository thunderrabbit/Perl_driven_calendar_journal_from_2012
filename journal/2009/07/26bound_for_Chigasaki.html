<p>Currently seated on Tokaido Line as we're stopped briefly in Kawasaki station, I'm headin' home
to Chigasaki from Tokyo Station, this line's central terminal.</p>

<p>I think I errored a bit by getting on the local train; I coulda taken the &quot;ACTY&quot;
express and arrive 5 minutes sooner than I will on this train.  I could switch, but I'd almost
certainly lose my opportunity to sit, and I wouldn't have as much time to write / sleep.</p>
