Just found this crazy website that will convert chat convos into movies  with animated characters speaking the text  It's nuts! 

do dizawg.  dat shiite be crazy hahahaha.  that's hilarious 

I know dog!  so I was lookin' for someone to be all WASSAPP wit on chat an shit 

hey... do you remember my friend John Strolien in houston? 

not sure  I prolly never knew his last name 

remember.... he was a really nice white guy from river oaks and he used to try an copy us saying "dawg"  and it just never worked for him 

hahahahaha yes!!! 

always sounded funny  he was a really really nice guy though 

yo, um dog. 

yes!  with an inflection at the end 

yes!  I totally remember 

which made it come out like "yo, um dog?" 

we went to his new years party right? 

yeah.  I think so 

that's when someone bumped someone's car; I can't remember who 

some party over at his dads 

but Nurse Fokker had to bust out quick cause he had tickets outstanding hahahahahaa 

hahahahaha  Nurse Fokker  lol 

So wazzap wit you recently, um dog? I just had a premium day barefoot at the beach; the sand was broiling, but still a good time.  I went rock hoppin' on tetrapods that they've got placed along the coast. 

sorry phone call 

is coo 

btw....  I meant to tell you...  I am still on the untramarathon email list 

ultra?  untra? 

and there are now a couple guys that do ultras barefooted 

contramarathon?  wow! that's dopeness 

fo sho 

how many be doin dat? and how long is an ultra?  I can't imagine it.  I sorta can, but not really... 

there is only a few guys doing it  there is like 3eople on the ultra list  and I'd say like less than 5 guys run barefoot and ultra is anything longer than 26.2 miles 

ah  well, it's still quite awesome 

but most are 50k, or 50 miles, or 1or 1les 

I was just going to say "well I won't say it's awesome, cause it's not 1les" but you negated that shit quick; it's amazing!!!! 

lol  ultras are totally awesome  you'd love the ultra community  everyone is totally cool  laid back  noncompetitive  encouraging its all about each person's own personal journey 

ah cool  that  that's really neat 

yeah....  the best guy in the world at ultras is a guy names Scot Jurek  he is the "lance armstrong" of ultras 

I see 

has won the most prestegious event 7x in a row 

wooooo 

and I was talking to him at one race  and we were congratulating him on running 50 miles in like 5 hrs or something... or something like that  so he was even finding a way to compliment people who were running twice as slow as he was 

wow  that's really cool  implying it's "easier" for him cause he's faster hahahha 

yeah.... the ultra community is a very unique group lol.  exactly 

aight I gotta bust to bed
