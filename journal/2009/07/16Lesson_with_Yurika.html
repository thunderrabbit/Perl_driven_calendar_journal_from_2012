<p>Haven't seen Yurika in over a month; as she's quite pretty, and I've been quite single, I gazed
at her face for part of the time that she gazed at her paper, trying to find the mistakes within the
lines I had marked for her.</p>

<p>As always, she did great homework, and the hour lesson went quite quickly.</p>
