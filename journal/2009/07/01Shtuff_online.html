<p>Today, I installed CB (Community Builder) on my Joomla! installation.  Not quite finished all the
steps yet.</p>

<p>Chatted with kT (great!); Skyped with Sonja (interesting, JMW); talked to Soness (cute, sleepy)
and told her a bedtime story about a raindrop that cried when asked not to rain and then the sun
was foiled by eclipse when trying to dry up the water.</p>

<p>Contacted my CC company to see why I can't make a new Shopsafe number for MBNA.  Got things
sorted.  Got things ordered. (KTs from Clairvision)</p>
