<p>Not sure how many men will come tonight.  David said he's IN, but I don't know about Takeshi or
Michael.</p>

<p class="date">9:05am JST Tuesday 14 July 2009 (day 14356)</p>

<p>Three men in I-group: me, David, Takeshi.  I told them I was worried about frittering through
the money I have now without getting a proper job.  Suddenly realized I don't have to get an
apartment before I look for work, so I can look for work while living here.  First task is to send
my resume to Michael's friend for editing purposes.</p>

<p>Then get my suits dry cleaned, but one thing at a time.  Okay, maybe two.</p>
