<p>Yesterday (Sunday 12 July) Chris + Holly, Sorcha, Soness, and I went to the beach, where Soness
found ECOCH, which stands for Eco Chigaskai, which stands for Ecological Chigasaki, who were holding
a pre-party to their beach cleanup on 15 July.</p>

<p>We hulahooped with ECOCH peeps; I barefootedly rock hopped alone while the rest of my group
played in the waves; Chris and Holly headed back while Sorcha Soness and I stayed for foodage.</p>

<p>Soness was essentially all, &quot;MaaAAaachiii&quot; after I traded digits with Machi, but I was
like, 'whatevs' cause I'm doing quite well single, and have no interest in dating at the moment.  I
got her number to invite her to see Soness at The Pink Cow in Shibuya on Wednesday, and maybe get
some Cow-Go lessons.</p>
