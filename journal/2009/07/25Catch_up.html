<p>I've thoroughly been slacking writing for a while.  Here's the latest:</p>

<p>I made the 6:36am train toward Tokyo station to meet Jon &quot;What's missing here&quot; at 8am
at Korakuen station to attend Kevin's shamanism workshop from 9:30am.  Yay!  Definitely looking
forward to seeing both Jon and Kevin.  They've never met; I'm interested in hearing their
conversations.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I slapped some lunch together while wondering where I left my slacks (last wore
them at Duets: Seasons of Love, on the 22nd), and pouring a bunch of sugar and ants down the toilet
to get them out of the pantry.  Sigh.  Need to get some ant-proof containers; the plastic clippies
just weren't cuttin' the sweet sweet sugary goodness from the ants' olfactory glands (?).</p>

<p>Last night, while getting to bed around midnight after watching the first 10 minutes of
<a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/2772533">Dark Mission - The Secret History of NASA (2008)</a>,
I remembered to put some brown rice ('genmai') in the rice cooker for my consumption today.</p>

<p>There's a bunch of dishes in the kitchen sink, though they are basically rinsed.</p>

<li><p>I've been thinking about making a way for me to write journal entries with my iPhone.  I
used to have a way I could just email a certain address and have it parse the content and post
journal entries that way.  It was only obscure-secure, so I now just use scp with ssh keys.</p></li>

<li><p>Sabina wrote a description of a photon detector which I placed a kilometer underground in
the <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">Castle of Dreams</a>.  Still slowly inviting people
to join and write descriptions of rooms.  Haven't gotten much responsed from original Castle of
Dreams members (Guenivere, Red Fern, Scout Seven, Nim), but I think they've all seen it (maybe Scout
Seven has not).</p></li>

<li><p>I've embarked on an adventure in abstinence.  Haven't had sex since May (thanks to Ami for
remembering the month), and haven't had an orgasm since early June, via 4chan/hc online.  I'm
planning to continue the non-orgasmic lifestyle through August at least.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently had a job interview and will work starting in August, so that should help me stay
distracted from the internets.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to give 100,000 yen to Mark for use in FOREX.  Maybe a bit more, but probably not
less.</p></li>

<li><p>Been helping Traci with Cow-Go, and have therefore cancelled my plan to go to OZ in August
for Avatar with Soness and seeing Sally in Adelaide.</p>

<p>Traci's great idea of having a checklist per student has really helped me get a grasp on who has
done how much of the registration process.</p>

<p>I seem to have lost the receipt book, which is a bummer ecologically, though there were only like 4
receipts used so it's not such a huge loss logistically.</p></li>

<li><p>Have enjoyed talking to Moonie at The Pink Cow recently; she's a pretty cool person.  Daisha,
another cool person, was there last night for her new event ¥Ì¥Ì (nu-nu), where she presents new
music just to get a sense of audience reaction.  She showed me a cool $600 device+records+software
that allows a DJ to scratch mp3s using a real turntable.  Basically the device listens to the
turntable output for its standardized record being scratched, and through USB tells the software how
to play the current mp3.</p></li>
