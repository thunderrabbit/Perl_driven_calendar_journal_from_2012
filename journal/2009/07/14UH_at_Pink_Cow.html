<p>Wow!  At The Pink Cow, I sat down with Fie (sp), who usually sits in the smokey bar area, but he
was with his mate Hiten, a man who lived in Taub Hall 2nd floor during the same years I was lurking
around Taub Hall 3rd floor at UH!</p>

<p>We both know John Covey and Angelique Jamal, and he's heard the name Kniery; wow practically
neighbors!  And now we're BFF (Barely Facebook Friends) hahahah!</p>

<p>Hiten was with his girl Eva, from Czechoslovakia; she and Fie chatted while Hiten and I recalled
the good ol' days.</p>
