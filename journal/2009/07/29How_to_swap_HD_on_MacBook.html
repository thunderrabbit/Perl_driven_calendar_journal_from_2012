<p>I've just recently purchased a Lacie external 1TB and a Seagate 500 GB internal drive to replace
my existing 70GB internal drive. </p>

<p>I've got OS X Leopard (10.5.7) and figure I might as well use Time Machine instead of SuperDuper
or CarbonCopyCloner.</p>

<p>Now, the thing is, Time Machine requires having the Leopard DVD handy for the restore process,
which apparently SuperDuper and CCC don't require.</p>

<p>I've done a modicum of research
(<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=time+machine+bootable">time machine bootable</a>
and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=time+machine+new+internal+drive">time machine new
internal drive</a>), and came up with the following steps that I'm  implementing now:</p>

<p>(I got all my hardware at Ω©Õ’¥€ (Akibakan) in Akihabara, the electronics paradise in Tokyo)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find your Leopard DVD install disk</p></li>

<li><p>Buy an external backup drive.  I got a Lacie d2 quadra 1 TB for 20,400 yen</p></li>

<li><p>Buy an internal drive.  I got a Seagate 500 GB 5400 RPM drive for 9,990 yen</p></li>

<li><p>Buy Torx screwdriver set.  Online I heard we need size 8, but the guy at the shop said size
9.  I got both in a handy screwdriver handle with various tips inside.</p></li>

<li><p>Open and plug in the external drive.  Your instructions may vary depending on the brand you
got, which is a good thing because I'm about to wing it.</p></li>

<li><p>Format the drive according to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1550">apple
support</a>.  I've got an intel based mac so I'll be using GUID</p></li>

<li><p>Make the backup drive bootable
by <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2008011623365026">restoring Leopard DVD to
the drive</a></p></li>

<li><p>Restart the machine and press Alt during bootup to choose the DVD copied to your external
drive.  Make sure you can boot from that drive.</p></li>

<li><p>If not, stop reading this and seek professional support.</p></li>

<li><p>If so, do not install OS X!  Choose your preferred language and then quit, either with Alt-Q, or from the top menu Mac OS X Installer -&gt; Quit Mac OS X Installer.  Reboot from original internal drive.</p></li>

<li><p>run Time Machine and backup the existing internal drive</p></li>

<li><p>Shut down your machine and remove the internal drive (subset of instructions
from <a href="http://www.macinstruct.com/node/130">How to upgrade your MacBook's Hard Drive</a>
by <a href="http://www.macinstruct.com/">MacInstruct</a>)</p></li>

<li><p><del>See if you can boot from Time Machine backup</del></p></li>

<li><p><del>If not, shut down the machine and put your old internal drive back in and seek professional support.</del></p></li>

<li><p><del>If so, shut down the machine and</del> insert the new internal drive and hope the rest of this continues to work.</p></li>

<li><p>Boot again from Time Machine backup.</p></li>

<li><p>Follow instructions
from <a href="http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2008/01/restoring-from-time-machine.html">Restoring
from Time Machine</a> by James Duncan Davidson</p></li>

<li><p>Boot from new drive.  Hooray!</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="date">10:25pm JST Wednesday 29 July 2009 (day 14371)</p>

<p>Okay, so the above is my plan.  Here's how it all went down:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Found my Leopard DVD install.  It was in the shed in a box labeled old electronic stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>Bought an external backup drive.  I got a Lacie d2 quadra 1 TB for 20,400 yen</p></li>

<li><p>Bought an internal drive.  I got a Seagate 500 GB 5400 RPM drive for 9,990 yen</p></li>

<li><p>Bought Torx screwdriver set.  Online I heard we need size 8, but the guy at the shop said size
9.  I got both in a handy screwdriver handle with various tips inside.</p></li>

<li><p>10:27pm so far so good!  I'm following the Lacie instructions and going through the whole
setup process, formatting the drive as a 1000 GB single partition.</p></li>

<li><p>Bonus!  OS X detected the drive and asked if I want to use Time Machine to do backups.  I
have actually cancelled that to make sure the drive is formatted GUID</p>

<p>First, I moved to my internal HD the docs and utils from the Lacie installation.  I deleted all
the non Mac and non English stuff.</p>

<p>Now running /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app and formatted the drive according to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1550">apple
support</a>.  I've got an intel based mac so I used GUID, and formatted it as Mac OS X Extended
(Case-sensitive, Journaled)</p>

<p>moved from the internal HD the docs and utils <em>back</em> to the Lacie drive</p></li>

<li><p>Made the backup drive bootable
by <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2008011623365026">restoring Leopard DVD to
the drive</a>:</p>

<p>insert Leopard DVD</p>

<p>Do not close the window that pops up</p>

<p>Click Restore tab in Disk Utility</p>

<p>drag Mac OS X Install DVD to Source</p>

<p>drag LaCie (or whatever you called your formatted drive) to Destination</p>

<p>click okay or start or something (I forgot what)</p>

<p>wait 33 minutes.</p>
</li>


<li><p>Okay, this is where things start to get spooky, but we still should be okay for now.  I'm going
to shut down my machine (after uploading this file) and try to boot from the external drive.</p>

<p>It worked!  I chose English and then quit.  Rebooted from original internal drive.</p></li>

<li><p>Now time to turn on Time Machine and backup the existing internal drive.</p>

<p>System Preferences -&gt; Time Machine -&gt; ON</p>

<p>In the top menu bar you can click a little icon to start the backup immediately.  Mine failed at first, but then I reselected the backup drive.  Now my backup is progressing.</p>

<p>12:30am now as I start the backup.  See ya tomorrow, computer, to continue this fun!</p>
</li>

<li><p>Good morning; it's 8:12am and I have hourly backups going back to 2:29am, so the original backup took 2 hours.</p>

<p>Now shutting down my machine to replace the internal drive.</p>
</li>

<li><p>9:47am, and now back up with my new drive, and my system is so much faster!  Whoohooo!!</p>

<p>Be sure to run Disk Utility first to create the partition on the new drive.</p>

<p>Then Restore from Backup, and it works like magic.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Er, make that not like magic.  Seems that I can't open Firefox or Flock now.  Hmmmm.  Spotlight is
indexing things, but that shouldn't affect it...  I stopped Time Machine's most recent backup; it
was 500GB complete in backing up 50GB.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Well, Safari works, so I'm going to dl FF and Flock.</p>

<p>downloading didn't help.  But super thanks to Sha for this fix: <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=1279415&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a">Firefox fails after restoring via Time Machine</a>!</p>
