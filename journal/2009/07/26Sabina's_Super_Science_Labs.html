<p>Sweet!  It appears that Sabina has modified the text of Sabina's Super Science Labs
in <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">The Castle of Dreams</a>!!  I'm really glad to see
that.  I knew she wrote a description of a photon detector (which I installed); I, er, the Castle
Workers, need to get working on &lt;navigation/&gt; tags for the room!</p>
