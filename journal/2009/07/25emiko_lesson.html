<p>Yesterday I had a lesson with Emiko (which started exactly 24 hours ago cause she was a bit late)
at Motoya cafe in Bunkyodo bookstore.  When I walked in, a girl smiled at me from a nearby table and
I think commented to her two friends (male and female) about me.  Hmm.  I made eye contact with her
a couple times before and during the lesson, and then we waved bye to each other as Emiko and I
walked out at 9:05pm.  I considered greeting her with my card, but figured if she were interested
she had tons of time to say HI to me first, and I don't need to be chatting up young females anyway,
and... perhaps I'll see her next week.  90% guarantee I'll never see her again, but there's a bit of
fantasy in my brain; maybe she goes there each Saturday night, etc etc.</p>

<p>Lesson with Emiko was fine though she left her homework at home.  We flipped through Metropolis
Magazine some and she summarized different articles she had read.</p>
