<p>Right now I'm on the ホームライナー小田原２５号, which I would translate as &quot;Homeliner
Odawara #25&quot; which cost an extra 500 yen, but guarantees a seat and his supa-faster than
normal. 44 minutes instead of 52ish.  Whoosh!</p>

<p>Sitting next to a girl who I asked how to pronounce 号 （ごう）so I could transcribe it from my
ticket.</p>
