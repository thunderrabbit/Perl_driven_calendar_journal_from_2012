<p>Tatu is a strange young lad; he doesn't have a Facebook account.  Hmmmmm, <em>very
interesting</em> ....</p>

<p>Hahaha he's sitting beside me on the train (as we head from Chigasaki to Shibuya by way of
Kawasaki where I'm gonna pick up some anti-fungal juice from a clinic (pesky athlete's toe)) and
said of Emacs, &quot;ah Emacs: it's a good operating system but lacks a decent text
editor.&quot;</p>

<p>HAHAhahahahahaha</p>

<p>Hey waitaminute!  That begs a very important question:</p>

<p>&quot;Do you use vi?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; for unix I'm usually using nano or pico..&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmm; that shut me up quickly; I've never used either of those.</p>

<p>Oh if only Soness could hear us talking now.  (( &quot;Do you boys talk about anything when I'm
gone?&quot; ))</p>
