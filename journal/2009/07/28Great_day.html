<p>Today started out a bit slow, but that was okay cause it started quite early, as I fell asleep
watching _The History of Maths (part 2 of 4)_ last night around midnight or so.  Woke up with fuzzy
teeth around 5:am or so, fixed the teeth, then played a hella lot of Mafia on Facebook.  Good job to
FB for being worth zillions.</p>

<p>I finally got some impetus to do things in the physical world, and got the following done:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>sent some money to David cause he's between jobs and had several surprise dollars removed
from his available cash from last paycheck taxes (-$2000) and moving costs (all the BS fees when
moving in Japan are ridiculous: deposit, key money, kiss-butt money, guarantor payment,
etc).  Anyway, yeah, I sent him some cash, and felt good about it cause it felt good.</p></li>

<li><p>sent £²£°Ëü±ß to Mark, who will trade it for me on FOREX.</p></li>

<li><p>bought new shorts (as I wore two pairs: the ones with a ripped-through pocket inside the ones
with rip in the butt)</p></li>

<li><p>mailed a power of attorney to Mark</p></li>

<li><p>mailed a letter (written on expandable illegifying wrapping paper) to Fred</p></li>

<li><p>forgot to get 500 yen expacks to send paintings to Mike and Mike</p></li>

<li><p>Had a lesson with Gen at 6:50pm, before which I went to The Apple Store in Shibuya to be like,
&quot;yo my iPhone earphones broke&quot; and they took my info and replaced them immediately.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While at The Apple Store, I got an email from Soness and was able to Skype with her!  So great to
hear from her; Soness is fast becoming my best friend (if not there already); I really really like
that girl.  She's doing super-well in Bali, and told me about a great palm reading she had today,
and I told her about the great book I've been reading.</p>

<p>I've been reading a great book called &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; by Dr. Robert A. Glover,
which was loaned to me by David last night, specifically after I had expressed concern about
breaking my commitment to myself to not orgasm until September.  He said &quot;I think there's no
such thing as coincidence; I was just reading this section today,&quot; and quoted from the book:</p>

<pre>
* Until a Nice Guy can be sexual with himself without shame, 
  he won't be able to be sexual with another person without shame.

* until a Nice Guy is comfortable giving pleasure to himself, 
  he won't be able to receive pleasure from someone else.

* Until a Nice Guy can take responsibility for his own arousal
  and pleasure when he is by himself, he won't be able to take 
  responsibility for his own arousal when he is with someone else.

* Until a Nice Guy can be sexual with himself without using 
  pornography or fantasy to distract himself, he won't be able to 
  have sex with someone else without needing similar things to distract him.
</pre>

<p>hmmm.  That last one sounds amazing to the current version of me, but I believe I can adjust my
brain cells to not need such distractions.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've just started the book and am really finding it jives with me a lot, and explains how
many men (in the US, in particular) including me, grow up needing approval from outside, especially
Mommy.</p>

<p>After my lesson with Gen, I headed back to Shibuya, and back to Apple Store and
read <a href="http://www.macinstruct.com/node/130">How to Upgrade Your MacBook's Hard Drive</a>,
cause that's what I want to do.</p>

<p>Asked a guy about getting a good price on an external drive, and he suggested ½©ÈÕ (sp), a shop
in Akihabara.  Actually, that was his net suggestion for external, internal, and torx driver.  Fair
enough.  I'm looking to get a 1TB external Lacie drive (without RAID or anything) (Apple Store price
= 28,000 yen ($280)), and not sure what internal drive I can get for around $200 now.</p>

<p>Asked him if Time Machine could be used to make bootable backups; he deferred the question to the
lovely and talented Sumiyo who remembered my name (cause it had showed up on their log from when I
turned in my borked earphones), and that we had chatted last year or so over some MacBook question,
and then over drinks at The Pink Cow (though the latter wasn't mentioned).</p>
