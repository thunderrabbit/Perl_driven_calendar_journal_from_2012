<p>Jon and I played in a park near Tokyo Dome City after helping/watching Kevin and Yuki pack all
their gear to get out of Suwaen, where we had our course.  I found myself unable to do back hip
circles on the low bar, nor get myself up onto the high bar (*), but I was able to swing by my arms
a good deal, and hung upside down by one leg and one arm from the high bar, and jumped out of the
actual swing.</p>

<p>(*) part of the problem was having nothing but rocks below the thing, and not having grips for
my hands.</p>

<p>I used both swings to have a wide enough surface (my hips were too wide for these
kiddie swings, but went a bit too wide and ripped a big hole in the arse of my shorts.  dang.</p>

<p>Jon offered some of his shorts to me; they were too tight so I declined; I felt sure I'd rip
them as well if I sat down.</p>

<p>We headed off to find another park, but it turned out to be closed.  Closed my eyes near exit 4b
outside Korakuen station while Jon finished a large circuit around Tokyo Dome (he had gone on a
scouting mission and called me when he discovered the park was shut for the evening) and when he
arrived back, we said &quot;aight laters,&quot; and went our separate ways.</p>
