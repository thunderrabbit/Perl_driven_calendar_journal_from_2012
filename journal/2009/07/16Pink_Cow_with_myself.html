<p>AFter lesson with Yurika, I went to The Pink Cow, where I got some great news from Traci, who met
Jared yesterday (I encouraged him to visit her, so I should get the finders fee); they are going to
meet up on Sunday to talk about some ideas they've got in terms of restauranting.  Awesome!</p>

<p>I heard some delicious sounding ideas; I look forward to their success!</p>
