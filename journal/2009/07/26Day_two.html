<p>On the train headed to the second day of my first shamanism course.  Plenty of seats on the
train (there were none available yesterday), so I'm going to snoooze so I can be awake for the course.</p>

<p>Had a good time with Day 2: we were allowed to zoom around with our power animals in the middle
world (earth, etc) (I slept), look for ailments in a partner (Mark and I both found each other to
be relatively healthy), and other stuff.</p>
