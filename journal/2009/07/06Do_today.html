<p>Today before meeting with Soness for a bit to chat and give her her gym bag, before going to
lunch with Andrew and pay him back 20,000 yen that was for my last week rent at Sakura House, I need
to put the surfboards away and write to Michael about possibly crashing at his place for a bit.  Oh
and write to Christine about her bank info so I can pay her for Avatar course.</p>

<p>Okay.  I've emailed Christine, and put the surfboards away.  Now putting my blanket and futon
away and head to Shibs for gym bag to Soness and lunch with Andrew.</p>

<p>But first, showertime!</p>
