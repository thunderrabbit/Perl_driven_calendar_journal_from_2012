<p>Hmmm, but perhaps the most trickiest thing yesterday has been the handling of my desire to run
away from responsibility under the guise of not knowing what I want to do (it seems quite a
convincing reality), and not wanting to choose where to do it.</p>

<p>I knew in my gut that Traci would be mad if I got run off to Australia for 3 weeks in the middle
of us trying to get Cow-Go going, but I figured I just gotta be me and gotta do what I gotta do.</p>

<p>Traci wrote me a lovely email starting with</p>

Hi Rob,

You did not tell me you would be gone so much this year.  I don't think I 
would have put in all this work, thinking I would have someone to take it 
over if I had known that.

<p>I told Soness (she could tell something was wrong, but I didn't want to interrupt her being mad
at me about surfboards to cry about getting fired from Cow-Go, anyway) when she was like,
&quot;what are you thinking?&quot; and I go &quot;I got fired from Cow-Go&quot; and she said,
&quot;let's talk&quot; and we talked and she was like, &quot;you're continually running away from
responsibility,&quot; and &quot;you can choose to be the man you want to be.&quot; etc etc</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So that was all last night, in the middle of having give peeps over for couch surfing purposes.
I'm writing this (and the above) the next morning, after having meditated.</p>

<p>I hate to cancel seeing Sally in OZ <em>again</em>, but I think I should cancel the trip to do
Avatar (which will just spread my energy out further), suck up the loss of $600 for plane tix (need
to pay Soness back; I'll ask her to cancel them, perhaps via her credit card company; I'd way
rather pay her 600 than pay them 600 for nothin')</p>

<p>I'm going to email Traci now, something like this:</p>

HI Traci

I don't know if you've replied to me since I wrote that last night.

I want to chalk it up to a temporary lapse of judgement on my part.  I
will cancel the trip to Australia; I need to keep myself focused and
not always run away from responsibility and such.

I know I've told you several times that I don't know if I can do this.
I believe I *can* do this (support you by getting Cow-Go started) but
I may need some training wheels to help me get started.

After talking to Murphy, I understand there is a master list of
students that Nao has.  I'm going to email Nao about getting access to
that list so it can serve as the official list.

The only thing I need from you right now is to know if you're willing
to forgive me, take me back, let me keep working on Cow-Go with you.
I understand you're running a business, so if you don't have time to 
waste on me I will respectfully duck out and just be your friend and 
masseuse as needed.

  With Love
    - Rob
