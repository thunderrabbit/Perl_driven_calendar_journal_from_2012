<p>I'm already finished at the clinic (I was scheduled for 1:30pm, but caught the doctor at just
the right moment); I was shown then signed the new informed consent form (minus one sub-investigator's
name), showed my athlete's toe had healed, then got 15,000 yen for my time and am back in the taxi
headed back.  Will easily make the 1:30 flight.</p>

<p>Now it's not quite as certain that I'll make the 1:30 flight, but I did enjoy gelato at まな's
shop, where 大人さん took me last time I was on an Ice Cream Quest here in Tenmonkan.  I got the
12:20pm airport limosuine (bus with reclining seats) so I hope to still make the flight.</p>

<p>I missed the 1:30pm flight, by just a few minutes, by my reconing, (ten minutes?) and got some
food while waiting till the 3:50pm flight.  Now I'm on the Keikyu Line train in Haneda airport,
bound for 品川 and from there 秋葉原 where I'll be in computer nerd paradise and get a 1TB external
drive for hopefully less than 28,000 yen, and a new internal drive for my MacBook, and a Torx 8
driver to do the hardware swap.  Kinda sucks about getting the driver; I won't likely need to use
... hey I wonder if Andrew has such drivers!</p>
