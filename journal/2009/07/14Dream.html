<p class="dream">Walking on a lake (walking _on_ water) with my dad, I thought, 'hey this isn't so
difficult,' and then went bloosh into the lake up to my chest.  Kept slowly walking, hoping the logs
and stuff I felt under me were not alligator houses nor otherwise dangerous, until I slowly made it
out of the lake.  My dad was still there and had made it out of the lake, never falling in.  He
said, &quot;I know you'll think I'm crazy, but it's going to be easier to go all the way back than
to try to get out of the lake right here,&quot; but I saw a platform thing that I could use; it was
like climbing up the inside of a train tressel.  My dad was ahead of me and I told him,
&quot;there's a step right by your foot that you can use,&quot; and he intentionally broke it off
and put it on his sandwich.  I yelled at him, &quot;that was a STEP, NOT FOR YOUR SANDWICH!!&quot;
and used the equivalent step on the other side of this central column.</p>

<p class="dream">There was a guy fishing from on top of the tressel, but we didn't really talk to
him.</p>

<p class="dream">While walking the rest of the way along the road, I pulled out two hairs from my
head, one of which was striped like a zebra with three colors.  A guy came up behind me all
&quot;boo!&quot; or trying to scare me, and I was like, &quot;yeah it's pretty hard to scare me.  I
can be standing on the edge of a the lake and you push me and I won't get scared.&quot;  He
mockingly tried to push me into the lake, but didn't actually try to scare me more. On closer
examination, the hair turned out to have white bumps on it that I thought were either dandruff
or... ew gross they must have come from the lake; they were little parasites.  Good thing we're
heading to the doctor by way of the lake so we can go to the doctor after going through the
lake.</p>

<p class="dream">Some people on the road were promoting a festival, and a woman with a tall ice
cream cone was like, &quot;would you like to come to our delicious festival?&quot; and I jokingly
go, &quot;hey your ice cream is about to fall; you should give it to me,&quot; and she whipped
around, &quot;where?&quot; and the top ball of ice cream flew off and I caught it.  I was like,
&quot;thank you!&quot; and ate the entire scoop.</p>
