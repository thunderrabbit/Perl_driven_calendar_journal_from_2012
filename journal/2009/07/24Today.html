<p>On train to shibs now. It's been a rainy day today so no beach for me, but I paid 20,000 yen to get
my resume professionally edited, and withdrew 30,000 yen to buy two NIN tickets (at Summersonic),
plus got top score in Wavy Blue Lines, the set of Reflexion levels I made.</p>

<p>Last night I missed my train by two minutes and therefore slept in an Internet cafe... Mighta slept
outside but for the rain and need to take out my contacts.</p>

<p>Have been playing Mafia on FB.</p>

<p>Oh, also today I worked on the garden at Chez Soness. Extracted some plants, planted some plants,
did a rain dance, washed my pants, took a chance and ate some ants.</p>

<p>Actually just the first two.</p>
