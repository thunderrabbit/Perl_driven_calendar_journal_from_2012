<p>Soness isn't on the train that she thought she might be taking home.  I got to spend some time
walkin' around; here's how it all went down:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>earlier today, she said she'd take the 9:15pm train home (*)</p></li>

<li><p>I thought cool; I'll take the same train back when I leave Pink Cow</p></li>

<li><p>I decided not to go to Pink Cow cause Traci wouldn't be there.</p></li>

<li><p>Did still want to ride train home with Soness, so I headed to Shibuya,</p></li>

<li><p>bought two 3000 yen Apple Store cash cards (one for each of us)</p></li>

<li><p>took the train to Shinjuku ready to surprise her at that station</p></li>

<li>

<li><p>SSL stands for Shonan-Shinjuku Line, which goes from Shibs (and Shins) down past
Chigs</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, not 9:15, <em>9:58</em>, and now not 9:58, 10:56.</p></li>

<li><p>Decided to go to The Pink Cow</p></li>

<li><p>Met Fie's mate Hiten, from UH!</p></li>

<li><p>left &quot;early&quot; to meet her train in Shibs, but she wasn't on.</p></li>

<li><p>Now it's 11:25pm.  I'm texting Soness; she's just now getting train in Shinjuku while my
train is gonna be in Yokohama soon.</p></li>
