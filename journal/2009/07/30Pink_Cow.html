<p>Went to The Pink Cow after lesson with Yurika, where I said HI to Traci (owner), and Geoff and
Ryan (Missing Scene, who were performing tonight) and then sat down on the front couchbenches and
chatted with Ayako (?) who's a drug sales rep trainer.  She was a drug sales rep, but preferred not
to travel so much. </p>

<p>Geoff and Ryan's set was cool; I most enjoyed the first song which is the &quot;Bang Bang&quot;
song that begins the movie Kill Bill.  Then there were two other guys on, one of whom did some
really awesome guitar.</p>

<p>Ayako (?) is one of Geoff's students; her English was fine for communication and she helped
translate a bit with Rie and I talking.  Rie hadn't really been to The Pink Cow before, but came to
see if she could talk to some international types.  After talking to me just a few minutes, she went
to get a drink and didn't come back hahah but she went and talked with the drummer who was backup
drumming for Missing Scene and then on stage drumming with the second guitarist.  Though I never got
their names, the drummer seemed pretty Jamaican (dark skin, dreds, Jamaican flag shirt with
&quot;Jamaica&quot; on it), and I'd guess the guitarist had Spanish background.</p>

<p>Later, Jason Ball, founder of Good People Japan,
(twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/goodPeopleJapan">@goodPeopleJapan</a>,
linkedIn: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1228567">Good People Japan</a>), told me the
latest that's up in his life.  So it was good to get to know him a bit more than just swapping
business cards and &quot;I'll call you sometime.&quot;</p>
