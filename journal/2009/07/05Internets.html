<p>Yesterday was pretty much on the internets all day.  Installed Gallery 2 on my site, I wonder if
I can email pics to it.  Hung out with Kana and Sayaka next door a bit (well 2 doors down, but
they're pretty small apartments so it's like next door) and had a picnic out on the front entry way.
Kana made some veggie salad and brought out jam her mom made and some bread that Leah made (Leah is
a woman who sells the bread on Fridays by the station, apparently) and I took a nap out there on the
ground and then it became 11pm while I was chatting with Krimms trying to watch the Fishsticks
episode of Southpark (after having watched 2 or 3 others) and had talked to Soness who is going to
be back tomorrow, and seemed to express some surprise at the idea of me crashing out couchsurfing
style for a longer-than-planned period.  I will talk with her today and see if I can stay either
with Andrew or Michael from my men's group.</p>
