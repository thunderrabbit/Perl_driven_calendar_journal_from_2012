<p>Dang I barely have time to do this last errand, but I'ma try...  want to get a new toilet seat
to replace the broken one here.  Was going to order a whole new unit, but for just 1000 yen more,
we can waste less plastic, and get a much nicer unit...  Perhaps I should confer with Soness
first.  She'll be home today!</p>

<p>But I *did* get a copy of the house key made for me, and a 1.0 liter glass container to keep
ants out of the sugar.  Yummy sugar, I know, but no ants allowed.</p>
