<p>I was late leaving the house to meet Andrew for lunch, and then the train was late leaving the
station, and later at the next station, etc etc for like 15 minutes of what shoulda been a 5 minute
trip, during which I got to talk with Soness about her adventures in Bali and tell her the house is
not quite as clean as I wanted to make it.</p>

<p>Her train is in three minutes; I hope she makes it on time.</p>

<p>So anyway, my train became so late that added to my already lateness, I called Andrew and we
decided to cancel until tomorrow.</p>
