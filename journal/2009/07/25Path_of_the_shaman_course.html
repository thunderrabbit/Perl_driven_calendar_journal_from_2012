<p>Today was the first day of me taking Kevin's Path of the Shaman course.  I told Jon about it
while we were in CPC together, and he came as well, so I'm really happy about that.  Due to Japanese
translation requirement, the course has gone a bit slower than I would like, but we did 5
experiential outings: two to the lower world, and two to the upper world, and then half of us did
one more to the lower world where we each got our client's power animal.  I perceived a horse, and
my client seemed really happy with the results.</p>

<p>To be honest, I thought I might be doing it wrong because as soon as I heard the plan for the
journey, I perceived horse as her power animal.  While traveling, I got the message multiple times
(saw the horse, rode the horse, looked into its eye, saw its teeth) so just went with it.</p>

<p>I didn't bring with me the notes I took during the course, but I sorta remember how it went:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>zzzz</p></li>

<li><p>zzzz snrk</p></li>

<li><p>zzzz snrk snrk</p></li>

<li><p>zzzz ah! zzz</p></li>

<li><p>gotta see a horse about a woman</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, I have my book now, but first I'm going to write the next entry, about yesterday's lesson
with Emiko.</p>

<p class="date">8:16pm JST</p>

<p>Aight, I'll transcribe what I wrote.</p>

<p>First, the notes before we did any traveling:</p>

<pre>
A methodology, not a religion, shamanism allows shamans to travel to lower world and upper world
(Focus 27 of <a href="http://themonroeinstitute.org/">TMI</a>) for direct experience and creates his
own mythology and archtypes.  Shamanism is a spiritual democracy.

Shamans don't channel spirits; shamans stay in control of their experiences.

Whereas the modern life meme says life is dangerous and meaningless, shaman life finds life magical
and alive.

4 ~ 7 hz drumbeat to put one in a shamanistic state

When traveling down to lower world, don't worry about magma or earthworms.
