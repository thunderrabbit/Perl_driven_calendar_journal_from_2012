<p>Right now in JMW meeting in Takadanobaba; I'm basically just been writing today's entries as the
entire discussion has been in Japanese.  And I'm <em>probably</em> not going to be here for JMW.</p>

<p class="date">5:25pm JST</p>

<p>I told the group about Phillip Gayle, who'd be a great performer to have in JMW.</p>

<p>Soness is set to MC the second half of the meeting starting at 6pm.  Pretty much, supporting her
is the only reason I'm here tonight.</p>

<p>Once we move upstairs (we're currently in B1 of Shimizu-Octo's first / satellite office (not sure
'zactly), a studio of sorts, with hardwood floors, quietly securely closing doors, nine light-boxes
of bright fluorescent lights with ten tubes per light box), I'm going to seek an electrical outlet
to charge my computer so I can watch the rest of the Gordon Novel vid.</p>

<p>Ah dang; I don't have my charger.</p>

<p class="date">5:35pm JST</p>

<p>Jon just gave his latest ticket idea: each event will have tickets available at ticket outlets in
Tokyo, and then those tickets can be exchanged for wristbands that will be tagged with that event's
code (which will give them guaranteed access to that event) but also allow likely free or discounted
entrance to any other JMW event.</p>
