<p>Soness now has a white iPhone S featuring 32 Gigs.  We spent our time at the Harajuku Softbank
store talking to Manuel.  Cliff helped me get rid of the pesky &quot;3 Unsent Messages&quot; message
from my mail.</p>

<p>Soness wants to download two of the apps I've got: Actions and PocketMoney.  She does not yet
have a case; the ones at the shop didn't quite fit her fancy.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm eating a vege bagel at Benugo in Ebisu, about to go to i-group.</p>
