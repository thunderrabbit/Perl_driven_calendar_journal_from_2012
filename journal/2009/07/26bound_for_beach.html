<p>Inspired by Jonathan, I decided to go out and sleep on the beach tonight, so I packed up some
pudding and energy drink for the morning, and headed out by bicycle.  It's nearly totally dark on
the beach, though some ambient light from somewhere allows me to see enough to distinguish solid
things from air.</p>

<p>I parked and locked my bike to a vertical post in some sort of wooden skeleton with its canvas
skin crumpled up on the ground in its belly.  With drumbeats in my headphones from the 15 minute
shamanistic track given to us by Kevin, I sat at meditatively facing the wet wind, leaning into its
gusts which kept me moist and awake.</p>

<p>I realized it was too much wind to sleep all night, so I headed back for reinforcements: my
sleeping bag would be perfect, but it's in the shed and I'm not about to risk hurting Soness's
surfboards getting them out of the way so I can get out my suitcases to find my sleepin' bag in the
dark.</p>

<p>After chatting with Sabina, I headed back to the beach with two towels.  I put one down on the
beach and lay down on it.  I put the other around my head to protect from wet wind whisking the heat
and sleep away from me.  Was there for about 20 minutes before heading back to warm dry calm and
collected blankets in the living room of Chez Soness.</p>

<p>I'll get my sleeping bag out now so I can use it tonight.</p>
