<p>Just went for a nice <del>run</del> <ins>playtime</ins> at the beach.  I ran a little bit, got
tired pretty quickly, ran back, walked around, jogged a bit farther and back, got my feet stuck in
sand, walked over to the T shaped rock penninsula, rocked hopped for a while, slow rock hopped for a
while, found a cut on my right big toe, rock hopped some more, walked back, rode back, said HI 
to かな, tossed my clothes in the washer, and wrote this.</p>
