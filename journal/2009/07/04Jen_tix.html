<p>Got to Chez Soness, had a bit of a snack, then grabbed tickets for Jen and Helen to see Soness
perform tomorrow in Gunma.  Jen said &quot;oh it's at 2???&quot; and didn't know if she could make
it, but I hope she can!</p>

<p>At the same time, in front of the police box in Shibuya's Hachiko Plaza (correct name??), I met
Jen's friends Esther and Albert.  Just said HI; didn't get to hang out toooo long.  They are
heading separate ways, so I chose not to join them (haha).</p>
