<p>Soness and I have been hanging out all day; starting with talking to her mom in the morning on
Skype and then heading to our respective job things (more on that in a sec) and now at The Pink Cow
meeting peeps including Moonie, Mallory, Traci, David (of course), and then new peeps: Q, Prince,
Paul, Kenny, Mel and several others, all from a Berlitz branch here in Tokyo, celebrating Prince's time
working there</p>

<p>Right now we're at The Pink Cow; we were the first to embark on the delicious buffet, and now
the house is pretty full with aformentioned party, plus another party. Soness is talking to David
now I think; I enjoyed talking with Moonie a bit, and with Q (cause he was wearing a shirt that
said &quot;California Barefoot&quot; or something like that), through whom I met his coworkers
Paul, Prince, and boss Kenny.  Soness was funny, describing Mel's name for me as &quot;あっ！メール
&quot; which went along with &quot;ah&quot; or something because she had just put a bite in her
mouth when I asked her name.</p>
