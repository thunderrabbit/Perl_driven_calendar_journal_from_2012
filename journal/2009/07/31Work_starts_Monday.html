<p>Several AWESOME things about my new work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The building is located near a recycling center at which I could stand for hours watching
them dump paper and cardboard into a big conveyor belt machine that picks it up and dumps it into a
mysterious pit.</p></li>

<li><p>The building is located quite close to the New South exit of Shibuy station, which is the
exit that directly serves the Shonan-Shinjuku Line (that includes the path from Chez Soness to
Shibuya).</p></li>

<li><p>The building is located overlooking some train tracks about which I recently dreamed I was
overlooking.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>About that last one, Soness actually remembered the dream when I told her about the building.
Then we were both like, &quot;WOOooooww..&quot; for about 3 minutes.  I mean, who knew that coulda
been taken as a prophetic dream??</p>

<p>Today, included in  all the paper they were dumping, I found several discarded books, including
a few of which I might like to read!</p>

<p>Not sure if/when I will register them on Bookcrossing (I'd start right now, but have no internet
access).. ooh I might try to register them all really fast to get near-sequential numbers for them
all.  That could be fun!</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>PHP &amp; MySQL</em>, <em>Doctor Zhivago</em>, <em>Angels and Demons</em> (Dan
Brown), <em>Awaken The Giant Within</em> (Anthony Robbins), <em>The Eye of the World</em> (Robert
Jordan), <em>Time Flies</em> (Bill Cosby), <em>Introduction to Bhagavad-Gita</em>
(A.C. Bhaktiveanta Swami Prabhupada), and <em>Prabhupada</em> (Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami) which is a
book apparently about the guy who wrote the previous book in the list.</p>
