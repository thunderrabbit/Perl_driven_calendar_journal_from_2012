<p>Yesterday was the solar eclipse, but I slept through it.  Had planned to meet Jon in Yoyogi, but
it was cloudy, so I was just gonna watch for darkness at the correct time.  Woke up a bit at
10:30am and then woke up at 11:45am.  Gah!  Missed the entire thing.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Then went to meet Ami at Kawasaki Station to give her her stuff back: hat, dress, shirt, pillow.
It was good to see her, and things seemed natural/friendly.  Good.  Ate sushi-train sushi down in
Azalea, and then ice cream at the Baskin Robbins below Dice.  yum!</p>

<p>Then headed home to change and then to Stellato for TIP-dinner called Duets, Seasons of Love.
$100 for lovely dinner for me sitting by Sorcha and Kai. Soness was to be on my right, but she had
a video shoot until after 8pm so missed the entire show and got a noodle dish for her $100, eating
it upstairs during Sorcha and Kelly's duet on the rooftop.</p>

<p>I enjoyed meeting Andrew (of Marcus Lycus fame) again, and Stacy who organized the whole thing
(?) and performed in the first show.</p>
