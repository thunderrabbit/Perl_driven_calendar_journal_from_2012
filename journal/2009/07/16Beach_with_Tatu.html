<p>Going to da beach now with Tatu.</p>

<p class="date">4:18pm JST Thursday 16 July 2009 (day 14358)</p>

<p>Great time at the beach with Tatu; he got lotsa pictures with his incredibly cool super-fast
monster Canon 50D camera.  I went barefoot; the sand was hot.</p>

<p>very hot, at times.</p>

<p>We wandered along the shore watching surfers, onto the T-bar tetrapod thing with old guys
fishing, and to &quot;those white sheds over there,&quot; which, fortunately, turned out to be
summer beach bars.</p>

<p>At the first one we visited, Sato introduced himself and we chowed tofu and sausage on sticks
(actually hot dogs on sticks), and were pleasantly greeted with &quot;let's take a picture!&quot;
by a girl on the way out, &quot;I want to be in the middle,&quot; she assured us.</p>

<p>Down a couple spots later, where I could no longer handle the hot sand, we enjoyed huge bowls of
shaved ice: lemon for Tatu and azuki for me.  Yum!!  We learned the term for 'brain freeze' which in
Japanese is an onomatopoeia 「キンキン」 &quot;kinkin&quot;　which we though was pretty
appropriate.</p>

<p>More tetrapod hopping and then back for more fun at the shaved ice spot and (because we asked for
it in our glass cups instead of plastic bowls), some free shaved ice (blue hawaiian flavor (has
nothing on the azuki!)) and it was great.</p>
