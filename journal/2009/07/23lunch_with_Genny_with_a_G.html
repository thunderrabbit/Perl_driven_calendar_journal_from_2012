<p>After getting Soness on her way, I went back to the house to get ready for lunch with Genny with
a G from Ultimate with a U.  It started raining just as I went to the station, so a guy at the bike
parking place gave me an umbrella free.</p>

<p>We ate cold pizza and calzone that I made two days ago, were still hugry so went to Denny's for
dessert.  I got french toast and vanilla ice cream separately because they couldn't put 2 scoops of vanilla ice
cream on my french toast (they could put vanilla and chocolate, but not two scoops of vanilla).
&quot;And this is why I hate Japan.&quot; </p>
