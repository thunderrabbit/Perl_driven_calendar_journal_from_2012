<p>Mmmmm sweet sweet storage.....</p>

<p>I now have a 500GB Seagate (5400.6 RPM) internal drive for my PC (for 9,990 yen) and a 1TB Lacie
d2 quadra (7200 RPM) external drive (for my PC) (for 20,400 yen), and went ahead and bought a cool
multi-screw-torx-driver cause it features 28 driver tips including torx and others for just 1580
yen, i.e. not much compared to what I spent on drives.</p>

<p>And I'm now in Tokyo station on the Shonan-Liner train, which costs and extra 500 yen, but I get
a nice seat and nice view outside.</p>

<p>Hmmm I hope this train stops in Chigasaki.  I'm pretty sure it's the same one Soness and I took
from Shinagawa once, so it'll be okay.</p>

<p>It was okay.  Home now!</p>
