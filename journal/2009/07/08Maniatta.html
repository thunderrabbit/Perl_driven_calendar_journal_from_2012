<p>As we were approaching the station from outside, our train arrived.  Fortunately, it's a pretty
long train (15 cars), so it takes a while to arrive.  And it stops infrequently, so it stops for a
bit at each station.  We zoomed up the stairs, beeped through the ticket gates and heard
the-train-is-leaving music start as we were at the top of the escalators.  I zoomed down and just
caught the doors as they were closing.</p>

<p>The guy opened them for me, but Soness wasn't yet aboard as he closed them behind me.  I knew
he'd do that so I stuck my foot in the door to make sure she got on.  That's what we call まにあった.
Not sure if there's kanji for it.  Well there's kanji for it, but not sure if it's the correct
meaning (間に合った).</p>
