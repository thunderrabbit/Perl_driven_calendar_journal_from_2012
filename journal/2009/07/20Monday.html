<p>Monday... hmmm  Looking at my schedule, the only thing I had going on that day was 7pm Japanese
lounge night at The Pink Cow.  I went up on stage to play a hachinantoka (I don't remember what
they're called); they are difficult to play!  Like recorders, but there's no guarantee that the air
will be directed the correct way over the whistle part.</p>
