<p>I created Fred's account on Facebook.  He outsourced that task to me because he didn't want to
take any time to maintain a presence accessible via http.</p>

okokok Someone lookedme up on fb the other day, and I was all oh hey! that's a brand new train
station in Tokyo; noticehow close the track is to the floor and how I'm standing RIGHT WHERE THE
TRAINS go!  anyway, I downloaded the iPhone fb app, and I can't log in!  (obviously). and this girl
was all, well just click that ("forgot ur pw" buton) and I'm all no, see, u don't understand.  and
she'sall, whaaaaat? u never see what ppl say and stuff?  they like message u and u never reply? and
gave me this weird look like I hadsprouted a third eye.

SO.  u probably told me this already (onlyjustnow thoguht to look through my emails and no way am I
deleting all this typing I justdid onthis phone), but what's my uname/pw?

note: ido NOT want you to change the email, or actually make any changes. I just want to LOOK at the
page throgh iPhone.  IF the interfaceis acceptable, I MIGHT start interacting thru it.  butone step
at a time.

why do you crazies play mafia wars instead of racing live (an identical game with different icons
and strings)?it has a pic of a lamborghini on the splash screen; therefore it's clearly better.

Wahahahaha!!!

Duh!  Because as mafiasts, we make enough money to buy many Lamborghinis!

haha! yeah that's basically the only reason I play.  I've found a few soft targets that I pokefor
money and then log rightback out everycouple hours.  I make like a half mil to a mil and about one
level every day.  I'm on level 22 and have 3.2M.  the best car available at this level is a Porsche
911.  next is an Audi a8 (I think). not sure when the lamborghini shows up, but it's somewhere
between levels 22 and 200 (the max)!
