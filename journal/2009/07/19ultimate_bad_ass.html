<p>Hahahahah Andy said the best thing to me after he saw the flaps of skin hanging off my heels
(they had been covering big blood blisters).  &quot;Is that a bandaid or your skin?&quot; &quot;It's
my skin; they were blood blisters.&quot; &quot;Damn you're a bad ass.&quot;</p>

<p>I came out to ultimate today for the first time in a long time because they organized a BBQ for
today.  mmmm  barbecue.  I made deviled eggs, thanks to Soness for suggesting it.  They went over
quite well!</p>
