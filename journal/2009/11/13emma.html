<p>After work, I met Emma for an RC session; I basically told her what I had told her on the phone:
I haved (cross between have and had) a crush on まみこ in the class, but need not act on it, for my
own reasons, and for the integrity of the class.  We'll probably organize a 3-way RC session
featuring me, まみこ and another person, possibly Emma, and sort it all out that way.</p>
