<p>Well, I've basically been in the office for ...  um...  a while now.  Got here at like 9:30am
Sunday morning, and now it's 3 am Tuesday morning, so it 6.5 hours it will have been 48 hours, so
41.5 hours and counting.</p>

<p>We did sleep last night, camping out in the meeting room.  Today I've barely even considered
getting out of my chair.  Ordered food via delivery a few times and not quite ready to finish for
the night.  Gotta keep coding, but getting a bit tired.</p>
