<p>After I got home yesterday, I finished the task I was going to do this morning, so I was able to
get started quickly on today's stuff: a list of fixes before the site goes live soon.  Eeep!</p>

<p>Alfonzo was in much better spirits, though there's still a lot of work to be done, we can see the
proverbial finish line.  A few items were working correctly but the DB data was bad (in which cases
I tweaked the code a bit to explain why the program didn't seem to do anything, &quot;um yeah you
can't view that record because it doesn't exist.&quot;</p>

<p>Another fix was super easy: we were checking the value of a variable, but somehow its initiation
code had been wiped.  So I rewrote the initiation code: (*)</p>

<pre>
      $action = $_REQUEST['action'];
</pre>

<p>and bang two whole sections of code suddenly
began to work!</p>

<p>(*) That's the only line that was missing.  All the validation code was still in place, which is
why the sections didn't work.  Basically $action was an invalid value (NULL) so the program quickly
and silently did nothing.</p>

<p>The super difficult bits that I haven't finished yet involve CSS.  Ack; I hate CSS, which I guess
isn't a very good way to learn it.  Have to make some divs be sortable, &quot;oh, and make them
&lt;li&gt;s so the number shows up, and move the delete button from the bottom to the top.&quot;</p>

<p>Gah.</p>
