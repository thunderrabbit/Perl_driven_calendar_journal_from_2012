<p>Most interesting for me at The Pink Cow was a trick done by a guy named Frasier, a sleight of
hand magician.  He did the normal card-appears-on-top-of-the-deck, and had a vanishing
(crushable plastic) beer bottle, and a new balloon doggie hidden between two nested bags...  those
trick I all figured out (not that I could do them; I just know the trick)</p>

<p>BUT he also did a trick that I love (though I probably know how it must be done).  The show was
finished, and he was walking by and Emi had put the tiny pink balloon dog inside her stocking cap.
I saw Frasier walking by so was all, &quot;yo Frasier!  Emi has a trick for you!&quot; and then
noticed that she had taken the dog out of her hat so I go, &quot;oh wait!  Look over there for a
minute!&quot; while we stuffed the dog back into her hat and put it on her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay check this out!&quot; and he turned around and Emi set him up the same way he had set
her up on stage, &quot;what's your favorite animal?&quot; and answered before he could answer,
&quot; a dog!?!&quot; and then, &quot;well wouldn't it be amazing if I had a dog inside my
hat!&quot; and pulled off her hat to reveal the dog!  We all clapped and he acted surprised and Emi
queried him a bit, &quot;what would you have said if on stage I said my favorite animal was
elephant?&quot; He answered, &quot;A dog!?!&quot; and then did an awesome trick for us.</p>

<p>Basically, he took ¤ß¤Ä¤è's ring, lost it, and then found it hanging on a link inside his zipped
key wallet!  I love that trick!  I didn't see where the ring went during the period of loss, and I
didn't notice him put it on the link inside the zipper before he showed us it was already there.</p>

<p>It reminds me of seeing Cyril on stage do that with a shoe, and of a trick I saw in Dallas with
Mr The Bibbster and the magician working with Austin Roth's watch.  Amazing!  And I'm still talking
about it.</p>

<p>Also got to talk to Moonie a bit before the bar got too smokey (which didn't take long after I
got my drink), about how we almost met up last night but her possible student canceled so we didn't
meet.  &quot;Let's meet up soon!&quot; is an ongoing concept in Tokyo.</p>

<p>During my burrito chow, a woman named Sheena (sp) sang a few jazz songs.  Her voice was great,
but she seemed to be a bit unprepared in terms of sound check and experience.  She seemed to
downplay her singing and apologized for her dress (satin black, perfect for any exquisite evening),
and was like, &quot;sorry, the next one will be better,&quot; and &quot;bear with me,&quot; while we
were enthusiastically clapping each of her songs!</p>

<p>Mostly, I came tonight to see Emi and Keiko, who do live painting during some Pink Cow events.
They painted during Sheena's set and V1 Rockets' set, during which I had to head out to catch the
train Soness and I planned to get.</p>

<p>After last time I saw them, Emi had invited me to see their next show which turned out to be
tonight, and tonight I showed them some of my paintings/drawings, and we agreed we should do a
collaboration sometime soon.</p>

<p>I had to leave during David and V1 Rockets set.  They sang a couple of originals including
&quot;Why&quot; and then Radiohead's &quot;Creep&quot;</p>
