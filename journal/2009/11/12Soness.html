<p>Soness was super genki tonight, on a sugar rush from drinkin a shirley temple and told me all
about her evening which included briefly meeting an author she wanted to meet.  Mostly show focused
on <em>not</em> getting to talk to the author, but being stuck at the other end of the table after
arriving late to the party (&quot;who comes to a wine bar at 6pm??&quot; &quot;I don't know.&quot;
&quot;no one!&quot;) and having to not only talk to her friends who she can see every week, but a
guy named Michael with whom she hadn't previously gotten along, but who has chilled out a lot since
he had kids.</p>

<p>In Tamaya, we jokingly slow walked like the Hana Barbera(?) wolf that whistles dixie and says &quot;man&quot;
after everything he says to the tune of the store-closing music.  So funny!</p>

<p>At home, I sat with Soness for a bit, inviting reiki energy down for a calming effect for her
and a back-fixing effect for me.</p>
