<p>Headed up the street from Shibuya station toward the Pink Cow, I got pulled gently from my track
back into unrushed reality by an unknown entity until I turned around to see Megumi!  Wow!  yay
Megumi!  I hadn't seen her in like a year it seems, at which point she was not sure how much longer
she'd be working for United Nations doing videos on world issues (sustainability of life resources:
water, food, land; sustainability of life: peace; etc) Awesome!  She said she's still there and
still not sure how much longer she'll be there.  Gotta go to lunch with her sooooooon like in
November cause she's going to head out of Japan for a month of chillin' and may not come back!</p>

<p>I asked if she'll be at Travis's なんとか party, but she hadn't gotten an invitation.  I emailed
him to see if I can bring her, but I didn't even remember the date of it so not clear if she can
even come, but.</p>

<p>Told Megumi my life update: in Chigasaki living with Soness, not dating anyone, workin' hard at
work on a project which should end sooooooon.</p>

<p>Yay!  So great to see Megumi!</p>
