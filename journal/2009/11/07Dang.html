<p>Anna did a lot of work in the garden, including tilling up soil to plant veggies, etc.  I figured
it would be good for a season and then let the grass grow back in the spring for summer activities
(surfing, plus April BBQ), but turns out Soness surfs in the <em>winter</em> as well.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Anna re-installed the plastic pond, which looked awesome enough but I forgot Soness didn't want
stagnant water there.  I knew she wants a fountain, but why not both? thought I.</p>
