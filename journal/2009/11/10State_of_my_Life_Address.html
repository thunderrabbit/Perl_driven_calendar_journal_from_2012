<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I live in Chigasaki with Soness at Chez Soness.  Been sleeping in my sleeping bag using her
couch to elevate my knees to keep my lower back happy.  For the past few weeks we've enjoyed having
Anna there as well, chilling in Japan as the last stop on her round the world trip.</p></li>

<li><p>I work in Shibuya with Nate and Alfonzo, doing website DB design.</p></li>

<li><p>My finances are actually looking pretty good, now that I'm getting paid a more normal salary
($2500) than I was getting back at 77Hz ($1500)</p></li>

<li><p>I miss Ami, who has been my ex-girlfriend for some months now.  At times I want to call her
to hang out, but I don't think it would be for the right reasons.  Well, I know what my reasons
would be and I think it would make for even worse situation later.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is white MacBook, about 3.5 months past its final warranty period.  Running:
<ul>
<li><p>GNU Emacs 22.1.1 (i386-apple-darwin8.9.1, Carbon Version 1.6.0)</p></li>

<li><p>Mozilla Firefox 3.5.5</p></li>

<li><p>Eclipse SDK Version 3.5.1</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> version 1.76 (9392)</p></li>

<li><p>iTunes 9</p></li>

<li><p>iPhoto 6.0.6 (322)</p></li>
</ul>

<br/>on Mac OS X Version 10.6.1
<br/>on 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo 
<br/>with 2 GB of 667 MHZ DDR2 SDRAM 
<br/>and 424.23 GB HD with 303.63 GBs free.
</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access is via ethernet cable at work, and via airport at Chez Soness</p></li>

<li><p>Soness just got back from Thailand, but I have been working a lot so haven't really had time
to ask her about her trip.</p></li>

<li><p>I-group has been pretty consistent (2nd and 4th Mondays) with 3 men and sometimes 4.
Seems like I'm the most consistent, with Michael second and David and Takeshi vying for 3rd.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been meditating most mornings, but not every morning.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been pretty active in my art recently in that I was the featured artist on 31 October at
Rimi's Second Art Lounge in Odaiba, yay!! Super thanks to her for helping me invigorate my art!
That has inspired me to keep drawing so I've got art supplies at work so I can draw when my brain is
tired.</p></li>

<li><p>I met 田中さん a week and .5 ago, and he told me there's a space I can show art in
Chigasaki.  Awesome!</p></li>

<li><p>My most recent I-group stretch is to look into that space to see what it takes to show art
there.  Awesome.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really volunteered my time except to work recently, to get recent work project
finished.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really been studying Japanese or any other spoken language, though most recently I
was using Anki to study kanji.</p></li>

<li><p>Programming in PHP mostly, and considering using Python to rewrite my journal, but that
project has become so stale I sorta doubt I'll pick it up again.  I was using git to store it..  I
think the url was like git.robnugen.com/ something</p></li>

<li><p>Primary website is robnugen.com, with some recent activity on robnugen.com/wiki (for my art)</p></li>

<li><p>I have no pets, though Soness's cat Nibbles comes to chat with me from time to time</p></li>

<li><p>marble track III indefinitely on hold</p></li>

<li><p>Recently, I've been listening to Ani Kiko's albums _Soul Naked_ and _Opening_ on repeat</p>

<pre>
Ani dear,

I love your music.  I've been listening to _Soul Naked_ and _Opening_ on repeat through my iPhone.
My favorites are "Lion Roar" "Let me Infuse" and "Sometimes" for both lyrics and music.  Right *now*
I'm about to import _Like No Other_ and the unreleased songs you gave me.

How can I thank you?  Money?  Fan mail?  Reiki energy from afar?

In related news, this Saturday, I'm going to trade massage for yoga lessons with a woman who's got
an established yoga business here..  She was like, "after their yoga lesson, I'll turn them over to
you for a massage..."  yay for connections!

     Love and Light
      - Rob!

<li><p>The last paragraph of my email to Ani above deserves its own point here!</p></li>

<li><p>I've got my music largely stored online via Amazon's Simple Storage Solution and JungleDisk.
Got my local hard drive backed up to my local external drive (Lacie 1 TB).</p></li>

<li><p>Considering different ways to keep images online; I want them on my own server, *and* I want
them on a taggable server like Facebook's, *and* I want them on my wiki, *and* on SmugMug,
etc.</p></li>

<li><p>If I lost my computer, I'd not lose too much data; I've got it all backed up via SVN for
work and my external drive for my personal stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't had m/any interesting earthquakes recently.</p></li>

<li><p>It's November, therefore NaNoWriMo season.  I did it 2 years ago, gave a half assed start
last year, didn't start this year.  I'd like to write a bit
on <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/">Castle of Dreams</a></p></li>

<li><p>Haven't traveled much recently, though I take the train almost an hour every day for
work... Considered going to OZ for a week or more in winter for Clairvision school, plus summer
(yum!) and maybe say HI to Simon &amp; Jax, and Ani in Sydney.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday I emailed Paola, who approached me and Yuriko at the TELL Auction last Friday to
see if we'd like to bid on her yoga lessons.  They were way-too-low priced at 15,000 yen to start,
and had been auctioned up to 25,000, so I just wrote 50,000 but apparently didn't get it.  Anyway,
I wrote to her and she wrote to me and I wrote to her and I'm going to trade freestyle healing for
yoga at her studio on Saturday!</p>

<p>This could lead to added benefit for her clients and my repretoir and really make this thing
happen!</p></li>

<li><p>Perhaps I'll take a trip to Thailand for a few months to learn Thai massage.
yummmmmm</p></li>

<li><p>Recently haven't really talked with Dad nor Ma, but was chatting with Fred a bit who asked
if I can help him with some of his code and perhaps doing some distributed computing.  He said he
can pay me, but I have no experience with distributed compootin', and sorta no time to do it.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't gone to play ultimate recently...  I've been working on some Sundays recently, but
we should be finished with this project soon.</p></li>
</ol>
