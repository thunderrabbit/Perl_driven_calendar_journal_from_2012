<p>I don't know who this dream Becky represents in real life,</p>

<p class="dream">I met Becky and fell in love with her.  She had a boyfriend, and I had single for
a while and I met her and was like wow she is awesome and wanted to kiss her but did not and tried
not to even mkae it look like I wanted to kss her so I just played it cool adn later when we got a
chance to hang out we had a lot of fun not kissingly but it was just nice time together and then
when she was watching a movie with her friends I noticed that my bangs had suddenly gotten longer
or I had missed some hairs when I shaved my head so I was like, &quot;becky?&quot; and then
&quot;bekcy?&quot; again and she came dashing out, &quot;yes??&quot; and I was like, oh man I cant'
ask her about something as silly as my hair now so I was like, &quot;um yeah I know I have been
acting very close to you and I think you're awesome but I know you have a boyfriend and your'e a
million years too young for me so I am sorry if I have given you any false messages but I just
can't and won't act on anything now, except now that I'm telling you this when we hadn't even
verbally breaching the topic before so I'm sorry if this comes out weird or sounds strnage.</p>

<p class="dream">She was like, &quot;no problem; I know, and I knew so it's okay, we can still be
friends&quot; and I was so relieved and she went back to her movie and I woke up.</p>
