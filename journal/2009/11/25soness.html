<p>Soon as I got home, Soness and I finally got to grrr at each other face to face as we hugged in
the kitchen.  &quot;you don't ever listen to me grrrrr&quot;  &quot;you don't ever listen to me
grrrrr&quot; and we were mates again.   :-)</p>

<p>Nice to finally get to chat with Soness after her trip to Okinawa where she went scuba diving
and got to ride a motorcycle!  I'm super glad she was able to take some days off for vacation.</p>

<p>Charlie, her latest couchsurfer is from Chicago (and sounds a bit like my cousin Pete), and a
dive master, and was telling us about some POV vids where divers go crazy underwater and die from
nitrogen narcosis (having a gas due to too much gas and letting life pass away).  Soness was like,
&quot;eeeep!  I hope that doesn't happen to me!!&quot; and we were like, &quot;you'll be fine;
haha&quot; and I go, just don't go below 20 meters!&quot; though I don't know if that alone will
keep a body safe from bends or narcosis.</p>
