<p>Mike Blender had his artist reception at The Art Blender at The Pink Cow tonight.  His art will
be up for all of November so come out and check it out!</p>

<p>Soness came and met many of the peeps from ultimate: Jei and Juri, Shaggy, Genny with a G, JC,
British Mike and Su Yong, and Chris, who she knows from improv.</p>

<p>I gave a massage to Jei who thanked me and put Juri in the chair.  Then there were a string of
volunteers, so I enjoyed giving massage + reiki + a bit of shiatsu to everyone who asked.  Shaggy,
Moonie and maybe one other...</p>

<p>Then when lotsa people had left, I danced on the wall to the breakbeats that the DJ was
playing.  Fun fun fun.</p>

<p>Soness and Anna left with me though I was like, &quot;you can stay if you want!&quot; I just
wanted to catch the 10:48pm train.  We did, and Soness threw an invisible ball for me to chase
cause I had so much energy like a dog running in comet-like orbits around its owner.</p>

<p>Anna offered to show us the way home, and I suggested a shorter way home so she can show off her
navigational skillz soon.</p>
