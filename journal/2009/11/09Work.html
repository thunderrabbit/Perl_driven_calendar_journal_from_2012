<p>Though Alfonzo and Nate were not there much of the day yesterday, I got some good shtuffs done in
the end and some code finally came together.  Just need to fix a javascript check that's not
stopping the submit for a couple items.  Nearly finished another page, though the popup we were
using for a thing is actually tied to the DB, so I had to send an extra var to let it know which DB
to use.  Not the best way to do it, but I didn't trust myself to make the correction in the amount
of time available.</p>
