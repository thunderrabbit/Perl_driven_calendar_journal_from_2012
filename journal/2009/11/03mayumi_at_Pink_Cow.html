<p>After work last night I met Mayumi at The Pink Cow at 8pm for what was hopefully going to be her
introductory lesson, but the teachers I had invited to come were unable.  The night was Games Night
at The Pink Cow, where poker is played and other table games are welcome.  I invited Mayumi to stay
for a drink and hang out with peeps.  She got a burrito as well and mostly hung out with me, which
was fine; we talked about just how delicious the burrito was and a bit about programming; I think
she said she's also a programmer.</p>

<p>I know she said she wanted me to teach her PHP, but I assured her I can't teach PHP in Japanese,
so she said she would learn English and then I can teach her.  Done deal.  She asked how long I
thought it would take to learn English which makes me imagine she believes there's some magic pill
or Matrix download that will do it.  Those technologies don't yet exist as far as I know so I guess
she's left with studying and practice.   I suggested she move out of Japan to immerse herself in
English.  When she discounted that possibility, I suggested she watch her favorite English movie ten
thousand times until she can quote the whole thing.</p>

<p>Busy night so the burrito was a bit slow coming out, and busy talking so a bit slow going down,
but I saw her to the door just after 10pm.</p>

<p>Before meeting Mayumi, I was talkin' to David, Dorothy, and Lauren (sp), all of whom played
poker while I was chatting with Mayumi.  Their numbers grew through the evening as a guy named Karl
joined, and Craig, but otherwise I lost track.  I disabled David for a little bit with a bit of a
back massage; he was like, &quot;thank you; ... you're covering ... up ... my thing.&quot; and
Lauren was like, &quot;whaaaa?&quot; and I was like, &quot;I'm standing way over here; I don't know
what thing you're talking about,&quot; carelessly leaving the preposition at the end of my thing,
and he goes, &quot;my tell,&quot; as in the poker term, meaning no one can tell what he's thinking
cause he can't even think with all the massage action on his shoulders.</p>
