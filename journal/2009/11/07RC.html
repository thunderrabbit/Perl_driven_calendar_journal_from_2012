<p>Today is RC.  I'm going to arrive later than planned, but part of the commute includes a walk so
I *might* be able to make up some time during that walk.  It's scheduled for 8 minutes by Jorudan,
but i walk pretty quickly, so we'll see (if I can walk quickly enough from 東京 (Station) to catch
the next earlier train in 大手町)</p>

<p>Though I'm likely to be at least 30 minutes late, it might be even longer as the train has just
emergency-stopped (between Yokohama and Kawasaki).</p>

<p>Talking about opression in most/all classes, today focused on Jewish oppression, about which I
have a lot of negative feelings given what I've seen happening in Palestine.  We had mini sessions
to discharge about stuff; I was in a trio with Tatiana and Margaret, who spoke about stuff
including that Tatiana studied middle east conflict as part of her schooling, so when it was my
turn, I started with &quot;actually, you may know more about it than I do, but&quot; and I was going
to be like &quot;it's a really messed up situation, and the Israeli's hold all the power, &quot;
etc, and be rather intellectual, but Tatiana interrupted me, all &quot;I wouldn't say that [I know
more about it than you]; you went there.&quot;</p>

<p>And that just hit me.  I fuckin' went there.  And I just cried and cried for my full seven
minutes, thinking about all the times I went through checkpoints between cities that are like
international borders for Palestinians, but free passage to Americans; about the home demolition
where I couldn't bear to go but Ben, Serena, Rochelle and some others went and got video of the
devestated family pleading for the bulldozers to stop destroying their home (we had been on a tour
of home demolitioned neighborhoods and the driver happened to get a call &quot;there's one
happening <em>right now</em>&quot; but of course it was too late to do anything but watch); cried
about the blockade built around Bethlehem around which Niveen had to sneak to get to her university;
cried about Rachel C something dying by bulldozer trying to stop a home demoliton; cried about gaza
being blockaded so no food nor water could go in as Israeli military jets bombed the shit out of the
area; cried and cried and wasn't done after my seven minutes but spoke a little bit about the
details for like 3 minutes; oh man there is so much.</p>

<p>And the fault is not with yer average Israeli citizen, nor even a hardcore zionist; it's with
the warmongering corporations that make a smella lot of money by killing people.</p>

<p>Stop enabling killing.  The money won't bring happiness.</p>

<p>In other news, I have a crush on Mamiko's smile, eyes, voice, attention.  She joined us for the
first and second times last month and tonight respectively.</p>
