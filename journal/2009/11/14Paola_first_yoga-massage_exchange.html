<p>On the train now to meet Paola at 12:45pm.  I'm way overdressed in terms of warm clothes.
Soness's house somehow was positively freezing compared to outside, which is positively warm
compared to yesterday!  How does that happen???</p>

<p>Bananna said, &quot;good luck!  As if you need it; you'll be fine; just enjoy it!&quot;</p>

<p>It was great fun!  I really enjoyed getting back in touch with my physical body; it's been a
long time since I've had instruction while doing yoga.  MMmmmmmmm yummy!</p>
