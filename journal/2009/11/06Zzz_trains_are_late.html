<p>Just got on the train that was scheduled to leave at 11:40pm.  Apparently someone's train of
thought included jumping in front of a train around 11pm, cause 11:02pm was the time stuck on the
marquee for a while.  That train was about 45 minutes late when it left, but then they started
tossing trains down the line like greased watermelons and the 12:06 train was only 5 minutes
late.</p>

<p>My train just left about 30 minutes late (it was behind the backlog of trains on the other side
of the platform as they got more and more on time, and it got more and more late).</p>
