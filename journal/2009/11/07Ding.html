<p>Though I really wanted to fix the garden today, Soness was like, &quot;don't worry about it; I'll
do it on Monday,&quot; when she heard how little free time I've had recently.</p>

<p>With that, and Anna's encouragement, I went to the beach for the first time in a while.</p>

<p>Went to the walls with sand around them and watched miniature avalanches pour sand down into the
stream bed.  I induced and harassed the avalanches a bit, enjoying watching nature dancing along
balances of movement and stability, beauty and danger, potential and kinetic.</p>

<p>Went to the T bar and walked along the rocks, enjoyed watching a crab stay in place on a tetrapod
despite water alternately pouring over and dripping off his shell.  I went rock hopping after a bit,
running briefly and thinking how cool I was and then stubbing my big right toe enough to rip the
skin from the tip.  The flap stayed attached at its bottom, so I simply washed it out and put the
flap back under my toenail to hold it in place while the blood does its job. </p>

<p>But the washing had to wait, for when I got back to TJ Bike to grab my sandals to wear back after
rinsing off my toe at the beach hose, I realized I had left my keys at home.  So I skipped the wash
until I walked home and got a towel, watching my sandy blood covered toe slowly dry to a sturdy
adobe scab.  Washed it off and out at home, toweled off, got some cereal, got my backpack and
computer (on which I'm now typing), walked back to the beach (with keys), unlocked TJ Bike, then
rode along the beach to where I could cross the big road on an overpass up which I enjoy riding
cause TJ Bike has some low gears, then zooooom to the station and now I'm on the train.</p>
