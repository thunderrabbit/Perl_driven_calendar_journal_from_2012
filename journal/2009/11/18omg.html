<p>Speaking of universes, I read an article
&quot;<a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/science/2009/11/does-jesus-save-aliens.html">Does
Jesus save aliens</a>,&quot; about the upcoming disclosure of the existence/communication/friendship
with our extraterrestrial brethren, and one of the comments kinda scared me to think there are
people who believe this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article shows amazing shallowness regarding this topic.</p>

<p>The Bible states that we are in the midst of a great controversy that is to be settled here on
Earth. These UFOs and other such images are nothing but demons which are trying to convince the
world that the Bible is not true. They did not come from another planet. They have been here on
Earth since Adam's fall. Earth is where the sin issue is to be decided. Earth is where it will be
finished. Once sin is dealt with, and once Satan and his demon angels are destroyed, those who were
saved (John 1:12) from this planet will be taken to see the center of our Creator's kingdom. After a
thousand years, we come back, the wicked are raised up to face their judgement of permanent
destruction by fire. The Earth is remade when the fire cools down, and then this planet becomes the
new center of God's kingdom. Yes there are probably trillions of other angels and being and
different worlds out there. But none of them are sinful. All of them are watching Earth carefully to
see the final solution to this sin problem. Essentially, Earth is under a "sin quarantine". None of
us can leave without being de-contaminated.</p>

<p>Again, this is such a NON-ISSUE, but leave it up to the Catholic beast of Babylon to try and deceive the world regarding this "alien" mess. They are not aliens. They are demons.</p>
