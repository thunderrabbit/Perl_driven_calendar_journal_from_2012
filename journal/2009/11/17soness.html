<p>Soness got home late, and we stayed up later chatting, cause we haven't seen each other in like a
long time, and she's headed out of town for a mini vacation for three days in Okinawa and work until
Sunday night.  She told me about meeting a guy name A-something who was like, &quot;don't I know
you from improv?&quot; and Soness goes, &quot;quite possibly!&quot; and turns out he's a blue man
in Blue Man Group.  Wow!</p>

<p>She pet Nibbles Kitty and told me about her audition (I think she'll get it, but first they gotta
audition one more girl on Friday or so) and I massaged her ankles and told her about work, and
yoga-for-massage exchane with Paola and how I was glad to be back doing physical training again.</p>

<p>Would have stayed up longer, but had to be at work at 9am so crashed to sleep around 2am.  zzzz</p>
