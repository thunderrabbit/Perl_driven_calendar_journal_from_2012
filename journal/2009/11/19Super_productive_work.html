<p>As opposed to late last week and early this week, when I finished in about 30 hours a page I
thought would take a day, I've been zooming through page creation today.  Most of them are copies
of each other with some tweaks in the DB, but I'm still happy with my progress, and Alfonzo said he
was too.  One page was a combination of the functionality of three other pages, but using a single
table to save multiple types.  I got it finished just as Alfonzo said, &quot;they don't want to use
it, but save your code and we'll use it later.  As I was adding HTTP:Redirect(&quot;/&quot;); to
the top of all the pages to render them inoperable, he came back, &quot;wait!  Now they want the
identical functionality in the same location.  By the way, the pages seem to be redirecting, so you
might want to look into that.</p>

<p>haha</p>

<p>SO, just a bit ago I was finishing up coding of another page that will be used to talk to two
different tables, with just the flick of a parameter.  I *think* I got all the changes made to the
code, but haven't been able to test while on the train.  One day I may get a wireless access
point.</p>

<p>Station now so I'm nearly home!</p>
