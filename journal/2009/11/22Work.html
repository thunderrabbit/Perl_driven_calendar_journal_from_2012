<p class="date">10:51pm JST Sunday 22 November 2009 (day 14487)</p>

<p>Worked late today (Sunday) and yesterday (Saturday) after sleeping a bit late (cause I downloaded
and watched half of 2012 last night), and waking up early (to attend yoga lessons with Paola
starting at 8:45am Saturday), respectively.  In both cases, I got to work at around noon thirty.
Alfonzo was on a similar schedule both days; we're pushing hard to get the site done before its
release on the first.</p>

<p>Helpful in that regard, our possible new Cow-Go student Takayuki did not respond to my offer of
Saturday 7pm for a lesson with Mark.  I canceled the meeting with Mark and kept on working.</p>

<p>Today I finished retooling all the finish_time variables..  We had had a checkbox
&quot;finished&quot; and later added a timestamp &quot;finish_time,&quot; but then realized they
are ripe for conflict, so removed the boolean &quot;finished&quot; from the DB tables and I
retooled the code that displayed those values.</p>

<p>The coolest bits of code keeps the timestamp at (most recent) five minute intervals.
Basically:</p>

<pre>
	timestamp = (floor(NOW / 5 mins) * 5 mins)
</pre>

<p>In PHP I essentially wrote</p>

<pre>
	$time_without_minute = Date("Y-m-d H:");
	$nearest_five_minute = floor(Date("i") / 5) * 5;		// most recent 5 minute
	$record['finish_time'] = $time_without_minute . &quot;:&quot; . $nearest_five_minute;
</pre>

<p>In javascript I essentially wrote</p>

<pre>
	var currentTime = new Date();
	var moon = currentTime.getMonth() + 1;
	var date = currentTime.getDate();
	var year = currentTime.getFullYear();
	var hour = currentTime.getHours();
	var five = Math.floor(currentTime.getMinutes() / 5) * 5;
	$("finish_time").set("value",year+"-"+moon+"-"+date+" "+hour+":"+five);     // requires mootools
</pre>

<p>And in MySQL (via PHP), I essentially wrote</p>

<pre>
	$rounder = 5 * 60;  // to nearest five minutes
	$db-&gt;do("UPDATE " . $table . " SET `finish_time` = FROM_UNIXTIME(FLOOR(UNIX_TIMESTAMP() /
		(" . $rounder . ")) * (" . $rounder . ")) WHERE `id` = ". $id);
</pre>
