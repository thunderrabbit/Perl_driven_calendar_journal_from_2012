<p>Got home to find Anna bundled up for warmth as she surfed for gardening tips.  In the kitchen
were a pair of dirt holders, each with about 50 little cups filled with dirt, ready for seeds.  Wow!
She said she'll work on them tomorrow and needs a warm place for them to sprout.  Hmmmm.  Warm.
Hmmmm.</p>

<p>I showered then started falling asleep while looking at source code from work so she headed
upstairs and I konked out downstairs.</p>
