<p>Went to Ze Pink Cow with Anna tonight for a special Monday night event for which there were
several performers, starting with a woman named Annie (?) who sang + played guitar, then a band
called sumpin I forgot who played several songs, including lead + harmonica.  We headed out as the
next band was setting up, including a woman who is probably playing sax right now as I write.  I
asked if she/they had a CD (no), so gave her the 1000 yen that Anna refused to not give me (after I
said I was taking her to dinner as thanks for her time on Soness's ticket) and was like, &quot;make
a CD!&quot; and gave her my card.  Her friend was like, &quot;did he just give you 1000 yen for
nothing?&quot; &quot;make a CD!&quot; as she said, &quot;we don't have a CD,&quot; and gave me their
miniflyer.  It's cute in its own way; maybe I'll scan it since I've been going scan crazy recently.
In case I don't scan it, I'll now summarize it
thusly: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dasyukon/">choco choco-raisin</a>.</p>

<p>Right now Anna and I are on Yamanote Line approaching Shinagawa.  I'm going to play forgetful
for a bit to see if she knows to get up.  Just for fun.  She does!</p>
