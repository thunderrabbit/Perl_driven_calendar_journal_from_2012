<p class="note">9:33am JST Thursday 26 November 2009 (day 14491)</p>

<p>To try to smoove things over, as I didn't know if Soness had gotten my reply to her text
message, I said, &quot;I want to apologize for the miscommunication last night,&quot;</p>

<p>She thanked me and looks like we can be friends again.</p>

<p>For the record, though I was super sleepy and wanted to sleep, I was pretty sure it was more
important to stay up (wake up when I heard her) and apologize.  I'm def glad I did.</p>
