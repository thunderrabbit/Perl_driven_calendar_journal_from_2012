<p>Just leaving work; not a very long day, but long enough for what was a holiday for most people in
Japan (I dunno what holiday it was, but today was a holiday).  Um, anyway, Nate and Alfonzo were
there from 11am, and I arrive a bit after noon and we al worked pretty diligently until 10:30pm when
I had to bust out for last train and they were like, &quot;yah I'm outta here, too&quot; and we
left.</p>
