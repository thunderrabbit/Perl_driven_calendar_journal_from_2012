<p>I made the last train in Shinagawa by 5 minutes.  Was standing next to a girl who smiled at me
when I accidentally bumped her hat with my elbow (while hanging in sleeping fashion from the handle)
and little fantasies ran through my tired mind about hooking up with her or at least getting to sit
down and have her snuggle up against my arm.  We did smile at each other as we both sat down at the
same time when two people got up, but with a person (angel?)  between us who didn't get up.  While
watching a guy snoringly take up two or three spaces on the other side of the train, I was focusing
on the guy to my left like, <em>get up get up get up get up</em> in my mind, and when he finally
did, I didn't shift over to her cause I didn't want to give the wrong impression.  I wanted her to
shift over to me, but she only looked around sleepily and then went back to sleep as another guy sat
down between us.</p>

<p>Turns out she and I both got off the train at Chigasaki, but we didn't speak (did we smile?) and
I'm sure I'll never see her again.</p>
