<p>Tonight I attended the TELL (Tokyo English Life Line) Connoisseurs' Auction, basically to network
with a new group of people in Tokyo.  I had bought a ticket for Soness as well, but she was too
tired to go, having just gotten back from Thailand.  She called Yoshioka, owner
of <a href="http://www.benscafe.com/">Ben's Cafe</a> in Takadanobaba who joined me instead.</p>

<p>Most interesting was the live bidding, most of which was on varieties of wine that had been
donated.  There were a few non-alcoholic items, mostly involving travel, and then a hand painted
silk screen and a photograph of Princess Diana from her last trip to Tokyo back some years ago.  The
photographer, <a href="http://www.davidstetson.com/">David Stetson</a>, offered a photo session with
whomever bought the painting.  I think it went for 130,000 yen, though I didn't keep careful
track.</p>

<p>I met David the photographer.  He's a big guy (rugby in university) and has been in Tokyo for a
while.  After we traded cards and he saw my &quot;freestyle healing,&quot; He said he's broken 29
bones, including his shoulder, so he has a lump that feels similar to mine, though his is actually
his bone, which didn't get medical treatment for a couple weeks and had begun to grow back by the
time he got back.  They were like, &quot;we can re-break it, but it's won't likely be better than
what you'll have if you just let this be,&quot; and he let it be.</p>

<p>Met a woman named Paola (&quot;it's Italian,&quot;) owner
of <a href="http://www.yogasan.net/">Yoga San</a> in Setagaya.  She actually approached Yoshioka
and I, basically to tell us she had donated yoga lessons.  But what wasn't specified on the
description: it's a ten class course, and I assume each session is an hour.  So I promptly went
over and bid 50,000 yen on it (written auction) after confirming with Yoshioka that I could borrow
20,000 yen if I had to pay tonight (I didn't).  I guess it makes sense that we didn't have to pay;
how were they going to track down everyone who had won the items and possibly left the premises?
Of course just call us the next day or so.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope I got the classes.  She said she may call me for some freestyle healing.  Cool.</p>

<p>She was on her way out when she said HI to Yoshioka and I.  I was like, &quot;thanks for telling
us,&quot; and she was like, &quot;there was just something about you,&quot; or something like
that.  Hmmm...  could it be my new shoes?  New tie?</p>
