<p>To welcome Simon to Tokyo while he and Namiko were picking up a fish tank for his gilled lizards,
I bought him a spindle of 50 DVDs on which he will probably burn copies of Loose Change 2E with
Japanese subs or Improbable Collapse which has more hard facts.</p>

<p>At The Pink Cow we gave away my third and second to last copies of Loose Change to Moonie and a
guy flexing his Japanese skills with a girl at the next table.  Simon had given me 10 copies to give
away, and I've been doing so, slowly.  He was like, &quot;here's how you do it:&quot; and stood up,
walked two steps and put the DVD down on the table, &quot;hey here's a free movie for you,&quot; and
sat back down in his seat.  They asked in Japanese &quot;what is it?&quot; and he replied in
Japanese, &quot;the truth about 9/11.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm.  I must admit that looked pretty easy.  I was like, &quot;aight; I just gotta get a DVD
burner..&quot; and Simon goes, well I'll keep burning them and sending them to you so fast your
house will fill up if you don't give them away..&quot;  hahahahah awesome.</p>

<p>Moonie sat with us a bit as the delicious Pink Cow Buffet was winding down.  I found out she's
half Korean, and she found out I ripped U-Cow's head off during a fight with Ami.  &quot;You had a
girlfriend??&quot; and I was like, &quot;yeah; I told you that!&quot; but she assured me I hadn't.
Hmmm strange.  &quot;Well, you never told him you're half Korean so there ya go,&quot; Simon tossed
in there to balance it out.</p>

<p>Namiko is from Osaka, and Simon works in Osaka, but they live together in Kyoto, with a couple
(soon to be a few) fish tanks.  I don't remember if I heard what she does for work, but I think she
said teaching English???  to elementary kids?  man, where is my brain?</p>

<p>Last night they slept in the van in a carpark in Odaiba.  They can't do that tonight as the van
is full of fish tanks and equipment, but they'll sleep in a hotel where his friend is staying
tonight.  Somewhere really nice like the Regency Exquisite in Ginza (a name I just made up, but I
know he said Ginza) so they should sleep well, once they get to sleep; it's his friend's last night
in Japan, so I imagine they'll stay up late talking.</p>

<p>After finishing off the buffet (and I mean Simon scooped up the rest of the chicken and poured
the rest of the spinach salad onto his plate (he's not fat; he's an ox)) we said bye to Moonie and
saw U-Cow chillin' on the printer, so I grabbed him (at Simon's suggestiion) and after taking
pictures of the stained glass windows outside The Pink Cow for Namiko to petition her sister who
makes stained glass to make one for her, I took us all an indirect route to the station which turned
out useful for Simon's art: he draws cars on occassion and we saw some tricked out Chevys and got
pics of them and talked to the owners for a bit.  One of the cars had IV Life on it, and I was
like <em>wtf?</em> and then <em>ohhh</em> and explained to Namiko its meaning.</p>

<p>We kept on and then up the street past Apple Store and then down the left into the heart of the
outskirts of culturally interesting Shibuya.  We headed toward the heart and took a detour to ドーンキ where I figured there'd be some more interesting hair styles, but we didn't see more than girls
with long curled hair flowing over long white fur coats tottering atop too tall high heels.  I was
hoping for some ギャール or even やまんば, but didn't really see any.  Ah well.</p>

<p>Back down along 109 (I guess we shoulda gone back to センター道り) and we crossed the street so
we could cross again at Shibuya's scramble.  It wasn't as scramblingly scramblicious as it woulda
been a couple hours earlier; most peeps were heading toward the station (and home) with not so many
heading out from the station toward antics.</p>

<p><em>Ah,</em> I realized, and took us on a quick detour to Hachiko which Namiko named when she saw it, and
Simon was like, &quot;meh,&quot; but took our picture with their disposable camera.  (They had
forgotten their cameras until they were 20 minutes away from Kyoto.)  Then headed up the steps to
Ginza Line and dropped them off there.</p>

<p>Wow.  It was great to see Simon, and great to meet Namiko.</p>
