<p>Met Soness on her way home from Thailand!  She's back after a multi-day adventure, just in time
to go to the TELL Auction, but is choosing not to go, and has found someone to use the ticket.
Nice.  She and I met in Gotanda toilwt and then she joined me to the BIG SHOES shop where Soness
helped me pick out some nice new dress shoes (black leather slip-ons) to match my suit.  I dunno
where my previous ones are.  Did I leave them in Motosumiyoshi?</p>

<p>Randomly saw Soness's friend Blake who she introduced as her husband because they played husband
and wife in some kind of acting thing.</p>
