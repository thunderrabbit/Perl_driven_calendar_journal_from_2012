<p>Got a good start on my first page on the front end of the website.  These are way way way easier
than the back end.  Not reading any data from the users so nothing to validate; just grab an id
(okay we have to validate an id, big whoop, I can do that with my eyes closed):</p>

<pre>
typing this with my eyes closde.  Really:

$id = intval($_GET]'id']);
if(is_numeric($id)
{
    // process that id
}
else
{
    // bad id
}
</pre>

<p>Ah, one mistake: the fisrt line should be $id = intval($_GET['id']); but that's just cause I was
nervous about mistyping weird characters with my eyes closde.</p>

<p>Oh one more mistake: should be two close parenthesis on the next line.</p>

<p>Okay, so maybe I can't validate ids with my eyes closed, but they sure are easier than
validating HTML input, date input, phone number input, etc etc etc across multiple input pages eeek!</p>
