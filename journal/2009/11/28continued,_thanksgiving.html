<p>This morning around 6:30am, I heard Shivani and Charlie quietly talking, discussing what time he
would have to be out the door to get his train.  Then there was some commotion at the door as
drunken Jojo talkatively tried to help Ace take off his boots.  I got up and quietly (though
ungently) shushhhed her, and she was like, &quot;We ARE trying to be quiet!!&quot; even louder than
before.  I shushed her again and realized I might have been better with some other technique, but I
don't have much experience dealing with drunk peeps.  She came in and was like, &quot;where are we
going to sleep?&quot; cause the floor was pretty covered with bodies, and Shivani was like,
&quot;he's about to leave soon,&quot; and offered the blanket area where Charlie had been, but Jojo
wasn't listening and gently crumpled into a pile near the door after saying, &quot;I'll just sleep
here in the cold,&quot; and fell asleep.  Shivani put Charlie's blanket on her.  (one of the
blankets that Jesse gave me back when he moved out of Michael's apartment)</p>

<p>When I woke up about 30 minutes later, I didn't see Charlie nor Shivani, and Ace was snuggled
behind Jojo in a human blanket type way.  He sat up and shook my hand and I suggested they sleep
where Charlie had been.  Once I got back from adhering my contacts, they had moved to the
blanket.  I waved bye to Jen who happened to look up as I was leaving and I left.</p>
