<p>I've been way focused on work recently; our project is supposed to be done now and in testing,
but we're sorta two days behind on that (really we'd like another month).  I stayed late to work on
a page that I thought would take a day, but ended up taking me three days.  Gah.  Can't quite
pinpoint what was the huge difficulty, but a clearly new part for me were having the popup window
ask the parent window to refresh its popup window code so new popup windows would be available.
This was all done with javascript libraries, and though it pretty much works, there's still a bug in
that if I create a new non-popup-requiring item from the popup window and *then* create a new item
that needs a popup, the second item's popup won't work.</p>

<p>Ah that reminds me of a second major difficulty: creating two distinct types of items.  One type
comes from data already in the DB and one type comes from the user's own data.  Though both types
show up in the same list, only the user-created ones are editable.  Another trick was they can only
create an item if they search the DB first for an existing item.</p>

<p>And then the last one, which Alfonzo and I shoulda caught from the beginning; we were using the
ID of the *other* item in the DB as the unique ID for the items, but if the item was created by the
user, it won't <em>have</em> that other ID.  So that wasted some time in adding a unique ID to the
table and retooling how the data was read and saved.  (With no unique IDs, we just wipe and rewrite
whatever we got from the POST, but with unique IDs, we have to keep track of which ones were
inserted or updated, and delete all the ones that were *not* sent in the POST.)</p>

<p>So anyway, I was at work till like 11pm Monday, then slept in internet cafe in Shibuya, and then
back at work at 8am yesterday.</p>

<p>Left at a normal time Tuesday for vegan buffet and meeting Arwen, and now back at work at
9:08am:</p>
