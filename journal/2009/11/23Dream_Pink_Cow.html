<p class="dream">By the time I realized what a cool event was happening at The Pink Cow, it was
basically too late to go; I was nearly an hour away out on some streeet walking when I saw a TV
broadcaster say, &quot;and now we're going to go live to The Pink Cow for an update,&quot; and at
The Pink Cow a dark version of Spring Day was all genki saying, &quot;yeah we're here at The Pink
Cow and things are progressing well; we're going to have a performance by the Pink Cow DJs and
...&quot; and as she was talking the camera panned back to see the room all filled with balloons and
it looked really cool; the balloons were glitter covered with pink glitter all over them and then we
noticed that the number of balloons in the room was to make the place look crowded, but there
weren't that many people actually there.  Like the room was 10 percent full with people and the rest
filled with balloons.  I commented this to my friend and she was like, &quot;yeah&quot; and we
wondered about going out, but we were an hour away.</p>

<p class="dream">My brother arrived next to me and was like, &quot;the show was great you should
have been there,&quot; and I wished I had gone, but it was too late to make it worthwhile.  Though
it was the middle of the day, and we were on the street next to a construction site from where a
goldenrod truck with a long pointy nose drove out and then turned up onto a thin sidewalk ramp and I
had no idea how the guy made it drive up the narrow steps, but then I saw it had only two wheels and
was even more amazed!  How'd he keep it balanced when driving so slowly and how'd he roll up the
steps cause there was a big jump from the street level up to the deck on which he was driving. I
guessed it had to do with the rails that sloped up smoothly.  I was watching him and then a man
walked by with a bit of a beard, and Fred goes, &quot;we have to encourage him to grow his beared;
do this,&quot; and stroked his beard as if thinking in a beard growth encouraging way.  I stroked my
beard too, and was surprised that my beard was gone; I didn't rembmer shaving anytime recently, but
as I looked back in my memory, I saw a listing for The Pink Cow which showed what we had missed was
already announced, &quot;come on out for the boot stomping astrocaster party with the various and
random astrocaster dancers broadcasting live from the Pink Cow!&quot; and I was like dang I wish I
had read this sooner!!</p>

<p>This is the version I wrote with my eyes closed.  Relatively few errors cause I was pretty well
rested:</p>
