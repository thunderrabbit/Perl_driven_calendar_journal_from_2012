<p>Headed home now, and am pretty tired.  I'll have the house to myself tonight and tomorrow night,
but I won't be having any parties.  Headed out early to yoga tomorrow with Paola
at <a href="http://yogasan.net/">yogasan.net</a>, relatively close to Shibuya, and then going to
work all day, starting with Alfonzo and ending with Alfonzo unless our Cow-Go student replies that
he'd like to have his initial lesson tomorrow.</p>

<p>On the train, I'm sitting next to a man who I've seen several times.  He always carries a
skateboard, and always wears big headphones, I assume featuring some awesome tunes for his ears.</p>

<p>I don't know his name, but I do know his business now: watches.  Or, possibly more likely,
graphics design.  He's been tweaking images of watches like for product images in a shopping cart
the entire ride since 9:37 (pm) (10:17 now)</p>
