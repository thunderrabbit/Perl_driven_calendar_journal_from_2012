<p>Emiko came to yoga yesterday!  I was glad to know she was there, though I barely saw her cause I
didn't put in my contacts until I got to work <em>after</em> yoga.  I enjoyed being in a visually
soft environment.</p>

<p>Since she had to wake up at 5:30am or so to get there by 8:45 (left her house in Chiba at
6:30am), she's going to attend the 12:45 pm lesson from now on.  I agreed to come at that time as
well (cause it's a bit early for me too; I had to get a train that left at 7:24am).</p>
