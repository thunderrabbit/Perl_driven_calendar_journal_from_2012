<p>Finished off the one page on which I had gotten a good start before yoga, and completed another
page just now on the train.  I had everything except the previous and next links set up.  Now all I
have to do is save my files when I get to an internozzle and see how well I did.  Hopefully zero
errors cause I had my eyes open while doing it.  :-)</p>

<p>Okay, and now I've just set up templates to hopefully finish all the rest of the pages
tomorrow..  I hope!!</p>

<p>In any case, we're bringing sleeping bags tomorrow for an overnight camping programming
extravaganza.  What fun!!  I love camping!</p>
