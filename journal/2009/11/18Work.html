<p>Back onto a sorta normal rate of completing tasks at work.  I finished a page today and should
be able to get its home pages (not homepages, but homey pages) finished tonight or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Nate and Alfonzo had a meeting to go over the whole site before their presentation to our client
and found &quot;a whole page of changes,&quot; which I expected.  I hope they're all little fixes
like Alfonzo thinks.</p>
