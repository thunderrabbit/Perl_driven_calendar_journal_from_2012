<p>Met Arwen last night at The Pink Cow vegan buffet.  I met a guy named Jesse in line and because
it was his first time to come, when I saw Earl, Miki, and Robin all in a row at one table, I
introduced Jesse to them from afar.  Heather and Arwen also introduced themselves.  When Arwen said
her name, I was like, &quot;Arwen.  awesome.&quot; cause I really like the name.  She was like,
&quot;you can have it!&quot; so I jokingly said, &quot;HI I'm Arwen,&quot; to Jesse.</p>

<p>Got our food and I came back to sit by Arwen, &quot;since we have the same name, I figure we
should sit together,&quot; and turns out we both really like roller coasters so I'm
thinking, <em>dood we gotsta go ride some coasters together</em> and thinking <em>dood I thought
you said you were going to not date anyone..</em>  and therefore thinking, <em>well, what *is*
dating anyway??</em> and then wondering about the viability of going to a park in Tokyo.</p>

<p><em>Spoken</em> conversations at the table focused on the food, Miki having been 20 feet from
Obama during his recent speech here in Japan, jobs, the raffle, housing locations.  &quot;You live
in Chigasaki?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;Do you surf?&quot;  &quot;No.  But my housemate
does..&quot; but the conversation didn't go on from there.</p>

<p>I think from now on, I'll append &quot;Soness&quot; to &quot;my housemate&quot; cause it turns
out Arwen knows Soness and also stayed at her house via CouchSurfing!  Wow!!  I didn't determine
this until I left (wanted to walk to the station with Arwen, but she was chatting with peeps, and I
ended up not even saying bye to her.  I hope/d she noticed, and I hope/d she didn't feel slighted, and
omg wtf am I thinking?  Why are these thoughts in my brain?  I just met her tonight!  (last
night)</p>

<p>Looked her up on FB and found 1 mutual friend, Soness, and was like, awww man!  I shoulda said
her name.</p>

<p>I *did* say Arwen's name several times, cause when otherwise she would have had to repeat it (as
new people came to the table), she'd tap me and say, &quot;what's my name?&quot; and I'd go,
&quot;Arwen!&quot;</p>

<p>The first time that happened, Heather and I both were like, &quot;What's my name??&quot; and then
she goes, &quot;Say it!  Say it!&quot; and I go, &quot;ARWEN!!&quot; loud enough that certainly
everyone not in the bar area probably heard me, but that's the way of the herd at The Pink Cow.
Noisy is okay.</p>
