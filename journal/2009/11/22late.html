<p>I think I have Chez Soness to myself again tonight.  I think Anna said she'd be back on Monday,
and she said she thought Soness said something about not coming home on Sunday.  I'll find out in
about 20 minutes!</p>

<p>If I have the place to myself, I'll finish the rest of 2012 and go to sleeeeep.  If they're
there, then I'll probably install Wordpress on unwim.com.  Or maybe install a wiki.  Or maybe a
forum, or trac or all the above.  Man I can tell I'm getting tired and a bit silly.</p>
