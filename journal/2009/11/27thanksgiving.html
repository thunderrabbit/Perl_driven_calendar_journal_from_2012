<p>Last night we had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat.  Hey wow I'll be 14500 in a
week!</p>

<p>Um, so I was able to come home a bit earlier than normal and joined a whole posse of peeps at
Chez Soness for thanksgiving deliciosos.  It was also Bananna's birthday so we had a cake and ice
cream and singing for her to boot!  In attendance were ?, ?, Shivani, ?, Charlie, Maggie, Chris,
Jen, Jojo, Ace, Bananna, Soness, and me, and maybe another ?.  I got home around 8:45 after taking a
bit of time to look for a gift bag for Bananna's present from Soness, trying to call Soness for
further suggestions cause I didn't find one, walking to the bike parking lot, getting a call from
Soness imploring me to get a bag, going back to the 300 yen shop and getting a pink box that I
figured would be useful for something if not the present.</p>

<p>Turns out it was just the right size for the prezzies and everything was great!</p>

<p>Peeps headed out to karaoke after midnight or so, but I hung back to sleeeep cause I gotsta go
to work this morning.  Jen and ?  stayed back as well for health and sleeping purposes.  Charlie
wanted to stay home because he has to be on a train to Nagoya this morning,  but succumbed to peer
pressure and went for &quot;an hour,&quot; though I don't know how long that lasted.</p>
