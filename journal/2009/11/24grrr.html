<p class="note">9:25am JST Thursday 26 November 2009 (day 14491)</p>

<p>Soness got mad at me over the phone when she thought I wasn't listening to her.  She called so I
put her on speaker cause Anna and I were playing with her new iTouch and Soness was like, &quot;yeah
I think she should take it back, especially before she starts putting any apps on it; there will be
a new one out soon and she can get that one instead,&quot; cause Anna got it to act as a backup
camera, but oops it doesn't have a camera.  Anna, listening and smiling, was shaking her head no no
no no not going to take it back, so we had a bit of a laugh and then I was like, &quot;okay; I'll
tell her,&quot; and Soness goes, &quot;you don't have any interest in this coversation, do
you?&quot; and I go, &quot;nope; it doesn't matter to me if she takes it back or not,&quot; as
Soness was like, &quot;okay put me on with Anna,&quot; and then goes, &quot;what do you mean?&quot;
and I go, &quot;Anna is a big girl and can make her own decision,&quot; and then silence.  I go,
&quot;do you want to talk with me or with Anna?&quot; &quot;Neither; bye.&quot; and she hung up.</p>

<p>Anna and I looked at each other like, &quot;wha??&quot;</p>

<p>Soness wrote me a note</p>

<p>And I wrote her a note</p>

<p>And that was it.</p>
