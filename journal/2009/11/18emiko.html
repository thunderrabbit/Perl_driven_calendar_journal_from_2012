<p>Just finished lesson with Emiko.  She's stopped doing homework, but still brings Metropolis
magazine which we use for fodder, plus catchup on the past two weeks of stories.  I invited her to
take yoga lessons as well, and imagine there's a 30 percent chance we live in a universe where she
will.</p>
