<p>Tried sortof a new way of coding today.  For the past several pages, I've been thinking,
&quot;well that's just like this page, but with these few changes, and taking the other page and
copying all the code and making a few changes.  But today I started from scratch, and drew out my
almost flowchart but mostly psuedocode, and then started writing, but only pulling in little bits of
code at a time, so I was more sure to only get the bits I needed, and to build the page up a bit at
a time instead of all at once.</p>

<p>I think this second technique will give cleaner code in the end, and I think that it's only
become possible after I really pretty much know all the bits of code we use and know what does what
and goes where.</p>
