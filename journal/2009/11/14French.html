<p>&quot;Bonjour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bonjour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;C'est va?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;C'est va.&quot;</p>

<p>That was the extent of a conversation I had with a woman who greeted me as she walked past me on
a bench in Shibuya station (waiting for Inokashira Line).  She and her two kids(?) were laughing
and having fun as they walked, so I watched as they went by.</p>

<p>I somehow remembered quickly enough the answer to c'est va? to answer quickly enough to sound
normal.</p>

<p>Wow!  I used French in real life!</p>
