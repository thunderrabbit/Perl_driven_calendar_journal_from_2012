<p class="dream">Driving Scott through some gentle curving hills when it began to rain, but I was
too busy enjoying the speed to slow down or anything safe and then there was a car in front of us
and I had to tap the brakes and suddenly, we had no traction whatsoever and I knew we were goig to
crash so I saw a vine and grabbed it to pull myself to safety while Scott continued on into the
forest and stopped.  I was like &quot;whooo hoooo&quot; on the vine but a little sad that I had
wrecked my car. I walked over to get Scott and I looked at the damage: the back axel was bent, the
back radiators were crunched sideways, and the whole back end looked like it had been crushed a bit.
and Fred came up and was all, &quot;you aight?&quot; and I was like, &quot;yeah&quot; and he helped
me carry Scott back; we each grabbed a side and were carrying it like box between us as I told him
the story, &quot;I was coming down this curve here,&quot; and he goes, &quot;right here?&quot;
pointing to the little 4 meter radius curve into the driveway, and I go &quot;no no no; I was coming
down *fast*, and was on both inner edges of *this* curve,&quot; pointing to the 50 meter radius
curve toward the right and then equally large radius toward the left and Fred goes,
&quot;whoah&quot; and the people behind him go &quot;woooo&quot; and I was like, &quot;and I tapped
the brakes and was suddenly like 'we ain't got no traction,' and I knew in that second that Scott
was going to crash, so I completely discarded any ideas of saving the car, but I knew *I* wasn't
going to crash,&quot; and Fred interrupted me, &quot;how do you spell *I*, when you say it like
you're singing?&quot; and I got &quot;asterisk i asterisk, but anyway, I saw the vine and grabbed it
to fly out of the car to safety and Scott crashed down there so I want to ask you, was there
anything I could have done?  hit the gas to make up for having hit the brakes?&quot; and Fred goes
&quot;well,&quot;</p>

<p>and I woke up.</p>
