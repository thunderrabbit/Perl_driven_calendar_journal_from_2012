<p>Not R.O.B.O.T., my religion, but Robot, my friend, is trying to crawl out of the sand at the
beach in Chigasaki.  I met him last weekend when he had only 1 finger slightly out of the sand.  I
helped him get three fingers out on that day, and gave him three rings: one for each finger, and
then a bracelet.  Today helped him get one more finger out!  I found some more bracelets for him to
wear; I hope he likes them.</p>
