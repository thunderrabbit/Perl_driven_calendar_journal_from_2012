<p class="date">10:26am JST Sunday 25 October 2009 (day 14459)</p>

<p>Worked until like 8:26pm and ran to Shibuya station to get my train at 8:35.  Made it with a bit
more than a minute to spare.</p>

<p>Got home and Alfonzo texted me basically saying come in at 9:30, but I already bought my ticket
for tomorrow's train (8:44am).  I imagine it will be fine.</p>

<p>Today's work included finishing the screen for editing user accounts, and making a screen for
resetting forgotten passwords.  I'm getting faster at coding in this environment.</p>
