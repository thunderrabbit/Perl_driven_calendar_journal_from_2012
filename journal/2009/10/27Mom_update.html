<p>So on the 26th, after Soness's mom called to say she had missed the flight, they spent 5 hours on
Skype spiraling around in conversation about a whole mess of things and they decided her mom would
call back at 8pm but she didn't call so, uabwmaah, Soness cried herself to sleep.  I woke up a few
minutes later and told Anna the updated status.</p>

<p>The next morning (27th), Soness's mom called all chipper, &quot;okay; it's handled!  I arranged
the flight so I can leave in 12 hours from now and be there soon!&quot; but Soness was like,
&quot;um, no; you didn't call me last night and too much crying has been involved; I want to go
alone.&quot; So now Soness is going alone to Thailand to recharge and relax sonessly.</p>
