<p>Up late talking to Soness, or getting a bit of a talking to by Soness for characterizing myself
as the victim in a story of my relationship with Ami.  Soness had come home while I was telling Anna
about relationship with Ami after telling story of relationship with Hitomi combined with Hitomi
coming on PB with me without telling me before she bought the tickets.  I told Anna how I had
stupidly kept letting Hitomi come back to my room for the sex and about the moment she told me she
had gotten tickets.  OGC --&gt; OCC</p>

<p>I told the semi-extended remix, including how I didn't know Palestine from Pakistan when I
boarded the ship, and how I had let Hitomi hold my stuff during that trip..  then had shifted to
story of Ami and challenges of culture + language diffs.  How I had wanted to get Ami to counseling
to grieve her mother's death and how Ami had thought I meant couple's counseling for us.  Then how
Ami was really mad at me after she asked &quot;so why did we go to counseling?&quot;</p>

<p>That's about when Soness came in and was like, &quot;you forgot something,&quot; and I'm like,
&quot;what?&quot; and &quot;I don't remember.&quot; &quot;Really??&quot; &quot;It's apparently been
erased from the memory banks.&quot;</p>

<p>She switched to Japanese, &quot;あなたのわきしました,&quot; which I didn't know what that meant
but apparently I did because it reminded me and I told Anna, &quot;oh yeah, and while Ami was at her
mom's funeral, I kissed another girl.&quot;</p>

<p>We hadn't seen Soness all weekend so she told us about her great shows today and how this one fan
was all beaming smiles and dancing all the dances on the fourth row yesterday and the front row
today.</p>

<p>I started working on my latest maze for 31 October art show as they discussed options for Soness
and her mom in Thailand.</p>

<p>Anna went to bed after a bit and Soness was telling me she was a bit nervous about the Thailand
trip, and then asked if she had said anything wrong tonight.  &quot;Well, I was a bit surprised
when you said something about Ami,&quot; and Soness was like, &quot;you were making yourself out to
be the victim and when I heard you saying about Ami hitting you in the train station, I just wanted
to laugh, because I knew you weren't blameless in this, I mean what girl would <em>not</em> think
you were going to couple's counseling?  I told you she would take it that way but you still went
with her anyway what were you expecting?  First of all I can't believe she stayed with you after
you kissed Keiko, and secondly, just when it was time to take the relationship to the next level,
that's when you ran away.  It's like your old pattern.  Let me ask you, did you cheat on Wende
before you broke up with her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I must have; I was back and forth with Wende and Amanda for a while at
first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that's the girl you wanted to bring into my house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; completely different; that was, what's her name...  Madeline.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah Amanda, Madeline, there's Ms and As in there.  And Ds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Ns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What were you thinking when you went to Keiko's house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was thinking I had a lot of free time cause I wasn't seeing Ami while she was with her
family; I had asked if I should go to the funeral, but in the end she said no because she would
have to take care of me due to Japanese culture of an outside guest at a funeral so said it was too
complicated so I didn't go.  I called Keiko cause I had a lot of free time and went to her house
where we talked about PB stuff and shared about Brandt dying; he was our mutual friend from PB.  I
was fixing the pocket in my pants&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Were your pants on or off at the time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They were on; it was these pants right here, and I just pulled the pocket out through this
hole in the leg and fixed it this way, and she was physically closer than may have been necessary
to fix pants but nothing happened and I finished fixing the pocket; she walked me out and at the
very end I hugged her and was thinking <em>man I'm never really going to see her again</em> and
just gave her a quick kiss on the lips a peck and then I haven't really seen her again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you said you were groping and making out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nooo that was a different situation; and it was just joking, not sexual.  That was with
what's her name Natalia from my old apartment I had moved my hand and accidentally hit her breast
and she was like, &quot;ooops&quot; and then I did it again like jokingly, &quot;oops oops
oops&quot; and it was never like anything was going to happen but more like 'hey you have breasts
haha.'</p>

<p>&quot;Well about Keiko, you don't go to Japanese girls house; you just don't do that in this
culture.&quot;</p>

<p>And I'm thinking, <em>I don't?  <b>who</b> doesn't?</em>  &quot;Well, maybe I made a mistake in
that but I'll argue that things are different because we had been on PB together. It's a bond that
most people just don't share.&quot;</p>

<p>Soness's face was like, <em>don't give me that BS</em></p>

<p>&quot;It's true!  And yes, I went because I was feeling lonely, and I maybe probably shouldn't
have gone but I'm impressed enough that I was presient if that's the right word thoughtful enough
to not try to do more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you had done that to me, I would have gone ballistic.  I think most women
would.&quot;</p>

<p><em>I think you're projecting, or maybe I don't go for women who would go ballistic.</em>
&quot;I know you would have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You run away just when it's the chance to step up and be a man.&quot;</p>

<p>I thought about this for a while.  &quot;Up to what would I have stepped at that time?  I didn't
want to be in the relationship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly!  That's what I've been saying; that's what's so obvious to me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, things that are obvious to me are not always obvious to you.  I know computers
pretty well, but I don't see this as obvious.&quot;</p>

<p>(train arrive; to be continued maybe)</p>
