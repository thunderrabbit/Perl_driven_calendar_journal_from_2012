<p class="date">8:06am JST Monday  5 October 2009 (day 14439)</p>

<p>Today I'm taking the 8:05 train to Shibuya instead of the 8:44 train to Shinagawa + 9:35 Yamanote
to Shibuya.  The latter got me to work at 10am, and the former will get me there by 9:10am.</p>

<p>Today's the first day Alfonzo and I are going in early to work.</p>
