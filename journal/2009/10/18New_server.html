<p>I got a message a few days ago that my websites would be moved from their old server (york) to a
new server.  I got the message today that it had been moved.</p>

<p>Subject of message from Dreahhost:</p>

<b>Moved account to nicosia!</b>
</pre>

<p>Oh dear.  So I quickly wrote them a message back:</p>

Doods I'm having a problem with this move...  I've read all the documentation, searched the DH wiki,
but still no solution:

How do you pronounce Nicosia??? 

Does it rhyme with "asia?"  Is it like saying bye to a guy named Nico?  "Nico, see ya."  ??  Or
maybe Nick owes you some money, "Nick owes ya."

Wikipedia doesn't even have an English pronunciation guide for it.  Oh what to do????

Don't do too much research on this.. just if you happen to know offhand how _you guys_ pronounce it,
I'd love to know.

sub-question: Is it named after the capital of Cyprus?

    Thanks for all your hard work!
    - Rob

ps: I reserve the right to have other Qs later, but I haven't actually checked my sites, etc
