<p>Tonight, soon after I finished uploading pics of my six most recent art pieces (created for 31
October 2009 presentation), I got a call from Justin Spyderman, inviting me out to his sayonara
party.  This was about the 6th time he had called to invite me to something and the 6th time I had
turned him down since I met him at the Finda Pizza Party some months ago with Bob from Tachikawa.  I
turned him down again, and then was like, <em>ya know what, I'm gonna go</em>, and I'm on my way
now!</p>

<p>Turns out it's in Shibuya, so it costs me nothing to take the train, plus I've had an hour to
write to Simon, catch up on some email, plan to go to the Reiki Share on 25 October look
up <a href="http://www.lifeforces.org">www.lifeforces.org</a> if you wanna join, realize I'm going
to The Pink Cow again tomorrow night, AND write this journal entry.</p>

<p>I even have my poken for sale and told Justin I'll give him half of the profit, which is pretty
much the selling price because I've essentially written them off as a loss.</p>

<p>Ah cripes I need to snag a battery from one of the new ones because it appears my poken's
battery has konked out.</p>

<p>The party last night was basically a sausage fest, with about half Japanese dudes and half
foreign dudes, for maybe 15 in all.  Chatted with Don for a while who's teaching Japanese how to
embalm bodies for display at funerals and then got to dancing, once I got good and drunk on orange
juice.</p>

<p>About 2 other guys had as much energy as me and one was doing the steps of my step dance
(basically up and down a step like in an aerobics class, which is easy enough, but then I like to
add spinning around which makes it a bit more challenging).</p>

<p>Also available was a pole, which was painted and repainted in old flaked, repainted paint, so it
wouldn't have been too good for sexy pole dancing, but it worked well for monkey pole dancing.  I
wasn't sure how to best use it, but then I got a couple ideas.  One was to lift myself up for a bit
of extra air time so as I was jumping to the beat, my feet were only hitting the floor half as often
as I could have without the pole.  So if the beat is like 120 bps, I was bouncing only once every
second.  I was surprised at how hard I found maintaining that rate, as I can maintain 1/2 second (*)
bounces for a couple minutes (**) no problem.  (*, **) not that I ever really timed the frequency
nor duration.</p>

<p>But <em>then</em> I found a way more fun move, expanding on the lifting, throwing my feet into
the air so that I was nearly touching the ceiling each time (I did once).  I couldn't maintain a
consistent frequency with that, well, at least not one that matched the music well.  But it was
pretty cool.</p>

<p>Once I got tired (for the second time), I went and sat down by Justin's friend Tony who was
like, &quot;what drugs are you on?&quot;</p>

<p>none, mate.  none.</p>

<p>It reminded me of the time while walking barefoot in winter at UH and a guy asked the same
question.</p>

<p>I headed home just a bit after 10, though the party was still going pretty effectively.  Though
I had brought my contact case to stay out all night, it didn't seem like it'd be fun enough to make
that worthwhile.</p>
