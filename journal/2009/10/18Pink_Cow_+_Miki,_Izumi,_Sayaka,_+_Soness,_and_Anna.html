<p>On the way to The Pink Cow around 6pm tonight, I got an email from Miki, my student on
alternate Wednesdays:</p>

<pre>
My friends and I are going to Pink Cow on Sunday for the 'Japanese Rounge Night'.
Are you going?
</pre>

<p>I didn't reply; just showed up and she introduced her friends, &quot;this is Hitomi, and this is
Sayaka.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hitomi, Sayaka, nice to meet you,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I'm sorry, this is Izumi-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Izumi-san, nice to meet you.&quot;</p>

<p>We laughed a bit that she had gotten her friend's name wrong; it turns out they have known each
other for just a month or so since Miki's birthday party for which she took a scenic cruise from
Hammamatsucho.</p>

<p>Talked and chatted, and I noticed the drunker Miki got, the more touchy-feely she was getting
with me across the table.  Lingering touches when I showed them pictures from my phone, and then
briefly caressing my arm hair when she wanted to talk to me, and then footsies under the
table...</p>

<p>I will readily admit, at a different stage in my life, I would have been all, &quot;HI&quot; and
welcomed her advances with equally advancing tactics, and we woulda been seeking a love hotel
shortly.  But.  Right about now that's *not* in which I wish to partake, so I took leave of the
table and ran up to Traci all, &quot;eep my student is touching me and it's ooking me out,&quot; and
she goes, &quot;well, if it goes any farther, then you can say something, or you can make up a
fictitioius girlfriend, or maybe Soness will back you up on it,&quot; (Traci keeps trying to get me
and Soness together,) saying, &quot;it's not as far off as you may think.&quot; &quot;oh, I think
it's pretty far off...&quot;</p>

<p>Said HI to Soness and her most recent couchsurfer Anna who also came for Japanese Lounge Night,
which tonight featured a most unique cross-cultural trio: Akira on Aussie digeridoo, Leigh the
English rapper, and John playing Japanese shakuhachi.  They were dope and I danced on the wall for
them (with Traci's permission, which seems to have been extended indefinitely into the future
(yay!))</p>

<p>Great night overall.  Oh I also re-met Amy and Keiko who did live-painting during shamisen-master
Taro's performance on three instruments: two types of shamisen, and koto.  I uploaded those to FB.
Have *got* to get my own site a way to accept pictures quickly.</p>
