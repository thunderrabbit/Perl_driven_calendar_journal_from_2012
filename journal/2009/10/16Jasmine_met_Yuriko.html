<p>Yuriko came to The Pink Cow a bit before 9pm to meet Jasmine for their trial lesson.  We don't
yet know if she'll choose to sign up, but she said she'll email once she's decided.</p>

<p>This was the night that Jasmine and I were the only two customers for the buffet that coulda fed
30 people.  You guys don't know what you're missing!  Come chow at the Cow!</p>
