<p>Fortunately,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>only the white lock was locked, so I had the keys</p></li>

<li><p>the shop was open</p></li>

<li><p>repairs should cost less than 20,000 yen</p></li>

<li><p>I had plenty of time to get to Tachkiawa</p></li>

<li><p>TJ Bike will be ready to go next Saturday!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As a bonus, I found I had both keys all along, in my back pack, which I carry with me almost everywhere.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures, but oh well.</p>
