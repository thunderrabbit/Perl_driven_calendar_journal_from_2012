<p>I've been thinking about the meaning of life, and, in my mind, have
determined/realized/thought/noticed an interesting thing.</p>

<p>Not sure if I'll be able to put it succinctly or even at all, but let's see:</p>

<p>base axioms:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>we are experiencing the world from inside these monkey bodies</p></li>

<li><p>consciousness lives independent of these monkey bodies</p></li>

<li><p>we have free will</p></li>

<li><p>there are no rules</p></li>
</ol>

<p>tidbits I've picked up:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>faith based religions are based on making money moreso than anything else</p></li>

<li><p></p></li>
</ol>

<p>bah; I'm already side tracked.</p>

<p>The end result idea was this: our job on earth is to do whatever we do, and be awake while we
are doing it.</p>

<p>We could reach spiritual clarity by simply sitting and merging with consciousness, with no
action</p>

<p>We could run around chasing what media tells us to chase with no spiritual clarity.  (I think
our culture leans a bit far to this side.)</p>

<p>Somewhere (in several places, I'm sure), there's a balance between that includes physical action
and spiritual clarity.</p>

<p>I <em>imagine</em> that being physically active makes spiritual perception even more
challenging, so meditation practice initially includes inactivity.</p>

<p>But all of this is still just mental masturbation.  I still haven't perceived union with the epp.</p>
