<p>Weird weird stuff regarding the trains this morning!  I arrived at Chigasaki at 8am and it was
loaded with people, and even some police officers.  Despite the obvious standstill of people all
the way from the ticket gate back down the hall and all the way down the steps, I snuck my way
along with a thin line of people who were headed to the Sagami Line, the one single line that was
working.  (It immediately veers left (north?) when leaving Chigasaki station)</p>

<p>I got to the ticket gates and saw a few police officers chilling and perhaps doing crowd
control, but everyone was under control and just standing patiently or making their way to the
Sagami Line.</p>

<p>I went down to the Sagami platform and wondered if I could somehow get to Shibuya though some
backstreet tracks..)  Certainly I could, but I didn't know how to check.  I mean yeah I can check
from point A to point B, but don't know how to tell it to filter the results.  Don't use Tokaido
Line!</p>

<p>Decided it would be better to go home and work from home for a bit than to waste time on the
platform so I did that.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, I understand the lateness.  Someone probably jumped into an oncoming train and
barfed up the commute for tens of thousands of people(*), plus will make his family barf up tens of
thousands of dollars(**) in fines.</p>

<p>(*) probably pretty accurate number</p>

<p>(**) just a guess</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At home, I cut-n-pasted-n-slightly-modified 6 lines of code in about 5 places, and fixed a
couple of other errors I noticed, and then did something else and decided it was about time to try
the trains again.</p>

<p>Got to talk to Soness a little bit; she woke up just about 15 minutes before I planned to head
out.</p>

<p>Took a picture of her hand waving and throwing peace as I left.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>When I got back to the station, everything seemed fine.  It was all cleaned out; everyone had
gone home or crammed onto a train.  I got a 500 yen refund for my reserved seat ticket I had bought
the previous night and went down to the platform, intentionally missing the 11:18am train bound for
Tokyo in favor of the 11:24am train bound directly for Shinjuku.</p>

<pre>
11:18   TOKYO   15 CARS  5
11:24  SHINJUKU 15 CARS  5
11:32   TOKYO   15 CARS  5
</pre>

<p>Then the weirdness started.</p>

<p>I looked at my clock after I thought enough minutes had gone by for my train to come, and sure
enough, it was 11:26.  I looked up at the sign:</p>

<pre>
11:32   TOKYO   15 CARS  5
11:48   TOKYO   15 CARS  5
</pre>

<p>WTF?  Where did the 11:24 train go?  I was standing right here; I sure didn't miss it.. wtf?????</p>

<p>Time kept on ticking, ticking; time kept on ticking, ticking, and no train came.  Around 11:40
or so, a train that *could* have been the 11:24 train I wanted when blasting by without stopping!
wtf???</p>

<p>I looked back up at the marquee:</p>

<pre>
11:32 SHINAGAWA 15 CARS  5
11:48   TOKYO   15 CARS  5
</pre>

<p>WTF??   The train isn't going to Tokyo anymore?   what is happening here??</p>

<p>Time kept on ticking, ticking; time kept on ticking, ticking, and no train came.  around 12:00pm
an announcement came on, [so sorry, but the train will be coming around 12:15.  thank you for your
patience.]</p>

<p>good grief!</p>

<p>The train came at 12:15, and was packed, plus a ton of people got on at each station because no
trains had come for 45 minutes.  SO SO weird!!</p>

<p>AND when we got to Shinagawa, we arrived at a platform fully one foot shorter than the level of
the train doors.  It's the &quot;Extra Platform&quot; in Shinagawa, for line numbers 7 and 8.</p>

<p>After that, everyhing was back to normal.  I took Yamanote to Shibuya and even got a seat all
the way there.</p>

<p>As I write this now, I'm on my way back home.  Train is on time and fine and dandy.  Got my
reserved seat and life is good.</p>

<p>Let's see what happens tomorrow when the typhoon hits!  Whoooohooooo!!</p>
