<p>Today, after sleeping in, and doig my morning meditation, I spent most of my time preparing art
pieces for my presentation on 31 October.  I think the short URLs that point to my work are
these:</p>

</ol>

<p>I was a bit bummed about the third one, which was almost done according to plan when I stuffed
it up.  dang.  Not really enough ¤ä¤ë¤­ to do it again.</p>

<p>But, it brings into focus a question about art.  Not quite sure yet what question, but something.</p>

<p>The fourth on the list I did yesterday.</p>

<p>Thanks to Soness's scanner for the quality scans.</p>
