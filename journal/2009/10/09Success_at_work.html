<p>Nice.  Just as I needed to go, I just finished the final touches on a page.  Almost finished.</p>

<p>Was trying for a long time to get a Mootools gallery thing to work, but couldn't find the right
functionality AND using MT 2.1, so Alfonzo was just like, &quot;skip the JS; just write it in
PHP.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can do dat!&quot;</p>

<p>Did dat; the trickiest bit was handling the end points.  Pretty simple overall; I think it will
be a-okay.</p>
