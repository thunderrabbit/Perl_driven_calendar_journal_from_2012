<p>Traci is back in town and was at her post at The Pink Cow.  Good to see her and chat a bit.
Good to turn in the money I have had from Cow-Go registrations and such.</p>

<p>I met with a woman named Nao who's interested in teaching English; she talked about the
possibility of teaching group lessons.  Hmmm!</p>
