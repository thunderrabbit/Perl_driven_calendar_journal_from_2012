<p>Long and productive day at work.  Got the new page finished that I started yesterday, and got a
new page well-started that I should be able to finish tomorrow.</p>

<p>I can see my skillz getting better; man it seemed to take forever during the process, but I
guess it hasn't been *that* long.  Alfonzo was like, &quot;I'll do this part and you can do that
part,&quot; but then he was like, &quot;ah, you can do this part as well so I can work on other
stuff.&quot;  So I basically did the whole thing.  Nice.</p>
