<p>I got home after the beach, dropped off my new rocks (new???) on the counter, had a bowl of
granola while using Firefox in Private Browsing mode, had another bowl of granola while researching
frameworks for Python, then checked the train schedule and realized I had to leave in like 35
minutes!</p>

<p>Good thing I had already put laundry in the washer; it finished just as I needed to catch the
train, but I had left plenty of time.</p>

<p>Rode out toward the station, then &quot;D'oh!&quot; I realized &quot;I don't have my keys to TJ
Bike!&quot; So I rode back while mentally searching for them in my brain.  I couldn't find them for
sure, and for sure couldn't find but one once I got back.  So it's 50% possible that I won't be
able to move TJ Bike today at all until I find the other key or cut the lock (which I'd hate to do;
it's a really nice lock)</p>

<p>So I'm definitely later than I had hoped, but I *still* might make it in time (I had left 2
hours leeway in which I need to walk from Hirama to TJ Bike, take TJ Bike to the shop, then walk to
Kosugi, and then from Tachikawa to RC class.</p>

<p>If I can't move TJ Bike, I'll have loads of time.</p>
