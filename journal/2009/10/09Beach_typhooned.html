<p>Lotsa people at the beach this morning, checking out the relatively minor damage in terms of
property, but pretty significant loss of sand in terms of beach.</p>

<p>Most amazing to me: several of the tetrapods of the T had been broken by the waves.  W to the O
to the W, WOW.  Just wow.  I had seen broken tetrapods before, but now I know how they probably
were broken.  Wow.  Waves, man.  Waves.  I was amazed enough that the semi-rusted-to-bits fence
hadn't survived, and then more amazed that several large rocks on the T had moved, but cracking of
tetrapods??  Dang.</p>

<p>I laughed hard when I saw the sand completely filling the recently-cleared water outlet.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>
