<p>Went to the beach just before I was about to leave cause Alfonzo sent me a mail, &quot;can we
make it noon instead of 11?&quot;

<p>There was some sort of marathon happening with participants featuring jersey numbers between 700
(or so) and 19800 (or so).  Most of the numbers I saw were in the 18000 and 19000 range.</p>

<p>Riding carefully along with the runners, I marveled at their tenacity to run run run run.  Some
of the quadraceps I saw were huge.</p>

<p>(We have biceps, triceps and quadraceps; are there uniceps or monoceps or the like?)</p>

<p>I rode down to the gross water outlet and got a picture of the 4 fingered robot climbing out of
the sand.  I wonder what his name is.</p>

<p>Carefully rejoined the runners for a bit and rode from the robot to the T.  Hmmmm I need to
document these places a bit on my wiki.  Here's a draft:</p>

<b>The Wall</b> / <b>Gross water outlet</b>

If I go down the beach-bound street closest to Chez Soness, and go left along the beach about 150
meters, I'll get to a low wall that extends from the seawall to the sea.  The wall has a partner
next to it, and together they make an outlet for gross water to slurry its way to the ocean.

I've spent some time wave-watching/reading/sleeping/sitting/meditating on this wall, and some time
collecting rocks, shells and green wire rings near the wall.  I've played Wave Racers a few times,
marveling at the water's ability to move heavy rocks as easily as styrofoam.

One day, I found a metal bar in the sand so I went to collect it, but when I picked it up, it stayed
connected to something in the sand.  I dug down to dig the whole thing up, and found another metal
bar.  Then immediately found *another* metal bar!  They were all affixed to something quite heavy
and hidden beneath the sand and gravel.  Then I realized the amazing truth: they're fingers of a
Robot trying to get out of the sand!!

Shocked, and inspired to help the Robot out, I dug down further, but couldn't get him out.  The
waves keep coming back too frequently and erase my digging work.

I took some of the green wire rings and put them on the Robot's fingers, to let him know he is loved
and will be treated like a Robot prince once we get him out.  One ring for each finger, and then a
bracelet around all three fingers.

A week later, I went to see how my Robot friend was doing.  He hadn't been able to get any further
out, but when I helpfully dug around his fingers, I found a fourth finger!  We're making progress!

I gave him some more rings and bracelets.  He'll be the most blinginest Robot around once we get him
out.

A few days later, I found he was holding a rock.  Word.

<b>Willy the Robot</b>

Willy the Robot was born of a normal Robot factory, but just as his brain chip was being install, a
lightning strike hit the factory lightning rod, which just a few minutes prior had been knocked
loose by a srong gust of wind, and the factory robot maintenance staff had sprung to work getting it
reattached.  Through some magic of synchronicity and storytelling, when the lightning strike struck,
all their AI brainpower was transferred to Willy the Robot's brain chip, giving him the AI of four
robot factory workers in addition to his originally planned brain.

Anyway, he became more sentient than the rest and broke free from his robotic lifestyle and ended up
stuck in the sand in Chigasaki after a wind surfing accident.

<b>Chigasaki T</b>

The T-shaped human-made rock penninsula thing is probably not called Chigasaki T in real life.  It's
about 150 meters to the right of where one would arrive at the beach if one went down the
beach-bound street closest to Chez Soness.

I like to barefootedly rock hop on these rocks.  They're all stable, usually dry (unless it's
raining), and most are smoothish, making a generally even surface on which one can run.  But they
feature gaps between them that could easily capture a leg, so I gotta be careful, genki, and able to
see when I rock hop on them.

<p>I rock hopped on the rocks from the bottom of the T to the top, two full back-and-forths along
the top bar of the T, and then back from the top to the bottom.  I was pretty puffed out after
doing my run, and my feet felt a bit tenderized, but I didn't feel the sting of any cuts.  Nice.</p>

<p>Headed home and took a shower.</p>
