<p>Afterward, we headed out for drinks at a coffee shop, at which I (di)splayed all the unnamed
drawings on the table so we could look for names in them.  (These were the ones I had done on the
train, and the six we had done as exquisite corpses during the  presentation.  At that time, we/I
came up with names for these:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/mgs">Mardi Gras Snake</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/eqfo9">Facicle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/eqto9">Tempest</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/kmm">Kings Metro Map</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/k">Akiko's Map</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/l">できない</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/abco9">angelbearcloud</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/tyo9">二人のhomework</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The last one was a source of great entertainment for us, as they tried to figure out what the
densely colored portion of the drawing signified.  Basically I would not tell them except,
&quot;when you know, you'll know.&quot; and soon enough, Yuko got it, and then Akiko got it after
that, but she kept saying, &quot;well, maybe,&quot; so I was like, &quot;no you didn't get
it,&quot; and then she &quot;gained confidence,&quot; so I was like, &quot;aight,&quot; and called
the piece 二人のhomework, a mangling of Japanese (&quot;2 people&quot;) and English
(&quot;homework&quot;) and a の in between which indicates ownership.</p>

<p>They made joke plans to call each other to figure out the answer and teams of those in the know
and those who will go to their graves with the question on top of their mind.  

<p>On the way from the coffee shop to the station, I changed the name of 二人のhomework to 三人の
homework, because it turns out Akiko did *not* figure it out.</p>

<p>Only later did I name these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/eqso9">Stargate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://art.robnugen.com/hto9">Heart Tree</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And then at home I renamed 三人のhomework to &quot;Team Yuko&quot;</p>
