<p>Afterward, we headed out to dinner and saw a couple of Halloweenly dressed people on the way from
Rimi's house and in the train stations.</p>

<p>Had dinner at a British pub called FootNik, near Âçºê station, at which a group of sports/movie
buffs were doing some sort of quiz night.  Our group got about 12 points on the quiz, none of which
were sports nor British related.  I got all three Halloweeen Qs and all three medical Qs and a
couple of others.</p>
