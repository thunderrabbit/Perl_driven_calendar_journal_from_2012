<p>Just now on the train headed home from work.  Basically at work 11 hours today, minus an hour
lunch to say HI and Bye to Kumi, plus give her a book to give to Helma in OZ.  I'm so excited for
Kumi going for 6 months!  Wowowow</p>

<p>We ate lunch at the keitein sushi shop semi-close to New South Exit of Shibuya.  Actually I ate 7
plates of sushi and she just had mango pudding.</p>

<p>As I watched her walk toward the station, I asked a little prayer for her to have a wonderful
trip.</p>

<p>They're certainly at cruising altitude by now; I hope everything is going perfectly.</p>
