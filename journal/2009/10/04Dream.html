<p class="dream">Working on a project of some sort, building some wooden shelves or something that
sprayed a lot of sawdust all over the house, I wanted to get finished and cleaned up before Soness
got home.  She arrived home a day early, and at the same time I got a once-in-lifetime invitation to
go on some sort of overnight trip and wanted to leave the mess and still go on the trip.  Soness was
like, &quot;well, you don't have to leave for an hour, so you can do both!&quot; I was like,
&quot;ummm,&quot; but then I realized I probably could do both the cleanup and the trip,</p>

<p>but then I woke up</p>
