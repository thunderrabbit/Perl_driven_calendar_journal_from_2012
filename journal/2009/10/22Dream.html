<p class="dream">At KTRU, I was the next DJ.  On air was a 14 minute song by Francis Dhomont (sp)
which gave me a bit of time to get back into the proverbial swing of things.  The CD was playing
pretty quietly, but soon enough it was on track 2 and I told my friend &quot;yikes it's on track 2
we gotta say something,&quot; and I went on the air, &quot;Hello you're listening to K-T-R-U
K-TRU&quot; which was are we supposed to say it?? &quot;um, Rice Radio, and we just played a song
let me check the name I had it here a second ago, actually the previous DJ was playing it, so I'll
let you know in a second what it was.&quot; As I motioned to my friend, &quot;so now we're going to
play a great number for you,&quot; to get a new CD, &quot;in just a moment it will be playing.  It's
been a while since I've been here you know man this is like oh I wish this was a dream and I could
wake up and be all 'alright, it was just a dream!' but no such luck in this case,&quot; as my friend
handed me a case &quot;haha so now we're about to play&quot; I jammed the CD into the player and it
jammed, &quot;a song for you as soon as the CD player accepts it,&quot; the case was blank,
&quot;but I don't know the title right now,&quot; and the music finally started playing so we were
okay.</p>

<p>I didn't realize it *was* a dream until a long time later when I woke up naturally.  &quot;hey alright,
it *was* a dream!!&quot;</p>
