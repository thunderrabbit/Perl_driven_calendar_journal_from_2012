<p>Woooowwwwwww!!</p>

<p>There was basically zero rain, but lots of wind.  And nice and warm!!  I rode the yellow bike
down to the beach, sometimes worried that powerlines might break or trees might snap.  But
everything held tightly to where it belonged.  Getting to the beach was awesome; I was greeted with
a wave splashing up past the sidewalk!!  The sidewalk is about 20 feet above normal sea level.  So
cool!</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;HELLO OCEAN!!!!!&quot; so the ocean could hear me above the wind.  Amazingly
awesome.</p>

<p>The waves looked like we were in the middle of a rough sea, with deep troughs and waves over
really slow wavelengths.  The water was all dark and messy with sand from the beach..  And the beach
was... how to put this accurately... gone?  I mean there were large sandbags visible that formed the
sea wall, but all the sand that had been on top of them was now in the water.</p>

<p>A large canyon (not as big as the Grand Canyon, but it looked like a canyon) had formed where
normally we can walk down the sand to meet the sea.  The sea came up to meet me!</p>

<p>I headed toward the T, and the wind sand blasted me with sand; I had to cover my head with my
hood (glad I brought my rain coat!) and basically look straight at my bare feet while walking past
the sandy area..  Got to the T and enjoyed watching the waves crest over it from one or both sides
at the same time, and then retreat for a minute and then crest again.  Very long slow
wavelengths.</p>

<p>After several minutes of watching the pattern, I realized I'd have enough time to run past the
slightly lower part of the T and get to the top of the T to be right at the sea.  I saw waves
kersplashing at the top of the T but never flooding over it, so I knew I could hold onto the poles
and be okay.</p>

<p>Oh hey, wait a minute... Half the poles aren't there anymore.</p>

<p>Eeep..  Well, if I go to the part of the T where the poles are still intact, I'll be alright,
aight?</p>

<p>&quot;OKAY!  OCEAN?&quot; I yelled, &quot;I'M GOING TO RUN OUT TO THE T THE NEXT TIME THE WAVES RECEDE.  COOL?  IS
THAT OKAY?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't hear a specific reply, but the waves began to recede just in time so I walked after
them as they slowly rolled off the slow-sloping beach.  I made it to the first rocks of the T,
which had had their sand washed from between them.  Note to self: don't break an ankle.</p>

<p>I rock hopped from rock to rock and made it to the sign saying something about waves.  It's
always there, and firmly planted into the rocks so</p>

<p>Oh snap here comes the waves already??  and suddenly I was in water up to my thighs and then
water from the other side of the T and I was in water up to my waist.</p>

<p>I now have a tiny tiny tiny sense of what a tsunami might be like.</p>

<p>eeew!  though the water was warm, there were like large sticks and creepy things brushing
against my bare feet and legs.   eewww!</p>

<p>&quot;bad idea&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OKAY!  I UNDERSTAND!!  I'M GOING TO HEAD BACK NOW!&quot;</p>

<p>Hanging onto the sign, with water still up to my knees, I looked back at where I had been, and
it seemed a really long way away.  Damn how am I going to explain this to Soness who made me
promise not to get into the water???</p>

<p>The waves receded and I was able to see the rocks well enough to rock hop my way back.  Looking
at the water's motion, I guessed that the water into which I needed to take my next step was only a
couple inches deep.</p>

<p>step.</p>

<p>safe.  whew.  I hurried on back before the next waves arrived.</p>

<p>Watched the waves come and go back.  Watched the froth come and keep going, blown by the 50 m/s
breeze.</p>

<p>Called Alfonzo.  &quot;yeah, I'm not going to be early at work, but I'll be there on time.&quot; </p>

<p>Headed up to the sidewalk and then checked the time on my phone, thinking &quot;if it's before
8:30, I'll head down to the water thing, otherwise head back.&quot;  8:12, so I went to see the
waves near my Robot friend.</p>

<p>WOW</p>

<p>I can safely say, while I watched, the waves never receded enough to reveal his robot hand.</p>

<p>A few times the waves washed way up against the gross door, and were just about 3 feet below the
level of the sidewalk.  Amazingly deep, like 20 feet deeper than normal. wowowowowow</p>

<p>The sand sandblasted me so I was barely able to see sometimes, and the waves splashed up and
sprayed against me other times.  So coooool...</p>
