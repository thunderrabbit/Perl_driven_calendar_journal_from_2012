<p>So yeah, at work, I got two pages finished; they were basically just cut-n-paste from other
pages, and then when I had to leave to get my train I was in the middle of some major code
surgery.  I hope I'm on the right track and everything will come back into my brain when I start
in the morning.  9:10am start again tomorrow.</p>
