<p>This is the day I arrived at 2:30pm, and they asked me to come back at 3pm.  Fair enough.
Everyone knows the class starts at 3pm.</p>

<p>Class was good and full of triggers for various people, so we got to work on those things.</p>

<p>This was the first day Mamiko joined our class.  She reframed the way I've seen my nose, and
actually seemingly magically healed it from just the right nostril working to both nostrils
working.  Wow.</p>

<p>After the class, Tatiana and I traded talking time, and I told her &quot;yeah, I'm in my old
pattern again of wondering if I'm going to marry Mamiko,&quot; etc, and I realized something: that
I've been doing this since I was 10 or 12 years old.  I remember Ladonna was the daughter of the
neighbors who moved in next door, and I thought, &quot;hmmmmm; maybe I'll marry her,&quot; so this
pattern may be deeper than what it appears.</p>

<p>How can I look at this more objectively?  I mean the pattern.</p>
