<p class="dream">Watching some video about 'merika! and was like getting all pissed off about the
wars the industrial-military-government-complex has going on, plus the inflation of the Dollar, etc
and was like, &quot;yeah, part of it is effin' Bush's hick accent which reminds me of the type of
people who think he did a great service for our country.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;They destroyed our own trade towers and steal all the gold from below them so
they could start wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and soon Iran, all for a false flag operation just
like the Neocons wanted.  I mean it's not even like you have to scour the videos for evidence, the
fact that all the evidence was destroyed is enough to subpoena everyone in charge on that day.
Fuckin' Cheney to start, Silverstein made some bucks, and fuckin' NORAD, Elizabeth Nelson will talk,
and fuckin George Bush the hapless leader who signed into law his and Cheney's free rides.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And my mom was like, &quot;you might want to ixnay the uckinfay ushbay, cause he's
right there,&quot; and I looked up and saw ol' George with smarmy smile looking down on me
from below all &quot;now, why would you think that anything other than what happened
happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;George, um, Mr President, um former president, what happened to all the
evidence that day?  Why was it destroyed?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I don't know of any evidence that was destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Then where is it?  All those twisted up I-beams from the trade centers?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;It was cleaned up by the strength of our construction workers over a five
month period.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Mr President, please,&quot; and I reached out to touch his arm in a bit of
human compassion, and his guard guy started to pull out hand cuffs, saying, &quot;you cannot touch
The President,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I didn't touch him; please, oh please I don't mean anything malicious,&quot;
and the guy was like, &quot;do you know The President has a stack of money right here under his
arm?&quot; he was pointing to his armpit.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;No he doesn't,&quot; I said with disgust. &quot;what are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And then Laura came up, and I go, &quot;oh Laura, thank you,&quot;</p>

<p>and woke up.</p>
