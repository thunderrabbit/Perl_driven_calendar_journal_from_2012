<p>Met Emiko tonight for our lesson, which was just a week after our last lesson, and just a few
days after we both went to Little Shop of Horrors on Sunday.</p>

<p>Lesson included poring over Metropolis magazine, especially the little tidbit news items.
Interesting to see a little blurb on haikyos, and I was sad to not see British Mike's website
listed as a prime haikyo journalist.</p>

<p>I hope these lessons are good for Emiko; sometimes I'm not sure that I'm doing anything useful
for her... just correcting the mistakes she makes, but not really driving forward with a lesson
plan of any variety.  Hmmm.</p>
