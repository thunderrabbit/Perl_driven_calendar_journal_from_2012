<p>Wow.  It's been several days since I've written.  This morning we just got off a three day
weekend, and just now I got off work and am headin' home on the ホームライナー, next stop,
Fujisawa.</p>

<p>Um, it's getting cold.  Maybe that has frozen my ability to write.  Or maybe just been busy busy
with work and chillin' in Chigs.</p>

<p>Latest projects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>painting 80 x 60 cm.  Actually drawing, and actually a bit smaller.</p></li>

<li><p>creating an app for Facebook.  Pffft.  I wasn't able to get their hello world working in 10
minutes, without reading docs.  Oh well.</p></li>

<li><p>Got TJ Bike from my old apartment to Chez Soness!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Riding TJ Bike again was fun and made me hunger for more.  And made me hungry for food!  On
Saturday, the guy didn't have TJ ready in time, so I waited around until he finished and then rode
toward Chigasaki until it basically got too dark to make it to the next station on the line (~10km
increments).  I parked TJ Bike in a parking garage and then went to a restaurant called Bamiyan and
had gyoza plus their drink buffet.  I felt a bit cold so I really enjoyed their hot green milk
tea.</p>

<p>Back to Totsuka on Sunday and rode TJ Bike the rest of the way home.  Pretty much faster than I
had expected.  Stopped by the beach on the way home and found that my robot friend has escaped the
sand!  Super glad for him, but a bit sad for me that I didn't get to see him getting out of the
sand.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Went to see Caitlyn and TIPs performance of Little Shop of Horrors on Sunday (for the second
time, as I had seen it with Soness et. al. on Friday).  I probably wouldn't have gone a second time,
but I had told my student Emiko that my tix were for Sunday.  She got tix as well and then I was
like, &quot;wait I mean tonight!&quot; but too late, so I just decided to go again.  And see
Caitlyn.</p>

<p>((( before any rumors start, let me now say that Caitlyn is married, has no idea I think she's
cute, and there's nothing going on between us.  We're not even friends on FB.  I don't even have her
phone number nor email address.  Don't even know her last name.  And anyway, I'm officially not
dating anyone until I turn 15,000.  )))</p>

<p>Stayed after the show to help strike the set.  That involved a fair bit of unscrewing screws and
a small bit of putting things on the lift and carrying stuff from the lift to the truck.</p>

<p>Walked with Kelly and Anastasia for a bit and then said bye as they turned right toward the bar
to hang out with everyone, and I turned left toward the station to head home.  I think next time
I'll arrange to at least have the option to stay out late with the group.  Living in Chigasaki means
last train is pretty early.  Like 11:30pm.  I guess that's not *that* early, but maybe it would be
fun to stay out later.</p>
