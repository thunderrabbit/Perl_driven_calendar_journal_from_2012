<p>Today I picked up Soness's computer box which she left in a restaurant in Shinagawa (*) when she
ran out of time before her train to catch her flight to Thailand.  I picked it up, had a hand made
hand eaten meal (nan and curry) and worked on one of my most recent mazes.  I'm enjoying making
mazes.</p>

<p>(* which Anna pronounced  &quot;Shinagua&quot; yesterday; it was so cute!</p>
