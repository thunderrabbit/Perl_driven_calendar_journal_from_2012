<p>I did not bring my computer to my art presentation, but I brought some blank paperboard things
(I forgot the name in Japanese, but they're often used as signature cards to give as thank youus.)
On the train I drew four different pieces, just for an extra boost of things to show at the
show.</p>

<p>In attendance: Rimi (organizer), Akiko (my friend from English Village), Mayumi (Akiko's friend
from their class on art, Yuko and Yuko, friends of both Akiko and Rimi.  One goes by Yu-chan and
the other by Yuko, though I kept forgetting which was who so I just called them both Yuko.</p>

<p>I spoke sorta freestyle about the Q &quot;what is art?&quot; and sorta asked some Qs of them and
I'm not sure what else, but then had everyone draw on a blank paperboard (I had three big ones and
three little ones available so I had pairs じゃんけん to see who got which).  Those pieces became
exquisite corpses (as far as I understand) and most of them (except the one I started) turned out
reasonably interesting, I think.</p>

<p>At the end of the presentation, I asked everyone to choose a piece as a gift, and a color with
which I signed the back and gave them.  Yuko chose
&quot;<a href="http://art.robnugen.com/s4a">Anna's Spirals</a>,&quot; Yuko chose
&quot;<a href="http://art.robnugen.com/AMK">Arthor McKinneson</a>,&quot; Akiko chose
&quot;<a href="http://art.robnugen.com/sso9">Spaghetti Spoon</a>,&quot; Mayumi chose
&quot;<a href="http://art.robnugen.com/no3AH">No one on 3 Alien Highway</a>,&quot; and Rimi chose
&quot;<a href="http://art.robnugen.com/3WI">Three Ways In</a>,&quot; I believe.</p>
