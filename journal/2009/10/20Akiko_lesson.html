<p>Lesson with Akiko (coquelicot) was earlier than usual yesterday; my preference is to start at
7:30pm so I can leave work at 7pm (and not come back), but today I planned to go back to work
anyway, so no problem honoring her request to start earlier.</p>

<p>Back at work now hopin' to get shtuffs done.</p>
