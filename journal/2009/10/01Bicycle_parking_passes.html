<p>I got bicycle parking passes for Soness and I.  We have to park our bicycles 15 times each this
month to make them financially pay for themselves, but the time saved digging out 100 yen each time
to buy a ticket, and the security of knowing there's always a space available for us is nice,
too.</p>
