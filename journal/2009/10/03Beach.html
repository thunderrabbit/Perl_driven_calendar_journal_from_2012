<p>On the way back home after helping Soness get to her train, I took a detour to stroll on the
beach!  Glad I did cause there was a cool rainbow down the beach from me (is there ever
an <em>uncool</em> rainbow????)</p>

<p>I took a few pics and then headed the other direction where I noticed the beach was all covered
in sand, whereas a week ago there were big splotches of gravel that had been poured at frequent
intervals along the beach.  They were all covered by sand, and I though I could discern slightly
raised beach where they had been.</p>

<p>Found my <del>twig</del> <ins>log</ins> and got a picture while sitting on it.</p>

<p>Found the robot trying to get out of the beach, and while helping him out, I discovered he has
four fingers and not just three!</p>

<p>I was so excited that I forgot to take a picture and collected some verigated rocks instead.  I'm
thinking I might buy a rock tumbler and polish them, just like back in the day (10 ~ 12 years
old???, polishing rocks taken from the railroad tracks behind our house.)</p>
