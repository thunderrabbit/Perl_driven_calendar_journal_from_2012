<p class="date">8:49am JST Wednesday 28 October 2009 (day 14462)</p>

<p>Was just setting up to do my meditation in the morning (actually I've not done it in nearly two
weeks) when Soness came down to chill with me just before she heads out on a solo mother-daughter
trip to Thailand.</p>

<p>I was thankful for the connection (because we had seemed to be at odds with each other for a
couple days late last week).  I was sitting just in front of the couch and she sat on the couch
behind me.  I just sorta flopped back for a sorta reverse hug for a few minutes.</p>

<p>As much as we love and hate each other, we make good homies.</p>

<p>We're going to meet during lunch today; she'll probably come by my work (for the first time) and
bring her new PC for some quite usage tutoring.  The hardware is fine ($450 for some generic(?)
manufacturer's answer to Mac Air), but it's got Windows Vista as its OS.  I suggested that she get
it, and if the OS proves unstable, we can install Ubuntu on it.</p>
