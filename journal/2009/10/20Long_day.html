<p>On the train headed home (starting at 10:48 from Shibuya); I got to work at 9:15 and worked til I
had to meet Akiko (coquelicot, not my normal Akiko) for a lesson at 6:45.  Normally I schedule
lessons for 7:30, but she requested an early start, so I used it as a break and then came back to
work until 10pm.  Shoulda worked until 10:30pm cause I totally arrived at the station at an
inconvenient train time for me.  Had probably just missed a train that would go to Chigasaki, but
the next one wasn't until 10:48.  I waited prolly 30 minutes, eating cheese karage, drinking milk
tea, and playing with my iPhone.</p>

<p>We're closing in on beta version of the site; it'll be nice to get it sent off for testing and
then really nice to get it finished.</p>

<p>Today I was looking at some of the stinky data they've got.  `record_type` with varied data that
should be normalized.  So I rewrote the import script to normalize it.  Ah.  Much better.  Didn't
even throw away that much data.  ;-)</p>

<p>Tomorrow I need to reinstate some code I commented out, and move some code from point A to point
B.  Dang.  I really shoulda pored over the DB more carefully before coding anything.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be another long day.</p>
