<p>Anna was awake by the time I got back from <del>the beach</del> <ins>skydiving</ins>, and I
showed her the pics.  After she asked where the sumpinsumpin was in Chigasaki, I was like blah blah
blah:</p>

<p>&quot;You can just ask the police in the police box cause there's very little crime in Japan,
their job is to give directions and help return lost items to their owners.  I even reported my
stuffed rabbit as missing.  Yes really!  Oh yeah you think it's funny but lemme show you some
pictures of Francois..&quot;</p>

<p>And
visited <a href="/images/peeps/francois/">http://robnugen.com/images/peeps/francois/</a>
on my site and clicked slideshow.</p>

<p>Anna is officially the best, most compassionate listener ever, enjoying seeing all the pics of
Francois (*), and even wanting to help find him somehow once she found out he's traveling on his
own.</p>

<p>(* there's a lot more; I wonder if I can find them + time to add them to the slideshow)</p>
