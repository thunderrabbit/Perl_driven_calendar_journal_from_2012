<p>Met Soness in Shibuya; she had come from Asakusa on Ginza Line after performing in 5 shows!!  She
got to meet Alfonzo briefly and then we went to the Pink Cow while he headed out elsewhere.  Cow
Jam featured sets by three sets of performers: a quintet featuring drums, bass, guitar, vocals, and
violin, a solo artist from Sweden featuring guitar and harmonica, and a duet featuring Thomas on
vocals and someone on guitar.  There certainly may have been more after that (ustream knows the
truth), but Soness was super tired (though meeting a guy named Robert who's got an NPO thing going
on in some southeast asian countries) and I had to be on the train headed for work in ~11 hours (~9
hours now) so we left around 9pm.</p>

<p>Chatted with Traci who's working hard to keep the Cow afloat, and David who was doing the same
by running the sound board for Cow Jam.  Gleb and Rio came in (Rio's picture is currently at the top
of <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">Uncle Cow's Travels</a> website) and we chatted a bit.  He said
he would upload the pics he took with Uncle Cow well over a year ago.  We shall see!  (he's been
saying that for over a year)</p>

<p>Uncle Cow is currently at Dr Traci's; his stitches were coming out from his surgery after I
ripped his head partway off while freedom fighting with Ami.</p>
