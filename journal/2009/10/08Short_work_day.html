<p>Well, not exactly short; I did get stuff done at home, but then I arrived at work around 4pm.
The day was <em>beautiful</em>, and I definitely wanted to go play by the beach again instead of
stare at a monitor (albeit a rather large one) and tap away like a monkey.</p>

<p>Finished the first step of a page, but it's not quite right, even so..  looks like we'll have to
write the ajax part immediately rather than later.</p>

<p>We were hoping the small images could all be read in, but even with just like 90 images, they
seem to muck up the page.  I ain't sure why it would happen though; I'm still 70% thinking it's a
CSS issue instead of javascript.</p>

<p>In other news, I downloaded an <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/iphoto/">iPhoto to Facebook</a> thing after sorting out a way to <a href="http://forums.macosxhints.com/showthread.php?t=104594#2">import images
from my iPhone to iPhoto</a>.</p>
