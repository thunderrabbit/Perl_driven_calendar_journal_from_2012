<p>Today at work I worked on work related stuff, and had to bisect a huge screen into two different
screens with mostly distinct functionality.  Alfonzo said he may have us start coming in a bit
earlier to get the thing done by deadline (end of October), which is going to be a push.</p>

<p>The good thing about coming in earlier is that I can take a train directly from Chigasaki to
Shibuya and not have to change in Shinagawa.</p>
