<p>Delicious vegan buffet at The Pink Cow tonight.  It took me a while to find a seat, so I sat
next to Earl, the organizer, who was sitting with Allyn who was sitting across from Momo.  Earl
didn't stay seated very long; Allyn, Momo and I talked about traveling; Momo sailed on PB's 32nd
voyage!!!  wow wow wow</p>

<p>Momo was like doubly wow to hear I got to sail twice, and Allyn was like triply wow at hearing we
had gone three times between us.  Momo's was a southern hemisphere voyage.</p>

<p>Stories switched topics to Allyn telling us about some crazy oooky leeches he saw in Nepal.  I
was like, &quot;eeeeeeeep&quot; and squirming like a leech at the idea of a leech squirming toward
me.  きゃーーああぁぁ！</p>

<p>Moonie joined us for a bit and won the gross story contest about her mom having a painful spot in
her leg for five weeks until, a worm crawled out of it!!!  A fly or something had laid eggs in her
leg!!  With spooked looks, we all agreed, &quot;you win!&quot;</p>
