<p>On the train now heading home.  Got the 10:48pm train again, but this time timed things much
more precisely so I could spend more time working and less time playing Doodle Jump on my iPhone
while waiting for the train.</p>

<p>Nate and Alfonzo both gave me some kudos for the work I've done.  Not like a sit down meeting,
but just hey yeah that works really well; thanks!</p>

<p>Today I spent about a million hours trying to get some shtupid code to work; I still don't
really know why it was so hard to do; shoulda just been a cut and paste, or so I had thought.
Finally got it working and then set myself to finish the rest of the thing by tonight, which I
*almost* did.  I can certainly get it done tomorrow.  (please oh please)</p>

<p>Alfonzo said he's coming in on both Saturday and Sunday.  I may do the same.</p>
