<p>After talking to Soness a bit, I got out of the house just in time this morning; I rode as fast
as usual to the bicycle parking area, and fortunately, it's <del>raining</del> <ins>misting</ins> so
not many people were parking bikes and I was able to run instead of trudge up only two ramps instead
of three, because it was fully 8:41 when I looked at my clock and I had to run to the station (with
a short pause to rezip my backpack).  My train arrived just as I was approaching the station; I ran
up the stairs and dodged people milling around the ticket area and gates, then zoomed down the
stairs with a couple other people and made it in time to have to wait in line about 15 seconds while
people shuffled onto the train.</p>

<p>I have shaved it even closer before (no line getting on the train), but I like a bit more
buffer.</p>
