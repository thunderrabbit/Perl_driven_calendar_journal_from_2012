<p>The page I started yesterday and finished today actually works best as a pop-up window (an
iframe, though it might be cooler in a separate window).  It allows easy editing of text in its
parent window!  The effect isn't magic, but it works well and I hope it will be useful.  I must
admit it was Alfonzo's design; he verbally sketched out how it should work and I put it together
yesterday and today.</p>

<p>It's even got a cool bit of mootools code that I wrote with minimum fuss.  I'm sure my skillz
are getting back on par to where they should be.</p>
