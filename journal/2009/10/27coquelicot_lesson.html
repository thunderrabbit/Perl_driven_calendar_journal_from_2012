<p>Coquelicot called me at 7:32pm while I was just getting ready to head out of work.
&quot;HI Akiko!&quot;  I knew why she must have called.</p>

<p>&quot;HI Rob.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do we have a lesson right now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, um,..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't email you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's okay!  um, I can be there in 30 minutes at 8pm; is that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>So I showed my latest and greatest to Alfonzo after comitting it to SVN (I want us to get git)
and headed out.</p>

<p>Lesson was good.  Man I can remember the first times we met back in English Village Kichijoji.
She said she spoke French and my heart was aflutter.  We've never gone out nor even touched (though
she apologized when her elbow barely brushed my shoulder when she was putting on her jacket (I was
sitting at the time)) but she's certainly beautiful.</p>
