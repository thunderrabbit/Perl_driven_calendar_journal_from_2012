<p>Got home and chatted with Anna for a while; she's pretty awesome, and now also surfing at Chez
Soness.</p>

<p>Showing her some of my recently drawn art pieces, one of which I've been drawing with her in
mind, we commented that a grid of dots I had drawn looks like a grid of dots from the game dots,
in which players form squares by drawing lines within a grid of dots.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I love dots!&quot; she exclaimed.  I kept working on my piece and she drew out a grid of
dots on another piece and we played.  I may have won, but it was hard to tell cause our letters A
and R look pretty similar.</p>

<p>The good news: I was able to show her how to not take a whole series of squares, leaving the
other player with just 2 or 4 squares to capture.  Other news: she filled in 64 squares on a 15 x 13
board (<del>185</del> <ins>195</ins> squares).  I think I'll name the piece &quot;Hollow
Victory.&quot;</p>
