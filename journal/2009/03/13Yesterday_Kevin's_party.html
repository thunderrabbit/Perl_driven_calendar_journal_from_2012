<p>My dear friend Kevin and his wife are moving (with their son Kailash) to Kyoto.  Last night was
their going away party at Mac's Carrot in Meijiro.  Nice to see the peeps I know through Kevin,
especially Tomoe; dude, she's hot.  In attendance on Kevin's side: Tomoe, Romi, Denise, Andy,
Hubert, me, Ami, Steven (warrior from Indianapolis), and his friend Junichiro.</p>

<p>I'm tempted again to write a brief bio on each person who shows up in my journal, but I don't
have time, permission, nor access to my wiki at the moment.</p>
