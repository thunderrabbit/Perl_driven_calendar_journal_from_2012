Hey Malek

How's stuffs?

I don't have your phone number on my phone or I'd just call you.  Would it be okay if I visit you
guys today just to say HI and use the internet?

I'll be in shibuya soon with nothin to do until 8pm dinner at The Pink Cow.  Hope to get some (free)
internet during that time.

Thanks!
Rob
