<p>Am considering applying at NOVA, the company for which I hated working when I first got to
Japan.  But</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I quickly need to get some income coming in</p></li>

<li><p>NOVA collapsed (lawsuit due to mismanagement) and is being rebuilt by new management, so
could be completely different now</p></li>
</ol>
