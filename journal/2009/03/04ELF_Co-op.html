<p>So, I'm going to ELF COOPERATIVE to make something of it (the co-op, and my life).</p>

<p>(thanks Benjamin)</p>

<p>Good time chillin' with Mark at ELF.  I brought some white sauce to combine with spaghetti and
his secret ingredient: eggs, and we had lunch after chatting a bit while I carefully measured and
placed screws to hang <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Four_F10s_2007">four of my big
paintings</a>.</p>

<p>I gave him a shiatsu/massage/reiki treatment for 45 minutes, through 30 minutes of which he
slept, and then for the final 15 minutes I helped him pop various vertibrae in his back by pressing
in places according to his direction.  Used my full weight in some cases.</p>

<p>Though I was officially paying him in massage time for his FOREX knowledge, he gave me a 20
minute massage in return.  I slept through parts of it.</p>

<p>Afterward, we chatted over tea about plans for the place, and he basically said he's wanted to
do a lot of stuff, but doesn't have the time to do it all, so he created a space where lots of
people can do lots of stuff.</p>

<p>I'm glad I met him and thereby found this place soon after it was founded.
