<p>The screening of Zeitgeist Addendum at The Pink Cow (on Sunday; two days ago) featured about 50
people (I wrote 30 on Twitter, but now that I think about it, there was quite a crowd), perhaps 30
of whom came via the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Movie-Meetup/">Tokyo Movie Meetup</a>,
headed by YK, and the rest from various advertising and emailing of friends and friends they
brought.  Great times!</p>

<p>I made a networking mistake at the end; I succombed to Ami's request that I go home, which I
think was prompted because Manuel was outside waiting, and because of, let's say, attachment
issues (IMHO).  The real problem was my ignorance of the importance of making connections with
people, especially when they pretty much came due to my having organized the event.</p>

<p>I emailed with Traci a bit about it; I'm learning!</p>
