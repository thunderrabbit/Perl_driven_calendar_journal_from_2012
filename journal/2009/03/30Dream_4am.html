<p class="dream">Dreamt that Meg Robinson confided in me as her brother, saying &quot;we just did
some mushrooms...  it was okay, but it would be better with *you*&quot; and she curled up in my lap
like a cat or a child.  I said, &quot;well, I've been considering doing mushrooms, so...  I'll come
out there and watch or perhaps join you.&quot;  She goes, &quot;really?&quot; and was all smiley
and licking just under my nose like a cat. </p>

<p class="dream">We went outside and were next to the Zbylot's old house on Methil, and climbed into
a screened in area for tools.  Meg's friend was face down on the ground and still experiencing her
mushroom adventure.  Meg and i sat down and then Kate came out to say something but then the noisy
nosey neighbor opened the window all, &quot;hey you girls havebeen playing out here for a while, and
Mike's trying to practice piano.&quot; I go, &quot;so what are you tring to say?&quot; and he was
all, &quot;what if Mike goes to bed and doesn't know you're out here??&quot; and he's like,
&quot;you just need to think about that.&quot; and Kate and I both go, &quot;think about
what???&quot; And he's like, &quot;exactly.&quot; and we go &quot;wtf?  it's not like we're being
loud!&quot;</p>
