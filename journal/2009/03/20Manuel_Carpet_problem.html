<p>Manuel was like, &quot;I have nothing to do,&quot; cause today's a holiday, and the day that he
leaves Japan, so all his stuff is packed, and he's waiting until 4pm for Sakura House peeps to
confirm his room is clean and take his key and lock him out of his room.</p>

<p>After he gave us a coin-problem last night; I thought he might enjoy The Carpet Problem.  I know
I've written it up before, but not sure where.  Search for &quot;9 x 12 carpet, 1 x 8 piece, 10 x 10
remainder&quot; or some variant to find the problem and try to solve it yerself.</p>
