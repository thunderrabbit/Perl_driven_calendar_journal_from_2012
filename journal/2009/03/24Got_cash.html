<p>Grabbed 140,000 yen cash from my account, which I have calculated will plenty-cover my OZ
adventure, and I *double dog* hope that the value of the yen will be pushed down after the Japanese
financial year begins on April 1st, meaning I can make back a bit of profit when I change the AUD
back to JPY when I get back.</p>

<p>We'll see if it happens, but only if I remember to keep track of the exchange rates each way.</p>
