<p>Third ISIS of this week, transcribed from diary:</p>

<pre>
With Jacquelen, touching right kidney area, right along bottom rib line

This ISIS shit is shit I don't see/feel/perceive shit.  Sadness sadness.  All my project are
unstarted and unfinished websites, courses, classes, languages, trips, girls, fear of commitment.

&quot;You're feeling the sadness.  What's it like to feel this underlying pattern of unfinished
projects?  Get into your 3rd eye and feel the point (under Jacquelen's fingers)&quot;

and I did that and began to see a purple spot in my closed eyes.

wha?  is that it?  excitement (?) shhhh  just relax and stay with it.
