<p>Kevin and I have often-times gone to the nearby Indian restaurant to get tea and nan slash curry.
I usually get just cheese nan and lassi, and he would usually get something more filling.  Today
David joined us, getting a salad and nan.  I got just cheese nan, and Kevin got just tea.  
&quot;エックチャイ&quot; the way he would ask for it in India.</p>

<p>Talk was mostly about men's group stuff while David was there, and then he headed out to begin
his one hour ride home.  Kevin and I switched to our more common topic of the latest antics with
his son Kailash (named after a mountain), and my latest questions about spiritual development.</p>
