<p>Snippets from my email to Paige</p>

Paige!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm not trying to win the slow email contest, but maybe I have!

Right now (24 March 2009) I'm waiting for my flight; headed to OZ for 10 days, 8 of which will be
spent in an intense emotional cleansing process called ISIS...  *maybe**** I told you about it, but
not sure!  A friend of mine did the same course and came back with eyes shining.  nice...

Okay, and now (25 March 2009) I'm in a hostel in Sydney, chillin' in Sydney for two days, trying to
catch up with email before my 8 days without internet access..

Life is exciting as always... I've loved seeing your updates via Facebook / Twitter(?)  Facebook,
right?  yeah, anyway, via the internet I've enjoyed little glimpses of your life scubadiving with
wildlife and your wild life on shore as well.

Ah, so my life includes a more and more energized job search, as I haven't had much income since
$8000 for clinical drug trial in February.  Have done an art show, and taking shiatsu (acupressure)
lessons, and doing what *I* want to do instead of chasing money.

This 8-day retreat will hopefully reveal some insights in myself so I can do what I love *and* make
a living!
