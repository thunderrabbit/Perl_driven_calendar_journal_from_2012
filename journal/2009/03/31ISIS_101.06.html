blackness huge space bubble always with me.  Inside it I am safe and warm but it's sadness.

yes i see a light

Go to it.

back at Source, school, sitting, relaxing, basking

Open to what to do.  Aware of dark space in my heart.

[Click]  turn on the light.

Shine the light out through my heart.  To all beings, to all people, to all things.

That's part of my work on earth.
