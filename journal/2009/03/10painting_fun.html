<p>Yesterday I brought some of my painting equipment (two markers) downstairs, and was working on
&quot;Purple Glow&quot; (or is it &quot;Glowing Purple&quot;??) before it was named.  Manuel came
home and cooked dinner, during which I gave him some shiatsu goodness, and then Nina came down and
they both ate while I continued painting.  (Manuel did offer to cook some for me as well.)</p>

<p>Nina, watching my painting progress, jumped at the offer to draw a bit on it.  &quot;of
course!&quot;  So I went up and got the rest of my markers and a blank B4 size paperboard for them
to use.  Together, they created a great piece, though it's not finished yet.  Most likely, I won't
make any marks on it whatsoever before putting it into my show this weekend.  We haven't sorted out
a price for it, or who gets paid what if it sells, but Manuel said he wouldn't want any money for
it.  I'll ask them tonight or so.</p>

<p>While we painted, I thought, <em>dang; if I had been spending all my free time painting while
I've been in Japan, I'd certainly have had several shows and be on my way to doing this full
time.</em>  But then I released the &quot;should have&quot; aspect, and any regrets, and just
focused on this moment.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad I've started painting.&quot;</p>

<p>Manuel was like, &quot;what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad to have started painting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you hear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;studied.&quot;</p>

<p>Think think think, 'ah, <em>studied</em> instead of <em>started</em>.'  &quot;Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you studied computers, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm glad to be <del>painting</del> <ins>journaling</ins> right now.</p>
