<p>I'm making a bit of an example page to be hosted
at <a href="http://thunderrabbit.bob.buttobi.net/">http://thunderrabbit.bob.buttobi.net/</a> as
part of a skills test for making a website.  It's interesting to get this as part of a job
interview.</p>

<p>I'm creating this page by hand using Emacs.  Actually I create nearly all my pages by hand with Emacs.</p>

<p>Ah crap.  I just re-read the directions; they don't want any reference to this being a job
interview.  Aight; I'll make some カワイイ なんとか。</p>
