<b>Happy Beans Day!!</b>

Dearest Beanest

Your loveliest painting is chillin' safely right here beside me.  I just want you to know it will
almost certainly be in your possession by your *next* birthday (in 2010).  I 99.9% guarantee it will
be there!  Thank you for telling me you don't care how long it takes.  :-) I wanna make sure it gets
there safer than faster.

I am headed out to Australia, and will arrive on the 25th, and chill in Sydney for your birthday, and
then head 4 hours west of Sydney with NO INTERNETS for 8 days, and then back to J-pan, arriving on
April 6th.

    Love Love Love Love
     - Robest!
