<p>Up early (after a lovely sleep; thank you, sand man!) and about to visit internet cafe for one
more up-and-download of emails, plus upload of journal entries.</p>

<p>Not sure if Hidden Valley is the name of a city, a valley, or the retreat center, but will find
out within probably 8 hours, and post the answer in 8 days!  The plan is to have internet access
again on April 5th, and be back in Tokyo on April 6th.</p>
