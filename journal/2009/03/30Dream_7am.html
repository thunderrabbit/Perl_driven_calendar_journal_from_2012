<p class="dream">Carrying my cute cat Spot through some water drenched train track areas...  I
miscalculated and he got just slightly less wet than had he been swimming.  I carried him even
closer to keep him warm.  We arrived halfway there and Wende and her friends were there looking for
us to guide us home.</p>
