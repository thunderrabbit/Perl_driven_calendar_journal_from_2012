<p>My art is still up at ELF in Tachikawa!  Three paintings sold during my recent art show, which I
guess should now be referred to as my recent art <em>opening</em>, and Mark and I decided the rest
of the paintings looked good and should stay up on the walls!  Nice!</p>

<p>So, if you're in Tachikawa, stop by <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/elfcooperative/">ELF
CO-OPERATIVE</a> and check out my art!  The pieces are all for sale, and soon will all have their
own URLs at art.robnugen.com.   Haven't figured out details yet, but yes yes yes!</p>
