<p>Strictly speaking, I have liquids with me.  Oh-so-dangerous dihydrogen-oxide in a equalized
solution with sodium-chloride.  I'm wearing my contacts at the moment and if I wanna pop dos
badboys out during the flight, I have a bit of saline to support said procedure.  I carried it in
my pocket through the metal detector, assuming it wouldn't detect any amount of liquid (my skinsack
is full of liquids), including not detect a couple CCs of saline in my contact case.</p>

<p>My ÌäÂê»ù (problem child) sticker right on my laptop didn't cause any concern either.  I'm glad
about that.</p>
