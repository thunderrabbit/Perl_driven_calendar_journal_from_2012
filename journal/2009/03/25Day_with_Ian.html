<p>Have been walking around with Uncle Ian today, who showed me to the least expensive hotel in
Sydney, got a better deal than advertised, bought me lunch in a Chinese food court, showed me great
place to buy socks and t-shirts, bought me AUD$0.30 ice cream, showed me great internet cafe ($10
for 7 hours), and tried to help me get some Crocs.</p>

<p>Countlessly thankful for him guiding me around the area.</p>

<p>Was actually able to help him with a computer question he had about a Japanese website.</p>

<p>Ah.  Just had a nice nap.</p>
