Robin was my connector

touch on side (where I thought Steven would touch)

Civil war bayonette

She was the woman I love most ever ever ever. my wife was a native american and knew everything
about the land and earth and everything.  So much love for her.  Now I keep looking.

Rei was the best, and right there...  so much anger at myself to have not broken up with Hitomi and
lose Rei as a result.

Now I'm with Ami and knowing I should break up with her, but fuck how?  Why can't I?  She's cute she
cooks she's great but isn't for me.  I keep looking

First it was Robin, but oh she has Neil.  Then Jacquelen, but ah she has Simon.  Now Tina looks
pretty cute but ARGH this is a stupid cycle.

I just need to do my work.  I'm going to build a retreat center and train people like Helma. I have
so many talents but what to do?  just do my work and she'll come.

<p>Questions that arose during feedback circle:</p>

<p>Is it possible that my lack of responsibility keeps me from having what I want?</p>

<p>What is it about the DESIRE?  I &quot;want&quot; to do the work, but what's under that want?</p>
