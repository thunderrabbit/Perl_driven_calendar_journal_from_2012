<p>Yesterday I set up my paintings at ELF in Tachikawa.  Everything looks great with the bright
lights shining down on 'em.</p>

<p>Mark and I went to his place to scan all the paintings (on his &quot;normal&quot; sized scanner,
so the larger paintings had to be scanned in sections.)  Not sure yet how the big ones will look,
but the small ones are great and will be posted in the art section of my wiki &quot;soon.&quot;</p>

<p>I set up <a href="http://robnugen.com/art/">robnugen.com/art</a> to redirect to the Art section
of my wiki, but there's essentially no content there yet.</p>
