<p>Met up with Jesse near Gaba in Shibuya and wandered toward some food whereupon we happened upon
Roscoe and Jason at a conveni!  Hadn't seen them for days and days (3 years?)..  Roscoe has just
quit Gaba; he had become a manager of sorts and perhaps coulda gotten me a job, but he's going to
focus on music, which he hadn't done in two years.  I forgot to ask him about his judo (?) which he
had been doing between lessons at Gaba.  Cool to see them both so genki.</p>

<p>Jesse bought me a fish filet sandwich and a shake at a fast food restaurant and we chatted while
watching people walk by and he told me about his new job as a minister/teacher up in Saitama.  I'm
super happy that he'll be doing that which he loves to do (preachin' the good word of the Bible),
and super happy to get to see him before he quits visiting Shibuya as often.</p>

<p>His dad will be comin' for a visit this week (!) and I wished him the best for that.  He said
it'll be a bit weird.  I hope it's great, though.</p>
