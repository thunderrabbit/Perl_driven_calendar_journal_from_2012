<p>Aight; I've just written 11 messages which are in my Gmail Outbox (thanks to Gmail's offline
access via Gears), and am going to the internet to send them all soon.</p>

<p>couple other things to do while online:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>* Add Nim to my Rob Updates list</p></li>

<li><p>* get a detailed map of where to meet David.</p></li>

<li><p>* make sure I'm to meet him on the 27th, not the 26th</p></li>

<li><p>* download podcasts of Eckhart Tolle</p></li>

<li><p>X (see if I can borrow a USB cable and) upload U-Cow pic to his site</p></li>
</ol>
