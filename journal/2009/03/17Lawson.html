<p>So right now I'm in my old Lawson convenience store, where I befriended some of the staff
(two-thirds of whom have moved on to different jobs or different stores).  Tsunashima-san still
works here so I like to say HI to him on occassion.</p>

<p>Today, he asked, &quot;how are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;元気。おなかすいた。&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;hungry..&quot; he confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;haha yes.  genki and hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>I got a single うどん item, the name of which I couldn't read, but I saw it featured the most
kilocalories per unit price.</p>
