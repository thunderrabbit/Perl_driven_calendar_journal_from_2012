<p>Meeting Tariq at noon today; we plan to get flash videos working on his site again.  I don't
know how he had it set up before, but he says they suddenly stopped working.  Could be anything.  I
found <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/">JW Player</a> which seems well
supported and reasonably likely to work.</p>

<p>Some good news: Tariq has offered to pay me to get this working on his site.  yay!</p>
