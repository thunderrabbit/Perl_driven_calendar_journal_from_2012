<p>I've been meditating each morning for the past couple weeks, right around 7am (though a few hours
late yesterday).  Using the Clairvision style of meditation, I've gotten about as much result as any
other style: generally I tend to fall asleep.  Have begun to begin seeing a bit of a difference
between sleep and meditation-sleep, but maybe I'm just fooling myself and there is no
difference.</p>
