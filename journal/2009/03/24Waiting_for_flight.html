<p>I sat next to the TV (so I can't see it (just chill in its electromagnetic radiation. (Actually
it's a flat screen so I don't know how much of that there is.)))  Plugged in my laptop and my
Little Blue Monkey (the name of my blue-cased iPhone), and my headphones so I can't <em>hear</em>
the TV either.  It had an announcer and guests jabberin' about the news that Obama is (apparently)
going against his campaign promises and keeping the secret prisons open for a year and sumpin'
sumpin' sumpin'.  Bah.</p>

<p>In better news, there are two (2) infants within a meter of my seat, and two new(?) mommies
having a little mommy chat about their prized creations.</p>

<p>When the first small person arrived, I tossed Uncle Cow onto the ground near her.  Mommy smiled a
bit, and baby's quick taste test proved U-Cow wasn't particularly exciting.</p>
