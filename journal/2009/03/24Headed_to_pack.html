<p>Headed home now to pack.  Pretty much I've got everything semi-ready, though there are a couple
items I still need to buy: flashlight, and white t-shirts.</p>

<p>The T-shirts will work for me after the course as well; I need to get some for suit-and-tie
interviews and possible job.</p>

<p>During the course, clothing should be light colored and plain so as to keep pure energy during
meditation.  No visual distractions for participants and nothing to attract astral energies that may
arise.</p>

<p>Am considering buying Crocs as well; mine have developed some decent sized holes, so that if I
wear socks with Crocs, the socks come home with matching holes, darnit!</p>

<p>The shop in Shibuya didn't have my size.  I imagine it will be easier and less expensive to buy
these items in OZ.</p>
