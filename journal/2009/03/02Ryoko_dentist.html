<p>Just finished a little dental appointment.  They recovered two spots they had covered previously,
from which those covers removed themselves recently.  I also asked them about a spot that would cut
through my dental floss with just a few swipes.  They uncovered a hole the size of California (*)
and filled it in with a similar cap.  So that my floss doesn't remove the cap, I'm now supposed to
floss into the gap, but horizontally out instead of vertically.  I guess that'll mean I floss that
spot last, so I can finish with the horizontal floss flourish instead of a vertical jerk with cap
removal.  In other news, I've got a bit of a silly crush on ¤ê¤ç¤³'s smile and attempts at English.
Invited her to call me for English lessons.  She said she's busy cause she is looking for a new job
in addition to her current one.</p>
