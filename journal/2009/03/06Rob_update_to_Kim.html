HI Kim

I was laid off from my too-low paying job in December, but that coincided nicely with three things:
1) wanting to quit or get paid more
2) my brother coming to town for 3 weeks
3) my participation in a clinical drug trial right after my brother left Tokyo

After coming back to Tokyo with $8000 from the clinical drug trial, I began looking for some
opportunities doing the type of work *I* want to do: artistic, healing, modeling (not likely as a
single job).

I applied at a modeling agency and immediately learned of a quick modeling job at which I met a new
character in my life, Mark Henne.  Mark has the same first name and voice of my friend Mark from
Houston, so I started chatting with him, and we have subsequently been hanging out a bit.

Mark has been in Tokyo for quite a while, and has recently built a space he calls ELF COOPERATIVE,
or just ELF, which stands for Earth, Life, Form.  Anyway, I will have an art show there on March
14th and 15th!  It will be my second show ever, and though further away from where I normally hang
out, is in a non-smoking environment.  (my first show was at The Pink Cow, a restaurant with a bar
where people could smoke).

Though at the moment, ELF has limited resources, there's a nice buildup of energy that feels
appropriate for me to engage.  I'm learning some about how to create such a space through
advertising / networking, and am benefitting from my skills and services (*) being advertised as we
network.

(*) I've been interested in making money by giving massage/reiki/shiatsu (Japanese acupressure), and
painting, all of which seems possible at ELF.  I traded an hour of massage to Mark for an hour of
FOREX training, and he highly recommended my massage-skillz to some of his other contacts.  I think
the only barrier is to get my mind out of the way, and advertise my ability.

The fear is a bit around inadequacy, but mostly around "getting stuck" in the wrong country (which
is similar to the fear that broke me up with Wende: getting stuck with wrong person, in wrong life).
If I plant roots here as a masseuse, then I'll be stuck here forever..  Oh noooooooo!!

Interestingly, ELF is 3 minutes' walk from a different new thing in my life: UER.

UER stands for United to End Racism, but the group I've been attending is a co-counseling group and
essentially amounts to a lighter, more accessible version of MKP (lower price of entry, less safe
container).  It's co-gender, and is the only thing I know of in Japan that's actually *training*
people to speak and listen honestly with one another, usually in pairs.  The basic basic premise is
that people will work out their own issues if given genuine attention, and freedom to discharge
emotionally.

The container is made a bit more strictly, using timers to give people exactly N minutes to speak,
and then the partner will be given N minutes to speak.  Of course nothing spoken inside the circle
is to be gossipped later, but even further, participants are discouraged from any other interaction
outside the co-counseling setting. Like if I meet a cute girl there, we're not supposed to date, and
if I meet a cool guy there, we're not supposed to hang out.

(If people were alread connected before both begining the co-counseling, they keep their same status
outside the counseling)

So I've got this great new space called ELF, and 3 minutes away is a great group of peeps, but for
the moment, I'm not allowed to invite my UER peeps to ELF (and my art show).  argh.  The
preciousness of the UER relationships is partially because we can all speak fluent English, quite a
rarity for Tokyo.

In other news:

Sunday March 8th, I'll be hosting a screening of Zeitgeist Addendum at The Pink Cow (you can watch
the movie(s) for free at <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">http://zeitgeistmovie.com/</a> _Zeitgeist_ looks at the untold side of
religion, WTC destruction, and the Federal Reserve.  _Zeitgeist Addendum_ looks at money in general
in our society, and how capitalisim necessarily means we'll have rich people and poor people.  It
suggests a new abundance-based society using technology to handle our needs and giving people all
they want and the space to be creative)

I've traded Traci, the owner of The Pink Cow, 1 hour of massage for buffet ($30), twice so far, and
more scheduled, plus she's encouraging some of her employees to do the same.

Tariq and I have started development for iPhone, but it's still outside my abilities... Part of the
problem is that it's been available for a while in the US, but more recently came to Japan (and even
more recently to me), so other people have a head start on programming for it.

I've got plane tickets to visit Sydney for about 10 days (25 March - 5 April), during which I will
do a super-intense emotional/spiritual cleansing called ISIS 101, via a school called Clairvision
(<a href="http://www.clairvision.org/">http://www.clairvision.org/</a>).  I've done some (14.5) ISIS sessions
(<a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:ISIS">http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:ISIS</a>), though lost the momentum as my teacher was
disallowed re-entry into Japan (for not having a "real" job).  ISIS 101 will be something like 12
hours a day of this intense work for 7 days.  Afterward, though I won't be able to do ISIS for
money, I'll be able to trade ISIS sessions with Kumi, who will have done the same training (in New
York, about 2 weeks before my training).

My friend Kevin, who I met through MKP, and via whom I met Clairvision, will be moving to Kyoto
soon.  He'll check out of our I-group in 3 days.  Sadness.

In the dating department, I have told Ami clearly that I won't marry her, and that we should
probably break up and get it over with.  She has given me space and freedom (which I haven't yet
used), but we're not officially broken up.  In fact, things are pretty much the same as before on
the surface.  Through my self-transformation, I'm leaning more and more toward vegetarianism, want
less and less to do with TV, whereas she's the opposite: not transforming, loves meat and her TV
shows).

In I-group I said, "but I don't want to break up another relationship; I've done that (with Wende)."
Feedback went like thist: "did you make the right decision when you broke up with Wende?" 
"Yes."
"Is it possible this could be the right decision again?"
"Yes."

Hmmmm.
