<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I've got a job interview tomorrow, and another one probably Thursday (I suggested Tuesday
(today) or Thursday), but they haven't replied yet).  The interview tomorrow after I passed the job
application: Sign up for a website on our server and create a few pages, download and install a wiki
and create a few pages, then install a set of themes and change the wiki's theme.</p>

<p>The interview tomorrow will include a written exam and a PC building test.  Good thing I've put
together a few PCs.  Hopefully I can apply my dusty 486 building skillz well enough to build
whatever they want me to build.</p></li>

<li><p>I had a great art show (my second ever) this past weekend
at <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/elfcooperative/">ELF in Tachikawa</a>.  Intermittantly
uploading pictures from that.  Really glad to get Su Young's pictures from Saturday, a really
hilariously fun time!</p></li>

<li><p>Slightly jobless since December, I've just started to more seriously start looking for
work.  I was blessed with 800,000 yen from my second clinical drug trial in Kagoshima back in early
February.  That money has essentially run its course.</p></li>

<li><p>The course run by the money includes plane tickets to and from Australia for a week long
ISIS 101 retreat run by <a href="http://www.clairvision.org/">Clairvision school</a>.  The work
should prove amazing and great.  Kumi has just recently finished the same course in New York, and
said it was pretty
awesome.  <a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=peeps:Kevin">Kevin</a> has done the
course as well, describing it as &quot;great and fantastic, etc,&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>But, Kevin continued, &quot;do you think it's prudent to go off to Australia for the course
while you're looking for a job?&quot;  I've wondered and wondered the same question, and come up
with the answer, &quot;gotta go to OZ.&quot;  As Kevin asked, I listened again for an
answer.  <em>Go to OZ.</em>  I even did a coin-flip test.  Go to OZ.</p>

<p>That was the evening that I asked each man if he would still love me if I was making a mistake
in going to OZ when I &quot;need to get a job.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>I wonder if that's what <a href="http://www.michaeljohngrist.com/">British Mike</a> had read
that basically turned him away from the idea of doing that type of personal growth work.</p>

<pre>
I said it sounded great to be supportive, and before i read on your blog just how far your support
group takes it.  i figured a few guys sat around getting practical advice from other dudes could be
good- not for me really, but good if you need it.  what you have though sounds far more intertwined
and dependant and emotional than i'd be interested in.

<li><p>Ami and I are still doing our thing.  She comes to visit about twice a week and cooks.  I
give her shiatsu and massage.  We do more if time allows.  She joined my art show on both days, and
the Brazilian dinner on Sunday.  I wonder if we're wasting time; I've told her I can't marry her and
wanted to break up.  She asked me please to continue with her, and now when I roll out to OZ, I'm
wondering if I'm gonna have the
same <a href="/journal.pl?type=all&date=2006/01/30#Rei">horrible feeling</a> I got by not
cleanly breaking up with Hitomi before my second PB voyage.  I'm still not over that yet, and I
don't want to repeat it.</p>

<p>A big difference is that that was 100 days, and this is only 7 days.  BUT, that was busy workin'
and this is busy growin' and deeper sharin'.</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone has changed the way I interact with the internet.  I can upload pictures more
easily, and I just now found the link to the story about Rei above via my iPhone.</p></li>

<li><p>My art looks so good at ELF that it's going to stay up for a while!!  I've asked Ami to
print some price labels for the different pieces which I will label this Saturday.  Basically will
give 10% of the sales to Mark, and help him drive foot-traffic
to <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/elfcooperative/">ELF in Tachikawa</a>.  Go go go!</p></li>

<li><p>In news from the shocking-but-true department, I applied for a job at NOVA, and have an
interview offer.  That's the interview which I requested to be either today or Thursday.  If they
offer me a position at a school close to where I live now, I'd be pretty likely to take it.  Just
depends on myriad other factors.  Just wanna get <em>sumpin</em>, to start.</p>

<p>Even if I don't work there, I have now discovered it's possible to get permission to work in a
job other than what my visa specifies.  Here, with my emphasis:

Dear Mr Nugen

Re: our telephone conversation.

Could you please send us an updated resume including a cover letter to this address so that we can
process your application. As I mentioned during our telephone call you will need to visit
immigration and apply for <b>"permission to engage in activities other than specified on your current
visa"</b> to enable you to work in this industry.

You will probably require some kind of letter from us before you go to immigration so on
successfully passing an interview with us we can provide you with such a document.

Sincerely

Darryl &lt;snip type=&quot;remainder&quot; /&gt;
