<p>Neryl touching center of my sternum:</p>

<pre>
Trip slip on rocks and fall dead down a cliff, just from a small mistake, how can such a tragic
outcome come out?  This lifetime?  Been in Tokyo for six years of bullshiz on just my small choice
to go there, with no research, etc.

&quot;when was the first time you felt this?&quot;

Tumbled back in time and glimpsed my most beautifulest wife ever, on the porch as I had to decide
between love and money, supporting my family directly or indirectly, and I would do anything for
them (huge sadness of loss), so I went to the war to make money and then die and they didn't get any
money anyway (huge anger of unfairness), and now I don't want to chase money, fuck the government
and lying banks.

Just feel the feeling of feeling the sadness.  Soggy wet sloppy sadness.

&quot;Howe does it feel inside the sadness?&quot;

WTF ARE  YOU TALKING ABOUT?

Sadness feels sad. Go fuck yourself wif deez questions.

<p>Sat with Jacquelen looking over the valley during dinner.  She helped me get an idea of how to
answer the question, starting with how the emotion manifests itself in my body.  Tightness here,
heaviness there... ah I can answer that kind of question.</p>
