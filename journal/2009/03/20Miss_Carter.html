<p>Just friended my English teacher from my junior year in high school.  I knew her then as Miss Carter.</p>

<p>She messaged me and Mike Gammons to basically say what's up with her.. and I messaged her back directly:</p>

I don't remember Mike Gammons (?), but I remember you!

... perhaps due to having such a huge crush on you that I'm sure most of the young men had.

I'm glad you remember me!  Little ol' me trying out for cheerleader on all-girls squad...  One of
two guys on 55 person color guard...  I guess I broke the mold enough to be memorable! hahaha

Tehran sounds cool!  What did you do there?  Havest thou a blog of your adventures? 

I'm in Japan now and have done a bit of traveling as well...  Between two trips around the world
with Peace Boat (as a volunteer teaching English on the ship), I spent 6 weeks in the Palestinian
side of Jerusalem and some other Israeli-locked cities.  So important to speak the truth, but seems
difficult in the face of mass media.

I've been keeping my journal online since late 1990s, with several entries transcribed from my high
school days.  http://robnugen.com/ for hours and hours of reading pleasure. hahaha!!

Latest endeavors are find a job and promote my paintings (still in the starving artist stage for painting!)

Will do an 8 day intensive emotional cleansing retreat in OZ (4 hours west of Sydney) soon!  Have
been doing similar work for 11 years with Mankind Project.

Now I'm just gushing.  Did I mention I had a crush on you??

   Love and Light
    - Rob!
