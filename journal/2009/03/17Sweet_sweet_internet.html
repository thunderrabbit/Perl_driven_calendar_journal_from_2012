<p>I'm at my old work for the afternoon, slurpin' megabits of data, which included an invitation to
interview with NOVA on Monday (they didn't even mention my request, but I don't really care to fuss
over it); I happen to have the day off, so that works for me.  I had just wanted it sooner than
later, but whatevs.</p>

<p>I signed up for Zembly, but I can't really imagine what useful content I'd be passionate enough
to create, so it probably won't go any further than having set up a domain name at zembly.robnugen.com/</p>

<p>Talkin' to Sho, asking about ways to get networked for an art show and how to find people to
help promote, etc, etc... and he gave a simple, effective, obvious answer: go to events and meet
the people who are interested in those types of events.</p>

<p>SO, I signed up for Michael Q Todd's healing event this Sunday which will feature speakers from a
variety of healing genres: Qi Gong (sp), reiki, yoga, water fasting, etc, AND vegan meal.
Sweet!</p>
