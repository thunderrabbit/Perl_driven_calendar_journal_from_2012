Nothing at first.  This doesn't work.  I can't; I just want to do the right thing.  I love her
smile.  Tia, Ami, Angelina Jolie.  I want to make Ange smile.  [crying crying gasping crying]  I
just want to make her happy. I just want to be cute and funny.  Feels warm and fuzzy.  Warm wet
breathe easily.  wombspace

happy, dark, warm, nothing to do....  so nice.

Then, oh snap, I gotta go do something, but I can't remember what.  Can't stop it don't want to go.

first breath.  cold, bright, alone, don't know what to do why did I come back?  I can't remember....

I had a good reason, but I can't remember what it was.

I like colors.  bright colors, white red green blue yellow want to go over to the colors.  can't
move.  how do I move?  push push push want want want struggle struggle ongoing no going.  Sometimes
the colors come to me.
