<p>I'm just a few minutes from Tachikawa on the Nambu Line, (and totally falling asleep here)....
About to reach Yaho Station.</p>

<p>I slept just 4.5 hours last night, and will be busy today.  Looking forward to a great day of
connecting with friends and brightening people's lives with my art!</p>
