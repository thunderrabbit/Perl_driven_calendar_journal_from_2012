<p>I told Kevin that I had just listened to a 10 hours of recordings by Stanislav Grof, which
described first some of the inadequacies of the standard model for psychological behavior, and their
expanded cartography with which they can describe more precisely a greater range of psychological
behavior, including spiritual states of conciousness and schizophrenia.  (( This summary is my
version from my memory, so don't trust it nor make any assumptions about the actual content of the
recordings. ))</p>

<p>&quot;In the lecture, he basically talked about their use of LSD to allow people to reach
transformative states of consciousness, which would sometimes mirror those of schizophrenia and
spiritually awakened states of consciousness, and could be used to affect emotional breakthroughs in
the patient, or something like that,&quot; I said, or something like that.</p>

<p>&quot;So, I wonder if you have any feedback on using this type of experience for spiritual
growth.&quot;</p>

<p>After my specification that I wish not to smoke anything (neither marijuana, nor salvia
divinorum), Kevin suggested ayahuasca, which has been available here in Japan (&quot;though may not
be anymore&quot;), &quot;or you can go to Brazil and get it anywhere; they have an entire religion
based on it.&quot;</p>

<p>He described ayahuasca as a &quot;teacher plant,&quot; which, &quot;once it accepts you as a
student, will continue each experience where you left off with the previous one.&quot; Wow.  That's
pretty cool.</p>

<p>The thing that's got me most sold on this is the similarity to near death experience, in which
I'm quite interested.  He said, &quot;it can bring up the grief from all the times you ever hurt
anyone, so you feel the experience from their point of view..&quot; I interrupted, &quot;... so
therefore, I won't have to re-experience those when I die for real.&quot; Hmmmmm I'd be willing to
learn from this type of experience and have the chance to apply my newfound knowledge
immediately!</p>

<p>&quot;BUT,&quot; he suggested, &quot;you can get the same experience from the type of work
you'll be doing in Australia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... At this point I'm still just thinking theoretically, and will probably only do this
for realz if I get no result from ISIS 101.&quot;</p>
