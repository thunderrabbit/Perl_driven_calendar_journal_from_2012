<p>Argh.  I tried a buncha variants to get just a little rewriteRule working for my journal, but nothin' wanted to do the right thing.  Nor the rewrite thing.  Argh.</p>

<p></p>

<pre>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^alice.html$   bob.html
# RewriteRule ^test.html(.*)$      /journal/index.php?date=$1&amp;type=$2
# RewriteRule   ^/journal/(\d\d)/([^/])     /$1
# RewriteRule   ^/journal/index.php?type=([^&amp;]+)&amp;date=(.*)    /u/$1/$2  [R]
# RewriteRule   ^/~([^/]+)/?(.*)    /u/$1/$2  [R]
</pre>

<p>The first one above works, but none of the rest do, even when they're not commented out.</p>
