<p>Had a great turnout today for my art show: Around 12:30pm, while Mark was telling Jacob and ___
about Forex, Talia and her two kids were first to see my show.  They didn't stay very long; the kids
didn't seem super interested, but Talia assured me her son really like it.  Jacob and his mate
stayed about 2 or 3 hours, during which we ate spaghetti, cooked by Toshiyuki, Mark's daughter
Christi's friend's father.  (While Christi and her friend played up in the cubby hole of the
loft.)</p>

<p>Then Denise with Hiro came a bit later, right as Ami arrived.  Denise asked me the price of
_Heart Center_.  I looked over at Ami because I had painted Heart Center for Ami, and then enhanced
it and put it in my show at The Pink Cow (where Ami bought it (for 3000 yen)).  Ami left it at my
house and I put it in this show, and when Denise asked about it, I looked over at Ami and she didn't
respond, so I looked on the list of prices and suggested 2000 yen.  Denise bought it and gave an
extra 500 yen so I could send it to her house via exapack.  This time it won't be left at my house,
so it won't likely get sold again.  Or at least not sold in a way that the money will be near
me.</p>

<p>After Denise and Hiro left, Ami and I were chillin' and I got down another painting and sorta
said, &quot;yeah sorry I sold your painting,&quot; which I thought she didn't really care, but it
turns out she hadn't realized.  Gah.  So, I told her I would paint her a new painting.  &quot;And
this time, don't leave it in my room!&quot;</p>

<p>I was getting a bit tired so went up to the little cubby hole in the loft and lay down for a
second, just as Canadian Mike and Kumi came in!  Wow!!  That sure erased any need to sleep!  Then
British Mike and Su Yong came, <em>plus</em> a special guest appearance by Brady and Yuki!!  wow!!
I sure didn't expect to see them during their visit to ol' Nippon.</p>

<p>In addition to the greatness of having them all come, they stayed for quite a while, chatting
and talking, plus enjoying a bit of Mark's whiskey-chocolate around the same time as Margaret
arrived from my UER class!  So super great!</p>

<p>I didn't spend much time with Margaret, but definitely thanked her for coming, and acknowledged
that I didn't really chat with her much.  She said no worries, and that she understood; I could pay
attention to her at our next meetng.</p>

<p>From the ceiling, Mark brought down the swing and many of us took turns on it, generally having a
gay old time, especially after Doug (owns English school next door) came over to show us just how
high we can swing!  We playe lots, during which Su Yong got *lots* of pictures, which I hope to see
online, and likely eature on my art website!</p>

<p>Candian Mike bought _Blueness_ for 1500 yen, and British Mike bought _The Pen Slipped_ for 1500
yen.  They both requested hand delivery.</p>

<p>Super great time; I'm so glad they came!</p>

<p>Canadian Mike might do a show here later, and I look forward to that.</p>

<p>They all left, and I played on the swing with Doug and Mark egging me on, and Ami thinking
&quot;be careful!!&quot;</p>
