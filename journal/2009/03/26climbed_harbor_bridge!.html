<p>&quot;Wanna go climb the bridge?&quot;  I figured it was the least likely question, and least
likely to work.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wanna go climb the bridge?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard it's expensive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But yeah I'll walk over there with you.&quot;</p>

<p>And we did.  On the way, we found out the bridge peeps offer shoes for barefoot peeps like me,
and it costs $179, and is &quot;so worth it.&quot;</p>

<p>Alanna chose not to climb today, but we said bye, and *I* chose to climb!</p>

<p>Tevvi was our tour leader, and Kara was first, then me, then Oya, then everyone else, and then
Kara's friend Stephanie and another Rob on the end.</p>

<p>I liked Tevvi plenty well, but the actual climb was less amazing that I had hoped.  Maybe due to
the nice weather and gentle slope.</p>

<p>The best part were the cable attachment things, which rolled past where the cable was affixed to
the bridge!</p>

<p>Kara was scared on the way up and told me to be quiet, as I was enjoying the entire event quite
well.  I stayed pretty quiet past that, but still tried to be supportive of her climb.</p>

<p>Tev took lotsa pictures, but they were for $20 each, so I only bought one.  And that was for $10
with an imaginary $10 discount ticket which I apparently got when I signed up, but lost.</p>

<p>Went out to a bar with Tevvy, Gabby (sp), Kara and Stephanie afterward.  Tevvy's um, friend
Sebastian came by; he had hitchhiked up from Canberra.  Orange juice and vegetable nachos for
me.</p>

<p>I'd write more, but I have a headache.  sorry.</p>

<p>Upon awaking in the morning, I think the bridge climbing experience was greater than I
remembered it while having a headache.  I further think I would have enjoyed it more had I been
able to ask all the questions that came to mind, and have been talk-talk-talky as I wished.  I kept
my mouf shut cause Kara complained, and I think I the words built up in my head and gave a
headache.  That's my theory, anyway.</p>

Hey Tevvi, what are those cannons?  Hey Tevvi, who
designed this cable?  Hey Tevvi, can you do this course 
with your eyes closed?  Hey Tevvi, how do they keep 
paint from dripping on cars?  Hey Tevvi!  Hey Tevvi!
