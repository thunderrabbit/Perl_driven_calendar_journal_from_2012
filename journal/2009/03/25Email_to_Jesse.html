<p>This is slightly confusing with no context, but I want to put my thoughts online.  Eventually I'd
like to put it in my wiki, but as mentioned, I have no internet access at the moment.</p>

    I am glad we found this point of difference.


I'm glad *you* found it!  How did you find it?

I think this discussion will quickly get to unweildy for email, but I'm going to try this reply and
see what comes out.
 

    I would say that is, by definition for love, impossible.
    I would also say that is morally impossible.


huh?
 

    Simply that any word is going to have an opposite, and a point in which is cannot include other
    definitions.


what?  I think you mistyped something in that sentence.

    Also "naughty" and "evil" are quite far from each other.


I agree with this.  For me, naughty is testing boundaries, and evil actions are designed to harm
others.
 

    To me, a grandmother who loves a grandchild who want to kill her other grandchildren is not in
    her right mind. If she includes an evil grandchild into the group,


I didn't want to kill any of my cousins, but I definitely harmed my brother.  I hit him while
enraged on more than one occasion.  ((It was only when I thought I may have permanently hurt him
that I realized instantly that I would never hit him again.  I was so happy when he got up and
started yelling and wailing on me.))

But sorry, that's a sidenote in that it doesn't match your scenario.  I believe the grandmother
will/should/must love even the child who wants to kill his/her cousins/siblings.  If the grandmother
were to withdraw her love, the child would only seek more revenge against this further pain of not
being loved.

    she is not protecting the others and thus not loving the others. Another morally impossible
    situation.


Ah.  By my definition, love doesn't always include protection.  I might let someone make a mistake
to learn from it.
 

    I think you may be right that love allows freedom to man, but only if man is loving.


I agree love allows freedom to man.  I say it allows freedom whether or not man is loving.
 

    And a man can only be loving if he fears love. If he does not fear love he has no reason to do it.


Please tell me about your definition of fear.
 

    My point is that fear and respect is one in the same.


I see fear and respect as different. 

I respect your opinion, and I respect people who lead thoughtful lives.  I don't fear you, your
opinion, or thoughtful people.

I respect W, Cheney, and crew for their ability to drive the US and the world where they want to go.
I fear the outcome to which I see their actions headed.

I fear a possible moment on my deathbed, looking back on my life and thinking, "I made more mistakes
than successes."  (That's one reason I try to live to high standards of my own making.)

I can only imagine your response, "yes, but Rob 'of your own making' is the problem there.  You need
to live to the high standards of God's making."

And I respond to that (imagined response), "I don't fear God."

My basic reason stems from the phrase "God is love," and knowing by *my* definition of love, I have
no reason to fear love, nor God.

- -

So we come back to the definition of love.  My definition of love as a verb basically mirrors the
one by M Scott Peck.  Something like, "love is thoughtful effort put forth to enhance our own or
another's spiritual well being."

Love as a noun is more difficult to define, especially if I define love = God, for I've already said
that God is infinitely more unknowable than we can pretend to imagine.  I wrote a little bit about
this under my definition of EPP, the Ever Present Present in, I think, the Religion namespace of my
wiki.  (I'm not online now, and won't try to remember to find it before sending this, so if I don't
send a link, search under the Religion namespace of my wiki at http://robnugen.com/wiki (click
search, then select Religion and R.O.B.O.T. checkboxes and search for EPP))

I see love as an opposite of fear.  (not necessarily "the opposite," just "an opposite" or maybe
"diametrically opposed to")

Thanks for your thoughts!

Take your time in replying; I won't have internet access for the next 9 days.

    Peace, Love, Respect, and no Fear
