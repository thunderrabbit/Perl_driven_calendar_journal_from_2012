<p class="dream">Saw a cabbie and passenger standing on the trunk of the cab, stepping carefully
across its length to close it around an apparently oversized load.  They asked if I would help; I
said sure cause I wanted to make some money.  As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot, a cop
pulled us over on suspicion of having illegal something in the trunk.  We pulled into the next door
parking lot, where people started coming out of the bar to say HI to their friends (cabbie and fare)
and thanks for a great night, the party for which continued inside.  The cop found out what was in
the trunk, had a complete turn of heart, and gathered all the non-Japanese around him, saying
basically &quot;I just created a game that will show how thankful I am to have all of you here in
Japan,&quot; and the game was weird but well-hearted, and it turned out great in the end.</p>
