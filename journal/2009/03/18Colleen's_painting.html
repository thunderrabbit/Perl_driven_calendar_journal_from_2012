<p>I set up <a href="http://lilurl.sourceforge.net/">lilurl</a>
at <a href="http://art.robnugen.com/">http://art.robnugen.com/</a>, but plan to only allow it to
shorten URLs that include the string &quot;robnugen.com/wiki&quot;, so don't try to shorten anything else.  I
think I'll password protect it, or perhaps only let it shorten URLs that also contain the string &quot;Image:&quot; </p>

<p>Anyway, the first image with a URL on the service is Colleenie Beanie's painting,
at <a href="http://art.robnugen.com/0">art.robnugen.com/0</a>.  I'm pretty happy with that.  1 - 6
will be the six paintings I made as a set, and then I may use the image names qw(island, strips,
yellow, spiral) for the four F-10 canvases I started in 2007 and had in The Pink Cow, and now up at
ELF in Tachikawa.</p>

<p>Speaking of which,</p>
