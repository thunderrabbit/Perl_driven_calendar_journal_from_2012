&gt; hey rob- pleased that our coming was good for you- i always like to support
&gt; friends when they do something creative.

Hooray!

&gt; been reading your wiki some- a nuisance that i can't comment on the posts.
&gt; why not just use a blog format- get some interaction going on?

My wiki?  My journal?  I'd love to get some commentary going, and have looked into a couple of
different options.. Thanks for your feedback that you wanna leave feedback.  That makes me a bit
more likely to implement something!

The *reason* I don't have any commenting system is that when I made my journal, "blog" wasn't a
word, PHP didn't exist (?), and I made it all myself (with my brother's help) in Perl, just
transferring my journal to an electronic format.  The concept of making a social network based on my
musings didn't cross my mind.

AND I don't want to abandon my existing system, so any commenting system must fit in with my current
infrastructure.  And have some sort of registration deal cause I don't want spam.

BUT I ain't got the time to write a custom version, so I've looked into Disqus, which is designed to
meld into existing systems.  Didn't get it to work on my first try, but might try again.

I didn't expect to write that much toward that topic, but the thoughts of having a comment system
are definitely in my brain!

&gt; think, so no big deal. lot of crying? hmm. sounds a bit indulgent, and also
Hmmm.  I don't remember saying "lots of crying," but men in the group are encouraged to release
whatever emotions they need to.

&gt; visceral than TV, but seems more masturbatory, as it's just recycling old
&gt; 'trauma'. happy to be corrected if you care to- the whole thing is very
&gt; curious to me.

What I've found, is instead of "recycling" trauma, we are actually releasing the trauma by
expressing the emotions which we did not express at the time the trauma occurred.

As I mentioned yesterday, our group has slowly grown smaller as people have left Tokyo; we are
likely to have some open meetings soon.  I'll keep you informed.  (We currently meet on 2nd and 4th
Mondays at 7pm near Ebisu station; if you'd like to put such a Monday in your schedule, let me know
and I can make a request.)

&gt; and- why do you dislike tv?
I dislike TV because when I watch TV, it engages my brain in a numbing way, to a degree that I don't
notice the passage of time as it (TV) is pushing its messages upon me.

In my belief system, just a few wealthy companies own all most of the airwaves, and their interest
is not in my best interest.  Their best interest is for me to believe I need to spend money to be
happy.

Information on the interwebs comes from a much larger variety of sources, through which I can more
easily navigate than TV.

I dislike some parts of the internet (so I stay away from sites I don't like).  SOME parts of TV are
fine, but percentagewise, I like the internets better.

&gt; so you don't want to do a weekday haikyo? i may go this week now that i've
&gt; been thinking about it.

A weekday haikyo would be killadilla.  My only fully-free day is Friday the 20th.  On Monday through
Thursday I have something on each evening around 7pm.... guessin' we wouldn't be home by then, but
glad to be proven wrong.

      Soon!
      - Rob!
