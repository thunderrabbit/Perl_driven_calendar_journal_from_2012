<p>I chose not to pay full price for my train ticket from Musashikosugi to Shibuya.  Just 120 yen
minimum price ticket and snuck my way through the gate in Shibuya (saving/stealing 70 yen).  I
crumpled the unused ticket (but kept it in my pocket).  Paid 130 yen to get on Yamanote Line to
Ikebukuro from Shibuya.  Not sure how much it was supposed to cost, but snuck through the gate
there as well.</p>

<p>That was before my 3pm appointment at NOVA.</p>

<p>I kept the ticket intact; I realized if I sneak back into the train system (which I did), I can
get out &quot;legitimately&quot; if I exit one station away from where I started.  So I'm thinking
of going to Harajuku and walking to Shibuya.</p>

<p>BUT, it's a bit cold, and though I'm wearing my black suit (dark blue socks, black soft leather
shoes, blue shirt, and purple tie), it's a cheap single layer suit and not all that much protection
against the brisk wind.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to meet Michael for I-group tonight at 5:30pm, so I've got plenty of time to get
there.  Too much time, by some calculations, so riding the Yamanote Line the long way around gives
me a place to sit and write while listening to my iPhone (( which I sorta wish I hadn't gotten while
I'm looking for work, but I had no idea how hard it would be to make money writing an iPhone app )).
In Okachimachi now, we have 30 minutes until Shibuya.</p>
