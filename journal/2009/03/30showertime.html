<p>Showertime.  (I haven't yet taken a shower today)</p>

<p class="date">11:16pm EST</p>

<p>hahaha; my towel and clean shirt, socks, unders have been moved from the line where I hung
them.  I wonder why.  Still took a shower, but wearing same shirt as yesterday and day before.  But
this time, I'm wearing it <em>backwards</em>.</p>
