<p>Just finished my shiatsu lesson with Kimura-san.  We reviewed the side position (though I had
studied the face down positions).</p>

<p>After he performs the technique on me, I repeat on him, and he gives suggestions/corrections as
necessary.</p>

<p>Afterward, he gives me a free shiatsu session, at the end of which he holds my right hand and left
foot, and then switches, holding left hand and right foot, similar to a process that Kathy Fey
would do back in the day.  I asked Kimura-san, &quot;is that shiatsu?&quot; and he goes, &quot;no,
but it doesn't matter to the client; you don't have to say 'this is shiatsu, and this is not
shiatsu,'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I understand that, but I'd like to learn that technique as well, so I was wondering
what it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The client comes to be healed and doesn't mind what it's called.  You can do anything you
like.&quot;</p>

<p>I let it go.</p>
