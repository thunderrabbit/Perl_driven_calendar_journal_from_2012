<p>The men in I-group yesterday gave their support in my fear about the future of my immediate
future here in Japan.  I worked out my spending plan to reveal I'll have something like 30,000 yen
and one month to eat plus make 70,000 yen to pay for my rent which will be do on May 15th or so.
Kevin asked a good question:</p>

<p>&quot;Is it prudent for you to go to Australia for the ISIS training right now?  I agree the
training is great, but can it wait a bit?&quot;</p>

<p>As he asked, I heard the answer from inside/above, &quot;go to Australia; don't sweat it.&quot;
and then I did a coin toss test, heads: &quot;go to Australia,&quot; and my relief to see the
answer.</p>

<p>Takeshi didn't really understand my &quot;logic&quot; of following my gut feeling, and I accept
that.  No problem.  And I'm going to Australia.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm scared to do this,&quot; I summarized, &quot;but I have to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>SO then Kevin asked, &quot;are you complete?&quot; and I was like, &quot;ummmm 99% complete, but
gotta do one more thing.&quot;</p>

<p>I wanted to ask each man, eye to eye, <em>if I fail at this, will you still support me?</em>
but I didn't want it to imply necessarily financial support, but, just their support,.. and then I
got it, and started with Michael, &quot;If I fuck up, will you still love me?&quot;  He assured me
he will, and I started to cry.  &quot;good, cause I'm scared.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked each man in turn, and all gave their support (emotional).</p>

<p>This is the night Stephen came back to our I-group after what he says has been three years.  I
guess he'd know better in general when he was here last, but I think it's only been 2 years.
Anyway, he's definitely changed after his battle with cancer and sudden change of life plans.  He
said &quot;I'm jealous of you right now,&quot; as he hugged me, helping me remember the blessings
I've got and the opportunity I've got, and I've got to do this thing.</p>

<p>I thanked him later for his words.</p>

<p>We all headed back to Ebisu station, said HI to Stephen's host Junichiro (?), then bye to both
of them.</p>
