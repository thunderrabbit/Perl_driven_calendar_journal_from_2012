<p>Today I created a Zeitgeist Addendum movie poster to advertise the free screening at The Pink Cow
at 6pm on March 8th.  I'm on the train to Shibuya now to print it and post it at The Pink Cow, and
say HI to Traci and confirm our plan for Sunday, which will include a shiatsu-enhanced massage for
her, and then Zeitgeist Addendum, and the smoove stylins of FLO Union.</p>
