<p>Arrived early to my shiatsu lesson; ÌÚÂ¼¤µ¤ó had his door closed, so I waited outside and
painted in the sun.  Well, drew while drawing warmth and light from el sol.</p>

<p>Today's lesson included giving shiatsu to a patient lying on their side.  Pretty straightforward
technique, once I learn all the steps.</p>
