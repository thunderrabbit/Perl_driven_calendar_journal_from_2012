<p>I'm using the word &quot;breakthrough&quot; because my journal entries are sorted by name, and B
is early in ye olde alphabet.</p>

<p>And because I had a nice breakthrough during this morning's meditation.</p>

<p>Basically, it used to be that my brain would wander and then I would &quot;snap back to
reality&quot; of being 'here' sitting, practicing meditation, and having noticed that my thoughts
had wandered.</p>

<p>But today was a little different.  After about 12 minutes of normal soporific meditation
practice, I suddenly reached a state with a bit of wakefulness over-riding everything.  Like a
little connection that was keeping me interested and awake.</p>

<p>I suddenly knew that I would be able to maintain this for some time, and that the alarm on my
timer (must meditate for at least 15 minutes, rain or shine, sleepy or not)..  that the timer would
go off in a moment and perhaps break the connection.  So I fixed the feeling in my mind, and opened
my eyes for a bit to turn off the countdown timer, and turn *on* the stopwatch.  The coundown timer
had 2 minutes 20 seconds remaining.</p>

<p>My mind wandered perhaps as frequently as before, but this time, when I came back to mindful
awareness of my meditation practice, there was no shock.  Like a part of me had been connected to a
timelessness the whole time, and the thoughts which had distracted my mind were simply a brief
distraction, but not enough to completely envelop my consciousness.</p>

<p>So each time my focus came back to the meditation, the transition felt gentle.  I had been here
the entire time.  Just my brain had got distracted for a bit, but now it was back.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I started seriously considering a weekly meditation circle at ELF on Tuesday nights.  7 to 8pm,
with meditation practice for 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 20 minutes and 10 minutes then 5
minutes, or perhaps 5, 10, 20, and 20 minutes again.  Or just freestyle timing as the group
prefers.</p>

<p>I will talk to Helma about it in OZ; I basically want to get permission from her, as my
meditation / ISIS / third eye awareness teacher.</p>

<p>As I chose to finish the meditation, I gently came back to full waking consciousness.  Checked
the stopwatch to find 28 minutes had passed.  (So add that to 13+ and get 40 minute meditation
without much effort.)</p>

<p>Nice.</p>
