<p>Checked in for Qantas flight 22.  The agent talked to her supervisor for a second at first
because I had given her only my new passport, thinking she just needed to verify my identity.  She
was all, &quot;nevamind!&quot; when I added my old passport to the stack.</p>

<p>She concluded with &quot;please come to gate 82 by 7:45pm,&quot; and I was like, &quot;go
to,&quot; and she was all, &quot;?&quot; and I explained a bit in Japanese, basically, &quot;you
said 'come to' but it's better to say 'go to.'&quot;  Didn't explain why, but I hope she
appreciated the correction.</p>
