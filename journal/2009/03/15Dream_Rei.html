<p class="dream">Sitting around a table with people including my brother Fred, Ami, some others who
have not sailed on PB, and Rei, who has sailed on PB (first voyage was 52nd, my 2nd voyage).  Rei
was sitting to my right, and shared a recent story with the group: a guy had told her that when he
met her, he &quot;totally wanted to fuck me on the table,&quot; and expressing her shock at the
situation.  I, too, was shocked, and a bit offended that anyone would use such language toward
Rei.</p>

<p class="dream">She stepped out of the room for a bit, and I dramatically collapsed face down onto
the floor, &quot;ohhhh, this story is so difficult for me to hear.  I totally fell in love with Rei
on the voyage, and at that time remember thinking (and saying to a few people (Carla, Dan,
Maruan)), 'Rei is a woman I would never disrespect; it wouldn't even cross my mind.'&quot;</p>

<p>Oh Rei.  I hope you are happy and well.</p>
