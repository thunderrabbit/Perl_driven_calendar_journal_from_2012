<p>This morning when I went down for my shower, I was wearing just towel and no corrective eyewear.
Someone was at the sink, and when she said, &quot;good morning,&quot; I knew she must be Nina.  I
was feeling a bit late, plus a bit uncomfortable meeting her while in towel, but perhaps moreso
because I couldn't really see her.  Something about visual communication would make it easier in my
mind, so I was just like, &quot;good morning, uh sorry excuse me&quot; and whooshed down to the
shower.</p>

<p>I thought about how that musta been from Nina's POV.  Not necessarily a great greeting, so I
resolved to apologize and 'splain myself.  I thought I would have my chance while still in towel,
but it turned out to be Manuel in the kitchen instead of Nina.  HI to him briefly, the headed
upstairs for clothes and contacts, then knocked on her door, &quot;Nina?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yeah?&quot;</p>

<p>And she emerged a moment later,</p>

<p><em>O M G you are tall!</em> I thought, and almost lost my braincells all over the floor, but
managed to apologize for my first intro, and to *not* ask her if she wanted to join me for dinner
tonight, but instead was like, &quot;yeah so if you need any help or have questions just bang on the
wall or come around to my door...&quot;</p>
