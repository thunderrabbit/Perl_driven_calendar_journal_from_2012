<p>Hilarious.  I just searched for &quot;embed comments website&quot; (with no quotes) and came up with this article:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/29/quick-embed-code-to-add-comments-to-any-site/">Quick Embed Code to Add Comments To Any Site</a>.  Ah perfect.  Read through the comments and one guy was like, &quot;dood why would you trust this little js thing when haloscan is so awesome?&quot;</p>

<p>And a reply was like, &quot;dood, since when is diversity a bad thing?  Google started as nuthin' while we had Altavista and Yahoo.  Just sayin'&quot;</p>

<p>So then I did a search on haloscan.</p>

<p>Link at the top of their site:  NEWS: <a href="http://blog.js-kit.com/2008/07/18/js-kit-acquires-haloscan/">acquired by JS-Kit</a>.  HAHAHAHAHAAHAA</p>

<p>Turns out the article is over 2 years old, which, as this case study suggests, is ancient in terms of the interwhatsit.</p>

<p>So here's the code:</p>

<div class="js-kit-comments" path="/journal/2009/03/20/js-kit_comment_thingie" permalink="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2009/03/20#js-kit_comment_thingie"></div>

<p>I'ma just testin' it out.</p>
