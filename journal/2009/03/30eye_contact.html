<p>After listening to _Highness_ (17.9?) where Alcibyadi helps Szar with his hand, we did some
meditative aspirations, and then eye contact for a few minutes sharing impressions.  Jacquelen and I
spoke nothing verbally, and everything non-verbally.</p>

<p>When asked to tune in to our hearts, I got the sense of my heart being warm and big and loving
and strong.  woah.  hadn't felt that before.  It was like the words just came as I tuned into its
essence.</p>

<p>After the process, no one wanted to move.  I smiled at Jacquelen.  Turned toward Ange and said
to them both, &quot;I felt my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>high five!</p>
