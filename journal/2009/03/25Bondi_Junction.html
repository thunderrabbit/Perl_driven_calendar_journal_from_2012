<p>$5 bus to Bondi Junction now, and then another bus to Bondi Point (though I figure at a place
called Junction, which is the final stop for this bus, I can find a place to call Ian, and maybe
buy the couple of items on my list of items to buy:</p>

<h2>list of items to buy</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>contact juice</p></li>

<li><p>T-shirts</p></li>

<li><p>torch (*)</p></li>

<li><p>socks</p></li>

<li><p>Crocs (**)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) they mean flashlight.</p>

<p>(**) not necessarily this brand, but it rhymes.  (also not necessarily necessary)</p>

<p>Aight.  In Bondi Junction, I got some contact solution at a pharmacy and asked the cashier wehre
to get some t-shirts.  (Kmart)  Got socks (and underwear), but no shirts yet.</p>
