<p>Mostly lazed around the house yesterday.  I had planned to meet Michael Q Todd for his
cool-sounding healing conference deal, but it got cancelled due to lack of RSVPs.</p>

<p>Then Ami's friend ワンワン joined Ami and I to meet Nat(ty Nat Nat|alie) for her annual (?) salsa
party at Cubano Cafe (?) in Tsukiji.  On the way there, in Jiyugaoka, in the rain, while I waited in
the station (cause I had to プ and wanted to save money on my ticket), Ami and ワンワン tried to
print a flyer for my ongoing art show to give to peeps at the salsa party.  Unsuccessful though, due
to my having saved the document as HTML (which the printer they found couldn't print; it wanted .doc
(grrrr)).</p>

<p>&quot;I shoulda grabbed the copies from Mark at ELF when I was there on Saturday&quot; and
&quot;I shoulda saved it as a word doc&quot; are messages floating around my brain regarding thist
topic.

<p>At the event, hugged Natalie upon arrival and met a woman named Tomomi who came in alone just
after us and sat with Ami and ワンワン.  We chatted and had a lovely time dancing.  I did my own
style for at least 50% of the time I was on the floor (80%?), but did actually find I picked it up a
bit faster than the previous (10+) times I've taken salsa lessons with Natalie (this has very little
to do with Natalie's teaching skills, and more to do with my feet just wanting to do their own
thing).</p>

<p><del>Shellie</del> <ins>Ellie</ins> arrived a bit later.  I remembered her name as Shellie at
first, but Natalie corrected me.  When Ellie asked me if I remembered her name, she was surprised I
got it right.  I told her the full story, &quot;I remembered it rhymes with smellie, so I came up
with Shellie ...&quot; and Ellie was like, &quot;wot??&quot; in her OZ accent, and harangued me a
bit for having forgot her name <em>again</em>.  I said joke-hopefully, &quot;well, if we would ever
sleep together, I would remember your name.&quot; She laughed, &quot;well, I would hope
so!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the good news, I'm going to Australia in a couple days for 10 days!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where in Australia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the outback, 4 hours west of Sydney.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bwahahahah  that's not the outback!  That's called West Sydney!&quot;</p>

<p>Actually she didn't say &quot;that's called West Sydney,&quot; but that's what her reaction made
me think!</p>

<p>The woman who starred in my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD4fO1wTXEY">Sexy Silly
Japanese Dancer</a> vid on Youtube came fashionably late, and was not nearly as crazy as the times
I've seen her before (twice at Halloween parties and once at Natalie's birthday party).  I think her
name is Ayako.  (I'll use that name here for her.)  I was pleased to actually get some time dancing
with her (both in our crazy dance ways).  This has to do with the way she's quite an exhibitionist,
and seems utterly unattached to anyone new (just gravitates back to her friends).  So for her to
spend a few minutes focused on me was quite a pleasant surprise, during which I turned my brain off
as much as possible so I could do as Crazy a Crazy Rob Dance as possible.  Everything seemed to go
well until perhaps I went a step too far and had her do a handstand against my legs and Ayako's
skirt went upsidedownwise and she inadvertantly &quot;flashed&quot; everyone (just her stockings
actually, but).  Anyway, it was fun, and she said HI/bye to me at the end.</p>

<p>Regarding Tomomi joining わんわん and Ami, (Ami and) I expressed surprise at just how friendly
the three girls came.  It's a natural level of closeness for strangers with a bit in common in the
US, but not in Japan.  I was like, wow!</p>
