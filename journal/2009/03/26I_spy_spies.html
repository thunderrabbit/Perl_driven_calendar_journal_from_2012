<p>Dang, no camera to prove my story, but I sat down outside Starbucks just to wait for Ian.  A few
minutes later, an older man sat down nearby.  I noted that he, like me, had no drink, and therefore
not necessarily paying for his seat.  A few minutes later, a guy walked by the man who gave him a
newspaper, <em>without a word spoken</em> !!  wooah (?)</p>
