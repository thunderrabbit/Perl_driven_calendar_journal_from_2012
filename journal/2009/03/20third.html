<p>Okay, I've read over the docs a bit and see I don't need to keep including the line
&lt;script src="http://js-kit.com/comments.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; everytime.  Just once on the page.  At the bottom will be best so everything else can load and if js-kit is slow, it won't adversely affect the time for loading the page.

<div class="js-kit-comments" path="/journal/2009/03/20/third" permalink="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2009/03/20#third"></div>

<p>Well crud.  I don't know why the comments don't seem to last beyond a page refresh.</p>

<p>I'm going to try putting the &lt;script ... &gt; line back under each one and see if that helps, but if I understand anything about anything it won't work.</p>

<p>(please don't work please don't work)</p>

<p>Didn't work.  Whew!!</p>

<p>Ah crap, it didn't work.</p>

<p>Well, it seems to be working by setting the path to /yyyy/mm/dd/entry_name, although that path
isn't a legit reference to the entry.  Hafta really think about using this comment thing for all my
entries, cause if I change the URL...  er, actually let's think about this... I could use
MOD_REWRITE to slurp the URLs bits and then hit a DB.  THEN, the URL would be *correct*, -*and*- not
have to change.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But right now I'm goin' to bed.</p>
