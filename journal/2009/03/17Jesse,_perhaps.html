<p>I called Jesse to see if he was in the area to hang out.  He's cleaning out his desk at his high
school, where he's been teaching for a while (unless he changed schools during that time, and has
been teaching there for a little while).  He'll prolly be in Shibuya at about 3pm so we may hang
out at that time.</p>
