<p>Just finished a job interview (almost 100% written, including several logic tests, some of which
I had no idea.</p>

<p>One question was like, &quot;write a bunch of sentences appealing yourself and start with I.
ex. I am a nice person.&quot;</p>

<p>I started with &quot;I believe in the inherent worth and dignity of every person,&quot; and went
from there, sometimes awesomely, sometimes not, and ending with &quot;I encourage people to find
their own strengths and power.&quot;</p>

<p>I took a picture of the page, wanting to post its contents here, but was asked by Rumi to delete
the photo.  In front of her.  Ah well.</p>
