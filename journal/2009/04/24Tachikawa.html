<p>Came out to Tachikawa around 11am, where Bob and I did data entry for all the names and business
cards we got at the JMW pre-launch party two days ago.  We made the 2nd floor of a
Beastie-Boys-famous donut shop be our office space, and just as we were leaving, an employee came
up and gave us free donuts.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess that means they don't plan to kick us out...&quot;</p>

<p>I had Mark (from <a href="http://elfcoop.notlong.com/">ELF Co-op in Tachikawa</a>) meet us on his way
back in to ELF; we hung out for spaghetti and they talked shop, at the end of which Mark got Bob an
interview with a local guy who has a cram-school for Japanese students.</a>

<p>Perfecto!</p>
