<pre>Greetings from _____!

I would like to say Australia, but I am back in Japan after a vegetarian delicious,
spiritually nutritious, rainwater for dishes, wallabies in bushes, climbing rock
fissures, bright star wishes, scrumdiddlyicious retreat in Blue Mountains of
Australia!

Summarizing the experience may prove challenging, but suffice to say I loved it!

First, to help frame the description, I'll state I believe we humans are infinite
spirits temporarily and repeatedly residing in various human bodies.  (i.e. I
believe in reincarnation.)

The retreat included more than just pure meditation.  Clairvision School teaches a
process called ISIS (Inner Space Interactive Sourcing), which uses a meditative
awareness of ourselves to remove our emotional triggers.  (e.g. fear of heights /
spiders / paper cuts / etc; anger at family / life / self / etc; etc, etc.)  These
triggers may or may not make sense in terms of what we can consciously remember,
but when we meditatively recall back to the original event, perhaps remembering
back to previous lives, there's a greater chance of releasing the emotion and
therefore nullifying the trigger, so it won't affect our current lives.

During the week, each of us did 14 hours of this emotional seek-and-express ISIS
process.  And we did 14 hours of guiding others through their own process.

I recalled snippets from several different past lives.. via dream-like images and
feeling the related emotions.  The bits I saw were the emotionally traumatic bits,
which usually meant around the time I died, but also included being a prisoner of
war, and having to leave my family to go to war, among others.

I wrote notes after most of the sessions, and put all of those on my wiki under the
ISIS 101 category: <a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/Category:ISIS_101">http://robnugen.com/wiki/Category:ISIS_101</a>

While there's no real way to prove any of the past life visions are real, the
results are real: I feel tons better getting those emotions *out*!

Everyone was really great, from my co-students Neryl, Steven, Stephanie, Robin,
Jax, to the instructors Ange and Tina, plus everyone else in the lush valley. 
Happy that I got to chat with Helma, who introduced me to this work in Japan.  She
was an instructor in the advanced group during
the same time.

Upon my arrival back in Tokyo, I realized I didn't want to be back in Tokyo.  I
realized this with such gusto that when I called Ami to tell her I was back, I
began to cry.  &#34;I want to go back to Australia...&#34;

Though this has caused some concerns for our relationship, we are taking things
step by step.

- - - -

So, my basic plan = go back to Australia.  Spring in OZ starts in the fall here,
and that's when I intend to join the Clairvision building team to teambuild and
build buildings (basically for housing, and perhaps to replace the composting
toilets): starting in September or October.

The costs there are minimal, just $10 per day for food and free housing, so I can
live there for 18 months for OZ$5500 = US$4000 = 400,000 yen.  So just need to
raise that much money plus live in Tokyo and it'll be great!

One detail includes my current lack of employment, so I've bought and am reselling
poken (*), cute little digital business cards that I think will do quite well in
Japan.  I may have overbought on my initial purchase, as now I don't exactly have
enough yen in Japan to cover my next rent, but I think I'll be able to sell enough
to cover that, and if not, I can transfer some USD to Japan.

While peddling poken, I've pounced upon the plan of promoting performers, putting
performers' pictures on poken, perhaps placing previously poorly promoted people in
peak positions.

So I'm writing a business plan.  Shouldn't be really hard, right?  Righteous
writing results in reaping rewards!

In addition to all the above, I'm practicing massage, reiki, and acupressure.  Have
hands, will travel!  090-8560-4069.
