<p>Each night, Jax and I hang out and chat in her room; this is actually the third such night.  The
first night we actually chatted, and then last night we just wrote journal entries and then &quot;aight
good night&quot; and this night we are both still writing.</p>

<p>She just asked me what I plan to do when I get back; she plans to sneak behind and jump on Simon
while he's at work.  I'm like, &quot;um...&quot; and know I've gotta make some difficult decisions
around work and relationship and housing/city.</p>

<p>I go, &quot;I wanna ask you some questions,&quot; thinking about appropriate behavior back in
Tokyo, &quot;but not right now.  We write right now and I'll ask you later,&quot; wanting to get
another set of write puns right in there.</p>

<p>Now going to chat with Jax fo realx.</p>

<p class="date">12:32am EST Friday  3 April 2009 (day 14254)</p>

<p>Talking about our respective ISIS processes and then the plans for tomorrow; the class is going
to do two long ISIS sessions (one in AM and one in PM) instead of four 'normal' sized sessions (two
in morning and two in evening), and we'll be working with the same partner all day.  I immediately
chose Jax in my mind, and asked her if she'd be my partner.  I was like, &quot;well I know who *I*
want to partner with...&quot; as I caught up to walk with her to dinner.  She does, &quot;who?&quot;
and I'm like, &quot;a woman named Jacquelen&quot; and she's like, &quot;really?&quot; etc and then
agreed we be the best partners for each other.  Later I decided I shoulda said, &quot;my friend
Jax,&quot; but it's all working out nicely.</p>

<p>Anyway, talked about our plans and who was going to go first, and I was like, &quot;I'm a bit
nervous about looking at my mommy issues because I know what's going to come up, and I'm embarrassed
about it.&quot; She's like, &quot;what's going to come up?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;sometimes when
I'm with Ami, I like to call her mommy, and have her take care of me,&quot; and then went on to say
how that's especially true during sex, and I like her to tell me what to do, etc.  I see now that
this ties in exactly to my growing up; I wanted my mommy to be happy with me, and would do anything
to make her happy (but of course that wasn't possible, so it was all in vain).</p>

<p>Jax was all, &quot;aw, well, you should know that I'm not going to judge you, and no one here is
going to judge you, and plus that's perfectly natural,&quot; etc and that helped me feel a bit
better, but then, &quot;why does it have to include sex?&quot; and she's all, &quot;cause it's a
deeper connection; it's more personal.</p>

<p>mmmm makes sense.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;this is the one topic that I've never written in my journal,&quot; although
maybe I had, even before now.  (there's actually one more thing, which will have to wait)</p>

<p>Our conversation continued on sex and adventures in relationships of both long and short
duration.  Success and failures, joy and pain.  Mostly joy.  I like Jax.</p>
