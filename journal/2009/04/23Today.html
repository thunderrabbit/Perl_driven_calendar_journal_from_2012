<p>Been at home until now on the train to Yurika's lesson.  Basically today I got the shopping cart
purchase methods set up at nippoken.com, which basically entailed disabling the default ones,
installing one for Japanese ¿¶¤ê¹þ¤ß (bank transfer), and almost getting the PayPal one set up.</p>

<p>Emailed with Mark from <a href="http://elfcoop.notlong.com/">ELF Cooperative in Tachikawa</a>.
He's got
a <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/elfcooperative/Home/elf-book-collection-for-sale">wonderful
antique book collection, which needs to find a new home</a>.  I emailed Yukari at Google to see if
she knows a way to get in touch with Google-peeps who can do it for their book scanning project.
No reply yet.  Emailed Traci at <a href="http://thepinkcow.com/">The Pink Cow</a> to see if her
Cali-connections could be of use.</p>

<p>Talked to Bob some about poken; he's getting in touch with a guy who knows some peeps, etc.
Excited for it all to work out wonderfully!</p>

<p>Chatted with Jimmy, though not for long; he's busy with making websites.</p>

<p>Listened to Kiko's CD on breath awareness.  Have actually listened to the fourth track (12 mins
or so) a few times in the past couple of days.  Snoozed a bit.</p>

<p>Chatted with Shaun, who helped with Zen-Cart stuff; he created the Japanese language pack that I
installed a few days ago.</p>

<p>Ani updated the plan for going to the Kill Bill restaurant tomorrow; we'll start at a different
bar at first, cause the restaurant reservation is for 10:15pm.  Trusting it'll be a lovely night
meeting peeps and networking poken-style.</p>

<p>Uploaded pics to <a href="http://u.cow.fly2.nu/">Uncle Cow's website</a>, and realize, as
always, I'd like an easier way to upload pics to the sites I maintain.</p>

<p>Have brought the cup I made with Cheerful Dancing Fellows back in June 2007, the last time my
crazy class from PB 49 met.  We planned to meet every year, and did for a while..  Oh anyway, I'm
bringing that cup to Motoya, because I understand they'll use it instead of one of their paper
cups.  Save the environment and give me a bit more tasty beverage.</p>
