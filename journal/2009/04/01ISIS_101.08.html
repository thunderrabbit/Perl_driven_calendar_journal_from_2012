<p>Jax, with point on innter upper righter chest</p>

<p>Happy climbing trees as a child, then lonely as I miss my daddy.  We would sometimes play in the
snow, ride bicycles, build airplanes, go for walks... but I would get in trouble for things that I
didn't know, but that he could have told me, like too much oil in slot cars gums them up.</p>

<p>One time when I was 8, he said the water &quot;goes into the air,&quot; and I was like,
&quot;you mean 'evaporate'??&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, I know more than you may think.</p>
