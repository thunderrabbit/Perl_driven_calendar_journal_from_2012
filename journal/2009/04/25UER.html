<p>Great group with UER.</p>

<p>When we were asked to talk about racism, I told Margaret about the history as I understand it of
British empire via money and raping countries of their people and resources.</p>

<p>I didn't want to leave early; we had just gotten into a really interesting discussion on racism
and it was hard to choose going to find students instead of staying with my friends.</p>

<p>I hope I can chat with Tatiana more on this.</p>
