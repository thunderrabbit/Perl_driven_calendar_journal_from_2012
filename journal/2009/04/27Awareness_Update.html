<p>Not sure what Awareness Update means, but this is what I wrote to Kim, with &quot;Rob Awareness Update&quot; as the subject.</p>

HI Kim!

I am really late for April or really early for May, but I know I sent a Rob Update recently.

Right now I am acutely aware of giving my time away for free.  I understand that it's unsustainable,
and a different part of me is pissed that this type of life is unsustainable.  The world should beg
for more people like me who are working for the enjoyment of working.

The project on which I'm working is Japan Music Week (JMW).  We are putting together a week of music
events in November that we plan to make an annual event like SXSW.

As I write this, I'm wondering where the balance is: how much time to put toward cold-contacting
businesses with my resume, and how much time to put toward networking through this type of volunteer
work.

Jon Lynch, one of the overall event organizers, has his own company which is doing the promotions for JMW.

I see that as an example of having a stable thing in place before branching out to other projects,
exactly as you've suggested I do.

Been meeting people in entertainment industry; met a guy who will have a table at an art show on 15
- 16 May; I'll put some pieces up on his table..

Have a goal of giving 3 massages per week minimum, building up customer base.

   Love and Light
   - Rob!

<p>Just as I was finishing the message, Leslie called, asking for a massage.  Yes yes yes.</p>
