<p>I don't like that they call the meeting locations temples.  It makes me think this organization
sounds like a religion, or worse yet, might be a religion.  But our ISIS 101 group was invited to
join the just slightly bigger ISIS intensive group in the main temple tonight for some vision
spaces and such.</p>

<p>John, the MC for the group, continued to be the MC for this extended group, with Helma as his
opposite pillar.  Ange and Tina sat to John's right and left, respectively.</p>

<p>We heard some chapters read from Atlantean Secrets volume 4 (I think), with Szar bringing and
visiting Maryani down to/in Vasook's kingdom.  Did some eye contact exercises, trading some
perceptions (I partnered with <del>Claire</del> <ins>Carmen</ins> (saw a pure white column for her
connection), Denis (blue light), then Vera (with whom I'd like to chat at greater length; she
skipped the topic and asked about my ability to keep my awareness above my head)).</p>

<p>In the discussion afterward, I said the space in the temple felt easier for me to connect to
meditative space.  Easier probably than the downstairs temple, and way way easier than my room.</p>

<p>We then did some vision spaces after a pee break.  I partnered with Stephanie (from my 101 group)
(we didn't say much) and then David (with whom I got a ride here) (who did a bit of channeling for
me), for the first two general-topic vision spaces, and then with <del>Claire</del> <ins>Carmen</ins>
again for the personalized question vision spaces.</p>

<p>My questions were about how to develop my vision and ways to see what vision I have already.  I
don't remember much except I said I feel kinesthetically.  After the first portion, I mentioned that
I had seen she needed massage and shoulders and legs.  She said her arms too, but I had missed that
with my brief remote scan.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, I really enjoyed gazing into <del>Claire</del> <ins>Carmen</ins>'s eyes.
Turns out they're only 20 years old, but the space felt good.  Both she and David (and some others
who seem to have vision have) said basically, &quot;your presence is very grounded, and excellent
space for doing this work.  Just keep practicing.&quot;</p>
