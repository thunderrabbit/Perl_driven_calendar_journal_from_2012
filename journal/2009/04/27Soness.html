<p>Took the train to Chigasaki to chat with Soness after taking the train to the station a couple
of stops before Chigasaki to chat with Matt, Tomoe, and Soness about shtuffs after we all attended
the most recent Japan Music Week meeting.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  When creating Soness' email account at the JMW domain, I had to
log on as Ed (for his admin priviledges) and noted he had been CCd on a message from Jon about
Poken; Andrew S emailed Jon Lynch and Peter (from Akoni) that there should be a poken promotion in
Japan Music Week.</p>

<p>I agree there should be a poken promotion in Japan.  That's why I showed poken to Jon Lynch on
the first JMW meeting back before even the pre-launch kickoff party.  (^_^)V</p>

<p>(just sayin')</p>
