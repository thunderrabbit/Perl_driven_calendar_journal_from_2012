<p>Now going to surf the waves of the internet.  Free at my old work if possible..  Otherwise at a
cafe.</p>

<p>Chatted with Andrew today at my ex-work; he said things are going about like they were going when
I was let go.</p>

<p>During my visit, I was generally working on installing the new Dada mailer for Traci at The Pink
Cow.  Hopefully it eases the work required for her to send her weekly emails.</p>
