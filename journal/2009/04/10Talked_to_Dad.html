<p>I called Dad to see if he can help me sort out the signature card for my bank account, and told
him the latest haps with OZ, Ami, poken, etc.</p>

<p>He asked if I thought I'd be coming back to the US anytime soon.  I was like, &quot;nottt
reallyy...&quot; and he seemed understanding and actually said I would really enjoy Australia.
Nice.  And, I agree.</p>
