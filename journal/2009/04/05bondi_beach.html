<p>Chilled with Jax a bit at her apartment and took a shower, ate half a cantaloupe each, and then
she was like, &quot;Sorry to flake on you, but I'm gonna take a nap.&quot;</p>

<p>As I was debating just takin' a nap or going straight to the airport, she was like, &quot;you can
go to the beach; it's just down the street,&quot; I was like &quot;yah yah beach;&quot; I sorta
didn't want to go outside; seeing a lot of people just seemed like too much craziness for my still
semi-spaced-out brain.  but decided it couldn't hurt to go check it out.  Perfect weather, and just
a short 2 blocks away.</p>

<p>To sweeten the deal, I inquired about food.  &quot;Is there any place where I can get a good
vegetarian sandwich?&quot; There was, so I left Jax and went and enjoyed chewing the crispy bread,
sauteed mushrooms plus risotto cheese and spinach, while a little baby girl with blue eyes gnawed on
bits of bread from her mom's sandwich and then a stalk of celery while gazing happily at me.  Her
parents were like, &quot;so you got a new boyfriend, eh?&quot; and after a bit, while the mom went
out to do a bit more shopping, leaving dad to keep the celery under control, I pulled out Uncle Cow
which the girl enjoyed petting a little.  Mom came back all, &quot;where'd you get the cow?&quot;
and I said it was an engagement offering.  Laughter and celery gnawing ensued until they headed
out.</p>

<p>I then walked 2 minutes to Bondi Beach, a veritable paradise of lovely water, waves, surfers,
sand, seagulls, a skatepark, plus a hotel with a pool into which ocean water frequently frolicks.</p>

<p>I wandered along the beach, enjoying the water and watching surfers enjoy the waves.
Interestingly, just during the hour I was there, the waves progressively reached higher toward
sunbathers (launching them from their previously dry positions) and enthusiastically protected
sandcastles (launching new wall building campaigns).</p>

<p>As I headed back, I realized Jax forgot to tell me &quot;be sure to check out the skate
park;&quot; fortunately I noticed a skater doing some tricks nearby and was led to the Bondi
Skatepark. &quot;come over and SK8 my brains out!&quot; was part of the phrase painted on the small
blue pool with a circular deep end and a cute shallow end, several people around the rails watching
a few skatin' guys and one little 8 year old girl who got air going from the deep end up into the
shallow end.</p>

<p>I took a bit of video which I'll splice together and post soon (?)</p>

<p>In just those few hours at Bondi Beach, and yammerin' with Jax, I realized how much I miss that
type of play.  So good hang wif Jax and get a sense of what life can be like, instead of me
suffering along in my small apartment and small to non-existent paycheck...  not sure wtf I'm doing
in Tokyo anymore; it's time to roll out.</p>
