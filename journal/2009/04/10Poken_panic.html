<p>So today, I started lookin' a bit more into this poken stufff...  turns out the Japanese website
just started on April 1st...  It's *just* gotten to Japan!!  I quickly ordered two boxes of these
critters for $333 including shipping, to be charged to my checking account in the US.</p>

<p>Logged in to my online banking, went to transfer money to cover the charge and Oh Snap, I
can't.  Called CSR and it turns out that I haven't signed the master account thingie, so I can't do
much with the account.  Tsk.  Crud.  Crumbles....  They won't send the thing to my address in
Japan, (even though it's on my account), so they're going to send it to my dad who can send it to
me (i.e. forge my signature) and then I/he will send it back to them.</p>

<p>$27 NSF fee later, I can transfer the money.</p>

<p>I asked my mom to cover the amount... I hope she can deposit money soon enough.</p>

<p>And then, I got the smart idea to see if I can buy poken directly in Japan in Japanese yen.  Of
course I can since there's a website here, but I wasn't smart enough fast enough.</p>

<p>Anyway, so I have ordered 24 poken for $333 via the one site, and am going to buy 60 more poken
in Japanese yen right now....  Don't actually know the price they wanna charge, but I assume it's
not more than what's on their website: 19,840 yen for 12.  Wow dang it's significantly more in yen.
I guess the %10 discount code I found helped a lot.  I wonder if I can use a discount code for
today's purchase.</p>
