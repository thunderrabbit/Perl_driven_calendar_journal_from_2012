<p>After chatting with Tina the logistics coordinator, I washed a couple of bowls and serving spoons
for her to help clean up.  She was like, &quot;oh you don't have to do that,&quot; and I was all,
&quot;well, I have a crush on you, so...&quot;  She didn't react, but just perhaps thanked me for
washing the dishes.</p>
