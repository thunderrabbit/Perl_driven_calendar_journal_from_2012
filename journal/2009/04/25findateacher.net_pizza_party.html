<p>On the train with Bob headed to Asakusa Mitsuke and the Finda Pizza Student Teacher networking
thingy.</p>

<p>We're talkin' about our mutual job searches.</p>

<p class="date">1:19am JST Sunday 26 April 2009 (day 14277)</p>

<p>At Bob's house now in Tachikawa.  Had a really fun time at Sam and Dave's, where the
findateacher pizza party was held.  There were only 9 medium sized pizzas served (they'd probably
be considered small in the US) for a shload of people, so that kinda sucked, (bob got zero slices;
I got 3 + scraps).  Met a couple girls at first, Michiko and Yoriko.  Michiko lives in Tsunashima,
just two stations away from me.  We sorted out a price of 2000 yen per lesson in Motosumiyoshi, but
I'd be willing to bet she'll never contact me.</p>

<p>Met a man named Hiro, who will have a table at Big Sight on 15 and 16 May, at which I will put
my art work, and give him a cut of the sales price!  Woowoo!</p>

<p>A guy named Justin from OZ was there; he and his mate (whose name I've forgotten) and me an'
Bob, plus one other woman (whose name I never got) all hung out for a poken sale and billiards on
the cute table.  I knocked in two balls in one shot!!  Too bad they were for the other players, but
we still had fun jammin' out to music with guitars, of the air, pool cue, and cow variety.</p>

<p>Justin figured if we went to Unit we'd sell all the poken, and I am all up for that, but we hung
out dancing until Bob and I had to get last train.  I was doing a light-on-floor chasing dance for
a while, and generally had a great and lovely time.</p>
