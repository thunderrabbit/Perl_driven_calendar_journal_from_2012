<p>As a result of my crazed cleansing, I'm catching the 10:17 train instead of my planned 10:10
train.  I coulda caught the local train at 10:14, but this express train will pass it.</p>

<p class="date">10:41am JST Tuesday 21 April 2009 (day 14272)</p>

<p>Now on the Inokashira line from Shibs to Meidaimae, where I'll switch to some other line and go
two stops to Sasazuka.</p>

<p>S'posed to get there by 11am; it will be close; this is a local train, therefore slow, and there
are trains on the next line that will pass Sasazuka, so depending on their schedule (which, though
determined, I simply don't know), I can make it.</p>

<p>Oh!  haha.  I'll make it easily!  I just checked via my cellphone.  I'll have 3 minutes (plenty)
to get from this line to Keio Line in Meidai-Mae, and then arrive at Sasazuka at 10:53am.</p>
