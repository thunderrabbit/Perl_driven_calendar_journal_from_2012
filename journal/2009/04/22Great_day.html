<p>On the train headed home, but just read emails via my phone so we're already leaving
Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>Great day and evening and night tonight.  Worked briefly on wristbands this morning, and sent
several emails with a guy named Shaun who is developing and distributing Japanese translations of
Zen-Cart.  I paid him $15 via PayPal.  Turns out he lives in Japan and is interested in buying a
poken as well!</p>

<p>Before getting wristbands designed, it was time to leave to meet Bob in Shibuya, where we got
some pictures with his friend's Flat Stanley, and then some pictures with U-Cow (but I don't think
we got them photographed together)..  We met in Motoya and came to the conclusion that we shouldn't
be designing wristbands yet; we need more discussion and planning for how to allow the different
things we want to allow, and still keep the number of wristbands printed to a reasonable number.</p>

<p>Said bye to him and headed to Daiso to buy some clipboards and A4 plastic covers for Japan Music
Week's Pre-Launch Party tonight!</p>

<p>Walked to the location, Le Baron de Paris (or something), on B1F of a building in Minami-Aoyama.
Helped with setup by making copies of materials to hand out to peeps and handed them out as peeps
arrived, and then chatted with peeps inside and generally had a lovely time.</p>

<p>Took video of Kiko with her video camera; she sang three songs, including my favorite,
&quot;Lion Rrroar&quot; which is on _Opening_, the first album I bought from her.</p>

<p>Soness and Bob supported poken sales in the later part of the evening; I'm so so thankful for
their help!  Soness refused any renumeration before I pay my rent, and I didn't try to give any to
Bob, but will when I chill with him this Saturday night.</p>

<p>Met tons of peeps, got tons of cards, got photographed with Tomoko and U-Cow, and then with
Tomoko's friend and U-Cow</p>

<p>Met <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sublimetokyo/">Sublime</a>, a French jazz singer.</p>

<p>Met Laurier who said I looked like a cross between Tom Cruise and some other movie star, and
almost bought a poken.</p>

<p>Met Felicia, a promoter-superstar who I had previously met on Facebook.  She asked lotsa lotsa
questions about what Japan Music Week will do for the promoters, venues and performers.  I tried my
best to answer the Qs, and we laughed about the way she and two others were sorta surrounding me
against the wall, which featured an old-timey picture of a woman being spanked by a bare breasted
woman.  Felicia took several pictures of me at that picture, for funniness' sake.</p>

<p>Met Jonah, the president of <a href="http://tokyoplayers.org/">Tokyo International Players</a>,
who said he studied shiatsu for 3 years, and did a quick test and told me exactly where in my back I
had an issue, and then adjusted my back there.  Wow.</p>

<p>Met reggae performer <a href="http://blackey-blog.blogspot.com/">Blackkey</a> and Sidney, his
manager, who bought two poken.  They were dressed well in pin striped suits and nice ties.</p>
