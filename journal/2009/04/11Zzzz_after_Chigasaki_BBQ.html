<p>People are beginning to crash here at Soness's house after the 4th annual Couchsurfing BBQ +
karaoke.</p>

<p>Ami came out this year, though she left around 4 or 5pm with a woman who lives in Tsurumi.</p>

<p>I enjoyed chatting with peeps, including Ani from Sydney, who will be performing at The Pink Cow
on Thursday, and who bought two (2) poken, one of which will be for her friend, and Sorcha, who
bought one (1) poken, and who will be performing on Friday night in Shimokitazawa at her bf's
bar/club.</p>

<p>I plan to see Ani's performance on Thursday, and hang out with Soness on Friday and then go see
Sorcha after that.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Matt for helping me sell poken; he was right there promoting them, though he
didn't buy one himself.  His current project sounds a lot like Lee Hirsch's story of creating
_Amandla!, Revolution in Four Part Harmony_.  Matt's grandmother is/was Japanese, and his dad was
born in Japan, and given up for adoption(?) in Nagasaki.  From Matt's age, I'm guessing that was
essentially right after the end of WW2, and certainly *not* an easy time to be
Japanese-American.</p>

<p>Anyway, he's tracing his dad's roots back to see if he can find the family who raised him, etc;
it's been a two year project so far, and Matt sometimes wants to give up, thinking it's not going
(to go) anywhere, or that it needs focus, etc.  But I was like, &quot;dood, Amandla! took ten or
eleven years to make.  Stay on your search; the movie's focus will come.&quot;</p>

<p>Jen and Ben are cute together, always chewing on one another.  Helle and Helen enjoyed puns on
their names.  &quot;You can say 'hey hell,en, how's it going?'&quot;</p>

<p>People are telling bedtime stories now...  Sean is snorin' and Ben is like, &quot;omg I can't
sleep if there's any kind of inconsistent noise in the room.&quot;  Matt goes, &quot;he'll do this
all night, but he's one of the nicest guys I know though.&quot;  Ben goes, &quot;he'd stop if we
kill him.&quot;  &quot;Yeah, but where would we put the body?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd rather be sleeping with Hitler right now.&quot;  &quot;Oh man I totally want to meet
him as a 20 year old painter, to find out what his vision of the world was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The current pope was in Hitler Youth..&quot;</p>
