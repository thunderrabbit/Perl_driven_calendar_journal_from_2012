<p>Finally got out of the house and the lure of hiding away from cold rainy weather in my warm cozy
nest.  Right now heading with Uncle Cow, several poken, my contact case and contact juice to
Tachikawa, where I'll be a tiny bit late for UER meeting at 3pm, and then leave early from UER at
6pm to go with Bob to the Findateacher Pizza Buffet, for which I have just RSVPed by selling my
email address for 500 yen off.</p>
