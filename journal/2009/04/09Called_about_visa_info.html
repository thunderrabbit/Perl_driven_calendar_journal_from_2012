<p>According
to <a href="http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/keiziban/happyou/tokyo_tell.html">http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/keiziban/happyou/tokyo_tell.html</a>,
one can call either the Tokyo Regional Immigration Bureau (representative number): 03-5796-7111; or
Immigration Information Center: 03-5796-7112.  I was greeted with computer-generated voice reading
information on the first number.  The second number more quickly got me to an English speaking
human.</p>

<p>I had called the immigration office with one question in mind:  Is it easier to</p>

<p><b>(A)</b> Change my work visa from Engineering (to work in IT) to Humanities (to teach
English)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or</p>

<p><b>(B)</b> fill out
the <a href="http://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/pdf/parttime_worl_application.pdf">Application for
Permission to Engage in Activity Other Than That Permitted under the Status of Residence Previously
Granted</a>? (pdf from <a href="http://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/academics/part-time/permission/">Nagoya
University</a>)</p>

<p>I called and tried to ask in Japanese.  I was transferred to a person who essentially spoke
English.  He told me that the correct process is to get a letter of termination from my previous
employer, and I imagine therefore have to change to 90 day visitor visa (unless I also) submit
proof of employment from my new employer.</p>

<p>Well, there's the trick; I don't have proof of employment yet.  I contacted Gaba yesterday and
Keiko told me I'd need to apply for the change of visa before I can apply for the job cause that's
the first thing Gaba will want to see: permission to work in the industry.</p>

<p>So I'm a bit stuck with both sides wanting the other side to act first.</p>

<p>Ami just called me; she's going to call them and try to get a finer grained answer.</p>
