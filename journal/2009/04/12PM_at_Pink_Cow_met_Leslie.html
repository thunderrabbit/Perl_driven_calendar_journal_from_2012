<p>Tonight's the night I brought Ami to The Pink Cow for the wood carving night.  I puppypiled us
into the front tables to carve woodprint art.  I made a paddle for a certain person who likes
paddles and crops and such.  Met Chase, AJ, Riana (sp), and Leslie.  It was Chase's first time to
TPC.  I am sure I have seen Riana before (though she didn't think so, necessarily).  Leslie
remembered my Genuine Joe's shirt (but it may just be that she saw it in Austin (*)), and AJ is a
fellow artist, of the digital variety.  He may come to my art show
at <a href="http://elfcoop.notlong.com/">ELF in Tachikawa</a>.</p>

<p>(*) Leslie and I have a few things in common: she's from Texas (Arlington), does reiki (level 2),
and massage (is actually a massage therapist), went to renfest regularly, and has a similar sense of
humor.  She might also come to my show at ELF.</p>

<p>Showed them all poken, but none of them thought it was as great an idea as me.  Not yet.</p>

<p>Tonight was a great jam session with a bright smilely Japanese girl and keyboard, drums,
trumpet, t-bone, and sax players, who jammed and did three encores, even when she gave out and some
random guy from the audience (random to me, but he's apparently done some shows at The Pink Cow)
jamming &quot;I Feel Good&quot; and then &quot;Superstition&quot; or something that started with S
and is a song that everyone else seemed to know but me.</p>

<p>Great great fun jam session.  I love The Pink Cow!!</p>
