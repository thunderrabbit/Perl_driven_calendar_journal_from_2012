<p>Met Malek today; I'm actually still in the office; we chatted about some possibilities for
poken, and he's thinking they can be really good for promotions.  I'm like, &quot;so ya wanna buy
lots of 'em from me??&quot; and he says stuff about cash flow etc etc.</p>

<p>yep.  I understand.</p>

<p>BUT, he will introduce me to some peeps, so there's still some action happenin'.</p>

<p>I've been chillin' here for a bit, talking to Fred, Soness and Jimmy online.</p>
