<p>I fell asleep on the train around Bubaigawara, and woke up in Shitte, one stop from Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Kawasaki is the last station, so I just stayed put and am headed back now.  Will jump off
in Musashi-Kosugi so I can buy foodage on the way home.  Also in support of me eating, I didn't
touch my card in Tachikawa, and it's easier to sneak out in Kosugi than in Motosumiyoshi.</p>
