<p class="date">Tuesday  7 April 2009 (day 14258)</p>

<p>Tuesday I did laundry, threw a couple things away in the spirit of cleaning my room, applied for
one or two jobs, called Romen (my recruiter), and lulled around the internets.</p>

<p>Ami came over in the evening and everything was fine, including the snuggles, until I was like,
&quot;yeah so as I was saying, I wanna go to OZ in September, and I'm thinking it's best if we
break up at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami was sad and angry, and I opened my heart to her as she spoke through her tears.  I really
like when she's able to talk despite being upset.</p>

<p>I was triggered a bit when the time came for her to go home (as per her original schedule) and
she didn't go home.  But fair enough; she deemed the conversation more important.  I was just
worried that her dad would get mad at her. (Ami said she was supposed to be home for some type of
ceremony after her mom's death in November.)</p>

<p>We sorted out the issue, essentially.  I'm like, &quot;yeah we need to break up so I can focus
on meditation in OZ.&quot;  Ami is like, &quot;you focused well enough for two weeks, why can't you
do it for a year?&quot;</p>

<p>My answer to her question includes desires to just feel free.  Free of all requirements, free of
any concerns about what I *have* to do..  Another part of it stems from having had relationship
troubles by *not* breaking up with Hitomi before PB 52.</p>
