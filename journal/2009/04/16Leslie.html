<p>Chillin' with Leslie (of Leslie and Leslie) at The Pink Cow!  Just found out she's billiards
champ in Texas and Japan.</p>

<p>We ate delicious Pink Cow burritos, traded shoulder massages, talked about her billiards career,
Texas, music, Texas music, U-Cow, The Pink Cow, Terry Pratchett, terry cloth, and/or other topics
as appropriate.</p>
