Hey Kimmi Bebbi

I quite enjoyed the essay; thanks for sending!  It helps me to see dear Twitchell as a person; I was
one who got pissed at her for "giving me" an F (one page, carefully crafted, is enough to summarize
Alex Haley's _Roots_), and getting in trouble for playing with Lynda Smith's hair in class.

ANYWAY, I like knowing that Karen played bad cop...   That doesn't mean she *was* the bad cop.

Thank you for your hard work behind the scenes.

Yesterday, I tried to explain when one can use "good old" as an adjective.  "It can refer to a
person, place, thing, or time period... and it basically means 'reliable,' but not necessarily in
the sense that it worked, but just that it was there, for a long period of time," I said.

"What does 'reliable' mean?" she asked.

Hmmm.
