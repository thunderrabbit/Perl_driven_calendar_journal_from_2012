<p>Emailed Malek after my shiatsu lesson to see if I could meet up with him today to talk about
Poken.  No response; turns out he was out.  I wandered from Shinsen station to Harajuku, down ¥¿¥±
street, and back to Shibuya, turning often into different shops to see if they'd be interested in
selling Poken.  The people to whom I spoke were all part-time workers, and unable to do much, besides
perhaps give me a name/time/phone number of the boss who could perhaps make such a decision.</p>

<p>Got such phone numbers from Four Twenty, and Tokyo Hands, which are about as opposite as
possible in size and product line, but ah well.</p>

<p>Also dropped off a Loose Change DVD to Sofa, who works in the hip hop shop next to Thanks
Nature.  I had talked to him and then Dr Steve yesterday.</p>

<p>Door to door sellin' is hard.</p>
