<p>So here I am, chillin' in the airport, waiting for Kristen to magically appear, and a man asks
me if I can give him some advice on getting a room (he has a list of inexpensive hotels scattered
across Tokyo).   We've been talking for some time, have sorted out which hotel he should visit to
start his 14 day adventure, and then talking about religion vs spirituality, and then he asks for
my phone number and if I can find for him a retired architect.</p>

<p>I'm okay with giving my digits; I assume not too much can happen.  Retired architect?  I called
Mark at ELF Co-op, but no answer.  &quot;For what do you need a retired architect?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A 600 room hospital in Dubai and Pakistan and all over the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think Dubai has a hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes it does.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what's special about your hospital?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's very special..  There isn't another hospital in the world like it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it's a secret.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a secret, but I'm getting an intuition that I shouldn't tell you at the moment,
but...&quot; blah blah etc.</p>

<p>Fair enough.  He gave me 500 yen for my troubles of calling to get the hotel reservation made
and I'll send him off on the Keisei Skyliner to Ueno, etc.</p>

<p>&quot;Habib means beloved, ur means of, and Rehman means merciful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, with a name like that, why do you think you don't have a warm heart?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh the things I have thought in my mind ... &quot;</p>

<p>Can't help ya there, mate, 'cept to say &quot;I imagine I know what you mean, cause I've had those
thoughts too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so has everyone, but I think I am a little below the average.  I think I am blessed, I
think I have received from God the combined blessings of ten-thousand people, but I still have these
thoughts that I should not have.&quot;</p>

<p>Now he's getting a jumper from Uniqlo, and I'm still chillin' at my Kristen-waiting spot, which
has become a Habib-ur-Rehman-speaking spot.</p>

<p class="date">11:52am JST Monday  6 April 2009 (day 14257)</p>

<p>He came back jumperless, saying something about the price (2700 yen), and that my repeated
question &quot;are you really that cold?&quot; musta been a sign that he shouldn't buy it.</p>

<p>Headed toward the train and he said he was getting an intuition that he shouldn't go, but was
going to go anyway, and I showed him where to buy the ticket, which he bought and headed on his way
to Ueno.  &quot;Thank you very, very much, Rob.  Thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>Um, &quot;no worries.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm.  Well, though I haven't heard from Kristen today, I've definitely heard several times from
Habib-ur-Rehman.  He's called me to ask how to get from Ueno to the next station (ask somebody
there), and then he called when he was worried maybe he should stay in a different hotel (then do
it), and <em>then</em> he called me to say he was really stuck and was coming back to the airport
to find me.</p>

<p>Um, well, that was 15 minutes ago, and I'm leaving now.  Sorry mate.</p>

<p class="date">4:59pm JST Monday  6 April 2009 (day 14257)</p>

<p>Er, he just arrived.</p>
