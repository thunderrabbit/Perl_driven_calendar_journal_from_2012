<p>Emailed Mark Shuttleworth via Facebook to see if we can get together on Poken sales.  He's the
one who brought them to The Pink Cow.</p>

<p>Called my dentist at 9am to see if they'd be able to fill in a gaping hole in my toof that they
had opened up to fill in, but the filling fell out when I ate an apple recently.</p>

<p>Got an appointment for 12:30pm, at the end of which I gave a poken to my dentist, cause he had
jokingly said, &quot;ちょだい&quot; when I showed him mine.  Hopin' it starts a revolution of people
in his office wanting them.</p>

<p>Called Andrew and chowed pizza with him at Shakey's and he bought a poken cause he just got
finished with a drug trial in Kagoshima, wants to know how they work, and wanted to help me out.
He thinks we should set up a website to sell 'em, and will tell Malek they should look into the
product a bit more, so hopefully meeting with them tomorrow.</p>

<p>Wandered around a bit after that, including to ドンキーホーテ to find they don't sell Poken, and
to Juvenile Delinquent to find their product line wouldn't really go well with Poken (er vice
versa), and to a hip hop shop to see if they'd like to get in on the new wave of Pokens coming to
Japan.</p>

<p>Talked to a guy who was not the owner, told him
about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wtc+7">WTC 7</a> after he told me how the only problem
with Bush was he loves 'merika too much.  He said the owner would be in around 5pm, so I'm about to
go back there.</p>

<p>Got an email from Leslie (from last night at <a href="http://thepinkcow.com/">The Pink Cow</a>)
and arranged to meet her on Thursday, and see Ani at The Pink Cow that night.</p>
