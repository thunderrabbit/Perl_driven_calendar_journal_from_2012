<p>For the final ISIS of this week, Steven was my connector.  He put his fingers just to the right
of my sternum and I got into a little bit of a story about anger at my brother and then from my mom
while in the womb, and then he was like, &quot;spin back to before you came into your mother,&quot;
and I found myself &quot;wanting a challenge,&quot; of having anger built into my heart so I could
burn through it with love, but it's been a pretty difficult challenge (like learning Japanese?) and
I'm not sure the point now.  He had me &quot;spin back to the previous lifetime,&quot; in search
of when this anger came in.</p>

<p>He said, &quot;find the reason that you wanted a challenging lifetime&quot; or something, and I
flashed on my lifetime in the US during the US Civil War.  This was a tragically sad death so I
couldn't imagine how it could make me &quot;want a challenge,&quot; but I went with it and got some
interesting clarity on the death scene.</p>

<p>The first part was leaving my wife to go fight this &quot;stupid war,&quot; just to make money
for the family.  So sad to leave my beautiful wife whom I loved so much, but I did it for the
family.</p>

<p>In the war, I was in a battle and got shot in the left gut, perhaps where my birthmark is now.
Not a mortal wound by any stretch, but enough to get out of the war and get my pension and be done
with it.  I went to sleep on the battle field with the intention of waking up after the battle,
making my way back to camp, and getting out and done.</p>

<p>Lo, I wake up with a bayonette through my heart, in shock surprise and rage at the &quot;stupid
fuck&quot; who killed me for no reason.  Can't he see this is a stupid war?  Can't he see I was
peacefully sleeping?  Is he a fuckin' idio...</p>

<p>And I died with that raging anger at him and sadness for my family, and this anger is still
chillin' in my heart, and possibly hard to express partially due to being under threat of death for
expressing any fear or anger in a previous lifetime.</p>

<p>Got out more anger, ripping the blanket a bit more (Jax says she coulda gotten me way more into
my anger) and then floated around in space looking at the stark difference between the anger and
love in my heart.  Black cold coals versus brilliant sunny love.</p>
