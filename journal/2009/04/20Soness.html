<p>Soness, who was going to come chat with me about poken plans, basically had to cancel her trip
because her train was delayed.  She had been hoping to come out around 4pm to Shibuya, but was
delayed by cleaning out her closet (literally and metaphorically), and then when the train kept
stopping, never ended up making it out.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I like chatting with her!</p>
