<p>Tonight Ani invited all her peeps to join her at Gonpachi, the restaurant after which _The House
of Blue Leaves_ (?) fight scene in Kill Bill was modeled.  As we took pictures, Roger informed me
of the shocking news that the scene wasn't actually filmed in the restaurant.</p>

<p>Dang.</p>

<p>Ah well, we got lotsa hilarious pictures, including a video with premature ending as Ani's camera
ran out of memory.  Dang. </p>

<p>Before the restaurant, we hung out from 8pm at A297 bar in Roppongi, where several peeps came
out, including DJ James, DJ Dwane Wayne, Will from PB 58, Ry, Ben, Roger, and I think one more
person whom I've forgotten, plus a Jon Lynch doppelganger lurking around on his cell phone.</p>

<p>Conversation featured Dwane's belief that the media has mocked up the story about the guy from
Smap being arrested for being naked in a park.  The story just doesn't add up: he says he doesn't
remember, so the story must be coming from the girl in the taxi who says they dropped him off in
the park, which happens to be next to the building where he lives.</p>

<p>He was crazy-drunk at the time, so it makes no sense that they would drop him off in the park.
They woulda dropped him off at his building so he could go home and sleep.</p>

<p>Before A297, Ani and I met up around 6:30pm, and chilled down by the marble bean-cave-nest, in
which Ani climbed to get what will hopefully be pictures for an upcoming album.</p>

<p>Around 10pm, Roger, Ani, and I headed to Gonpachi, where I left her umbrella hanging outside as
we went inside after taking several pictures.  Dinner was slow but delicioso, and we were joined
after a bit by Alex (who we met at the first JMW meeting we attended on Monday) and Yale, who
places people in jobs in the financial industry.</p>

<p>I didn't have U-Cow, but got some funny pictures anyway.</p>

<p>Hilarious mascara rivers as we tried to get Ani to do her best impression of Japanese food
programs where people are so amazed at how delicious the food is.</p>

<p>Thanks to Roger and Ani who paid the lion's share of the food and the taxi to Shibuya.  They are
headed to Shinjuku for more drinkin', and I'm on the train home (in Tamagawa now).</p>

<p>Interesting!  The train signs are not working.  Like it doesn't say where the train is located now.</p>
