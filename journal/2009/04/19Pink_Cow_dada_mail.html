<p>At The Pink Cow, installing dada mail.  It seems to be taking a longer time to upload the files
than when I uploaded them a bit ago.  It must be that I didn't upload them before, but that seems
weird that it would just upload some of the files.  But anyway, they're about to be all uploaded and
I'll be meeting Ami soon for dinner with Mark, Yoko, etc. Unfortunately our dinner won't be
here.</p>

<p>File upload finished.  I'm a bit late to meet Ami and them at 5:50.</p>
