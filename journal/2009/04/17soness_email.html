<b>Sunday Monday Happy Days</b>

Soness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Have to say today blew me away. Monday も、楽しみ、ね。
Thank you for showing me a new way, quality alone time so you say,
but seeing you network outside yo chez, better than watching cheerleaders play.

Practically hang on every word you say, including your ticket I did not pay.
Had you been able to stay, I'da got yo ticket with no delay
Your house be down Chigasaki way, where the beach is near and seagulls play
Lookin' forward to the next day: that we tear up the カラオケ！

Nibbles' dog's legs open the way, for her to use the kitty toilet
That is a rhyme I did not say; it didn't fit in any useful way
but funny so that it had to stay, and hopefully did not spoil it.


Ah, but that's not why I'm writing.
I need to go to *my* dentist at least this one more time, cause last time I gave him a poken.
Perhaps the staff will each want to get one..

     See you sooness
      - Rob!
