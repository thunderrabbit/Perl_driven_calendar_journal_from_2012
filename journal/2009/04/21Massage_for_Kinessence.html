<p>Sweet.  Really happy to get such positive feedback from Ani on acupressure and freestyle
massage.  She made a request for face massage and while there I was like, <em>hmmmm I bet a little
larynx activation would be alright</em>, and she commented positively on that.  &quot;That was
really good, that thing you were doing here...&quot; but with her Aussie accent, &quot;here&quot;
sounds like, &quot;hea&quot;</p>

<p>After an hour, we switched to kinessence (I don't know if that's the word she uses), but I quite
enjoyed the process, not just because it involved breathing, breathing, breathing, which is exactly
the number one (1) technique my angels gave for how to maintain love emanating from my heart. </p>

<p>I had never done a technique quite like this; it combined several techniques in a way I hadn't
previously seen them combined, plus some stuff I have done internally (asking for angelic feedback,
asking the Clear Fountain in Clairvision terminology), but not seen done externally.</p>

<p>We started with me setting an intention: that I have abundance (enough money to live in Tokyo
through September or October ($2000 per month until then), and saving $7000 to go to Australia for a
year-plus afterward), and I breathed into that, choosing to live in this reality.</p>

<p>I fell briefly in love with Ani during the process, and then back to normality after a bit.  At
the end I told her &quot;<!-- I'm essentially over my crush on you, and --> I really like you, like
on a business and friendship level..  I'm really glad we're friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Then I go, &quot;strictly speaking, there's a part of me that wants to bite you, and I'm just
being aware of that.  I appreciate that I can tell you and you don't freak out.&quot;</p>

<p>My homework:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>breathe into my belly area three times a day for five or ten minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>give massages to people three times a day, preferrably for pay, but free is okay.</p></li>
</ol>
