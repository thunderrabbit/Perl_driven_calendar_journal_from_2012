<p>Headed to The Pink Cow now, first to support Traci in getting her new version of Dada mail set
up, testing its setup, setting up Mystery Girl, the bounce handler, and eventually importing all the
emails from her current system.</p>

<p>Then meeting Gen for the first time for my first lesson teaching via Cow-Go, The Pink Cow's
education center.</p>

<p>Have just read through the installation of Mystery Girl twice-ish, and am pretty sure we can set
it up on her system.</p>
