<p>Called Ami immediately upon arrival.  Good mornings and such and when she asked if I'd be coming
straight home, I was like, &quot;no&quot; because Kris Hartley will be in the airport today (though
I don't know what time) and I'm hoping to meet her.  When Ami asked why, I was all, &quot;I want to
go back to Sydney,&quot; and she was like &quot;yah&quot; and I go, &quot;no really,&quot; and found
myself crying.  She's all, &quot;are you okay?&quot; and I go &quot;no....&quot; unable to explain
in any language the depth of friendships that I made in a week were greater than years in Japan (not
exactly including PB, but)... The surface level relationships here don't touch my soul as those
beautiful openings in a week in OZ.</p>

<p>I let Ami go to email Kris; now I'm chillin' in a waiting area, with my phone charging on the
floor about 2 meters in front of me.  I decided to chill in a chair while it soaks up electrons.</p>
