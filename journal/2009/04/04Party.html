<p>10:20pm is the time I checked my current age in days to tell Vera and Steven after having told
them I monitor my age that way.</p>

<p>Just now is when the party has officially finished, and I'm in the penthouse (restroom with
flushing toilets) dropping bits and recording some tidbits.</p>

<p class="date">1:18am EST Sunday  5 April 2009 (day 14256)</p>

<p>And now is when I'm writing more.  I mostly chatted with Steven and Vera, telling them several
stories from PB voyages around the world, and meeting amazing people doing amazing things.  I quite
enjoyed their attention to my story; I love when people are genuinely interested in what I have to
say.</p>

<p>After Steven headed to bed, Vera told me a bit about her style of living, having no desire for
any part of &quot;the systems&quot; of marriage, 9-to-5, office work, TV, etc.  <em>Mmmm that sounds
cool,</em> I'm thinking.  <em>Will you marry me?</em></p>
