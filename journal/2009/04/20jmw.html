<p>JMW stands for Japan Music Week, a project that plans to grow to be like South by Southwest in
Austin.  This is JMW's inaugural year, and I'm excited to be part of its inception.</p>

<p>Well, that depends on how one defines inception, but I'm definitely in on the early stages of
this.</p>

<p>If you're a music / event promoter who wants to put on an event in the Shibuya area during the
week of 9-15 November, email me and I'll give you info on the pre-launch party+information meeting
this Wednesday night!</p>

<p>At the meeting today, in and out at various times: me, Bob, Ani, Matt, Yuki, Jon, Ed, Rie, Alex,
Roman, DJ James, and DJ Daisha (sp).</p>

<p>Daisha bought a poken; she immediately saw how cool they are!  I'm excited that she whipped out
her computer and wireless internet USB alongside her poken USB and registered right away (*)!</p>

<p>I'm in charge of designing wrist bands for the pre-launch party presentation on Wednesday.</p>

<p>(*) She registered after the main meeting was over, and we all went to a little coffee shop where
Jon bought our vittles.  I got an anko bagel.  Yummy.</p>

<p>Afterward, Bob treated me at a great gyoza place; we got three sets of gyoza and shared them,
plus shared our favorite iPhone games.  (Him: Labrynth, me: Dapple) I think we each think the game
we have is better.</p>

<p>He's lookin' to put up a website soon for his new business.  I can help with that!</p>
