<p>I have often said I like to be in one-to-one connections with people, like as opposed to
parties, with lots of people all around and it's kinda hard to get to the core core of the person,
I like to be in closer connection with people on a one to one basis, so I can, for example, more
carefully design lessons for them, or get to more interesting topics than the weather, or discuss
deep theoretical spirituality and religion, or get intimate with kisses, etc.</p>

<p>Today,</p>

<p>representing the other hand, Soness has been connecting people with people, not holding them
personally for her, but saying, &quot;oh you should meet this person,&quot; and &quot;oh you have
these talents; there's a guy looking for such skillz,&quot; etc etc.</p>

<p>I think</p>

<p>the style of living within an evolving living network has a lot of potential for everyone's self
growth.</p>
