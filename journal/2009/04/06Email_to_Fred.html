<b>Emailing from Sydney Airport</b>

g

Now I'm sitting in Narita airport.  10 hours zoomed by just like that.

I was writing to say something like the week was amazing; basically SWUUSI YRUU calibre
relationships, but with an additional focus on relationship with one's self.  I experienced scenes
from several past lives (some of which I had seen before, and filled in some gaps this week), and
got greater clarity on some of my issues this lifetime.

I found a possible influence for the times when I would hate having you copy me.. I had a sense of
being a leader in war, with thousands (and thousands) of men dying as a result of following my
command.  Not sure it exactly follows (no pun intended) that I'd hate to have you copy me, but that
seemed to be part of it.

I was struck with a sense of "I love Fred soooo much and want him to do his own thing, to blossom in
his own greatness."  I guess that may have been a lofty goal for an 8 year old me to have for a 4
year old you.

A different set of scenes centered around a life in what seems to be the US civil war.  I went off
to fight just to earn money for my beloved wife and family.  Got wounded and took a nap on the
battle field to wait for the battle to finish so I could crawl home, get PAID and be done with the
whole silly business.  Woke up with a bayonette in my chest as I died.  Huge anger came up for my
killer; sore throat ensued. I have carpet burns on my knee and elbows.  Seems like that
anger-during-death has stuck with me in this life.

There were others.  Not sure how interesting these stories are for you, but I'm open to discussion.
Can't really prove it's real (nor prove it's not), but the changes I feel inside me are definitely
real.

I don't have the words to really express what I feel, but I'm still working out how to live in my
new brain.
