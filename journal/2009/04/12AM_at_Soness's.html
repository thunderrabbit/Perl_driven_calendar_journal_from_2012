<p>I just meditated for 21 minutes, knowing that I wouldn't feel right if I went without it, but not
knowing why.  guilty?  uncentered?</p>

<p>Just in time, too; people are waking up.  Walter was the next to wake up; he jumped at the
chance to have his iPod charged while I'm using my computer.</p>

<p class="date">9:11am JST</p>

<p>Sean woke up Matt to say he's gonna head out, and Matt was like, &quot;yeah I'll come; can you
give me ten minutes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you give me an hour?  two hours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can give you a smack to da head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to wear blue underwear today.&quot;</p>

<p>Matt's singing various songs I can't identify, save for the opening of Jingle Bells.</p>

<p class="date">9:14am JST</p>

<p>Now everyone is awake 'cept Helle (nevamind; she's up), and Ben and Jen (save that Matt stepped
on Ben's big toe).</p>

<p class="date">12:33pm JST Sunday 12 April 2009 (day 14263)</p>

<p>Now everyone is awake, washed, fed (with help from Masta P(ancake)), and only 4 people left in
the house now: me, Anna, Helle, and Nibbles.</p>
