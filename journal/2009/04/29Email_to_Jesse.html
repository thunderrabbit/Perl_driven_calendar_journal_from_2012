&gt; Point being is that, universalism will say, as you have said, that God
&gt; includes both good and bad, and will in Heaven allow both good and bad
&gt; people. And so I said that morally, that is impossible.
&gt;
&gt; Am I correct on my view of your view?

You are essentially correct, except for wording.

I mean this: *all* souls are welcome into heaven.

There are no good people, nor bad people.

People are souls inside these temporary meatbag bodies, living under the impression that we are
indeed separate from God.  As a result of this illusion that we are separate from God, people
sometimes do things that think will help them find happiness and get closer to God.  People may
classify these actions as "bad," but everyone is doing the best they can under the conditions they
are living.
