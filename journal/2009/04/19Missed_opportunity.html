<p>Dang.  dang dang dang dang</p>

<p>I got off the train in Shibuya, and while walking up the platform, I noticed an elderly
gentleman snoozin' on the train.  He had some luggage...  Ah!  with PB tags on it!  The ship must
have just gotten back today!  I gently woke him up, &quot;yo yo yo this is the last stop, wake up,
jack!&quot; or something, and helped him get his luggage off the train.  I was like, &quot;PB?  me
too PB; it was so fun!!!  thank you thank you&quot; several times as I shook his hand, and he
thanked me and I know what it's like to rejoin Tokyo after 3.5 months of virtual paradise
travel...</p>

<p>But I &quot;had to get to lunch&quot; with Jesse at 12:30, so I left the guy to his stuff on the
platform.</p>

<p>Gah!!!  I shoulda carried it! I shoulda seen him off to his next connection!!  What was I
thinking????</p>

<p>Jesse et al ain't even here at Monsoon yet, so I coulda spent 10+ minutes with the guy and
perhapse made a new friend and really help him out, and <em>still</em> be on time!!!</p>

<p>I went down into the parking garage next to Monsoon to bark out F***! and a few choice barks to
release my anguish.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, Mr Old Man.  I shoulda carried your bag.</p>
