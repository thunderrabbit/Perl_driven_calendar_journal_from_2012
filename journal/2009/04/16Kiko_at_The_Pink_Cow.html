<p>There were other bands, but Kiko certainly took the cake for me.  She's got four (4) CDs, all of
which I wanted to buy.  She asked if I would take pictures of the show like I had done for the
previous band, Angels Are Architects.  Definitely no problem!  Especially if I can get a copy of
the photos!</p>
