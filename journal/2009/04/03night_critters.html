<p>When I got back to my bed area, I found a praying mantis chillin' on my bed.  I didn't really
know how to grab them or if they will bite fingers like biting mates' heads, so I just invited it
to be gone by the time I got back from my shower.</p>

<p>Jax, in a nearby shower, said &quot;just get a stick and put it in front of it and he'll climb
on and you can take him outside.&quot;</p>

<p>Got back to my bed and he was gone, so my first plan had worked already.</p>

<p>Currently pooin in the poo only compost toilet; on my way here, in addition to hearing several
wallabies just outside my flashlight (headlamp) range, I saw a little frog hoppin by, and a bit
later, I saw a little mammal gently carefully creep past me as I was standing on the trail wondering
if I had gone past the toilets (*).  I'll guess it was a lemur or
something similar.</p>

<p>(* they're on a side trail I had missed)</p>

<p>Dammit.  I just got back to my room and found the praying mantis basically squashed dead with
guts squirted partway out the body, but with legs still moving.  Though I realize I probably stepped
on it after my shower, I didn't kill it the rest of the way; I took it outside (on the back flap of
my notebook) and put it on a fern leaf, from which it immediately fell to the ground.  I'm so sorry,
little green guy.</p>
