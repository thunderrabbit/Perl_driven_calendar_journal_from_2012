<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that when I came to the ward office asking for 仕事が無い保険、 they
are not thinking I'm asking for unemployment insurance.  I've literally translated it as
no-job-insurance, but I think they're asking about self-employed insurance or something.</p>

<p>Just called Ami and she's talking with the woman for a long time as I'm writing the above, and
then I talked to Ami again, and she goes, &quot;do you want health insurance?&quot;</p>

<p>Um.  No.  I had hoped Ami would be able to sort out this answer given that I had just been
talking to her about my desire to get unemployment, but apparently she too thought I just wanted to
pop by the ward office to get health insurance, given that I can't really afford my rent for next
month.</p>

<p>Turns out, for the record, if one is seeking unemployment insurance in Japan, one should call
Hello Work at 044-777-8609.  That's the first step, apparently.</p>

<p>I'm still hungry.  Headed home to get some food, while Ami calls Hello Work.</p>

<p>Aight.  It turns out my company has to pay towards unemployment insurance in order for me to be
eligible for unemployment insurance, and it expires one year after termination of employment.</p>

<p>whew.</p>

<p>Fortunately, my resume says I worked at Aclass until June 2008, which I'm sure is within a month
of accurate, so I should be good.</p>

<p>Now just gotta reach those guys.  If they didn't pay unemployment, I think some lawyers would be
appropriate.</p>
