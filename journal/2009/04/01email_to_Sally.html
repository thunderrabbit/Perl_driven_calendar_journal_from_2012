Okay!

So it's now 10:32pm on Wednesday 1 April 2009!

The retreat has been at least as good as my expectations, plus an incredible space completely
surrounded by acres and acres and square kilometers and square miles of trees and sandstone
formations and wombats snuffling and wallabies jumping wallover the place!  (that's supposed to be a
pun on your new name!)

The food has been vegetarian and partially vegan and utterly fantastic buffet style each day, with
leafy greens, hearty yellows, bright reds, and blue blueberries plus banana smoothie and plus
couscous and pasta extravaganza and other goodies too good to name... omg mucho delicioso!

I'm seriously considering staffing/living/training/building here full time, starting perhaps in
October. ... this year!  in one minute!

Relationships with new friends are full and genuine, with heart to heart connections and eye to eye
smiles.  So delicious for me compared to the superficial conversation in most cases in Tokyo.

I may send more later, but I'll just send this now as a snippet.

   Love Love
    - Rob!
