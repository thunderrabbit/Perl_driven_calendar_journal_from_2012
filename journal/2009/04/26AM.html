<p>Awake, about to head with Bob outta Bob's place to Mark's
place, <a href="http://elfcoop.notlong.com/">ELF Co-op in Tachikawa</a>, by way of some food, I
hope.  Then we'll be going to Tachikawa's big park for a festival type thing at which we'll be able
to sell our various goods, including Mark's fossils, poken and my art.</p>
