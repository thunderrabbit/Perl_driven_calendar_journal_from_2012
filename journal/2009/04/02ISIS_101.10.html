<p>Ange and Tina are the MC and opposite pillar for this course.  In the past couple days they've
been doing the connection for individuals' ISIS process.  This time, Tina did mine.  (I wanted
Ange, but) this turned out to be a most significant process for me:</p>

<pre>
Basically, involuting and going back to back in the day, back in my room, and I fell asleep while
dreaming of my room, and Tina was like, &quot;if you see a vortex, go to it,&quot; so I saw a vortex
and tried to jump in, but didn't get anywhere interesting, so I was all, &quot;ROB! requesting Space
Matrix access through the vortex,&quot; and showed my recognition symbol [ROB!] glowing in yellow,
and then the portal opened, and in I went, into a huge (million light years across) bubble in space
where I could play, fly, create galaxies like a magician with playing cards, or whateva I like).
Then she asked me if it was anything like back inside the womb.  I found myself there, but this time
it didn't feel all warm and loving, or even like &quot;my space&quot; and Tina was like, &quot;who
else is there?&quot; and &quot;what else do you feel there?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;anger,&quot;
and had a sense that my mom was angry about having me, an unplanned pregnancy, which I imagine would
throw a real monkey (wrench) into one's life plans.

Feeling the situation from mommy's point of view, and seeing how it affected me...  mmmm nice
awareness.

Then when we debriefed, Tina was like, &quot;and when you went into that vortex, I was like,
&quot;wow!&quot; and really blown away...&quot;

&quot;That was real?&quot;
