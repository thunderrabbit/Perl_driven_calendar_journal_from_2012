<p>Actually I'm writing about yesterday today.</p>

<p>I went to visit Traci at The Pink Cow at 5pm, ate a delicious chicken burrito while helping her
with website stuff a bit..  Not sure that I helped *all* that much, but, I also bought a poken from her.</p>

<p>It's a cute little plastic panda with a USB port on one side, and a IR chip on the other.  Get a
couple pokens to give a high four, and you've just taken part in the latest way to exchange
business cards.  Web 2.0 meets cute and namecards all at once.  And it's just hit Japan!</p>

<p>I'm sure this will be all the rage soon, so I got one.  I chose the panda, though a few other
designs were available, with more to come, I'm sure.</p>
