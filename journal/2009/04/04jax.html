<p>We get an extra hour tonight, so it's like 11pm!</p>

<p>Jax says, &quot;when you're in your anger, you like to go back to crying, and I'm like, 'nooo,
feel it from your belly, from your belly!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't the belly feel sadness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but you were using crying as an outlet, as an escape from feeling the anger.&quot;</p>

<p>Great chat with Jax again tonight.</p>

<p>When I told Jax the story about telling Tina I had a crush on her, Jax was all, &quot;I don't
think I could ever tell anyone that.  If I have a crush on someone, I may put the moves on 'em, but
not say it outright.&quot;</p>

<p>I had come down from talking to Tina but Jax didn't answer when I poked my head into her room.  I
figured she had gone to bed.  So, I was really happy to find her still awake when I was about to go
to my room! (she had gone to take a shower)</p>

<p>I'm going to miss Miss Jacquelen.</p>
