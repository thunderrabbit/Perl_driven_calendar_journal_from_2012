<p>Scary to watch, but rings a bit true.  Obama was all, &quot;I'ma pull our troops outta Iraq&quot;
during the campaign, but now he's like, &quot;not!&quot;</p>

<p>And he was all, &quot;I'ma stop torture!&quot; but they're just moving Gitmo's operations to
different countries where they can get no flack.</p>

kinda freakin on your out on the edge political views.  twin towers an inside job?  obama lying and
moving torture of prisoners undercover to other countries?
  for the first time in a llllllong time we have a man of integrity running the gov and yet you seem
ready to believe what seems like shaky conspiracy theories labeling obama as just another corrupt
and evil man.
 i couldn't disagree with you more my friend.

Hey Bibby Baby!

I would much rather have this conversation face to face, sitting in a park with vegan sandwiches and
cookies we made together.

Short version:
hahaha Oh, I was just kidding about all that!!  hahaha

Longer, a bit more accurate version:
While I don't like the idea of a secret group of people who make decisions for the world based on
how they (the secret group) can gain more wealth and power, I have sorta come to believe this is, in
fact, the case, though I have no real proof except for what comes up during searches of bilderberg
(<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bilderberg">http://www.google.com/search?q=bilderberg</a>)

Even less so do I have any proof that Obama is anything than an upstanding citizen standing up in
the Oval Office for our best interests.  I hope to Goddess he brings positive change to the US and
the world.

However, I believe, sadly, beyond shadow of doubt: the World Trade Center was brought down by,
essentially, our own government.

I started my research by looking up WTC 7

I recommend watching Loose Change, available free online if you have a good internet connection:

Or I can ask the people with We Are Change - Austin to send you a DVD

Or I can send you a DVD if you don't want any crazies in Austin to have your addressssss.  :-)

   Love Always
