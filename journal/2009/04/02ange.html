<p>I didn't write this at the time class finished, but Ange talked to each of us about our plans for
future work, once we get back home.  I told her about Kumi in Tokyo, who has also done ISIS 101, and
asked about the possibility of starting a meditation class in Tokyo.</p>

<p>&quot;Any other questions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's it about Tokyo, but I wonder about living <em>here</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah good, I was hoping you'd ask about that..&quot; and turns out it may be an option to go
to New York as well, but not sure about my ability to pay the finances required (basically $10 per
day for food) for months at a time.  I mean, that's only $300 per month, but it's a volunteer
position on the work aspect of it.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>So, dear angels, I'm officially asking for help on making enough money to live in Tokyo until
September 2009, and then have enough money to pay for plane tickets and 18 months living here in
Hidden Valley.</p>
