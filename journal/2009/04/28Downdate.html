<p>Considering writing a Rob Update, but calling in a Downdate, cause that's how I feel at times.
Worried about paying my rent on 14 May, and trying to get work seems fruitless.  IT jobs seems to
want bilingual or Japanese natives, English teachin' jobs wants English-teachin' visa (there's
different visas for each genre of job Engineering for IT, etc, and Specialist in Humanities for
teaching English, etc) and the visa guys want proof of employment before giving me a new visa.</p>

<p>sigh.  And I'm hungry.</p>
