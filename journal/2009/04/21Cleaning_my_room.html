<p>Decided to clean my room today, mostly because Ani and I are going to trade massage for
kinessence, though I don't exactly know what that entails.</p>

<p>Didn't finish cleaning, but made significant progress toward that end.  I'll just tell her,
&quot;focus your attention <em>this</em> way,&quot; hahaha.</p>
