<p>Mark says ELF stands for Earth, Life, Form.  The cooperative allows people to use the space for
their creative endeavors, including, for example, art shows, etc.</p>

<p>And that's as far as I wrote before getting distracted with having to get ready for bed at my
new bedtime of midnight.  (so I can wake up and meditate around 7am)</p>

<p>Anyway, ELF COOPERATIVE (not sure what capitalization I prefer) is Mark's new enterprise out near
Tachikawa Station.  It's there that I'll likely have an art show on 14 and 15 March (though it's not
confirmed yet) as part of a FOREX presentation on Saturday, *and* a Brazilian dinner on Sunday.
Mark figures 15 people will fit in the space.  I'd figure fewer, but it'll definitely be fun!</p>
