Dear Representative John Culberson,                                      16 February 2008

Thank you for voting against the largest spending bill in the history of the United States
Congress. I appreciate your foresight on this issue, though it should have been obvious to anyone on
the Hill. Because of your courage in this, I wonder if you'll step out with me on an even more
important issue.

As you may know, the technology exists *today*, though has been kept secret by hidden government, to
let us have completely clean energy, without *any* dependence on fossil fuels.

At <a href="http://www.TheOrionProject.org/">www.TheOrionProject.org</a> (TOP) you can see that as early as 1902, energy systems were demonstrated
to Congress that used the energy from the Quantum Vacuum of the space for power. Since then, these
advanced concepts in energy generation have been ignored or actively suppressed by fossil-fuel based
economic and industrial interests. Under US leadership, it is time to move forward and develop these
systems for use worldwide.

The Orion Project has identified talented scientists who need to be able to work under one umbrella
to develop these devices that could: 1) Retrofit vehicles to reduce pollution and save fossil
fuels. 2) Generate electricity from water. 3) Pull energy from the quantum vacuum.

As part of its research, TOP has identified a brilliant physicist/engineer who agreed to work with
us and build an energy generator in 2-3 months. He was given permission by his immediate handlers in
his classified project but then was suddenly ordered to Iraq. Only an executive order from the
President will free him to build his prototype and use his skills for these solutions.

I urge you to go to <a href="http://www.TheOrionProject.org/Energy.pdf">http://www.TheOrionProject.org/Energy.pdf</a> where there is a comprehensive Energy
Briefing - a detailed review of energy systems that can be developed. The proof of Zero-Point energy
and other new energy technologies has been verified by reputable scientists. The environmental,
energy and funding policy discussions must refocus on these truly new solutions.

These solutions would provide clean, reliable energy throughout the world. They would be free
standing and eliminate the need for the aging power grid. For both environmental and national
security reasons the United States needs to take the lead in this energy future. TOP has identified
the solutions. Please seriously investigate The Orion Project and support its work.

Thank you for your time; I assure you this is the most important issue we can tackle. I'd appreciate
your reply via email.

<p>And I sent slightly varied first paragraph versions to my two Senators, Barack, and this one to Japan's Prime Minister:</p>

Dear Leader of Japan,
すみませんなんでけど、私の日本語はあまりペラペラじゃなくて、http://www.TheOrionProject.org の英語を日本語にかいつまんでます。

アメリカでは１９０２年に、本当にきれい電気をみせましたんだけど、お金もち人はその電気を偽装工作しています。

あなたの英語ペラペラ友達にhttp://www.TheOrionProject.org を見せてください。

よろしくお願いします。
