<p class="dream">I realized they weren't just playing, but fighting, and then I realized the
principal was Samuel L Jackson, so I was happy to go in and help him.  He guided one of the guys
walking backwards into me where I got him in a full nelson, except I couldn't remember what to do
with my hands once I had 'em under his arms.  Samuel L Jackson was like, &quot;no no, lock his arms
in front of him like this,&quot; and had me cross my arms in front of the guy in a hug while
locking his arms at the same time so he couldn't move.  The guy could still move, so I flopped us
both face down on the ground so he couldn't move.  He was still moving a bit, so I put all my
weight on just my hands and feet, and held his hands and feet out like a water strider so he would
have no leverage.  This seemed to work okay, but then I</p>

<p>physically wiggled and woke up.</p>
