<p>Went back to Softbank because I hadn't yet received notification of how to download my contacts
from their servers.  Took a while to prove my identity; I apparently didn't remember my 4 digit
password.  Why only 4 digits?  They should be way longer.</p>

<p>Got the email with password, but Tam had said it would also include a URL so I know from where
to download the contacts, but that wasn't included in the email this time.  Gah.  Ami helped me get
logged in and registered to My Softbank, but we still haven't gotten the contacts downloaded.</p>
