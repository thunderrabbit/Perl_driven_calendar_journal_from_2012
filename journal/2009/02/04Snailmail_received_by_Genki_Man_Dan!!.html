Rob!!!!

I saw your comment about mail... I was very confused. Went to the mailroom and it was sitting
there. I was like &quot;Dude that's mine&quot;, the cat was like &quot;Yeah, take it&quot;. Very strange.

Not sure how long it had been sitting there, anyway THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's caused quite
a stir in my office and people can't believe how amazingly pretty train cards are in Japan.

Thanks also for the book- will read it on my long train journey home.

We now require your snail mail to show you exactly how boring British train cards are, but will be a
great asset to your collection.

I'll be in touch shortly with the cards I liked, the ones I already have and the ones that blew me away.

Yahoooo!!

Yo mate I'm so glad I could send the cards to the only person in the whole world who appreciates
them as much as you!!!!

I tried to do a careful job of sorting out the duplicates within the stacks I sent you, and even
putting them in some sort of order. I look forward to hearing which ones brought tears of joy to
your eyes.

I laughed when recalling sitting on some steps with you in Jiyugaoka to give you the ultimate train
card EVER. If I could think of a way to top *that* card, I would.

&gt; I saw your comment about mail... I was very confused. Went to the mailroom and it was sitting there.

Did you go to the mailroom as a result of my confusing message?

I realize I made an error during the exchange. It should have gone like this:

DAN&gt; SNOW!
ROB&gt; Mail?
DAN&gt; Snowmail?
ROB&gt; Snailmail?

etc. So sorry!!

&gt; I was like &quot;Dude that's mine&quot;, the cat was like &quot;Yeah, take it&quot;. Very strange.
Didn't that cat know that mail is supposed to be _delivered_ ????

&gt; people can't believe how amazingly pretty train cards are in Japan.
kaWAAIiiiii

&gt; Thanks also for the book- will read it on my long train journey home.
HahaAHaa.. You are the only person I know who could begin to appreciate that book. I got it and
immediately thought you would get a kick out of going through it and saying, "oh hey get this: did
you know that Marion Studebaker was the 25th ranked kicker for the prime number years between 1958
and 1963? Wow!" And then people would go, "Who's Marion Studebaker?" and you go, "I have no idea!!"

My "collection" is limited to the single bus card that's still in my pocket after the PASMO system
made it possible to use a rechargeable card on all trains, buses, and many convenience stores.

But I'd love to get mail from you.
Feel free to use English or Japanese:
