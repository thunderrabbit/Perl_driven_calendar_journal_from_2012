<p class="dream">Met a woman named Colleen, I thought at first, but she had a different
pronunciation, so I was like, &quot;how do you spell it?&quot;  She goes, &quot;C - O - L - um, L -
I - O - U - N,&quot; taking a while to think before spelling the Lion part, which I think she
misspelled.  I said, &quot;cool.  I have had a friend name Colin, and have a friend now named
Colleen, but theis my first time to hear the name Co-lion.&quot;</p>

<p>I woke up from that dream and was too lazy to get up and write it down.  I thought, &quot;welp,
there goes that dream; I'm not going to remember it.&quot;  But then I was like &quot;wait.&quot;
and I used the reiki symbol for time and distance and requested that it's already been written.
And now it has.  Assuming I'm not dreaming now.  Nope!  (*)</p>

<p>(*) though I know this waking 'reality' is a type of dream.</p>

<p class="dream">In the middle of STAR WARS, we were trying to beat the bad guys and had stolen one
of their ships, shaped like an おにぎり (triangle-shaped rice ball with fish inside, wrapped in のり
(seaweed paper)) and equally hard to fly.  In one scene, Han was inside the stolen ship, hurtling
tumblingly trying to make it fly right.  Then he and I went inside the good ship and I carried the お
にぎり to some older pilots, all proud that we had caught an enemy ship.  &quot;does anyone know how
to fly this ship?&quot; And one guy was like, &quot;No, but I know who does,&quot; and at the same
moment (otherwise unrelated) I inadvertantly moved backwards over the corner of a counter and
something touched my balls.  My eyes widened for a moment and I immediately leaned forward again.
He goes, &quot;what's it like?&quot; and I showed him the triangular ship shape.  &quot;It can go
anyway you like, and doesn't care about things such as human spines.  I think it can only be flown
properly by a robot.&quot; I looked at his TV as the game Wheel of Fortune was being played outside
around a swimming pool. The weather was stormy and there were big waves in the pool and dark sky
overhead.  I was on a bus and changing clothes with two guys and about 50 girls and we were trying
to figure the best way to do this without showing anyone any inappropriate parts.  I pulled off my
underwear, but left my skirt on and pulled on my swim trunks under the skirt, noticing a little
stain at the butt, and then wondered at the stockings attached to the bottom of the swim trunks.  I
didn't remember having seen them before, though I guessed they might protect against sand and fish
bites.</p>
