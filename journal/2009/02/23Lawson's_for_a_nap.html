<p>Called Kevin to see if I could hang out at his house until i-group; he said he was too busy with
moving in two weeks, but he would see me tonight.</p>

<p>Called David to see if I could meet him somewhere before i-group; he said he would call me when unbusy.</p>

<p>I remembered that I haven't been to &quot;my&quot; Lawson's in a while, so I headed back there
to get a snack and ended up sleeping in the lounge in the back of the store.</p>
