&gt; On 17th, I have not yet book my hotel, but very likely should be in Shinagawa prince.

Shinagawa Prince is plenty close, but I need to postpone the 17th...
My housemate's going-away party is that night, and I'm forced to
choose between old friends and new!   I hope you don't mind.  ;-)

What about the other end of your trip?  I think you said the morning
of the 21st.  We can have brunch!

&gt; Am I right that you are originally from Australia?

Nope!  Sometimes I'd prefer to be from Australia, but I'm pretty much
from Texas.  Can't say I'm like an average Texan, though!

Sooon!

Hi Rob,

gee....sounds like ts still so cold in Tokyo. Over in HK, its really nice at 18~24degC. The best
weather of the year :))
So in Tokyo everyone is still wearing the winter coat? I need to plan what to wear there next week.
I understand that you have to attend party of old friend, its no problem, lets make it 21st
brunch. Btw, I am booked for Shinagawa Prince and will be checking out from hotel on Sat morning. If
I do not extend my stay, then my flight is 4pm on Sat. So lets decide a good accessible place.
Ah....so you are a Texan, can you ride a horse :D

See ya,
Laura

<p>And then I was all,</p>

It's 5 degrees now, and is supposed to get up to a high of 18 (low of
9) on Saturday, but then a high of only 9 degrees (low of 4) on
Monday!  Sounds like it won't be too warm next week!

&gt; lets make it  21st brunch. Btw, I am booked for Shinagawa Prince and will be
&gt; checking out from hotel on Sat morning. If I do not extend my stay, then my
&gt; flight is 4pm on Sat. So lets decide a good accessible place.

Hmmm that's a bit tight, but there is a fast train from Shinagawa to
the airport for 1330 yen (or more if you get a reserved seat)

What time can you get up?  To give enough time, we should probably
meet around 10am.  That's a bit early for me, but I'll do my best!
;-)

&gt; Ah....so you are a Texan, can you ride a horse :D
Well, I have ridden horses, but I can't take care of them nor put saddles on.
