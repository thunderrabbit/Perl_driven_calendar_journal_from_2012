I have some very sad news to share.  On Thursday, February 19th in Santa Barbara California, Brandt
was tragically killed in a car accident.  His body will be returned to the Dallas area for a
memorial service and burial.  My daughter, Laura and I, created a Facebook group "Remembering Brandt" 
to post memories, stories, and thoughts about him.  We will also be updating this site with
information about the memorial service.  If you can't access the Facebook site, feel free to email
me for details about the service.  Below is also a link to an article about the crash.

<p>my reply, which I hope is well received:</p>

Hello

Thank you for your message.  My heart goes out to you and your family in this difficult time.  I am
saddened that the world will be without Brandt's continually inspired ideas.  I knew Brandt through
Peace Boat's 49th voyage, and then subsequently e-connected with him during his different internet
business developments.

I have had some training in after-death soul retrieval (helping souls cross over from the physical
world into the next).  My perception was that after some initial anger at being taken too soon,
Brandt has crossed over successfully.

A message I got was "tell Greg I love him," though I don't know for sure to whom the message refers.

I know you don't know me, and didn't ask for this type of input, but I hope this email helps your grief.

    Blessings
    - Rob
