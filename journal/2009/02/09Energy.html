<p>Even more interesting than knowing who destroyed the World Trade Center, and why: unlimited
energy sources available from technology back-engineered from non-local (*) civilisations.</p>

<p>(*) by non-local, I mean in the space-time sense.  They might be from this area, but from a
future time.  But anyway, yeah,</p>

<p>free energy exists.  Physics has predicted and shown that matter blinks into and out of reality
everywhere, all the time.  So-called zero-point energy could be tapped to provide truly infinite,
truly clean energy.</p>

<p>Big energy &quot;producing&quot; companies do not want us to know this; they have made a nice
profit by extracting oil so their desire is understandable.</p>

<p>Though I can't point to proof that big oil companies are actively killing free energy proponents
and their work, I have seen evidence of GM dismantling electric trolley systems in various cities;
I remember Los Angeles was one.</p>

<p>Don't take my word for it; look into this a bit.  Start with World Trade Center 7, er,
wait.. Start with watching the press conference hosted
by <a href="http://www.disclosureproject.org/">Steven Greer</a>. There's a series of vids on youtube
that show his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldS1M3-qLlw">2001 press conference on
disclosure</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.ahealedplanet.net/">A healed planet</a> expreses this a whole lot better than I
can yet.</a>
