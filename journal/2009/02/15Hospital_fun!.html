<p class="note">(written 8:19am JST Wednesday 18 February 2009 (day 14210))</p>

<p>Arrived at Ami's house, helped her and her brother Yuuta to unload the gear while their papa
dropped off the last family and returned the van.</p>

<p>Ami called to find the nearest hospital that was still open (nice to know now that there's one
quite close to Musashi-kosugi station (go out the north exit (with the bus stop), cross the street
at the intersection slightly to the left of the bus area and keep going.  Hospital will be on the
left after about 400 meters); I was able to ride TJ Bike here this morning with no worries (but this
entry is about Sunday night)) and we took a taxi there from her house.  Generally speaking, only the
biggest hospitals in Tokyo (and therefore certainly all of Japan) stay open to receive new patients
after business hours (maybe long business hours).</p>

<p>I must admit, I was in a bit of a touchy mood, knowing there was nothing wrong with my head, but
being &quot;obligated&quot; to go because Ami's dad expected it, and she sure as sugarcookies isn't
going to lie to him, so anyway, I went, and after Ami filled in the paperwork for me, and I gave 'em
my ID card, they were like, &quot;ah, Mr Robert Nugen, please come here for a moment.  Now it says
here that your name is Rob Nugen, but it says, *here* that your name is Robert Dale Nugen
Jr...&quot;</p>

<p>And after all the years of dealing with moronic Japanese bureacracy, plus timid Japanese social
customs, I was thinking, <em>grrrrr</em>, and said, &quot;do you have a pen?&quot; as Ami explained
something tha I guess amounted to &quot;Uh, yeah, Rob is short for Robert,&quot; and in the end she
wrote &quot;ERT&quot; after &quot;ROB&quot; and they were happy.  Didn't even write Dale nor Jr,
which kinda pisses me off.  Why is the ERT more important than the DALE and JR?  They're twice as
many missing characters if you wanna get technical about it, you crazy rule-followin'
cantthinkforyourself bureacracy lovers!</p>

<p>After calming down through meditation, I had an interesting experience / imagination.  In a
similar way as we learned in Kevin's soul-retrieval class, I mentally engaged all the dead spirits
who may still be waiting in the hospital, &quot;Hey everyone!  Great news!  We get to go
home!!&quot; and I mentally ran up and down the halls chip chip cheering to help everyone wake up.
&quot;All we have to do is spin!  spin!&quot; and started spinning like a whirling dervish as an
example, and did a quick blessing to make sure all the spirits' guides were on the ready to receive
the spirits who may have had their attention refocused by my antics.</p>

<p>I imagined I came across one guy who had a bit of a negative attitude, and I stopped for a bit
and took his hand and said, &quot;I know; you're absolutely right,&quot; and then &quot;ah, here
they come now,&quot; and handed him off to his spirit guides.</p>

<p>I did it quickly because my still-physically corperated nurse invited me into the CT room where I
got my head scanned, and requested an extra copy of the CD of data.  &quot;Oh, no CD; just two X-ray
posters,&quot; &quot;aight; copy 'em up!&quot; and I got a copy of those, ostensibly for Fred, but
not sure if I'll send them to him.  Ah.. I guess I can send them with Colleen's painting and have
her hand 'em off to him.</p>
