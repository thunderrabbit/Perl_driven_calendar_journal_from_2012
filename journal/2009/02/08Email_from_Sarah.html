Hi Rob,

Oz is just too big for me to pop across to Sydney. But I think Chris is around that neck of the
world at the moment, in Canberra (our illustrious and dull capital). Maybe you could jump on a bus
for a few hours to go see the seat of parliament zzzzz and see Chris....

?

Have fun and joy.

But the good thing about OZ is you can travel by clicking your heels!
Just have to find ruby slippers though...

Thanks for the Chris-tip!  The vague plan now is to train to Adelaide,
and therefore through Canberra, I imagine!  I'll be meeting up with
one of my crushes (there are many, dontcha know hahahaha!)..  anyway,
she met an Aussie bloke and they'll be gettin' hitched real soon now,
and a-movin' to Awstrallya!

ahem.

How's Sarah?  I have all your emails about Palestine waiting in my
inbox for posting to my blog.  Gotten kinda stale, but unfortunately
the info is just as timely, if now a bit understated!  ARGH!

I'll let you know how the meditation goes; that's part of my way of
bringing world peace to the world.  They say the Australian outback
has fantastic energy for these types of things.  We'll be 4 hours west
of Sydney, apparently, though I've forgotten the name of the area in
which we'll be doing the work.

  XOXOXO
     - Rob!!

<p>Just want to say that I think of Sally as more than &quot;one of my crushes,&quot; but didn't
need to explain all that to Sarah.  As they say on FB, &quot;It's complicated.&quot;</p>
