<p>With Ami in Takadanobaba at a coffee shop just outside the exit, chillin' for 20 minutes while
Maruan and Kyoko arrive and we all head out to their ByebyeJapanHelloPizza party.  They each got a
scholarship for three months in Italy (let's say Milan) in an international peace oriented course
(let's say Piece of Pizza Planet of Peace Program) after which they plan to travel around
Europe.</p>

<p>Just took a picture of チンドン屋さん in Takadanobaba.</p>

<p>I wonder if FB will care if I hotlink photos from them.........  Dang it bugs me to have my pics
all splayed across the web, but it sure is easy to upload them there.  I might have to break down
and use a DB to store pics on my domain.</p>
