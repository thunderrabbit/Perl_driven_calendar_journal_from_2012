HI Brynsies!

I got a bit sidetracked before writing, but during our chat, I was just going to relay a story from
my oldest school SWUUSI days...

I was perhaps 10 years old, in a canoe with my dad, and we somehow met up with our church friend who
had a small motor on the back of his boat.  We connected our boats so our friend pulled dad's and my
canoe... slowly, but way faster than we could have paddled!

Totally new fun experience for me, so I was beaming smiling thrilled, of course!

After the ride, my dad said that his friend had said I was "grinning from ear to ear."

And for some reason, that really embarrassed me; I've never been able to explain why.  Something
about being seen or recklessly enjoying life.. I dunno.  But that has affected my ability to smile
in a way.

Insha'allah, at the meditation course, I'll resolve the underlying issue there and beam lighthouse
bright Bryn quality smiles around the universe!  :-)

Thanks for being my Bryn!  You're the best ever.

  Love Love
   - Rob!
