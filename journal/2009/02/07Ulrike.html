<p>Chillin' downstairs in the kitchen after eating some granola featuring the lactose free milk that
Manuel bought for me after he learned that lactose makes my guts all ooky.  Ulrike is flitting
around the kitchen, making some snacky food for herself: boiled some frozen ¤¨¤À¤Þ¤á and prepared
two drinks: coke on the rocks and Çß¼ò on the rocks.  Çß¼ò is quite sweet, and was one of the only
alcoholic beverages I enjoyed in Japan (okay, I also liked pinesour, but I really liked umeshu).
Anyway, she's already gone; she and Manuel are watching Men In Tights in his room with German
audio.</p>
