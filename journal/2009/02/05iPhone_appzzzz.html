<p>It's well past yesterday, and I can't say I've been awake continuously, but I have been trying
to get some sort of iPhone app sorted out.  I am beginning to grasp the architecture of the object
hierarchy, but still can just barely make any changes, and can't really make any changes that I
*want* to make.  But I was able to add an extra menu item to a menu and have it point to a new
instance of its clone's pointee, and even change the name of the menu item which was being set
through a language file that took me a bit to find (it's under Resources).</p>

<p>BUT still can't make my own view yet, nor actually run anything on Little Blue Monkey (that's
the name of my iPhone, but it may be too long to use very often).</p>

<p>Going to bed for now.</p>
