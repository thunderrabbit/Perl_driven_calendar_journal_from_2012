<p>Visited LeafCup Cafe to check out the possibly of working there.  The place seems pretty close to
what I'd like, but I get the sense that it wouldn't be quite optimal.  Can make between 1000 and
1800 yen per hour, for like 3 or 5 hours a day, but in group lessons, which are not my favorite.
Hmmmm.</p>
