<p>It snowed and rained at the same time!!  I explained dramatically to Beans via chat that this
weather kept me from sending her painting!</p>

<p>Instead, I've been doing some iPhone tooting, that's programming by the book, as in learning,
and not actually programming.  But learning.  I can remember entering data from COMPUTE! magazine,
having little idea what I was typing.  Back before the days of the internets.</p>

<p>Now I'm typin' code in again just so I can learn it more effectively.</p>

<p>Headin' out with Ami and Manuel to meet Ulrike and Florian at Hachiko.</p>
