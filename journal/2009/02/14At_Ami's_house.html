<p>At Ami's house right now; still awake after the TLUG meeting, and about to move our stuff to the
car to go skiing!  Woooo!  It will be my first time to go skiing in many years, and my first time in
Japan.  Probably my first time in 12+ years.  (I was going to type 10, but 12 is probably that much
closer to reality).</p>
