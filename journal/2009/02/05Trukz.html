<p>Thanks to Sach for helping me figure out how to get a javascript regex thing working for Trukz.
Now my greasemonkey script is working:
install <a href="http://robnugen.com/downloads/trukz.com/plus_5.user.js">Plus 5</a> if you play
<a href="http://www.trukz.com/">Trukz</a> and want to automagially set your speed to be safely five
miles above the speed limit, up to your truck's actual speed.</p>

<p>Also, join Eagle Logistics and tell 'em Thunder Rabbit sent you.</p>

<p>But really, don't play the game at all; it's a waste of time.</p>
