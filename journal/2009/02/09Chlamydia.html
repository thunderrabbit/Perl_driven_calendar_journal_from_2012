<p>Ami called to say the results of her checkup include chlamydia.  I know I haven't shagged anyone
else in quite a while (only a single kiss (a peck, really) with a single girl (not counting the
platonic ones) since I've been dating Ami), and Ami says she hasn't.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>According to the interwebs, it's easily treated with antibiotics.  According to Ami, they cost
15,000 yen for a two week treatment, and then a week wait and a urine sample to ensure cleanliness.</p>

<p>I guess I shoulda given a urine sample before paying 15,000 but, as Fred would say, whatevs.</p>
