<p>Came back home.  Ami had gone home and come back to continue our Talk.  I sat down, &quot;Well,
right <em>now</em> I don't want to break up with you..&quot; and went on a long tirade of my
spiritual growth trajectory, including how I think TV is horrid, and how this physical stuff isn't
real.</p>

<p>&quot;These are just monkey suits, and our spirits live inside.&quot;</p>

<p>Somehow, in the end, I closed with the theory that we all recreate our painful situations so we
can hopefully solve them this time around.  Ami wants to hear, &quot;I love you, therefore please
stay with me forever.&quot; I want to hear, &quot;I love you, so you are free to do anything you
want.&quot;</p>

<p>At the very end, we both got what we wanted.  I told her I want her to stay forever, and she told
me I could have sex with anyone I wanted.  Awesome.  There's a 95% chance I won't do it, but there
was a 90% chance I wouldn't do it before she said that.  I mostly just want the permission.</p>

<p>When she left, I was so happy that I did a surprise that I've been planning for a while.  I
climbed out of my balcony and came around the front of the house to give her a final hug and kiss.</p>
