<p>I blame my iPhone for my lateness today.  I was distracted, misdirected and confused... poor me!</p>

<p>Basically, though I got some of my music (NIN Ghosts, and 5 songs I had listed as favorites (*))
downloaded (not just copied from PC to iPhone, but downloaded from my Amazon S3 storage space, I
got conflubulated when trying to use the iPhone for getting directions.  Couldn't sort out how to
make it show me different options for traveling, and once it had decided its start point, I
couldn't reset it to 'current location' as I had been able to the first time I searched.</p>

<p>Though I won't make it to the iWeb seminar on time, I will make it to Apple Store Ginza to meet
with Tariq at 1pm.</p>

<p>(*) songs I had listed as favorites as of 3 Feb 2009:</p>
