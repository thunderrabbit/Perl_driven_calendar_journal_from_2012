<p>Chillin' at Softbank after grillin' the Softbank rep on a million (*) questions and writing
down lotsa numbers.  When I started with her, there were 13 people in line to be helped upstairs.
Now there are 4.  Well, I'm number 5.  Hey I was number 5 at my initial men's group weekend.</p>

<p>I started this Shibuya adventure by registering by phone to register with a modeling agency
tomorrow at 12:45 near É½»²Æ».  Then I was like, &quot;yikes stripes I've got nothing to
wear!&quot; and came to ½ÂÃ« to buy some dress shirts.  Success.</p>

<p>Went to the Apple Store to go right to the source of iPhone purchasing goodness, and it turns
out they are *not* the source.  At least not on the sales end.  They were like, &quot;sorry jack;
you gotta have 24 months left on your visa.&quot;  I have 23.  Ah come on..  Gah.</p>

<p>They were like, &quot;yeah, but we gotta send all the info to Softbank...&quot; Ah.  &quot;So
should I go to Softbank?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot; and they started to discuss where the nearest one
was.. &quot;thanks guys; I've got it.&quot;</p>

<p>These doods are being slow as Christmas; I think I know with which plan I'm gonna roll, so I'm
gonna roll out of here and come back when they're less busy.  (When is that???)</p>

<p>But then I won't have an iPhone right *now*.  ah well.</p>

<p>(*) not actually a million, but it nearly rhymes.</p>
