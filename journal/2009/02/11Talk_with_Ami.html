<p>That's Talk with a capital T.</p>

<p>Basically I got the massage gig at the last minute today and therefore needed to go to Shibuya,
and therefore ought not come all the way back home just to chill for two hours before going all the
way back.  It's basically 45 minutes each way, including walking.  Or maybe just under an hour.
Anyway, Ami came over even so, and she was like, ¿²¤Æ¿²¤Æ and I quickly fell asleep for an hour of
our two hours and then in the last 30 minutes we finally Talked and I was like, &quot;so yeah, I
want to break up with you.  Oh, and I gotta go.&quot;</p>

<p>And she was like, &quot;I jus' wanna be with you!!&quot; and I'm like, &quot;argh&quot; and
thankfully she respected my need to leave.</p>
