<p>At 4pm, went to my first &quot;modeling gig&quot; via Junes, where they wanted a buncha
foreigners to have their photos taken as practice data for facial recognition software.  Easy 4000
yen, plus gave my Freestyle Art Freestyle Healing cards to a woman named ¤­¤¯, who seemed quite
enthused to give them to her two bosses, who, like most salarymen, need a good relaxation now and
again.</p>

<p>A man named Mark said his name when asked, and I was like, &quot;Mark???&quot; in my mind because
he sounded like my friend Mark Leonard in Macau, and even looked like him too!  Well, from the side
he looked like Mark a bit, but taller, etc.</p>

<p class="date">7:02pm JST Thursday 19 February 2009 (day 14211)</p>

<p>Anyway, I determined this Mark was not my Mark, so I left without saying anything, but realized I
had forgotten my backpack, so went back and, ¤Þ, said HI to Mark.  He thought I said I knew him from
back in the day when I said he looked like my friend from back in the day, but since he didn't know
me, his brain was like, &quot;from where do you know me?&quot; and said &quot;hang on a sec&quot;
while he got his picture taken multiple times and got paid and we headed out.</p>

<p>Interesting connection, though: he lives in Tachikawa, which is on the same train line as me
(Nambu) (albeit at the other end), has interest in physics cause of his former engineering
degree/work, and *now* is working partially as a currency trader, and currency
trader <em>trainer</em>, which is something in which I have had some interest for some time.</p>

<p>I tagged along with him as he essentially interviewed with his friend who's starting up a new
currency trading business, and during the process was all but sold on becoming Mark's first client
with this company.  Hmmmm!</p>

<p>If I had a clearer idea about how much money I can afford to toss into the loo, I may very well
have signed up right on the spot.</p>

<p>But, had to meet Yurika for our lesson at 7pm, and therefore skipped going to the next place with
Mark, getting paid to chat with peeps in a cafe 1500 yen per hour..  Oh snap, now there's a good way
to make some money, chillin' out in a cafe, either surfing like I've been doing at home, or getting
paid a bit, or both!</p>

<p>Said bye to that, though, and hopped on the train, got to Shibuya and got a message from Yurika
which she had sent at 4:42pm.  She can't meet me today.  Gah.  Welp; I coulda checked my email
sooner and found out, but as it is, I'm heading home and will get connected with this other thing
laters.</p>
