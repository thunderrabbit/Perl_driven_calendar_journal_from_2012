<p>Got my tickets to Australia today.  Or, I paid for them and will receive e-tickets once they're
issued.  I'm glad the travel agent, for a charge of only 100 yen over what I had hoped to pay,
handled the visa into OZ.  It woulda been $20 to my credit card plus the hassle of entering my name
and passport info, <em>and</em> then getting charged sending money overseas to pay for it, or just
giving 2100 yen and the travel agent will sort it all out.</p>
