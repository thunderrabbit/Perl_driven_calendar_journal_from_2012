<p>_Bonk_ is the name of an album by Big Pig.  it's also what I felt on my head as I tipped over
and planted face first while skiing.  Super thanks to Mark for taking pictures!  Good thing he was
behind me instead of otherwise.</p>

<p>Ami and I had gone up the midsize slope twice I think, and then I went up the beginner slope
twice, and she and papa and his friends from work went up a much higher slope and I got a vid of Ami
coming down.  Shoulda kept the camera rolling, as the rest of the crew came down: papa did a nice
buttplant right at the very end.</p>

<p>I chose not to do anything big today; my legs were burning after my first run today, and I
didn't think they'd survive a much longer adventure in descent</p>

<p>Went down the beginner slope with Ami's dad a couple of times and then heard via phone from Ami
that Mark would be joining soon, so I waited at the top of the lift.  We headed down, and I beat
him handily; it was his first run of the day, so his legs were certaily feling about like mine had
been.  Down the same slope the next time, I led us down on the right near the bottom so we went
over the snowboarder's section with some humps and such.  I got a little bit of air on the second
jump, and landed safely.  Then on the next jump there was a guy standing, so I slowed way down and
didn't even try to catch air on the way over.</p>

<p>Mark said he also got some air, so the next time we went up the beginner hill, I went down well
ahead of him so I could get a video of him catching said air.  He didn't; he said later that he had
gone straight down without stopping and his legs were too weak at the moment to jump.</p>

<p>After that run we went to the slightly higher, slightly steeper course next to it, the same one
that Ami and I had done first today.  No worries the first time, and headed up again, saying this
would be our last run on this hill, and then we'd go do the gondola, and find out of that wolf was
still there, and therefore an animatronic puppet, or gone, and therefor real.</p>

<p>That's when Yoko called Mark while we headed up and asked that he join her in the cafe or
some such.  He told her our plans, and that he'd join her after our run down the gondola hill (long
beginner course).</p>

<p>We got to the top, and I was like, &quot;well, let's go straight down so we're not late,&quot;
and perhaps went a bit faster than before, but in any case, things worked out so that I face
planted and got bonked on the back of the head with my ski.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mark was there to take pictures.  And when he helped me get my ski back on, he was
like, &quot;dude, it's loose!&quot; and I was like, &quot;dude; it's been like that the whole
time!&quot; and then, &quot;aw mate, that's probably why it came flying off..&quot;</p>

<p>Made it down the hill (and the ski came off again; it musta gotten even looser from my crash)
and headed to see Ami and Yoko in the cafe.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't say anything about the blood; can you see it on my face?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you can still see it, but it's a bit dried up.&quot;</p>

<p>Headed in all, &quot;HI!&quot; and the girls were like &quot;HI!&quot; and then &quot;ah!  What
happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;nothing! what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's blood on your face!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahahah yeah, I crashed,&quot; and then showed them my head and discovered, &quot;oh hey
it's bleeding too!&quot; I thought it had just been blood from my face that ran down to make the
spot of blood in the snow.</p>

<p>Headed to the clinic after turning in the skis (and complaining that they had been loose upon
receipt, but no response from them) and then got my head bandaged, and then got free ice cream!
woooo! and then back to complain more and even the next guy was like, &quot;we don't have
insurance,&quot; so I took his picture surepticiously and after I asked for his name, and was poised
to label the picture, &quot;My name is ______.  We don't have insurance!&quot; he came back with his
card and invited us inside to make a report.

<p>I still uploaded the picture, but didn't put his name down.  Just got his card.  I'm pretty
happy to get *any* acknowledgement (after the first brush off, even Ami figured it would be
impossible, but thanks to Yoko supporting my cause, they both came in with me and anyway)..</p>

<p>The dude was like, &quot;yeah I can't make the decision,&quot; (no one in a Japanese bueracracy
can even pick their own nose without approval), which I expected, but at least we got him to take a
report, including my naivete (sorry no two dots over the i) about the ski being loose.</p>

<p>Seems reasonable that they'll help at least a bit with the cost of stitches.</p>

<p>Okay, my computer is at 6% battery.  See you!</p>
