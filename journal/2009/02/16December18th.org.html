<p>Dear Friend,</p>

<p>Shministim. Have you heard of them? I have - just now. And once I heard about them, I had to do
something.</p>

<p>The Shministim - all about ages 16, 17, 18 and in the 12th grade - are a new breed of
conscientious objectors in Israel and right now they are taking a stand. They believe in a better,
more peaceful future for themselves and for Israelis and Palestinians, and they are refusing to join
the Israeli army. They're in jail, holding strong against immense pressure from family, friends and
the Israeli government. They need our support and they need it today. </p>

<p>The Shministim have asked Jewish Voice for Peace to reach out to people like us to let the
Israeli government know we are watching, and that we support their courage. They're hoping to
receive hundreds of thousands of postcards to be delivered to the Israeli Minister of
Defense. Especially now-while bombs rain down on Gaza and we are reminded that when the soldiers say
no, there will be no more deaths. </p>

<p>The Shministim are hoping to stand strong representing not only the thousands of refuseniks who
came before them, not only the many young people to whom they are an example of a better world, but
also to represent us. They have asked you, me, and every person who strives for peace to support
them. I will.</p>
