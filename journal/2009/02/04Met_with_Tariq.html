<p>Tariq and I met after the iWeb seminar, which we both agreed would be a pretty decent way to
practice Japanese listening.  The dude was talking about topics I pretty much know, just don't know
in Japanese.</p>

<p>Met at the nearby Quiznos and he bought me lunch over which we chatted about iPhone games and
our flash game.  We're pretty close to having a *something* finished with the flash game, and I
think we just need to think of a simple little game for the iPhone to get started.  We saw a really
really dope pinball game, that took a lot lot lot of work (it appears), but even it didn't make a
lot of money for the developers, if any at all.</p>

<p>Saw a pretty neat little game that could be way more popular if it had better game play..
there's no levels nor point to the game.  Good time can be had by touching, but there's no break in
play or anything of the sort.</p>

<p>Tariq was asking how he can get &quot;up to speed&quot; with C# programming for the iPhone, and
I'm like, &quot;ummmmmmmmm,&quot; knowing the number of years I've spent in that department, but
then I realize there's an important aspect that I normally overlook: the design of the
game/project/whatsit.</p>

<p>I guess my job right about now is to install 10.5.6 so I can start iPhone development.  I don't
really have a good way to backup all my data, so I'm hesita.....</p>

<p>Ah-ha!!  I can backup my entire drive to a directory on my silver computer (with big HD) and be
done with it.  Sweet!  Thanks, brain!</p>
