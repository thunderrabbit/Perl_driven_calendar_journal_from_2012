Brief life history and additional information about you:
</h4></td>
<td class="t_header">

<p>My first year this lifetime was in Kentucky.  Lived in Missouri for 7 years, during which time a
sister was miscarried and my brother was born.  Sucked my thumb through first and second grade.
Moved to Houston Texas, still super shy, secretly sucked my thumb until 6th grade.</p>

<p>First date was as a high school senior when Lanette asked me.  Discovered girls around that time
and went through a string of relationships between one day and five years, in a variety of
overlapping ways.  On 29 February 2000, proposed to Wende, with wedding scheduled sufficiently far
in advance that I could get out if needed.  We bought an expensive house, had two cars and three
cats, and I decided I had to travel instead, so I broke up with her and moved to Japan, by way of a
few shorter lived relationships one of which included a miscarriage and another of which might have
been the one I shouldn't have left.</p>

<p>Worked as a computer programmer for most of my years in Houston after university, during which
time I volunteered for 5+ years as a youth advisor for YRUU <a href="http://www25.uua.org/YRUU/">http://www25.uua.org/YRUU/</a> </p>

<p>Decided to leave my life behind and see the world, starting with Japan because it was safe, clean,
but with different language.  Sometimes I wish I had done a bit more research, and I wonder why I'm
still in Japan, though a couple years ago I had the fantastic chance to sail around the world with
PB, for which I'm quite thankful.</p>

<p>Broke my shoulder while riding my overloaded bicycle down a curvy hill in May 2007
<a href="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2006/05/30">http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2006/05/30</a> and suddenly went from 0
dollars to USD$4000 in debt.  Just now have gotten that all paid off and am interested in my next
adventure.</p>
