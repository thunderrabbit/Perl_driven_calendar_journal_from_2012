<p>Not even an actual app yet; it just runs on the iPhone simulator, I've compiled a little diddy
that's basically just one of the sample code things, but with an icon I snagged (and rotated) from a
different sample code thing, and changed one single text string from &quot;flippy&quot; (it's a
Utility Action template (*)) to &quot;flippy chick&quot; in honor of the song &quot;Hippy
Chick&quot; though I don't remember who sings it.</p>

<p>(*) &quot;This template provides a starting point for a utility application that has a main view and a
flipside view. It sets up an Info button to flip the main view to the flipside, and a navigation bar
with a Done item to flip back to the main view.&quot;</p>

<p>Next step: go to bed!</p>
