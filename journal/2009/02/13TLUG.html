<p>Good time at the TLUG (Tokyo Linux User's Group) meeting tonight.  Sach invited me.  At the
station we met Leo, ____ and ____.  Dang I forgot their names.  At the restaurant, I sat at a table
corner between Mike and Shin.  Leo sat on Mike's left.  Bruce sat to Shin's right.  Tomita to his
right. </p>

<p>ISPs was the hot topic of the evening, with Bruce telling Leo all about it.  Sorta left Mike,
me, and Shin in a loud zone where it wasn't that easy to talk.  But dassalright; we sorted it out.
I imagine I seemed a bit odd by saying I don't drink, and talking about the importance of
meditation and real spirituality as opposed to religion.  Tomita will probably come to Zeitgeist on
8 March.</p>
