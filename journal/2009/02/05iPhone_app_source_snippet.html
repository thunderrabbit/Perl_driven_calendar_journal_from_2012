<p>Perhaps foolishly, I'm transcribing this from the video Using iPhone Features in Your
Application, at approximately 3:30 into the vid.</p>

<pre>
// Make sure the library isn't empty
if ([UIImagePickerController isSourceTypeAvailable:
        UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary]) {

   UIImagePickerConroller *picker;
   picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];
   picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary;

   picker.allowsImageEditing = YES;

   picker.delegate = self;

   [currentViewController presentModalViewController:picker
                                              animated:YES];

}
