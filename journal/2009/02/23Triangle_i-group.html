<p>Michael chose not to come again tonight, citing his back pain.  Kevin emailed at the last second,
saying the perfect house they found in Kyoto turns out not to be perfect..  They just got a call
saying &quot;no foreigners, no exceptions.&quot; C'mon, Japan, grow out of your racism.</p>

<p>So he chose not to come, saying on top of packing, they've got to go back to Kyoto to find a
place to move!   eeek!</p>
