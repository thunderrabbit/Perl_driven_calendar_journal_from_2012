<p class="date">5:03pm JST Saturday 21 February 2009 (day 14213)</p>

<p>Met Laura from Hong Kong (formerly Laura from Singapore).  Her parents named her Èþ±À and she
named herself Laura after the girl running down the hill in the intro of Little House on the
Prairie.  We hadn't previously met in this incarnation, but somehow connected electronically over
the interweb (Myspace?) a couple years ago, and have been in sporadic e-touch since.</p>

<p>We met at Hachiko, ate at Thanks Nature, while she asked about my plans to visit OZ, and I told
her a bit about the ISIS technique of emotional cleansing.  Headed across the love hotel hill to the
cramped shopping megapolis Donki-Hote to wander around a bit, and then back toward the station where
I had plenty of time before meeting Ami, so walked with Laura toward Harajuku.  Hugged her bye on
top of the crosswalk after identifying Harajuku Station, Meiji Jingu, and Yoyogi Park
entrances.</p>

<p>Walked back by way of the park-like path near NHK, where I saw Choco Crunch singing acappella
[sic], and then saw a huge shirt labeled FAT.</p>
