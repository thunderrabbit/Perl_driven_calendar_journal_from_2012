<p>Went to lunch at the 7-plate-minimum train-sushi shop with Awinter today before he headed to
work.  I'm now on top of Tokyu Department Store in Shibuya, sorta freezing from cold wind, but
getting a few emails written.</p>

<p>Yesterday I </p>

<p>Oh wait, I need to write one more email.</p>

<p class="date">2:43pm JST</p>

<p>Okay. Just sent an email to Janetta, the registrar for the Aussie ISIS course.</p>

<p>Right now I am (and over the past couple days I've been) listening to Stanislav Grof several
hours worth of lectures on wholotropic states of consciousness, thanks to Krimms suggestion during
our Kagoshima adventure.</p>

<p>Good stuff.</p>

<p>Recently have been in touch with a woman who will be giving an Ayurveda intro on Sunday for
Circle of Light in Ogikubo.  I won't be able to go... er, I'm choosing to go skiing with Ami and
family instead of the Ayurveda thing, and wonder if I'm making the &quot;wrong&quot; choices at a
conjuncture in my life.</p>

<p>Traci mused about subletting her space in the morning for, perhaps massage sessions, or, I'm
wondering about a meditation circle could (?) work?  Not sure.</p>

<p>Want to email Mia soon; I gave her a reiki-massage, and have yet to collect a session from her
(psycho-何とか何とか).</p>

<p>I think I'll call her now.</p>
