<p>Kumi and I ordered CDs from Clairvision, and requested they be shipped together to her house to
save a bit on shipping.  Just met her in Musashikosugi to pick up my CDs!  She had some free time
before needed to meet some peeps in Jiyugaoka, so we headed over there and happened across said
peeps when hopping off the train!  Said HI briefly to them and then went our separate ways until the
pre-determined meeting time.</p>

<p>Kumi and I chilled in a coffee shop, each getting &quot;orange juice,&quot; which was more like
orange flavored drink and chattered about the things about which we normally chatter: meditation,
spiritual awakening, living life happily, etc.  Told her about the stranger and stranger interview
with Bill Deagle, and we excitedly anticipated our upcoming ISIS 101 classes.  She said she doesn't
really want to become a practitioner, but I pretty much do, or I want at least to have ISIS on hand
to share with people as appropriate.</p>

<p>Also showed her a couple apps on Little Blue Monkey (my iPhone) and stuff.</p>

<p>7:30 arrived, as it does regularly, so we hugged and byed.</p>
