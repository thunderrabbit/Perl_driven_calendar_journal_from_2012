<p>From me:</p>

<pre>
<b>Massaji?  Massaji?

That's Japanese for "can I give you a massage?"

I'm looking forward to chowing at vegan night tomorrow night!  I'd
love to exchange another massage for a vegan buffet dinner in March!
When would be good for you??

<p>To me:</p>

<pre>
Yes, I need one!  What are you doing at 3pm today?  My back is screwed up
again although not nearly as bad as last time. I know it is last minute but
today would work best for me! Let me know if you get this:)

upcoming ¤·¤¢¤Ä classes starting Tuesday.  Woooo!</p>
