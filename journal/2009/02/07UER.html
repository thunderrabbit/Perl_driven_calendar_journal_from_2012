<p>Good time at UER yesterday (Saturday 3-7pm); I especially enjoyed the times that reminded me of
YRUU in depth of opening our hearts and games we played.  Emma spent a bit more time worried about
spending time than just taking time to do stuff, but goodness overall.</p>

<p>At the end, some of us were going to go eat, but Tatiana encouraged us to follow the guidelines
of not intereacting outside the listening relationships.</p>
