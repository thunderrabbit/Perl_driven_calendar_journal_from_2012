<p>Got a bit more understanding via an iPhone app toot; this author (nitrex88) showed a way of
setting up the nib file (.xib) that made more sense to me than previous ways.  Now it may just be
that I had a better framework to understand, but I was like, &quot;oohhhhhh!!&quot; cause I
suddenly understood.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's just a countdown timer, but I gotta few more iPhone-app-smarts.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Haven't been able to get it to both count *up* and count *down* in a reasonable way.  I
think the problem is simply with the boundary states, determining if we should next go up or down,
especially in the *first* case, where the chooser hasn't been given a value.  I assume we can make
a constructor in some way, but I'm not sure the syntax.</p>
