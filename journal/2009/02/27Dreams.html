<p class="dream">In my Aunt Mercedes' house, which was designed to withstand floods, when a major
climate shift had occurred, so the bottom story was flooded almost all the time.  We wree up on the
second floor balcony, overlooking the dark black ocean, with monster waves that came nearly to flood
the top level, and oscillated down to the lower level.  Though this was normal, some of the others
hadn't seen such wave action so close to home.  Carl from PB 52 was there, as well as Bryn and Abbey
from SWD and continental YRUU.  Ex figurehead of the US GWB was there as well, but I hadn't seen him
yet.  Bryn and I watched the ocean for a while, as its huge wave action seemed likely to destroy the
house.  I watched as a huge wall of water came toward us and fortunately its waveform equalized to
just the level of our feet so we weren't sloshed away.  Everything seemed safe, so we headed back
to the common area and flopped down on some cushions to finally catch up after all these years.
I told her the overview of Japan and PB and Japan, and she was like, &quot;wow!&quot; and then
kissed me and we kissed(!) 
<!--
    she kissed my chin, and I was like, &quot;dude!&quot; and she was like, &quot;well in that
    case,&quot; and she licked my chin!  I laughed and licked her chin back, and then stuck my
    tongue out to catch her tongue if she licked me again.  It worked; our tongues touched and we
    started to kiss happily and sloppily, both knowing it was just for fun and just to say we had
    done so.  Strictly speaking, she stopped before I was ready, but I knew that to be for the best.

a bit and then it was time to go.</p>

<p class="dream">I went to the non-ocean side of the house where lots of UUs were having a lunch
among oak trees and blankets and benches, organized by the owner of the camp.  I saw some dishes and
trays that needed to be cleared, so took them to the sink area where a woman had a glass pitcher of
sudsy water for washing.  I dipped one of the plates into it to rinse and then realized it was
&quot;clean&quot; water for washing, and said &quot;sorry&quot; and rinsed the plate off in the
correct area as I helped scoop the food particles out of her sudsy water.  She looked at me as if I
had quite destroyed something and wanted to call the manager.  I assured her that it would be okay,
but she called him anyway, so he came and I explained what had happened.  He said, &quot;oh; I
thought she said it was something bad, [but it's no problem] &quot; and that was the end of
that.</p>

<p class="dream">Back to the ship, I was in one of the guest rooms and GWB was in there, with his
smirky frog face, rinsing his hands after just having taken a whiz.  I asked him where exactly he
had whizzed because the room in which he was standing had only a sink on one side, and a sink for
kids on the other side.  He was confused by my question, and when I looked again, the sink for kids
was actually a little tiny urinal.  I was pretty sure it had changed just to make me look foolish in
front of GWB.  I left and went to the side of the ship and saw we had huge waves on all sides.  I
went to the front to watch our progress; we were traveling *quite* quickly I thought, perhaps
because the wind was with us because it wasn't all that windy outside the ship.  The waves towered
over the side of the ship, and at one point I felt us drop several feet, as if we had come down off
a wave to a lower one.  I looked toward where we were headed, and saw some buildings with the US
Capitol in the background, with its large white dome sorta hazy behind other layers of horizon.  We
were arriving at the Statue of Liberty, where dock workers dressed in traditional red British
soldier uniforms waved to us and helped us into the parking space.</p>

<p class="dream">In a plane in the Andes, our runway was actually a roadway that spiraled up to the
top of the mountain and then abruptly ended.  Our plane curved slowly up to the top, and I wondered
what would happen if a car was coming down.  I figured they had these details figured out, so just
watched the pine trees pass by.  The road was only 2 lanes wide; I wasn't sure how our wings were
coming along for the ride, but we got to the top and just lurched off the end of the road, then the
pilot pushed the engines to full thrust and we were soon airborne, but with a mountain in the way.
I wasn't sure we would make it,</p>

<p>and woke up before finding out.</p>
