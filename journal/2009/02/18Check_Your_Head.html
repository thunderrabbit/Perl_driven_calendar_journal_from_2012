<p>At the hospital now, letting them check the staples on my head when they're good and ready
(8:30).  I dragged my warm self out of my warm bed to get here <em>first</em>, and it seems to have
worked!  Yayy!!!  (In cases that I write &quot;Yay!&quot; (or its variants), I often want to write
Yahoo!, but don't want to advertise the company unnecessarily).</p>

<p>They've got an interesting registration system here, which I had never seen before.  Basically I
got an ID card when I registered with the hospital on Sunday night.  This morning, I inserted it
into one of three little card readers by the front entrance, and it registered me as having arrived
(pull a number; take a seat), <em>and</em> had printed on it where in the hospital I need to take
said seat!</p>

<p>Bah.  She was like, &quot;[As it says on your slip,] you're the first to arrive, 
but the 予約人..(*)(**)&quot; and I cut her off there, &quot;I'll be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>(*) 予約 has part of the same kanji as 予定, which basically means &quot;plan.&quot; 人 is the
kanji for person.  Maybe it means pre-scheduled people.

<p>(**) It went basically like this:</p>

<p>「壱番なんですけど、予約人が、。。。」</p>

<p>「私は大丈ヴィ。」))</p>

<p>But there's no one else in this waiting area....  I wonder to whom she is referring.</p>

<p>Man.  I wish I could take.... nevermind.  I just did take a picture of an old man whose name was
called right at 9am.  9am arrived, the nurse opened the door (she had been talking to patients
through the window, with the door closed next to her) and called the guy's name.  He walked through
the door and but his arm into the blood pressure machine and sat down with the old-mannest face I've
seen in a long time.  He wore a creased down frown permafrowned onto his face.</p>

<p>The machine ran twice and he handed the two printouts to the nurse.  In the amount of time I've
been writing this, three more patients (+)</p>

<p>(+) and that's when they called my name and I got my chance to rock in there and get my blood
pressure taken twice and tell the doctor no I don't hurt, and no I didn't get whiplash, and no I
don't want to come back Saturday cause I can hopefully get someone else to take the staples out,
grrrr.</p>

<p>Left, paid for the shiz. $560, on top of the $100 I had paid to see the doctor at night.  The
breakdown for my 9pm visit went like this:</p>

<p>Dr chg: 10,460 yen</p>

<p>Operation: 17,040 yen</p>

<p>CT scan 32,380 yen</p>

<p>Breakdown for today:</p>

<p>Dr chg: 1,400 yen</p>

<p>Today's fee is reasonable.  Not so sure about the others, and I'm a bit grouchy about the CT
scan. I didn't want to get one.  I knew my head was fine fine fine fine fine fine fine.</p>

<p>Just spent a month's rent for these three staples.  I wonder if I need to get a job soon.
gah.</p>
