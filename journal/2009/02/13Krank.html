<p>Last night I let Krank play and play by itself on Easy Level 27.  It didn't remove any of the
stones in a 6 hour period.  I guess it's more rare than I had hoped.  (basically requires 4 of 6
same colored stones to arrive at a certain spot on the field before any of the other 18 other-color
bubbles arrive in the same spot..)  There are four spots, each with its desire to get 4 same-colored
bubbles.  The bubbles are literally little circles that move around the screen, bouncing off the
sides and each other in a nicely chaotic way.  They move nearly frictionlessly, only losing a bit
of energy when they bounce off the sides of the screen.  But then gaining a lot of energy after
four bubbles collect on the hot spots, and then are exploded away at high speeds.</p>

<p>Anyway, a couple days ago, after a few hours of auto-play, one of the hotspots had apparently
received exactly 4 of its color bubbles and was removed from the screen.  I thought an overnight
adventure might do even better.</p>
