<p>I bought two books on iPhone application development: <b>Beginning iPhone Development: Exploring
the iPhone SDK</b>, by Dave Mark and Jeff Lamarche, and <b>The iPhone Developer's Cookbook</b> by
<a href="http://ericasadun.com/">Erica Sadun</a>.</p>

<p>(After buying them, I realized I had forgotten the receipt, which I imagine Tariq will be able
to use to make it a business purchase; I went back to the shop (Kinokuniya in Shinjuku) and one of
the regi-staff found the receipt by digging through the trash.)</p>

<p>At the moment I'm in Shibuya, waiting for Yurika, and have just put together a Hello World app (I
called mine &quot;brace yosef, fooz!&quot;) using the first book above, and have a much better
understanding of the process than before.</p>
