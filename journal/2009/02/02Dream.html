<p class="dream">Went back to the same rock in Australia where I los my glasses with janette in
Hawaii.  The tide was a bit lower, so from the shore, I was able to see the top of the rock that I
had wanted to surmount in the surf that day.  The water was crystal clear as I stepped into it, but
quite cold, so I wasted no time getting on top of the rock.  Discovered it was actually a preformed
tank made of fiberglass, and ocean waves would pour into it, but it didn't get filled up all the
way.  Deep sediment on the bottom had a hole dug into it by the inflow of water.  I wondered where
my glasses had fallen, and if I'd be able to find them.  how deeply would they be buried?  Might
have somebody found them already and hung them from a fence on the beach?  Perhaps I should have
left a note, &quot;if anyone finds my glasses, put them here, and I'll be back in a few years to
pick them up!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I jumped into the water (outside the fiberglass tank), and lo, slightly buried,
but with a temple sticking out from the sand were my glasses!  I was super excited, but a bit
concerned that this was actually a dream and that I wouldn't be able to bring them back with me.
So, I figured I'll call janette to *me* and show her!  So in my house from high school, I called
janette and my aunt Madeleine showed up instead.  &quot;Oh did you find your glasses in
Hawaii?&quot;  &quot;Australia,&quot; I mis-corrected her.  But I really wanted to talk to janette
instead of Madeleine, so I kept walking and when I got to the table where my friends were hanging
out like in a restaurant/campground, I realized why my legs were so cold.  My pants, shorts,
underwears and socks had all fallen into reverse sorted order so all my body parts were covered,
but I was super jailin' like hip hop fashion.  I was like, &quot;hey a new trend!&quot; but with
the underwear at my ankles, I couldn't really walk whatsoever, so I doubted it would catch on.</p>
