<p>Met up with David in Ebisu, and went to a coffee shop he likes.  I had a bagel and two mugs of
hot water (the server first gave me a little paper cup of hot water and noticed it was hot so was
getting me an insulator, and I'm like, &quot;um, how about a mug?&quot; and she agreed that was a
good idea.</p>

<p>David told me about the movie in which he's been acting, and for which it sounds like he's been
writing and partially directing.  Sounds pretty sweet!  I told him about the pickle in which I find
myself with Ami (if we break up, you cry, and if we stay together, I cry), and said eventually I
would realize enough is enough and write the proverbial Dear Jane letter.</p>
