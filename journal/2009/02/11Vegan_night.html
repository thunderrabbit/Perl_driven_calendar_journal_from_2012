<p>Vegan night was cool, as expected.  Sat with はるな、きよみ、Kate, and Dave.  A woman came up a
bit later and was introduced to me as Miki, and I was like, &quot;now *that*'s a name I an
remember!&quot; and explained that KG Miki was one of my favorite peeps in Japan when I first got
started here.  I was duly mocked for a bit, and then explained &quot;well actually I called her
Kindergarten Miki, cause she was a kindergarten teacher, so it sounds even worse.&quot; and Dave
was subsequently accused of having a fetish for Kingergarten kids, and he and I would clarify
&quot;<em>teacher</em> after the word Kindergartners.</p>

<p>Funny times.</p>
