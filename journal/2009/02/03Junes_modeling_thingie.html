<p>Went to Junes and applied to be a (famous?) model.  Met やす、まみ、and　とよ、 who all seemed
like pretty good peeps.</p>

<p>Picture takin' went well, and I've got a &quot;job&quot; on Feb 14 or 15th or so weekend.  It's not
really a job; they just need peeps to sport their faces in front of a facial recognition system.
Need thousands of people.  4000 yen per person.  Email me if you want the deets.</p>
