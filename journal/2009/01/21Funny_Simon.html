sweat?) as a blindfold, but it wasn't long enough to tie around my head, so I placed it under my
glasses to hold it up.</p>

<p>Simon was like, &quot;if you wanna scare them, you should draw eyes on it,&quot; and threw me a
marker.  I didn't really have time to draw realistic eyes, and I can't realistically draw realistic
eyes anyway, so I just drew two circle and pupils, hoping they'd end up in the right spot on the
blindfold.  Perfect!</p>

<p>He goes, &quot;I can't believe you're <em>how old?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thirty-nine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're very young at heart; that's good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah that's my plan for staying young.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mine too.&quot;</p>

<p>The nurses laughed and we all had a good time.  I blindly walked out as far as the door to our
ward, but couldn't get all the way to the toilet without looking.  I probably could have, but
didn't want to get in the way of any of the nurses.</p>
