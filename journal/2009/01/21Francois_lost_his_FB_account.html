Do I need Erin Cahill? maybe.
She may think that I have the rabies
I'll just keep buyin her hot babies

Every pet she touches turns to gold
Soon as she buys 'em, again they're sold
I may only be just four years old
but I don't always do what I'm told

For example sleep hoppin' in my sleep
I know Erin wants me for keeps
but because she bought me, other peeps
try to steal me out of her reach

That's why Erin is buildin' superfunds
no matter how often nor how far I run
she'll buy me back from anyone
but bidding wars aren't really fun

so she lets me chill with some other dudes
so I can swim in their pool and eat all their foods
and just when they think they got screwed
thinkin' Erin has left me to rot for good

she'll come back and rescue me,
we'll sail together on the seven seas
sleepin' snuggly warmly cheek to cheek
Oh look!  Here she comes as we speak!

Trang oh Trang, you're my favorite thang
If I'm with you I won't complain
We love to snuggle while we watch the rain
and all my worries go down the drain

I always love to sleep over here
When I look up, your smile appears
You sometimes let me sip your beer
and you never call me a teddy bear

Sleepin' in your pillow case
Popcorn by the fire place
Knockin' over your favorite vase
Chasin' me all over the place

You kept me safe for many months
when I was only a million bucks
You never clicked for your refund
And I'm so glad to say now you won!

You've got FFS most expensive Rabbit
Especially one with a singing habit
If someone buys me I'll say "yeah but,"
turn right around and let them have it

I always want to stay with Trang!
friendliest owner in the whole game.
Last name almost rhymes with her first name
but I just call her Trang Trang Trang!!

My favorite owner!!  <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendsforsale/users/show/5887132">Trang Trang Trang!!</a>
