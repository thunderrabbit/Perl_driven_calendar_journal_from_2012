<p>Will and I are chillin' in Haneda airport after the easy flight back.  Our group of six split
off in pairs at the monorail, and then we two are at a coffee shop, as the remaining two headed
first toward Keikyu line.</p>

<p>While we were on the Keikyu Line, Will looked up and pointed to an advertisement featuring a
hand holding a credit card.  &quot;That's my hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>At Keikyu Kawasaki, I waved by to Will and our (his) (four) newfound (high school girl)
friend(s).  One of them was the ringleader; she answered when he asked if the short train that
didn't stop near us at Keikyu Kamata was the train for Yokohama.  I figured it couldn't be; Yokohama
is a big station; it deserves big trains.</p>

<p>She explained that the next train would pass that train <em>en route</em> to Yokohama, and then
asked his name and was taken by the best idea ever after he answered &quot;Will.&quot; She called
her friend on the phone and handed the phone over to Will to talk to her (because she speaks English
very well).  We were entertained, though from the number of times he had to repeat things, either
her English ain't all that, or the background noise drowned him out.  I was intrigued that in
English he was like, &quot;come over to Yokohama next time and visit me,&quot; for even though that
phrase is spoken often enough in Japanese (and the key words &quot;next time&quot; means &quot;in
your dreams&quot; (okay, maybe I'm being a bit harsh there, but let's just say there won't be any
imminent plans made)), I wouldn't say it at all because it bugs me that the words seem insincere to
me.</p>
