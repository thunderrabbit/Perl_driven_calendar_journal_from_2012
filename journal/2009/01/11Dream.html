<p class="dream">With several people living in house, including Tamara (Angel), Jason (Collin dot
org), and Dave (met in Jerusalem).  I was planning to take a bubble bath, and invite Tamara, but
Dave had already drawn water.  I was like, &quot;oh; did someone plan to take a bath first?&quot;
and we joked a bit about Rob taking a girly bath, but ended up saying Dave bathe first, and then I
would use the tub.  Tamara mistakenly called Jason &quot;janette,&quot; and then couldn't remember
Jason's name; we let her try to remember for a bit, and then I asked if I could give her a hug,
which I did, and then we were deeper sharing, and she asked what I was doing because I have Ami, and
I said I would choose Tamara, and she was taken aback, including pushing me away.  I was like,
&quot;but...&quot; and then told her I'm a sex addict, but before I said the words, my eyes darted
to the upper right corner of my eyes and then back to looking at her, and then I said, &quot;and my
eyes just looked up like that because I don't want to tell you.  I don't want anyone to
know.&quot;  She appreciated me having told her, even so.</p>
