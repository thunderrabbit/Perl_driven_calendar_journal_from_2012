<p>We watched _Slumdog Millionaire_ today.  I hadn't wanted to see it because the name brought to
mind a fish-out-of-water story of a bum in Beverly Hills, or worse, a dog in Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>The movie has nothing to do with Beverly Hills, except that it features a Hollywood plot, but a
Bollywood setting.  Quite good, and made me quite happy I wasn't born in north India. Not even sure
I want to go now...  South side, yes, but. </p>
