<p>Funny: in Shibuya, headed to Shinjuku, I missed the train that Fred got on; I was headed to the
front car, but I mistimed the door closing noises that occur starting well before the doors close.
Fred saw me on the platform and waved as the train went by; I didn't notice him then, but was glad
to see him mock-laughing at me as my train arrived in Shinjuku 3 minutes after his had.</p>

<p>Went to Seikaido in Shinjuku and got some new markers and white paper boards for me, plus some
erasers for Fred's roommate, and an eraser for Fred.  Then some cute cards for various people.</p>

<p>The erasers were for some small pencils that Bill has.  He likes to have a pencil on him at all
times, and these little mechanical pencils fit the bill perfectly.  The erasers, like any pencil
erasers are cute and round, but unlike most other mechanical pencil erasers, even when new, these
erasers are pretty short.  I guess their shortness matches the pencils' shortness.</p>
