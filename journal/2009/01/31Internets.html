<p>Spent most of my morning on internets, mostly facebook.  I deleted all my porn last night after
telling Ami that it's as bad for me as TV is for her (or worse?)  There's an endless supply; I
don't know that I necessarily need to horde it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was on facebook a lot and watched a bunch of videos of animals on modern household
appliances: roombas and treadmills.  Mostly cats.  I favorited my two favorites, but of those the
cats on treadmill had me crying laughing the first time I saw it.</p>

<p>Then
downloaded <a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/secure-php-form-mailer-script/">Secure PHP
Form Mailer Script by Dagon Design</a>.  It worked quite well as advertised, and I may suggest that
Tariq use it on his website.</p>

<p>(This is interesting grammar above.  To me &quot;I may suggest that Tariq use it&quot; sounds
correct, but &quot;I may suggest that Tariq uses it&quot;.. wait oh I see it.  The second would
mean that I'm implying Tariq already uses it, but in the first I'm saying it would be a good idea
if Tariq were to use it.)</p>

<p>I wonder what a grammar guru would say about that.</p>

<p>Ami called me at 1:05pm while I was in the shower, and then called me again at 1:11pm and
sounded surprised when I answered in a completely awake voice.  She had thought my slumber kept me
from answering the first time.  Chatted with her a bit (a 30 minute bit) while I got ready and
walked to the train, on which I'm now headed to a listening workshop put on my UER (United to End
Racism) or something something like that.  The location is pretty farther away and well more
expensive than I'm used to paying for what I imagine provides the same thing I get free twice a
month with my men's group, but perhaps I'll learn a thing or ten.</p>

<p>Anyway, the conversation with Ami had limited substance, but at one point I asked how she felt
about last night.  She said, &quot;Sad, Shock, and Angry.&quot;  Fair enough.  I told her, &quot;A
little sad.  Not angry.  A little happy.&quot;
