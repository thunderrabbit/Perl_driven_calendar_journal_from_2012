<p class="dream">Telling a woman about my (previous) job, she thought it sounded pretty cool.  I
was like &quot;yeah; Malek likes to throw a good party, so he met people who do the same.&quot;
I continued after some deliberation, &quot;the only problem, though is that sometimes people end up partying to much and coming in late or
not at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">just then, Malek came outside in front of us, and I turned my head so he wouldn't
seen me.  he looked back to see if he had seen me, but turned away after a while.  I recognized I had
been in the same movie before, as brothers Will and Jesse  started to light the garbage in the back
of a firetruck at the same time as they stole the truck.  I was in the cab of the truck, and we
heard an explosion in the back, and then drove partway up a tree and a monkey was there , guarding
his territory.  We showed it some tennis balls and it put them in its mouth.  I ran up one branch
of the tree and looked out over the beach and woke up.</p>
