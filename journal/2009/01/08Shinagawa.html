<p>In … ¿Ó station now, at the Starbucks, where we just got a window seat overlooking the concourse
between the East and West exits.  Spent a few minutes looking at the super-cool water fountain with
strobe lights making the drops of water appear to fall slowly, levitate, and elevate.  Pretty neat
how they do it.  We're supposed to meet Ami here in just over an hour, so we'll probably chill here
until then.</p>

<p>Aight.  I've sketched out a <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/518/">flow chart</a> for reading and saving the level that people achieved in
my game.</p>

<p>Headed out to meet Ami now.</p>
