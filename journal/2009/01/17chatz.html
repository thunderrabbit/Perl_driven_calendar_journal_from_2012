<p>In more interesting news, I chatted with both Kris and Petra.  Kris had to leave immediately,
but Petra and I exchanged a few more words.  Both asked if I could Skype, but it's (way) past
lights out here, so I figured I shouldn't be blabbin' all loud as I would if I talked with either
of these lovely friends.</p>
