<p>The light switch hanging from my light ends with a little plastic ball.  Fred started to rap it
with a knuckle, sending it swinging with each tap, and was like, &quot;this hurts more than I
thought it would..&quot; but kept doing it for a bit because it didn't hurt that much.</p>

<p>Then, he or I was like, &quot;try doing it with your forehead.&quot; and he did, and then I
rapped it with my knuckle, assuring him that it didn't hurt.</p>

<p>Then I hit it with my forehead, and was like, &quot;you hit it back to me with your
forehead,&quot; and Fred goes, &quot;okay!&quot; and just stood there, letting gravity do the work
of sending it back to me.  Hahahhaha!</p>

<p>Then I was like, &quot;it would be funnier if we both did it.&quot;  Sensing a trap, he was
hesitant for a half second, but then did, and I joined the head-clicking.  It was hard to keep the
ball going in the correct direction!  Then Fred goes, &quot;you have to put your hands like
this,&quot; putting his hands in his armpits to make chicken wings out of his arms.</p>

<p>We were crying laughing by then, making bwak bak bak noises like chickens and bobbing our heads
to knock this little ball around.  Maybe a video is required.</p>

<p>Nah.</p>
