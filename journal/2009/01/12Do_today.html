<p>I did reiki charging this morning, for the first time in a while.  A difference: my left
shoulder has healed from last time I was doing chargings..  Apparently I had stretched it in a
weird way, but now I can do the upper back and have no pain.</p>

<p>Today Fred and I are going to chow at the Indian restaurant (Kohinoor) near Motosumiyoshi, and
then head to Shibuya / Shinjuku for internet / buy some art supplies from Seikaido.  Then either
drop him off at the internet cafe or he goes home while I go to my men's group, this time in Oomori
to support Takeshi after his wife's death last week.</p>
