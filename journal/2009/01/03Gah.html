<p>Gah!  For the first time in a long time (ever?), I was late for (i.e. completely forgot about) a
meeting with Tariq.  Fortunately the meeting was just at my station (and I slept in my clothes), so
when he called me, I was able to roll out of bed and be there 11 minutes later.</p>

<p>Meeting was good; we're making progress on this game (chat forest's first).</p>
