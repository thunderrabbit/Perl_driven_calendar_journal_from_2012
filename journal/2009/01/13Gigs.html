<p>I've got 12 Gigs of storage space tied up with some videos from a party in my shared room back a
couple years ago.  I'm thinking I should just delete them, save perhaps for me-n-Shawn's commentary
afterward.  That was pretty much funnier than the footage of drunken antics beforehand.</p>

<p>I deleted the antics portion.  I'm going to export the cleanup and discussion portion, but
probably not make them public.</p>
