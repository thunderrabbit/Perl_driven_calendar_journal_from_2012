<p>Today's walk included a little round of bowling no pins, but just going for accuracy, with U-Cow
being the 10 point target.  Will did an amazing bowl where the ball rolled along a curb of grass
along the side of the track for about 15 meters, then rolled off and about 30 more meters to hit
U-Cow perfectly!  Definitely a Youtube moment, but no cameras were rolling.</p>
