<p class="dream">Saw two Shetland ponies, with their tails as wide as their bodies, and long as
their legs, covered with a stocking like a chef with long hair would wear.  I noted their tails
were braided, no, dreded, and I asked my friend about the sacks covering their tails.  &quot;Is it
because of ___?&quot; and my friend goes, &quot;No, it's because they vomit on themselves.&quot;
&quot;ohhhhh....&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I went over to see if I could talk to them, and I approached one; she didn't get
scared.  I held out my hand, and she held out her hand.  She was standing my height, and we shook
hands with our right hands.  Then shook hands with our left hands.  it was like interacting with a
different culture, testing things out to see  what the reaction would be.</p>

<p class="dream">Then she reached her other hand over so we were shaking hands with both hands.  I
slightly pulled my hands apart to cross her arms together, and then she did the same.  I let go
with one hand to show her a dance move, basically twirling her toward me in my arms.  As the got
all the way over, I leaned in and gave her a kiss., just a peck on the lips.</p>

<p class="dream">She looked surprised, but curious enough to do it again, and this time she kissed
back.   Then we just stood there, and gave a Little kiss, but with eyes closed.  I said, &quot;eyes
open&quot; and she opened her eyes, and I opened my eyes and we kissed.  grabbed her tongue with my
lips and then *I* got a bit of a shock.  Her tongue was rough like a cat's tongue, and it was
split like a lizard.  I was like, &quot;wowww...&quot; and she lifted one side and then the other
as I was sucking on her tongue.  I tried to do the same, but without my tongue split, I could just
turn my tongue upside down.</p>
