<p>Went straight to Kevin's house after the dentist, arriving at his place just after 11am, though a
bit after I would have arrived had I noticed I was right next to his building when I checked out a
cool bicycle near a shop, bringing the owner (of the bicycle) out of the shop with a big smile on
his face asking, &quot;do you like my bike?&quot; and after the conversation where I learned he had
cut some drop handlebars off at the middle of the curve and flipped them over to make slightly
upturned handlebars with sharply cut ends, I walked right past Kevin's building and took a while
before I decided for sure I had walked too far.</p>

<p>Ended up back at the same shop for lunch with Kevin, Yuki and Kailash, featuring Four Chesse
Pizza for me and some set meals for Kevin and Yuki which they ate in turns while the other
monitored Kailash.</p>

<p>Then pushed Kailash on a cool tricycle (with chain driven back wheel drive and steering
controlled equally by his handlebars or the handlebars in back) to the storage unit by way of the
park where I told Kevin about the XKCD comic regarding going back to the childhood playground
slide.</p>

<p>Helped Kevin move a lot of stuff out of the big storage unit to a smaller unit after Yuki joined
us there to make the rental of the extra unit go more smoothly, so they'd have some manuevering
room to sort and repack their stuff before moving to Kyoto.</p>

<p>Fun to see Kevin so happy to get a good start on that big task; I'm happy to help my friend,
especially when I get to chat with him about spiritual stuff and stuff.</p>

<p>Back to his house for a second to get my stuff and say HI and See ya to Yuki and Kai, then Kevin
and I got a little snack and drink at Zoka, just outside of Meijiro station.  Chatted for about an
hour and plans and stories and good stuff.  At the very end, I gave him a Loose Change DVD, burned
by Simon in Kagoshima.</p>
