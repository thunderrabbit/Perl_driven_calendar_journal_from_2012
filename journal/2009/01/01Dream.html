<p class="dream">Accidentally drove my fast car too fast near a train track and didn't have time to
stop as the train crossing arms were coming down.  I swooshed over to the left and then the right to
slow down but it wasn't enough and I zoomed right under the arms as they were closing.  Then I was
just in front of Fred and his friend on the bridge over the boundary from Magnolia to Tomball, as
traffic was piling up.  I needed to get back to work, so I asked Fred if he could help me get over
the mid-line wall on the bridge and head back out the other way.  He started to race me, running
forward, so I put my feet down and balanced the car around my neck and ran after him to race him. I
caught up with him and then just climbed over the midline wall and he commented that I didn't need
any help.  I pulled the car up over my head and put it back down on the road surface, bid them
farewell and hoped the traffic would disperse soon, and zoomed away, up toward Magnolia.</p>
