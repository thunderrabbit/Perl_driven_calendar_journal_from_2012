<p>Chatted for a bit with my e-pal Nadhira, who lives in Kuala Lumpur.  I'd love to visit that city
sometime, and now I may have a guide!  She says it's about 30 degrees there now, and I'm like
whooohoooo cause I love it hot hot hot.  Only a few degrees here, like 5, and it may snow
tomorrow....</p>

<p>We didn't get to chat very long because my internet tubes have been clogged.</p>

<p>She said she had a bit of a headache (from the hot weather)...  I hope that she feels better soon.</p>
