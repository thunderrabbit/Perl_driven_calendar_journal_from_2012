<p>Mostly I've been connected to my computer today, but three meals have pulled me away, and the
movie did as well for a bit.</p>

<p>Things I did &quot;today:&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Took my phone into the toilet and then the shower while talking with Ami.</p></li>

<li><p>sewed U-Cow's belly where his seam had split</p></li>

<li><p>read Yongfook's 2008 reflections message</p></li>

<li><p>placed U-Cow precariously on the curtain track so when the nurse opens it tomorrow, U-Cow
will fall.</p></li>

<li><p>Set up a s00per s33cret email address so I can email from my cell phone and have it posted
to several image hosting providers, not yet including smugmug</p></li>

<li><p>contacted dreamhost for support in changing the subject line to the password I need to send
messages to smugmug</p></li>

<li><p>added a LHS to the chatforest game Tariq and I are making</p></li>

<li><p>not work on any of my drawings</p></li>

<li><p>tried signing up for mailchimp, but decided not to because they don't handle multi-language
info, nor auto-removes</p></li>

<li><p>watched the most funniest video in the world, sent by my dear friend Laura!</p></li>
