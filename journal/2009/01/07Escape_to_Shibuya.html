<p>Fred and I have escaped the clutches of my warm room with sporadic internet to visit Shibuya and
embark on a 90 minute dessert chowing adventure at Sweets Paradise before heading to solid internet
access at Manboo.  I've brought both my computers so I can synchronize my pics of MT3 construction
with my storage space on S3 with my silver PowerBook (purchased from Jason) while doing Flash
programming on this computer (white MacBook).  Maybe I need to name these computers and ... oh
wait; I have named the other one.  Fred was like, &quot;you need to name your computer,&quot; and I
was like, &quot;bah; who cares??&quot; and 2 seconds later I discovered &quot;paintbrush&quot; on my
local network, and was like, &quot;wtf is paintbrush?&quot; and Fred goes, &quot;that's my
computer's name!&quot; and I go, &quot;<em><b>*I*</b></em> want a name for <em>my</em> computer!!&quot;</p>

<p>So I named the PowerBook ±¦±ýº¸±ý.  I think I'll name this one ¸µµ¤.</p>
