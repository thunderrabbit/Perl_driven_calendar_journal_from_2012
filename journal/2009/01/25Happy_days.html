<p>For the past coupla days, however long it's been since I wrote (and a bit before that), I've
basically just been</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by the apparent dichotomy between engaging in human-objectifying behaviors, and
seeking enlightenment, but.  Those are the things I've been doing.</p>

not why I'm writing.  Every night at 10pm, the night nurse will come through and be like,
&quot;aight, lights out,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;nononoono one more hour!&quot; and if everyone
agrees, or it's otherwise obvious that no one is in sleep mode, the nurse will agree to leave them
on for another hour.  Not past 11pm though, even though I've begged and pleaded.</p>

<p>Tonight, however, it was a different nurse.  He was like, &quot;aight, lights out,&quot; and I
was like, &quot;nononoono one more hour!&quot; and he was like, &quot;nope!&quot; and I was like,
&quot;aight, just leave my light on.  And he did!  He asked me to close my curtain, ostensibly to
keep the light from spreading too obnoxiously across the beds of the other guys, all of whom are
still awake.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did he leave your light on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;hahaha I dunno!  I just asked him too and he did! wow!&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to John for taking the picture.</p>
