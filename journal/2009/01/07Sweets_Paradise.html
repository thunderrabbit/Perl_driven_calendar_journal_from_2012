<p>Welp, here we are!  We've been here 10 minutes, eaten about a plate worth each.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm gettin' kinda full.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, this was a good idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep.  And we've done it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, we've successfully sat in a room full of high school girls for 10 minutes...  and
gotten bored.&quot;</p>

<p>Fred, cheating, just got a plate of spaghetti and some bread stuff.</p>
