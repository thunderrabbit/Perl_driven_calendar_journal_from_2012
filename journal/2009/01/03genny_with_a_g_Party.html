<p>Great time at Genny et. al.'s house tonight for a great Christmas party!  We had a secret santa
exchange, and the most coveted items were a bottle of wine, and a coffee maker, which kept swapping
hands.  Finally I was able to offload the 3 Christmas CDs and get the photo
that <a href="http://jasoncollinphotography.com/">Jason Collin</a> took of one of his students.</p>

<p>Anyway, tons of food and fun.  Great time!</p>
