<p>Met Tariq at 9:15am, a bit late, but ah well.  We met until noon, mostly looking at a problem
he's having with his website, which I was unable to completely solve for him.  Got some progress,
but not sure why it's not working past that.</p>

<p>He'll pay me 20,000 yen for my time there and getting the rest of the problem solved.  Sweet!</p>
