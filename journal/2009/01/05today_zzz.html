<p>Had basically a lazy day at home with Fred.  He worked a lot on his project, and I played on my
computer, trying to get Inform7 to make a breakable glass window for use as a door, and didn't write
a Rob Update.  Gotta write a Rob Update.  Oh, but I did talk to Ryan about stuff; he's learning
Arabic and some martial arts, and plans to move to / visit the middle east this summer.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Fred and I went to the ramen shop near Motosumiyoshi station, and then were too full to eat with
Ami when she arrived here at my house.  She ended up not eating, and we chatted about me wanting to
go to Dubai to live for a year (and make several dollars programming), and she wanting to start
building a nest and stuff.</p>

<p>Sigh.  relationships.</p>

<p>But the good thing was when I was saying bye to Ami at the top of the hill over the train
tracks, I was like, &quot;and try to shock me more often; be creativer.&quot;</p>

<p>And she got it.  She went toward my house as I went toward her house.  Perfect.</p>
