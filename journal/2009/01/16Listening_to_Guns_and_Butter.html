<p>I'm listening to the <a href="http://www.kpfa.org/guns-and-butter">Guns and Butter</a>
episode <a href="http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/46561">"Understanding the Next Phase of the Global
Systemic Crisis"</a> from 10 December 2008.  I'll summarize the points section by section (from
memory for the first section):</p>

<ol>
   <li>first 15 minutes:
   <ol>
      <li>Interviewing Franck Biancheri.  Visit websites at <a href="http://www.leap2020.eu">www.leap2020.eu</a> and <a href="http://www.europe2020.org">www.europe2020.org</a>.
      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system">Bretton Woods system</a> started in 1944</li>
      <li>US was the world standard currency, with 50% of world currency value</li>
      <li>US went off gold standard in 1971</li>
      <li>US currency is now 10 to 15% of the world currency value</li>
      <li>No single national currency can serve as the reserve currency because global economy is too complex</li>
   </ol></li>
   <li>second 15 minutes:
   <ol>
      <li>most recent US recession started in 2007</li>
      <li>When the US economy is affected, closely tied countries are too</li>
      <li>Biggest problem with US economy is military spending</li>
      <li>25% of Americans are connected to military personally or via family members</li>
      <li>Military is only remaining pillar in the US</li>
      <li>Military employment is up; others are down</li>
      <li>unemployment is increasing, will be destabilizing by end of 2009</li>
      <li>Military will be asked to stabilize this.</li>
      <li>Military are already stationed domestically in US.</li>
      <li>Next depression will be worse than 1930s.</li>
   </ol></li>
   <li>next 15 minutes:
   <ol>
      <li>In February / March the US will default on its loans</li>
      <li>There will be no &quot;Obama Miracle&quot;</li>
      <li>The debt in the past months will be greater than can be conceivably repaid</li>
      <li>US will have to issue bonds payable in different currencies (as it did in late 1970s)</li>
      <li>September - December was the detonation of the crisis</li>
      <li>The fallout of the crisis will last years</li>
      <li>Ideas that the stimulus package will fix the economy in a few months are false</li>
      <li>Other big debt is social security / long-term unemployment</li>
      <li>Obama has a perfect plan, but it's too late</li>
      <li>key players in the economic plan caused it in the first place</li>
   </ol></li>
   <li>last 15 minutes:
   <ol>
      <li>Economy will crash in summer 2009</li>
      <li>there are many ways this could happen
      <li>US defaulting on its debt will cause a run from dollars</li>
      <li>(hurting some countries which have invested in dollars)</li>
      <li>Outcome of crisis has five key components:
      <ol>
         <li>50% decrease in standard of living for middle class by 2011</li>
         <li>collapse of significant public services</li>
         <li>Nationalization of capital-based pensions</li>
         <li>Massive unemployment at least 20%</li>
         <li>substantial devaluation of US dollar</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>US will not be able to pay pension to its old people</li>
      <li>Dollar will still be used within the US, but not useful outside US</li></li>
   </ol>
   </li>
</ol>
