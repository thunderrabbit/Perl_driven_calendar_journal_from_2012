<p>Went to an internet cafe in Shibuya, with basically a big bed instead of a seat.  We drank over
20 drinks and think we heard a couple having sex in a nearby booth.</p>

called sixteen things for Sara</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I choose not to spam all my friends with forwards, but I like to write about myself so I'll
do this for Sara!</p></li>

<li><p>I've never been to Colorado for more than a few hours. Actually I've never been to Colorado
at all! But I almost went to Four Corners one time.</p></li>

<li><p>Before moving to Japan, I decided to travel a bit around the United States; "might as well
see my own country before going around the world!" I drove 5000 miles in a loop east of Dallas, and
then 6000 miles in a loop west of Dallas.</p></li>

<li><p>Moved to Japan and it was really hard at first, but now I've found Tokyo to be easier place
to live than Houston, especially regarding transportation.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm sitting beside my brother Fred right now in an internet cafe in Shibuya.</p></li>

<li><p>After university, I worked as a programmer for some years, then shifted to teaching English
for a few years, which included sailing around the world on Peace Boat. Twice. Then broke my
shoulder and my bankbook in one fell swoop down a mountain and am now back to programming, but this
time in Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>My 2009 New Year's resolution is to have another art show.</p></li>

<li><p>I'd like to shift my income source from programming to creating art, giving massage,
counseling, reiki energy, and perhaps modeling.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to write a Rob Update and probably need to forget about capturing all the deets of my
past several months. Just send a happy 2009 note and be done with it.</p></li>

<li><p>I love sweets and tend to eat too many if they are laying around the house. Often at parties
I chow down on all the snacky food and feel a bit self conscious about it, but don't really
stop.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm going to a late Christmas / New Year 2009 party tomorrow at Genny with a G's house. We're
supposed to bring white elephant gifts, but I have no idea what I'll bring. Probably going to ドンキー
to get something. It's like a crazy cramped Wal-Mart of Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>Fred and I have been in this internet cafe for nearly 4 hours; we're gettin' ready to leave
and get some real food! Between us, we've had 21 drinks (small free ones).</p></li>

<li><p>I just added categories to all the images in Uncle Cow's website. Ready for 2009!</p></li>

<li><p>The dumbest thing I ever did was jump my dad's truck over some train tracks, where the street
went sorta-steeply up to cross at the level of the tracks. I realized it was stupid as we were in
the air, higher than the cars coming up the other side. Fortunately we were not *above* the
cars.</p></li>

<li><p>The smartest thing I ever did was start to meditate on a nearly daily basis. I hope I can
make it a more regular practice in my life.</p></li>

<li><p>I miss my cat Spot. I chose to leave him with my friend Jennifer in the US when I came to
Japan. I don't have any pets now, but I might like to get a cat. My girlfriend Ami is allergic to
cats though. And I can't have cats in my apartment. And I don't really want to take care of a cat,
but. You know. Maybe a robot cat if it was warm blooded and cuddly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We got some good white elephant gifts from ドンキー.  A nose shaper, some hot bath salt, and
almost got a 3000 yen gold tie, but I decided to just give one of my old ties instead of pay that
much.</p>

<p>Went to a sex-toy shop to see if they differed than the US (more bondage stuff, says Fred), and
then to an e-pimp place, cause I had never been inside before.
Wondered <a href="http://www.eve-group.com/">what I've been missing</a> (Not safe for work).</p>
