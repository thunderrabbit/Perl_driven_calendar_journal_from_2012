<p>Fred and I went to a Maid Cafe today.  Used <a href="http://gmap.jp/">gmap.jp</a> to find a cafe
near Akihabara Station.  The closest one I found was on the fifth floor on the ドンキホーテ
building.  Once we arrived, the girls we saw inside were, of course, wearing maid costumes.  We sat
down to wait for a seat, and were given an English information guide that said basically,
&quot;Welcome home, but don't take pictures; we'll take a picture for you if you want, or you can
play a game with your Maid!  Oh, and no touching the Maids, or we might kick you out.&quot;</p>

<p>I got a sorta spooked feeling about &quot;playing a game&quot; with our waitress.  What kind of
game?  Monopoly?  Charades?</p>

<p>We were seated by a girl with crazed hair sprouting from under her maid uniform hat.  She was
like, &quot;わわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわわ&quot;
as she flopped out some menus for us, and then we were left to pore over the menu which featured
over-priced spaghetti and over-priced desserts.</p>

<p>Fred noted with assurance, &quot;these prices are way too high.&quot;</p>

<p>Then we heard a bit of some clacking behind us and I turned around to see a customer
&quot;playing a game with his Maid&quot;  I was like, &quot;Fred Fred look.&quot;</p>

<p>Fred looked.  I looked.  He watched; I watched.  Game consisted of a <em>simplified</em> version
of Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.</p>

<p>&quot;Ready to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>And we left.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I tried later to explain <em>why</em> I couldn't stay.  Something about not seeing the point of
playing a game designed for 5 year olds as if it were a real game, in exchange for モエモエ coins,
which have no value.  wtf???</p>

<p>It's not like the girls dressed as maids really give a hoot about their customers, do they?  Do
the customers think they do?  Man; I just couldn't figure it out.</p>
