<p>Watched the first 20 minutes or so of The Escapist, and didn't want to watch much more.  I don't
like movies where people are specifically mean to people.  I can deal with war movies where good and
bad guys get shot from afar, but I just don't like what I guess would be called bullying.  Have
some good ol' respect for one another, and the world would be a nicer place to live.</p>
