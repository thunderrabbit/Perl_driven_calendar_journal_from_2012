<p class="dream">In a room, where perhaps I had been meditating, and a guru came in.  He looked like
an American.  I told him I was interested in having a guru, so that I could have the experience of
oneness with god.  I was like, &quot;yeah, I've done it a couple of times, but not
consistently,...&quot; and then I realized the truth that having done it *at all*, with no guru
instruction, was wonderfully beyond imagination and I just started to cry.</p>

<p class="dream">Crying crying for a moment, while the guru looked on with compassion, saying
nothing and letting the fullness of the moment complete itself.</p>

<p>Wow.  What a cool dream.  I haven't consciously recalled oneness with God, but perhaps this is
an interesting indication.</p>
