<p>Not sure if I can really get a good picture of this, but there are two ropes hanging from a
lever up on the transformer of a light pole near the East exit of Motosumiyoshi station.  Fred and
I are in a cafe called いーはとーぶ, where the waitress has the highest voice I've heard in a long
time.  Quietest yet highest pitch.  Amazing.</p>
