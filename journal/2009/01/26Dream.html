<p class="dream">I had been asked to research a list of nuns who were involved with something good,
and then those nuns started to be killed in mysterious manners.  I didn't know if my list was the
cause of their deaths, or if I needed to make my list faste to keep them alive.  I went upstairs
for a second, and then realized I had left my list downstairs, so I went down to get it before the
bad guys saw it.  A little kid came into the room and someone was like, &quot;hey you're too yong
to go in there!&quot; referring to our meeting, but the kid ignored her and came up to me and was
staring right at me.  I was told, &quot;he's  giving you energy; just be stil&quot; and I welcomed
his energy by holding out my hands.  He touched my hands to give more protection, and then he
climbed up onto me to give hugs.  He was like the size of a house cat, but basically just a head
like Mr Potatohead.</p>

<p class="dream">At my dad's childhood home, he was driving us soooper fast along the well paved
roads, jumping over other roads and fields as appropriate, all the while explaining how they had
driven like this all the time.  There was no other traffic.</p>

<p class="dream">In a shopping mall, there was a girl helping me..</p>

<p>not sure what... </p>
