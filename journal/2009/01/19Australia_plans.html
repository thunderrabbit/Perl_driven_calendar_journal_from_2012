<p>Plannin' to go to Australia in late August for Clairvision's ISIS 101 course.  I've done several
ISIS sessions, but this will be my first week long course.  Kevin has done it, and says it's pretty
great.</p>

<p>Ami called me, and she asked out of the blue if I wanna go to Australia.  I thought she had read
my journal at first, but then I realized I haven't even uploaded this file..  So I was like,
&quot;um, I'm planning to go in March!&quot;</p>

<p>I asked if she wants to go, but she's like, &quot;I can't meditate,&quot; blah blah, and I got a
bit annoyed at first, but then saw through her fear and explained that meditation is not a doing,
it's a being, and the doing part of the practice is easily explained.</p>

<p>I explained it over the phone and she felt better, and is considering going with me.  This could
be cool.</p>
