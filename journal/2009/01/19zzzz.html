<p>Today I drew a picture for Ami, and wrote a little letter-note on the back.  Didn't take a
picture of it.  Some things are best left unposted.  But I will post the letter to Ami soon.
Hopefully tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just a moment ago I added a label to my number on the door to our ward.  I'm number 304, and I
added the kanji for my name Ï©Éð and then ÌäÂê»ù, which means &quot;problem child&quot; or some
such.  I only know that because I have a bumper sticker from an artist
named <a href="http://mondaiji.com/">ÌäÂê»ù</a>, who I've seen perform at The Pink Cow twice.  He
does a song called Otaku Power, which I quite enjoy.</p>

<p>My internets are slow at the moment, or I'd try to find a link to the song.</p>

<p>OH, and I discovered today, the end of an era.  Francois' Facebook account has been disabled by
an administrator.  The good news: I don't gotta spend time as him online.  Bad news: I can't spend
time as him online.</p>

<p>Or can I?</p>

<p>I've been playing a strangely addicting game called <a href="http://trukz.com/">Trukz</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday I made a dentist appointment, and today I organized a time to meet with Mia to exchange
reiki for process work.  Not sure the deets of what she has to offer, but freestyle receiving goes
nicely with freestyle healing.</p>
