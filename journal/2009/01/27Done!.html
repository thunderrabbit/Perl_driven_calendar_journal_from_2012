<p>Simon and I took the third (last) taxi back to Tenmonkan, and talked a bit about skating.  He
skates &quot;everywhere&quot; in Kyoto, and a few times during the trial invited me a to visit.</p>

<p>He was tellin' me a story about his skating accident when we arrived, so I didn't get to hear the
end.  Zoom walked to ice cream and I grabbed four takoyakis and was eating them and ice cream and
talking to Ami as we needed to zoom back to the bus to make the early flight out of here.</p>

<p>I spent a few extra seconds watching a crowd including TV camera watching fire fighters empty
some brownish water from a small hydrant then headed after Simon toward the bus and heard him
calling me with his long &quot;oh&quot; Australian accent on my name.  &quot;Robe!  Robe!&quot; and
I hurried over, stuffed the final takoyaki bits into my mouth and swallowed then looked for a trash
can but found nothing, so looked pleadingly at the women at the ticket counter who took pity on
my situation and took the takoyaki trash.  Slurped a good bit of the ice cream to make sure I
wouldn't drip then got on the bus and wrote this.</p>
