<p>Fred and I are in Hirama station, headed to ultimate.  Had sortof a late start:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>woke up late</p></li>

<li><p>got ready slowly</p></li>

<li><p>couldn't find appropriate clothes</p></li>

<li><p>Fred forgot his wallet</p></li>

<li><p>waited on the wrong platform as the correct train left from the other side</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But,</p>

<p>As a result, we've inadvertantly waited for Ami!</p>

<p class="date">2:16pm JST</p>

<p>So, now we three (me, Ami, and Fred) are on Nambu line headed to ultimate.</p>
