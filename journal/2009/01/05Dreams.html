<p class="dream">In a neighborhood semi-near my house, my host was like, &quot;that's Bill Gate's
house, as we went by a small old house that was certainly bigger than my room, but not as big as
either of the houses I lived in the US.  It was two stories, but like one room per story, and had
some kind of grating around it to protect him from fans, stalkers, and ill wishers.</p>

<p class="dream">As we were half a block away, he came out, and his back was all hunched over like
he had gotten old, and he used his arms as much as his feet to climb outside and to the next room
over.  We went back to where he had gone in to a pub or something, and he was riding a unicycle
inside because that was easier on his back.  The unicycle stayed mostly upright, but sometimes he
would lean way back or upright, as he rolled around the area.  He was among other Microsoft
employees, and they ignored his mode of transportation.  I wondered about approaching him with the
offer of reiki energy, and I began to wake up from my dream.</p>

<p class="dream">Upon realizing it was a dream, I was like, &quot;no worries,&quot; and dropped all
social protocol and went right up to Bill Gates and was like, &quot;I'm going to guide some reiki
energy to you,&quot; and placed my hands on his lower back.  He responded positively immediately,
and I just stayed with him, thinking I should tell him that the reiki energy wasn't coming *from*
me, but just *through* me, and then his unicycle rolled backwards and I just stayed behind him and
went back until we bammed against a shelf in a grocery store.  Something fell off the shelf behind
us and then toppled in an arc over us and smashed onto the floor: a bottle of liquor.  A square
bottle, so probably whiskey.  I ignored the bottle and a couple of pieces of glass that had slightly
penetrated my feet, and just stayed there with my hands on Bill Gates' back.</p>

<p class="dream">People started to clean up the glass, and I pulled the two pieces out of my feet
and tossed them into the piles.  Bill Gates said the reiki energy was wonderful and started to head
out the door; I followed him and a woman handed me a broom so I could help clean up the glass.  I
told her I would be right back, and went outside and then realized it was a dream, so I intended for
the glass to be cleaned up; I never went back to clean it up myself, I just used dream-magic to
clean it up.</p>

<p>The next dream I don't remember.</p>

<p>But the dream after that:</p>

<p class="dream">Fred and I were cleaning up my room on a whim; it was about that time, so we were
moving stuff around and sweeping and cleaning.  He folded up his bed and moved the clothes hanging
partition outside the room and I swept up dust and hair and before I could finish, he had unfolded
his bed on the other side of the room.  I was like, &quot;oh, I still need to sweep that area,&quot;
and I started to sweep under the bed, and then he was like, &quot;aight, I'm going out to buy
another train pass..&quot; and I was like, &quot;what??  why?&quot; and he goes, &quot;I lost my
wallet,&quot; and I realized the cleanup should have turned up the wallet.  I looked over at him to
see if he was joking, and his expression of sadness mixed with しょうがないい (sp), plus trying to
keep a cheerful outlook on life and not cry, I was like, &quot;ohhh!&quot; and dropped the broom to
hug him.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was like, &quot;hey, this is a dream..&quot; and woke up.</p>

<p>I saw that my room was still a mess, and his wallet is right by his bed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I remember part of the previous dream now.</p>

<p class="dream">On a hill in a new area, that was well-trafficked with carts and cars, a river at
the bottom and nothing at the top, and some guys offered me some pot, and I was like, &quot;no
thanks!&quot; and headed to find some new friends.</p>
