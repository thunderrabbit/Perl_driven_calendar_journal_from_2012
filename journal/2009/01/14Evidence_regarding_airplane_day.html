HI John

Thank you for your hard work at researching and writing your reports.  I've been on your mailing
list since I met Erik Leaver on Peace Boat in 2005.

In the article titled "<a href="http://www.fpif.org/fpifzines/wb/5788">Lame Legacy</a>," after reading the biting commentary, I was surprised to see
your agreement with the official story on the WTC.

Can you point me to some evidence that the Bush administration "failed to prevent" the attacks?

I'll freely admit I'm only an armchair researcher with no budget, but when I l look at WTC 7
collapsing 8 hours after the first two towers suddenly exploded, I know the planes were not what
caused the towers to fall.

The Journal of 9/11 Studies (<a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/">http://www.journalof911studies.com/</a>) offers many fine, peer-reviewed
papers that indicate the official version of the WTC story is false.

Thank you for helping people understand the truth.

     Peace
     - Rob

Dear Rob:

Thanks for your note. On the issue of the Bush administration failing to prevent 9/11, there are
several useful books and articles on the failures of the FBI to follow promising leads and the
failure of Bush and other top staff to heed the warnings of Richard Clarke, in particular.

I appreciate the efforts of those who challenge the received wisdom on the World Trade Center
collapse. But I don't find the arguments persuasive. There simply is no reason for the government to
engineer the collapse of the twin towers or any other building after the planes hit. As for those
who argue that no planes hit the towers or the Pentagon, that just doesn't wash either given all the
eyewitness accounts. And the supposed failures of the U.S. military to intercept the planes? Simply
shock and incompetence. In these cases, I find the plausible explanations suffice and the
implausible explanations ornate and baroque.

all the best,
John
