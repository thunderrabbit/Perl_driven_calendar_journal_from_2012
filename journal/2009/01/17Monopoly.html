<p>Just finished a game of Monopoly with 6 players total, plus some extended rules that started with
John offering to go halfsies with me on Park Place and Boardwalk.  He had bought the former, and I
had bought Boardwalk.  That started a chain of other partnerships, with people giving the third card
in a series, to receive 20% and of the rent of others, plus free passage on the properties, etc.
For $200, I sold one of the railroads to Eugene who had two railroads on the condition that I would
only pay him $50 if I landed on any of his RRs, even if he got the 4th one, which he did soon
enough.</p>

<p>I made out well on that deal, and when people landed on Boardwalk or Park Place, things were
good (had a hotel on there and getting 50% of the rent ain't too shabby)..  but when people hit
hotels on other people's properties, they were getting wiped out, including me (fourth player out of
the game), and Eugene ended up winning, having like $6000 cash and most of the properties on the
game, which had been given to him in lieu of rent.</p>

<p>I enjoyed laugh-laugh-laughing during the game.</p>
