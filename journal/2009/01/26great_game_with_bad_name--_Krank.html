<p>I searched for &quot;mac games&quot; on Google and came upon a site called thriftmac, and
selected several games whose descriptions sounded more like puzzle games than 1st person
shooters.</p>

<p>In that list were some duds, and one diamond with a dud name:
&quot;<a href="http://www.thriftmac.com/krank">Krank</a>&quot;</p>

<pre>
    The name &quot;krank&quot; is probably the last I would pick for this beautiful
    game. Perhaps &quot;spheres&quot; or &quot;gentle dreamland&quot; would be more appropriate.

    Super-kudos to the authors for making a meditative game that rewards
    patience and gentle game play.

    The graphics are beautiful and creative, with subtle clues describing 
    how to play.

    A lovely soundtrack with customized gameplay sounds to match each 
    level deserves five of five stars.
