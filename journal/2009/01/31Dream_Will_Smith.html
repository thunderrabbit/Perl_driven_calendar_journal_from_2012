<p class="dream">I came across Will Smith's phone number, printed in relatively large letters on a
wall in the house where I moved in.  After some deliberation, I called the number and he answered in
a sleepy voice.  Dang.  Quietly, I was like, &quot;Will?&quot; and wondering what I was gonna say.
He didn't really respond, so I go, &quot;Will?&quot; again and maybe again and then, &quot;I'm sorry
for waking you up, but I just wanted to say I really like your music, and I've been listening since
He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper..&quot; Still not much response, so I started rapping song lyrics from
the album.  &quot;we went to the studio, then we made a video; didn't make a movie though, maybe the
next year or so, yo, I gotta message for all my fans and friends, the next album was dope y'all, and
here we go again!&quot; and I realized I said 'next' instead of 'last' but just finished out the
line in hopes that he wouldn't notice.  I got a bit of a more positive reaction, so I tried a
different song, &quot;dooo dooo doo dooooooooo bududududum Now I've gotta story that I'd like to
tell, about a guy you know he had me scared as hell!  He had rips in his shirt and veins in his
teeth, everyone knew he said his name was Keith!&quot; I knew I was on the wrong track there, but
Will laughed again, so I was feeling a bit more relaxed, and was like, &quot;so I just want to thank
you for your music and inspirational living, going for your dreams and living a clean life and
everything; that's really cool.  I know it may just be the public persona, but I see you as genki
all the time, so I somehow guessed you'd be awake at 9am.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He answered back, &quot;well thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I went outside and was telling him about the old neighborhood where he used to
live, and then I saw a woman skating up on high heels with single roller skate wheels in the
front.  She could lean back on her heel to stop or lean forward a bit to go.  &quot;omigosh, Will;
I'm looking at some roller skate high heels.&quot;  He was like, &quot;really?&quot; and I go,
&quot;do you want a picture?&quot; and he's like, &quot;yeah, that would be cool,&quot; and then he
changed his mind, &quot;ah, nah, don't worry about it; I'm sure I'll see them when they become
popular,&quot; but I was like, &quot;well *I* want a picture, hahhahaha I'm just lookin' for my
camera here.&quot; and found my camera then went back outside and realized I wouldn't be able to
keep the photos cause this was a dream.</p>

<p>Oh snap, if the camera is a dream, then talking to Will Smith must also be a dream.  Dang.
Well, at least I didn't wake him up at 9am.</p>
