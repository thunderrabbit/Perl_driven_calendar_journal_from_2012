<p>After a great conversation with Carrie via facebook chat, catching up on 10 years of
incommunicado, I met Ami in Shibuya at Hachiko and then Maruan and then Kyoko, and we all went to
Bikini for a few expensive bites to eat and then to Krispy Kreme for a few sweet bites to eat after
visiting JD, Juvenile Delinquent.</p>

<p>During the night, I was a bit different-acting towards Ami, and she picked up on it, and called
me as I was arriving home.  &quot;How is our relationship?&quot;</p>

<p>That was at 11:30pm.  Basically 3 hours spent on the phone with me saying I don't want to work
very hard to communicate, though I think communication is quite important in a relationship.  And
that I don't want to change Ami, but I don't want her to drink nor watch TV.  And I don't want to
live with her, but I want to move to another country.  And though I don't want to throw away our
relationship outright, I'd like to take a break.  She says she can't do that, so asked that we
continue.  I'm pretty sure that was not my cue to say &quot;okay,&quot; which I did, okay?
Probably should have said sorry charlie, but didn't.  This situation reminds me a lot of my last
months (and by last months I mean last 18 months) with Hitomi.</p>

<p>I was going to name this entry DD, for Delightful (conversation with Carrie) and Dreadful
(conversation with Ami), but I used GG, writing &quot;Great&quot; for Carrie and not being able to
remember what word I had chosen for Ami.... Oh.. wrong letter.</p>
