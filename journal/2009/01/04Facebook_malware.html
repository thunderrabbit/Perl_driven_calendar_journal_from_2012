<p>Got a message from my friend Sally (not Sally (no longer) in Cali (who's becoming an Aussie), but
Sally West) on Facebook.</p>

<pre>
Have you known that your pictures are all over humhide dot com-take a look
</pre>

<p>I was suspicious immediately, but curious enough to put fake login information on the site; where
it said, &quot;ENTER YOUR FULL NAME,&quot; I put something like, &quot;Wilbur Flanigan&quot; and
where it said, &quot;ENTER YOUR EXACT EMAIL ADDRESS&quot; I put like,
&quot;monkey.butt@facebook.tv&quot; Then it asked me to select where I got the message.  I clicked
&quot;facebook&quot; and it didn't do anything useful (&quot;we don't service Facebook
accounts,&quot; or some BS.  So basically they are trying to get passwords to people's email
accounts.</p>
