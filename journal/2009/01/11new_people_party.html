<p>Had a welcoming party for Kirk, Manuel, and Bastian, though Bastian didn't arrive until after
the party finished.  He and Ami ended up chatting and drinking until not so long ago.  Though Ami
and I had planned for a little romp, I sent her home because she was drunk.  Not even slightly
attractive to me.</p>

<p>I'll openly admit I'm a bit envious of Bastian's quad-linguality (Dutch, English, German,
Japanese, Korean) (of the last two, I don't know which he says he can't really speak, but one of
them he can), but I'm pretty sure *that*'s not the reason I sent Ami home.</p>

<p>Ami called me to say she'd be here at 5pm instead of 2pm.  She was gonna hang up, but I offered
that I was sad to have sent her home, but I just wasn't turned on by drunkenness.  She assured me
she wasn't, blah blah, but in a way that reminded me of drunk conversations from Hitomi.  Not a
good start, but then she got to something interesting and told me how her dad has been acting like
an ass ever since her mom died.  (so yes, I understand he's sad, but acting like an ass will only
disperse the family more.)  I listened for as long as she wanted to talk, and understood about half
of it.  I'm glad she's able to get some of it out.</p>
