<p>This was the night we had I-group at Takeshi's house, the first I-group after his wife's death.
He told us his experience in the last ten days.  She had a heart attack while they were skiing, and
then the difficulty of telling his kids who were waiting in the hotel at the time.</p>

<p>&quot;All last week, her body was right here in this room...&quot;</p>

<p>Hm!  Right where we were sitting.</p>

<p>Showed his kids a technique for calling her spirit when they want to have a chat, and how to
send her back up when they're done.   Basically just a placebo, I think, but.</p>

<p>After Takeshi went, I talked about my concerns with planning stuff.  It was pointed out that
though leaving Houston was difficult, I think it was the right choice.  And I may be making the
right choice again by leaving Japan.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Dubai, here I come?</p>

<p>My basic problem with Ami is that I want her to change.  Less drinking, and no TV.</p>
