<p>Back in Shibuya after the art store, Fred wanted to take a video of Shibuya crossing so we did
that on the way to getting some お好み焼き.  I had just one hour, but the timing worked out fine so
we got a ぶたやき which Fred fashioned into a smiley face, a nice throwback from back in the day
when he would ask me repeatedly to draw an &quot;eyes eyes nose mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm on the 山の手 line now about to arrive in 品川, where I'll take the blue line to 大森 and
meet Michael at 6:30.  Fortunately I'll meet him because I forgot the instructions on my desk.</p>
