<p class="dream">With my I-group at 9pm, I realized I was supposed to meet them at like 4pm or so,
and appalled at myself for having forgotten.  We were standing in a tunnel entrance when I suddenly
realized and my face winced with &quot;oh man...&quot; and I told them I had missed the previous
meeting time, as if they didn't know</p>

<p class="dream">Near a small rickety wooden boat in the desert, I witnessed it being dragged to the
sea, where an old clothes wearin' guy got in with intention of being chosen to sail on a big old
timey ship.  I watched the selection of crew from an elevated vantage point and then was on the ship
as it was leaving.  I saw a woman despised by everyone and called her to my window and noted how
beautiful she was.  Told her to kiss me and get undressed on climb into the window as the ship was
leaving.  She did it and we did it and then I was looking for a place to sleep, but we were up too
late so everything was taken.  But then some people started waking up so I was able to sleep.</p>
