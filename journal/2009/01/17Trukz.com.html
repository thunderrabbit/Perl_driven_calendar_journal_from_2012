<p>Saw a note on slashdot for a web version of Zork, coming soon to an internet near you.  It's not
on the internets yet, but <a href="http://www.trukz.com/driver_display.asp?ID=1083872">trukz</a>
is.  I drove a couple of routes.  Kinda boring so far, but maybe I'll play it a bit more when I
figure out how.</p>
