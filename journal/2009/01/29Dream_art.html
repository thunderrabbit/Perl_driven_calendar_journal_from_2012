<p class="dream">Showed my art to her and the guy started flipping through the pieces like, &quot;oh
and look at this one&quot; and &quot;oh and&quot; and &quot;look what happened&quot; and &quot;and
this one&quot; and was flipping trhough the pieces faster than I could appraise them myself, but
making approval comments that he loved each of them.  Basically they included oil and marker with
the oil in blends, and lots of white space, cause most of the pieces were ntot finished.  And I was
like, &quot;oh and there are more&quot; cause I had forgotten to get the bigger ones, and when I
went to get them, I overheard the guy talking to the woman, &quot;okay, tell him that the guy who
looked at his art was going to look at the rest, but he killed himself, and all that.  Buy this
piece, but don't buy the others yet, but make sure he has enough money to get started.  Keep an eye
on him because the public is not ready for his style yet, but they will be; he's ahead of his time
and a visionary.  This work is the best I've seen in all my time appraising art.&quot;</p>

<p>and I woke up gently like, &quot;BEST DREAM EVER!!!&quot;</p>

<p>While watching him flip through the pictures, I definitely saw colors in my dream (though many
of them were greeen).</p>
