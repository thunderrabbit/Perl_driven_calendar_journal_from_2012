<p>Fred and I are back at Fuji-Q Highland, after our aborted trip some years ago.  4 years ago, now
I guess.  This time, we got into the park!  But, the attractions we came to ride are not running,
due to snow and high winds.  Though the snow already fell, and the high winds must be really gentle,
or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, we did Zola 7, then the audio-ghost house next to it, and then skipped the tea cups
(Fred wants bumper tea cups) on the way to where we are now (in the maze game that janette and I
played multiple times until we won), but we got sidetracked at the coffin-ride haunted house
thing.  (mostly audio, with some shaking, a bit of water, and a faces jumping up out of the coffins
in front of us.)</p>

<p>That mountain ride is a different setup; it appears that we can't cheat it like janette and I
did to win last time we played over and over until we won.  (That was fun.)  Then we saw a water
ride (4 people per innertube boat, with glass sides to keep us from getting very wet).  While we
waited in line, ドドンパ started running, so we bolted out of line (to Ami's chagrin?) and jumped
into the ドドンパ line as test rides were being run.  While we waited in line, they announced that
the ride didn't meet safety specs, so it wouldn't be carrying any human cargo for now.  Gah.</p>

<p>Now we're at a burger place; Fred's refusing to eat cause he refuses to give Fuji-Q any more
money.</p>

<p>And now we're on the train headed home.  Pretty much a wasted trip to Fuji-Q.  Ah well.</p>
