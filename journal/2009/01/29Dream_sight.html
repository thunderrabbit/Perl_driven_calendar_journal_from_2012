<p>On a whim, I wore my Mindfold and earplugs when I went back to sleep after my previous dream.</p>

<p class="dream">Though wearing my Mindfold, I could see perfectly!  Using non-visual perception, I
had a working view of the world and could navigate with ease.  I told a woman this and explained
that I could see she was wearing a swim suit.  I pointed out the colors I could see (blue stripes
on white) and she giggled a bit, perhaps because my reality differed from hers.</p>

<p class="dream">Moving down a street, I could easily navigate my bicycle though I was
blindfolded.  So great to reliably use esp when manuevering!</p>
