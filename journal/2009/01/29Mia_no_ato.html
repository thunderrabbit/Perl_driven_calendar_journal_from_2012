<p>Chillin' on Inokashira Line in Kichijoji after an awesome session with Mia.  We had planned to do
an exchange as mentioned above, but things ended up with me working on her (reiki, massage,
listening) for 1.6 hours, leaving not really enough time to do the other half of the exchange.</p>

<p>This felt fine.  I couldn't really fathom switching to patient mode, and thought it better if her
mind could just relax after melting gently into the universe.  Even though I imagined I'd love to
talk about relationship concerns, etc, once I sat meditatively in her grounded room, I was in total
reiki offering mode and happily stayed in that energy for the remainder of the time.</p>
