<p>We're into the second week, and days full of not much to do.  So today I watched 5 (five) of the
Apple Developer Connection vids on the iPhone (actually XCode 3.1 apparently).  Pretty good stuff I
think, but I'll need to have a PC that can run it and an iPhone would help as well.</p>

<p>Took a shower with Ami on the phone with me.  Hot water and chat about similar topics.</p>

<p>Simon is busily drawring images for his Humphrey book.  Should be good.  The pics are pretty dope.</p>

<p>Oh, and I've been playing the strangely addicting game
called <a href="http://www.trukz.com/">Trukz</a>, a truck driving simulation.  Right now in the
game I'm e-driving some e-books to an e-city with a real city's name: Yucca Mountain, where I'll
e-swap the e-books for some e-rocks and e-deliver to e-Toronto for our e-contract.  But actually I'm
e-sleeping in the game by not playing it, and then my e-driver will have some e-energy and be able
to safely e-drive again.</p>

<p>Right now I'm going to do some real sleeping.</p>

<p>Dinner was yummy.  Salad, spaghetti with beef stew, plain french bread, some clear glass noodle
soup, and a sweet white pudding stuff with big juicy tasteless blueberries.  Mmmm mmmm.</p>
