<p>On the way home from the United to End Racism pre-course introduction thing led by a woman named
Emma, for her first time, and for the first time in English in Japan.</p>

<p>The basic premise as I understand so far: through intentional listening of others in the group,
we can get to understand our similarities while releasing emotional blocks.  It seems quite similar
to my men's group except that UER is co-gender (actually biased towards women in our group) and
focuses a bit on resolving -isms in our world: racism, genderism, wealthism, ageism, religism,
etcism.</p>

<p>I can't likely come to all the classes (there are 11 others scheduled, all the way out to June),
but I'll come next week and to the next after that.  After that, I may be working for OM in Yokohama
on weekends.</p>
