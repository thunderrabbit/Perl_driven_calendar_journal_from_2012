<p>Thank goodness Mia called; I had totally forgotten about our meeting cause for some reason it's
not in my calendar...  Eeek!  Basically I'm just in time to meet her at 1:30 at 31.</p>

<p>Mia and I will be trading reiki-massage (from me for her) for somethin'-process-psychology (from
her for me).</p>
