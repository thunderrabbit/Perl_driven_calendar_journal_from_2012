I believe we can find out the truth.  The internet allows unprecedented ability for grassroot
organization of like-minded people.  I think we need to keep asking for the truth, encouraging our
friends to open their minds and search for the truth themselves.

After getting your comment, I did a bit more searching and found a video called September Clues.  It
focuses on the discrepancies between the TV channels, and oddities of the broadcasts themselves.

Thank you for respectfully challenging me to show you some evidence.  The video above may or may not
convince you, but that doesn't matter, so long as we don't give up our search.

Because we have the internet, we can accelerate the timeline by which this fraud comes exposed.  We
are not alone in our quest for the truth.  In honor of your friend, keep searching; keep talking.
I'll do the same.
