<p>On the train now, headed back home.  We took a short excursion down into the ÉûÅÔ¿´Àþ, and I
showed Fred the platform over the tracks which will soon be the extension of my Tokyu Toyoko
Line.  (yes, mine.)</p>

<p>Fred was impressed that the dude at the gate let us in so easily after I was like, &quot;can we
just look at the line?&quot; and he was all, &quot;just look?&quot; &quot;yep.&quot; and he let us
in.  Sometimes I love Japan.</p>

<p>And we just looked and took some pictures and got a woman to take our picture and headed back
out.  Good times.</p>

<p>I had to whiz, so when we got to my line (up the escalator I hadn't yet used), we went to the
midpoint on the line and down to the loo.  I expelled probably 10 CCs per second for 30 or more
seconds, but ain't sure how one could reliably measure the volume per second.</p>

<p>I hope the clinical trial requires us to collect all our urine so we can have a whizzing
contest.  I doubt it will happen that way, but.</p>
