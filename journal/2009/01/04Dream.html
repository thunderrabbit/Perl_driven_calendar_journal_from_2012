<p class="dream">Back at home with janette, I was helping cook in the big kitchen and i kept asking
questions about her counter.  &quot;Can we use the counter as a cutting board?&quot; &quot;No.  Use
a cutting board, please.&quot; and then &quot;Can we put hot things on the counter?&quot; as I put a
hot thing on her counter, and it immediately melted the counter a bit, and janette took a deep
breath like to keep herself from getting angry, and said gently, &quot;noot things cannot go on the
counter.&quot; and I felt so bad, because I had obviously marred her beloved countertop, and she use
a big knife to slice of the part that had been melted.  I felt really bad and sulked a bit and
apologized.  janette said it was okay, but I told her no, &quot;I should have known better; I knew
all these things, but I forgot.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">But then she said, &quot;no really; it's okay; I'm glad you're back.&quot; and
that helped me feel a lot better.  So I smiled a cheeky grin through my tears, &quot;can I change
my oil on your counter?&quot; and she goes, &quot;sure.&quot; in a funny sarcastic voice.  And I
go, &quot;Can I bring my pet walrus to play on your counter?&quot; and she goes, &quot;he's already
here, on the counter!&quot;  and I was so happy to be happily joking with janette.</p>
