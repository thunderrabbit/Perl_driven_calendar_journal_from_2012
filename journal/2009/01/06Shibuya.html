<p>Have been chillin' in Shibuya for a couple of hours of computerin' with Fred after a few hours of
computerin' with Fred at my house.  We're in Denmark Cafe, watching the walking fashion parade
below.  Have also been watching bored sales staff play fighting outside their largely ignored shop.
They're also doing plenty of yelling sales pitches, but they (the pitches) don't seem to be
working.</p>

<p>Ami has just arrived and we'll be headed to ultimate soon, my first ultimate on a weeknight in Japan.</p>

<p class="date">1:12am JST</p>

<p>Wow!  Weeknight ultimate was quite fun!  We played with a different set of rules: basically play
*never* stops.  If a point is made, the other team grabs the disc at the point and just starts the
other direction.  No time wasted setting up and such.  I loved it!</p>

<p>Went to a pub in Ebisu afterward.  I walked barefoot as Ami wore my shoes.  Her high heels had
hobbled her from walking very quickly, but when she put on my crocs, she was like &quot;whooo
whooo!!&quot; making train noises and quickly scuffing to catch up.  She was much faster, but
couldn't really walk naturally cause they were too big for her feet, but anyway, she was cute.</p>

<p>At the pub, I put my stuff down across from where Hitomi put her stuff down, not realizing she
didn't intend to *sit* there, but just put her stuff there.  Fred put his stuff down at the big
table, intending to *sit* there, but someone else was in the place by the time he got back.  Ami,
Fred and I ended up at our own table while the rest of the group rowdily enjoyed the big table.
Interesting to watch my brain feel like an outcast, but then I tried to just focus on Ami and Fred
as if we were there alone.</p>

<p>Took the Hibiya Line to Nakameguro and Toyoko Line to Motosumiyoshi.</p>
