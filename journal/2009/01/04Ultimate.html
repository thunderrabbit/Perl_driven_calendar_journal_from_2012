<p>So glad that Ami played ultimate today!  I had her come toss with us, and then coerced her onto
the field during the game.  Basically I coached her while I covered her very gently.  Genny with a
G was like, &quot;you just want to cover her because you have a crush on her.&quot; and I was all,
&quot;don't tell anyone!&quot;</p>

<p>Played ultimate until dark, and now sitting between Ami then Fred then Ben on my left, and Jei
then Niji then Doug on my right.  Also present is Hitomi (hasn't seated herself yet), and soon Shag
will come.</p>

<p>On Tokyu Toyoko line now with Fred; took the Oimachi Line with Jei and Ben from 企灰短李 to 极统が抵 
and sent Ami to her bicycle via Denentoshi Line to Nambu Line via Musashi-Mizonokuchi (sp)
station.</p>
