<p>&quot;Do you have contacts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Today would be a good day to wear them.&quot;</p>

<p>But when Fred got his contacts out, the contact solution looked discolored (yellow) so he went
to his backup pair.  Pulled them out of their sealed blister packs and one of them was dryer than a
block of ice.  Soaked it and its partner in solution; hopefully they'll be hydrated by the time we
go to the onsen tonight.</p>
