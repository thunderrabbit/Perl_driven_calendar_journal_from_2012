<p>Just got back from a heavy shopping day from みなとみらい to 日本大通り to 川崎 by way of a
transfer in 横浜.  The day was heavy cause I carried my computer, two of Fred's books, plus Ami's
erasers cause she and Fred both collect erasers.</p>

<p>Fulfilled our plan of buying Japanese puzzle boxes near 大さんばし, and bicycle handlebar covers
in 川崎.  Also bought some kitchen supplies and other shiz.</p>

<p>Soon it's shower time for me and then party time for new peeps in 元住吉桜ハウス。</p>

<p>Oh!  Took neat pictures today as well.  I'll upload them sometime.</p>

<p class="note">(written 2 days afterward)</p>

<p>Because we had taken the Ltd Express train, we got off in みなとみらい and walked to
somethin'-somethin' park (Shinbashi?), by way of stopping for some foodage near the chrome
roller-coaster-lookin' sculpture nestled between two buildings that overlook Cosmo World.</p>

<p>We didn't watch a performer's entire show.  He started out all in black, sitting on a chair and
slowly walked around the chair, slowly adding feet to his costume.  He walked around twice, lowering
an extra foot each time, and then was taking too long just playing with the feet, slowly dancing
them in various ways, and crossing four legs in various ways.  We were on a mission, so we gave him
the boot and hoofed onward.</p>

<p>Enjoyed watching the construction as we walked across a bridge that used to pass the Muscle
Musical show (not sure where it's moved since then, though I think I've seen its new home and just
forgotten..  oh it's near Yoyogi Park, I think.).  They're cleaning up the area around the wharf,
basically to bring more customers and money to the area.  Ami concluded that the new wharf shape is
that of an elephant, though I can only see an elephant trunk.  Fred said, &quot;it's art, Ted. If
you're not stretchin', it's not art.&quot;</p>

<p>Made it to the visitor center across from Shinbashi Park and Fred spent some time (30 mins?)
looking at Japanese puzzle boxes and some other craftily fashioned wooden objects: pencil holders,
business card holders, book place-holders, and lien holders (j/k).</p>

<p>I got a bit mad at Ami for not refusing nor even giving back the Yokohama City Tourist guides she
was given by an old woman behind the counter.  Three copies, plus three pages, all wasted.  Gah.</p>

<p>Headed to 川崎 from 日本お踊り station, switching from みなとみらい line to 東海道線 in 横浜。
There, we visited Lazona to get some bike handlebar handle covers for Fred.  He had to get ones
designed for motorbikes to fit his handlebar shape, but they look like they'll work just fine.  I
certainly hope they do, and I hope he loves them; Ami had been like, &quot;no way!  don't get
those!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;cause they're not cool.&quot;</p>

<p>Haha, well they don't exist in Austin, so they'll be cool when he's the only one who's got
'em.</p>

<p>Ended up getting a few other items, including some bath salts with fire and lava drawn on the
front, and some kitchen utensils of a non-metallic variety which pass the Rob-test for use on metal
and non-stick pans.</p>

<p>Skipped out on getting a three hundred dollar trash can which has a handle for grating organic
trash into bits for use in compost.</p>
