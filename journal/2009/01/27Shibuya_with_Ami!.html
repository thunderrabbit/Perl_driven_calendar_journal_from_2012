<p>Met Ami in Shibuya near Hachiko around 7pm after she finished work.  Interesting that we said
we'd meet in Shibuya, but didn't specify the dog.  I guess Hachiko is our official meeting spot.</p>

<p>Got some foodage at the 7-plates-minimum ≤Û≈æ§∫§∑ shop, which was continually packed with people
on stools and fish filets on mounds of rice, riding around the track on little maroonish plates.</p>

<p>With tummies full of delicious tuna, salmon, and whatever Ami ate, we wandered through Labi; I
wondered if they'd have any good prices on iPhones, and if I could see the latest Macs.  There were
iPhones (16 and 32 gigs (or was it 8 and 16?)) but no laptops on the ground floor so we left out the
front door without going up the stairs to higher levels.</p>

<p>Out the front door, and turn 90 degrees to the left, then immediately turn lefter than 90
degrees to the left again and up a little street to a shop.... right next to the back door of
Labi!   &quot;Ah! I shoulda remembered this from when I came here with Fred and saw the same
thing!&quot;  I'll remember next time. </p>
