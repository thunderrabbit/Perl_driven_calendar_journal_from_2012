<p>Good times at Oedo Onsen.  Ami and I kept the plan from Fred so it could be a surprise for him.
He figured it out once we were in the locker rooms.  During our first venture into the bath area, he
and I shaved.  They offered free razors so I gave myself a goatee cause I've never done it before.
We chilled (warmed) in a few of the baths, and got progressively hotter until I nearly passed out.
Was outside on a bench at the time, so I just lay down in the cool night air until I felt clear.</p>

<p>Then we went to the central area and chowed some chow, and Fred got a ラムネ after I got one,
but his had mildew inside the cap.  Ewww!  I tried to take it back to the guy, but his answer was,
開けない！ hahaha I guess this ain't Amerika.</p>

<p>Near the end of our meal, Ami noticed that I had shaved.</p>

<p>Back into the bath area, and this time I visited the 82 degree C sauna area for 4 minutes.  Hot.</p>

<p>Ice cream after that and then our time was up; we had to catch the 9:30pm bus back to 品川.</p>
