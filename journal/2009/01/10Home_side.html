<p>We're back on the home side of town, as in, we're back at my place.  Ami is zonked on my bed.
Fred is zonked on his bed.  I'm downstairs in the kitchen going to work on the flash game for
chatforest.</p>

<p>Just met Locohama (not his real name) who moved into recently.  Finally, another American!  He's
also a writer, so we have that in common, too.  His blog
is <a href="http://goinglocoinyokohama.wordpress.com/">Loco in Yokohama</a>.  I haven't read much
yet, but he's written a book in addition to his bloggin', and wants to write another.</p>
