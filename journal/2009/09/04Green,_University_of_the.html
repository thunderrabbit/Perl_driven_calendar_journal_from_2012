HI

Thank you for supporting the greening of our earth!

I'd like to make three suggestions to your system if I may.

First, the return address of the email I received below is from admin@universitygreen.com On quick
glance, that does *not* appear to be a domain you guys own.

Second, if I'm logged in, I still see the "Enroll" tab as the first on the left.  Seems to me that I
shouldn't be able to enroll if I'm already enrolled (and logged in).

Third, I recommend you do *not* store passwords in plaintext.  No modern website should store
passwords in plaintext.  Don't send passwords to users over email.  If users forgot their password,
send to their email address a link that allows choosing a new password.  You should store the
passwords with MD5 encryption and compare the MD5 of their entered password with the one stored in
your DB.

Also, it's not because you emailed my password that I know you store it in plain text.  It's because
your system only allows 10 characters for a password!  Ten?  Ten?  Come on.  I use
<a href="http://supergenpass.com">http://supergenpass.com</a> for my passwords, and my master password is longer than ten characters.

You should allow *any* length of password (truncate it at 100 chars if you're afraid of injection
attacks), then store a 32 byte MD5 of their password.

Change it now before you get a ton of users.

   Peace
   - Rob
