<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I have alarms set on my iPhone: every day: 6am &quot;Rock Hop!&quot; 6:45am &quot;'mon
back&quot; 23:00 &quot;Athlete's toe&quot; 23:59 &quot;Go to sleep right now&quot; Weekdays: 7:45
&quot;rubbish&quot; 19:00 &quot;Go home (or set Working On)&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>I don't heed most of them immediately, but they help me keep a bit of a consistent
schedule.</p></li>

<li><p>Working in a small company with Alfonzo and Nate; they are funny.  MySql and PHP to make
websites.</p></li>

<li><p>Though I've not yet been paid by my new company, when I get paid (10 September), it will be
(25它边 + monthly train pass (2.7它)), which is more than I was making at my old company (77Hz) (15它
边 + monthly pizza party (~0.15它))</p></li>

<li><p>Just last night got a call from Kumi, my mate from meditation back couple years ago..
(dang!) and found out she's going to OZ for 6 months on the exact trip that I *want<del>ed</del>*
to go on, but find myself obligated here to work and Cow Go.  Sigh.  Sigh sigh sigh.</p></li>

<li><p>Soness will be back home tomorrow!  She's been out of town since August 10th in OZ on her
own amazing self-growth adventure with Avatar.  I'm looking forward to hearing tons of stories!</p></li>

<li><p>I need to write to Kana to say I can teach her on Fridays now that Gen has pretty much
cancelled (he wants lessons, but not at a time that I can teach).</p></li>

<li><p>I've been living in the living room (makes sense, hey!) of Chez Soness in Chigasaki for a
bit over a month now, much of which has been house sitting for her during her OZ adventure.  It
will be quite different when she's back!</p></li>

<li><p>I need to clean the place up a bit more.  I repaired the seat of the トイレ, and cleaned the
stove quite well..  I wanted to fix the towel hanger, but will do it later, perhaps.  Basically
just gotta put clean clothes away.</p></li>

<li><p>While she's been gone, I've been putting my futon on the arm of the couch instead of away in
the closet.  Much easier that way.</p></li>

<li><p>My sleeping pile has been (from the bottom up): the old single size futon, couch cushion (for
my thighs + feet only), one of my Jesse-given fuzzy blanktets folded in half, big blue futon cover,
me, white sheet, another Jesse-given fuzzy blanket (optional)</p></li>

<li><p>Each day, I've been paying for comfortable seat on the train.  That's 500 yen each way.  I
almost always make the 8:44am ホ〖ムライナ〖 from Chigasaki in the morning, then transfer in 墒李 to
the second car (usually has seats available) of the 9:35am Yamanote Line to Ebisu. (where we are
now; bye!)</p></li>
