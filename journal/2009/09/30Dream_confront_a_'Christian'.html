<p class="dream">In a house, with some commotion going on outside, and two guys knocked on the door
and sorta let themselves in; no one else inside really knew how to handle them, so they asked me to
so I went to the main guy all, &quot;get OUT,&quot; while pointing at the door as I bounced him out
of the room.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Now,&quot; I said, once we were outside, &quot;it may not seem like a very
friendly way to greet somebody,&quot; we chuckled, &quot;but I feel uncomfortable when people I
don't know barge into the house.  How may I help you?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Well, I just wondered if you had found Jesus Christ as your personal Lord
and Sav...&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Um, yeah, about that.  I am pretty much clear that I don't subscribe to the
Christian mythology and religious silliness, so don't waste your time.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I know how you feel, and I used to think the same thing.. that was until I
got married and found Jesus and have been Right ever since.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I thought for a moment and realized things didn't quite add up.  &quot;So you mean
you were married *before* you found Christ?  And you call yourself a Christian?&quot;  (*)</p>

<p class="dream">He looked sheepish, and his friends all looked at him.</p>

<p class="dream">I continued, &quot;and you call yourself Christian, but go barging into another
man's house without asking?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He looked down at his feet and I woke up.</p>

<p>(*) Yes, I realize this dream-logic makes no sense in our waking reality.</p>
