<p>yay!  The house is clean clean clean.  I scrubbed the shower, and all the various bottles of
shampoo, conditioner, exfoliant, moisturizer, pasteurizer, etc, plus their little rack.  All
scrubbed!</p>

<p>I had already cleaned the stove, so this morning I put away the dry dishes, scrubbed the counter
and sink.  Washed the bottles of laundry detergent and fabric softener (I wonder if anyone would
buy it if they called it fabric oiler?)</p>

<p>Actually put my bed in the futon closet instead of on the arm of the couch, washed the blue sheet
(which is actually part of the big futon set) and hung it out to dry today.</p>

<p>Oh, and last night I bought some glue and repaired a tea cup that had broken (due to too many
dirty dishes crowding the counter, ahem), <em>and</em> I fixed the towel hanger knob that had come
loose (from too much towelie?).</p>
