<p>I havne't written a journal entry in a while, so I'ma briefly summarize:</p>

<p>Working lots.  Alfonzo's like &quot;yah we gotta really crack down and get crackin' the deadline
is soon,&quot; etc even though the deadline is in October.  Cripes!  That's soon!</p>

<p>Been working on Kevin's website, and Angel's website a little bit.  Been playing stupid Mafia
Wars on FB (why is it so addicting to me??)</p>

<p>Been doing a bit with Cow-Go, though maybe should be doing more.</p>

<p>Had a bit of a fight with Soness that nearly had me leaving her apartment, but she didn't kick me
out whatsoever, and I didn't move out (though I came close), and last night we were pretty much
mates again.  I think I should write to Battlin' M to let her know.</p>

<p>done</p>

<p>Um, what else has been going on?  We're supposed to get the edge of a typhoon soon (big whoop;
big storms in Japan are called spring rains in Houston).  The map on weather.jp/typhoon (or
something) showed the path going straight to Kyushu and then curving up the coast before reaching
the coast.</p>

<p>Ah, Kitty at work is going to be leaving soon.  Sad.  Especially for two reasons: she's the only
person who's invited me to lunch, and yesterday when we went to lunch she said, &quot;now that you
guys are here, I don't want to quit,&quot; referring to me, Nate, and Alfonzo.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, unquit!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't; they already allocated the budget to something else,&quot; etc.  Dang!</p>

<p>Ah, last night I overslept on the train, and woke up as the doors were closing in Hiratsuka, the
stop *after* Chigasaki.</p>

<p>No trains were going the other way until 4:30am, so I took a taxi back, figuing that the next
stop, Oiso, would not have an internet cafe nor the like.  3860 yen taxi = 4 trips all the way from
Chigasaki to Shibuya on the train + 60 yen.</p>

<p>I got to sleep just after 3am last night; pretty super tired this morning after 4.75 hours of
sleep, but still did meditation and got to the 8:44 train out of Chigasaki.</p>
