<p>Semi-rough day at work; code just wasn't doing the right thing.  Turns out the underlying
initialization functions were funked up.  Alfonzo fixed them (he blamed himself for having copied
them from a forum without testing them) and then I went to lunch as he finished up the code against
which I had been proverbially banging my fingers.</p>

<p>When I got back, he was just finishing up, and I tested all the different cases for the code, and
it passed them all.</p>

<p>Then was going to work on the next section, but wanted to do a code review.  Alfonzo was like,
&quot;you review it first, and make sure you're familiar with it,&quot; and I noted that the delete
functionality hadn't been implement.  So I worked on allowing deletion of records, but with an
&quot;art thou surest?&quot; page.  And then was like, &quot;whoohoo!&quot; and realized that it
still needs search functionality... ah crud, and I realized I had merged the functionality of the
search and the edit all in one extravaganza.</p>

<p>Was about to blow it off until tomorrow, but after I wrote down my list of things to do, I was
like &quot;well numbers 2, 3, 4 are easy,&quot; so I did them quickly, and then just was left with
1 and 5 to do tomorrow.  And I did part 1a of number 1.  Nice.</p>
