<p>Got up at 6:45am, did a sitting sleepitation and then woke up Soness at 7am as planned, but she
&quot;needed 30 more minutes&quot; to sleep, (time which I could not afford before work), so I
headed to the beach without her, rock hopped and jogged.  The water was higher than I had ever seen
it before, so that was pretty cool.</p>

<p>Listened to Shaman drumming during my run, the best bit watching the waves crash upward against
a flat concrete wall (as I stood on the wall, the water shot vertically up in front of me, though
not as high as I might have hoped)</p>

<p>Soness was still zonked when I got back; I didn't wake her up again, but just got ready for work
and am at work now.</p>

<p>Back to work!</p>
