<p>Going to lunch with Lina today.</p>

<p class="date">8:37pm JST Tuesday  8 September 2009 (day 14412)</p>

<p>Lunch was fun; we went to Tandoor, the Indian restaurant that Kevin and I used to visit after
I-group meetings some months ago.</p>

<p>Lina told me about the long + boring meetings they have at work on Tuesdays, and said she'd like
Uni-qlo (?) meetings: standing with no refreshments.  Five minutes and done.  She asked me lotsa
questions about NOVA from back in the (terrible) day, and we talked about movies a bit.  I'm in a
bit of a question-mark state of mind as to whether she is interested in more than just
friendship. I'm not, at this moment, but I'm not going to &quot;say anything&quot; unless it's
broached as a topic.  Hmmm I wonder why that is.  Oh, I know, cause of all the times I've told women
I'm not interested and they verbally slapped back like, &quot;psshh who said <em>I</em> was
interested???&quot; jeez.</p>
