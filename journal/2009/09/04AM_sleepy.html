<p>While on Shonan Liner, I just wrote about last night, and now on Yamanote, writing about this
morning, during which I flopped around in bed until 8am instead of getting up at 6am to rock hop.
When the 6:45 alarm to come home after the beach went off, I was holding the phone in my hand and it
beeped weirdly and I woke up to see it had called Soness upstairs!  I heard her in the loo; I had
apparently woken her up, and got up to say &quot;oops sorry&quot; as she asked in the kitchen on her
way back upstairs, &quot;did you call me??&quot;</p>

<p>Both back to our respective beds and I didn't even get up at 7:45 for the reminder to take out
the trash.  Snoozed that alarm a couple times until 8 and finally was like &quot;oh yeah I gotta
eat&quot;</p>

<p>Oh wait; I think it was around 7am that I sat up to do my morning meditation practice for 15
minutes, and then conked back asleep. </p>

<p>Anyway, I didn't do much but sleep, meditate, eat, dress, leave, come back, grab the trash, leave
again.</p>

<p>Sorta had to negotiate how to get ready again; my clean shirts and socks were upstairs, so I
quietly got them without waking up Soness and then where to put my shorts and where to put on my
pants... Man, having people in the house is tricky!</p>
