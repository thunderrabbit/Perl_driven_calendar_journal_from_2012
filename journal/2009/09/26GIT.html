<p>Created a git repository on my local machine and on my server at ~/php_file_journal.git AND on
my server at ~/git.robnugen.com/php_file_journal.git, which is where I wanted it in the first
place.  I think I committed README.TXT (visible below (though with lowercased filename)) to the
local repository and pushed it to the first one mentioned on my server, but not yet to the second
one, which is actually where I think I want it.</p>

<p>But I might not want it web-accessible like that..  welllll I guess I do, but perhaps in a more
thoughtfully constructed file path than the site's root.</p>

<p>Right now, I wanna figure out how my current local git thing even knew about the.. oh wait I bet
I know.  I have a script that created a remote copy and then created a local dir and pulled the
remote to the local.  That was when I had forgotten to include git.robnugen.com as part of the file
path so it was written to a non-web-accessible location on my server.  When I created a new remote
repsoitory but the same local repository, the local already knew its original source so when I did
the push, it went to the first source.</p>

<p>So, the solution I see is to either</p>

<ol>
<li>wipe everything and start again (crude, but effective)</li>

<li>wipe just the local and create it using the correct remote (I'll probably do this)</li>

<li>figure out how to tell/trick the local into thinking it has a different origin than it does.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ah.  Number 3 was trivially easy.  There's a file called .git/config in the repository.  I set
its source to be url = ssh://thunderrabbit@git.robnugen.com:git.robnugen.com/php_file_journal.git</p>

<p>Hmm.  I just set ignorecase = false, cause that's how I prefer my filesystem to work.</p>
