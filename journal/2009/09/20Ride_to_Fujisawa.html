<p>Fujisawa station is pretty close to Chigasaki; about 30 minutes by bicycle.</p>

<p>I just rode from Chez Soness to Fujisawa, and parked the yellow bike for 100 yen.  Headed to Pink
Cow now on Tokaido Line.  Oh, but the cool thing: I *basically* memorized a route to ride to the
station, and made it, without looking at the map again while riding.  I'm pretty glad about
that.</p>

<p>Now granted, it wasn't toooooo hard; basically two streets, but navigating the ittybitty streets
around Fujisawa was a bit of a trick.  I ended up crossing the tracks twice (once by porting the
bike over some stairs, and once by riding across.  (finally!  I got to <em>ride across Tokaido
Line</em>))</p>

<p>Um, anyway, I'm glad to be back on a bike.</p>

<p>The real trick will be riding back tonight after seeing DJ Peter perform at his lounge night.
(He is one of the improv players that performs at The Pink Cow on certain (second?) Wednesdays of
the month.)</p>
