<p>Yurika canceled our lesson that was supposed to be tonight.  She didn't give 24 hours advanced
warning, and a common policy is that student still has to pay.  I may just say, &quot;yo, next time
give some head's up,&quot; but she said it was due to cramps.  かわいそう、ね。 So I'm not likely to
say anything. </p>
