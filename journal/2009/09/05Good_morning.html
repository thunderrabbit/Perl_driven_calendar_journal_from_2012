<p>This morning after sleeping in to about 9am, we enjoyed yummy omelets cooked by Mary of Mike
&amp; Mary, then lazed around a bit until I remmebered I needed to look for Michael (from I-group)'s
book that he loaned me.  Noticed that the shed was missing the medium length surfboard, so I assumed
Soness's neighbor had taken it be be repaired (long story).  That gave me a bit easier time going in
to grab a box of books to search for the book.</p>

<p>The book wasn't in the box I pulled out, so I was about to go back and Soness's neighbor came by
to take the long board out of the shed as well!  Perfect timing to go in there and get the other
box of books, and in that box I found the requested book.  Nice!</p>

<p>I dunno what exactly was decided about the longboard, but he confirmed the m-size board was
being repaired.</p>

<p>Headed to Shibuya now to meet JC, then Lina for their first French lesson.  Mike and Mary are
going to Akihabara, then other places, and will meet me at exit 13 to visit The Pink Cow tonight.  Yay!</p>
