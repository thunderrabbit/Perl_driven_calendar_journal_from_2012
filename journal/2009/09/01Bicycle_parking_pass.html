<p>Woke up early to get a bicycle parking pass for September.  1500 yen, which for me will
definitely end up being cheaper than buying 100 yen daily tickets.  Also got one for Soness; I'm
sure she'll park there at least 15 times this month.</p>

<p>Most interesting: the line was *well* shorter when I left than when I arrived, and there was
still plenty of time before 8am to get passes.  I might remember this and come later next month.
Go around 6:30, Future Rob!</p>
