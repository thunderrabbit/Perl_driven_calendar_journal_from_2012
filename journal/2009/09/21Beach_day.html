<p>Last night as I arrived home from Shibuya + missing DJ Peter's set in Fujisawa, Brook was like,
&quot;we made brownies!&quot; as everyone else was like, &quot;we're not home!  There's no
brownies!&quot; etc.</p>

<p>This morning:</p>

<p>Had a great day sleeping late and then cooking crepes, then heading down to the beach for an
overcast perfectly warm beach day featuring BBQ, double dutch and hoola hoop.</p>

<p>Crepeness consisted of Brook preparing the mix and the innards (fruits, whipped cream + brown
sugar), and me cooking the crepes.  Fun times!  Not enough from just one bowl, so we took turns
making another bowl.</p>

<p>Then Kristen and Tod arrived, and then Sorcha, as we were preparing to go to the beach.  Taxi
for half of us, and bikes for the rest.  Tod organized the BBQ fire and Soness met some other
BBQers who were doing double dutch.  The pair who were turning the ropes were well practiced, and
one had a Japan Double Dutch Tournament Staff T-shirt, so I figure he knew how to spin a rope.</p>

<p>After we jumped a bit, then ate a bit, and the hoops were out (Kristen teaches hooping), I took
a hoop over to the jump ropers and did double dutch while jumping the hula hoop.  Soness got some
pictures which I plan to upload sometime, somewhere. Can we email-upload to FB yet?</p>

<p>I like Brook; haven't quite figured out details yet.</p>
