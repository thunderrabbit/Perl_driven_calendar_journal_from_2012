<p>Was up late last night talking with Soness and the two couchsurfers Elias and Robert from
Sweden.  Then continued to be up late online, though I can't even remember why.. I think email.</p>

<p>This morning I did my 15 minute meditation in a most sleepy way, and that was both before and after going back to
sleep for a while to regain some lost zs.</p>

<p>Firefox seems to have some problems with Gmail recently.  But I'm surprised that it was even
slow when I added labs=0 to the URL.</p>
