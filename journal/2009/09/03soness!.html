<p>Soness is home!  I went and picked up Mike and Mary from Ontario on their &quot;big trip before
the baby&quot; as Mary is good with child (not exactly &quot;great&quot; yet, but 6 months, I think
they said).</p>

<p>I woulda bought flowers and possibly made dinner, but instead I forgot about flowers until too
late, and just dished up some ¸¼ÊÆ (brown rice) for Mary and myself once we got home.</p>

<p>Once Soness got home (!!) she began preparing an onion+kidney.beans+tomato+spinach stir.fry,
which I finished while she chatted with Mike and Mary (I was going to say &quot;Mary and Mike&quot;
this time for balance, but of the couple, Mike did most of the talking.)</p>

<p>During dinner, I could hear the change in her language after her 16 day extended remix (*)
course.</p>

<p>(*) actually it wasn't an extended remix so much as a 45 played at 33.</p>

<p>I heard her referencing the benefits of reframing one's belief system, and stuff like that.</p>

<p>After M &amp; M were in bed, I got some more time to chat with Soness.  Could really easily
clearly see how she transformed into more centered and Soness.  Heard about her new mates Rhonda,
Simon, Cele, and Sean, plus adventures in customs and other bits.</p>

<p>Her story about customs included them <em>throwing away her hula hoop tape <b>as well as its
case</b></em>. and I was like, &quot;dooood!&quot; and could feel the fury build up in me, knowing
that the US Government brought down the World Trade Towers 1, 2, and 7 so they could start wars and
keep us from bringing water and hoola hoop tape onto planes, and I was like, &quot;I know I've got
issues to work through on this, but it just fkkin infuriates me to know hat the US Government
destroyed the World Trade Center so they could start wars and keep us under control,&quot; and
Soness said something like, &quot;I know; I can see the rage building up in you; bring your
attention back here.  Focus on me.&quot; and I was still fuming over the water bottles frickin'
frackin' can't bring water through security but can bring machine-bought bottled water onto the
plane, and Soness was like, &quot;back here; bring your attention back to me.&quot; And I finally
did after a moment and ... hmmm I found it really interesting to hear how she handled that:
impassively but firmly, and without referring back to it once I was back to the present moment.</p>

<p>Wow!  A whole new Soness!</p>
