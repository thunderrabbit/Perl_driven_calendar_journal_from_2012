<p>We ate at California Pizza Kitchen last night after Grampa's Dream.  Soness played with Mayumi's
daughter Kaede, from coloring to going to watch the pizzas being prepared.</p>

<p>I was pretty quietly chill-chowing the whole time.  Our server had SALLY on her nametag, but
said she was from Japan and Sally was her nickname.  Soness said, &quot;isn't there a song about
Sally?&quot; and I quickly sang snippets: &quot;so, Sally can wait,&quot; then &quot;Mustang
Sally&quot; then, &quot;ride, Sally, ride&quot; though I know that's the same song now, I thought I
thought of three songs yesterdayq.</p>
