<p>Soness and I each went to Jamaican night at The Pink Cow tonight; she invited me and I was like,
&quot;I was already going to go...&quot; &quot;well, why didn't you invite me???&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm!  I guess cause I didn't invite anyone, and I don't really invite people all that often.</p>

<p>It was my first time at Jamaican Night, but I think it's been going on for at least a couple
months..  maybe way longer, but it just showed up in my mental radar last month for the first
time.  I expected lots of music and dancing because on the writeup it says, &quot;NO Dancing! (yeah
right!)&quot; but..  there was no dancing!</p>

<p>In fact, there was very limited standing as they were all playing Taboo and then as I and others
joined and there were too many people to sit at the table, people broke off to play dominoes and
maybe other games...  Soness and Raj (who she knew already but happened to see on her way from
Harajuku to Da Cow) joined after a bit and we had a righteous and riotous time, hollering and being
quiet and laughing at the abdominal snowman and watching two people find out they're both from the
Charleston in West Virginia!</p>

<p>I saw Brook and talked to him about Cow-Go; saw Daisha before we went in and talked to her about
JMW (33 confirmed events).</p>

<p>Traci wasn't there, but I think she will be tomorrow.</p>
