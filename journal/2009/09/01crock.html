<p>You know the phrase &quot;see ya later, alligator!&quot; should be followed by &quot;after a
while, crocodile!&quot; which can be crudely followed by &quot;after supper, mother
fucker!&quot;</p>

<p>Well, I thought of another really funny one a few days ago (and forgot it), but just now came up
with another, so I think I'll try to jot some down:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>after that, alley cat!</p></li>

<li><p>see ya there, grizzly bear!</p></li>

<li><p>see ya then, silly hen!</p></li>

<li><p>See ya now, spotted cow!</p></li>

<li><p>See ya soon, loon!</p></li>

<li><p>Later, dog!</p></li>
</ol>
