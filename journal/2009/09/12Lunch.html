<p>right now I'm at First Kitchen, chosen cause I can eat in a smoke-free-enough
environment, <em>and</em> I didn't get any food wrapped in plastic.  I skipped two shops because
their food had been prepared off-site and wrapped in plastic.  Another I skipped because when I
went it, the air stank like smoke.</p>

<p>I'm prolly gonna be a tad late to RC, but not too bad.</p>
