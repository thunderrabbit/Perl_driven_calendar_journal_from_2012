<p>I looked out my window a moment ago and saw a helicopter.  Fair enough.  I looked out just now
and saw another, and another, until I saw <del>eight</del> <ins>nine</ins> fly by, and now I think
I'm seeing the first ones repeat their flybys.  They're all flying with the focus of their radius
*basically*, *roughly* inside the radius of the Tokyu Toyoko Line's big turn as it crosses Yamanote
and heads into Shibuya station. </p>

<p>In other news, I noted different helicopters have different rotor rotation directions.  I wonder
what that's called.  The one I'm seeing right now has its blades rotating counterclockwise from my
point of view.  The one just a moment ago was clockwise, and the one just after the one I started
talking about this was again clockwise.</p>
