<p class="dream">At Chez Soness couchsurfing guests were a couple and the girl was really attractive
with great smile.  They jumped out of bed quickly and jumped into the shower and then we went to
Astroworld to ride the old roller coasters.  I had been on the ride before, but it looked different
somehow.  And then as we were aboard, and coasting toward the beginning, I saw that some of the
track was missing near the end of the ride.  I was about to yell &quot;wait!!&quot; but I didn't
think they would make such an error so I just went with it, and then I saw more track missing, and
didn't see any track that could take its place, so I wondered what was up.  The track was red and
near the ground with trees around it, some tarp covering the ground to catch tools and bits, and
then we saw that the track was completely different than it used to be.  We turned sideways into a
large vertical drop as the guy announcer was like, &quot;yeah, all that stuff I said before.  it was
a lie.&quot; and we started to accelerate sideways into this hole down at an angle and then whoosh
into a room down below, and then it was like a house with giant fixtures and we rolled over a toilet
and then it looked like the track was going to go down the bowl, but then it reversed and we rolled
backwards down into the toilet tank and into the plumbing for a bit and water poured around us and
then we were back out and rolling along the ceiling as the next track kept changing into some
various impossible shapes, as it twisted itself up and then untwisted and made little spiral things,
but again it was all for show and our actual track went past that and into something crazier upside
down and finally stopped in a haunted room and we got off the train and were wondering what to do
next.  I was like, &quot;any guidance??&quot; and got no response.  Then after a bit, a couple of
ride operators dashed into the room, a bit late and sheepish, &quot;sorry; we were jumping
rope,&quot; and I put my arm mock roughly around the girl in a flirtatious manner saying, &quot;this
was *great* this ride.. wow!  Thank you!&quot; and then to the guy the same thing, and I asked him
about the history.  He kept saying these names that I knew were wrong like Kinga Ka and something
else.  I was like, &quot;no; it was Viper originally,&quot; but I knew that was wrong as well.</p>

<p>The ride was located where Serial Thriller used to be, but on a hill.  It was more like The
Serpent in the trees. Anti-props to the jerk who killed Astroworld.</p>
