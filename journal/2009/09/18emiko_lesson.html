<p>Emiko and I met at 7:30 for our lesson at Bunkyodo, after which I invited her to eat the amazing
delicious Pink Cow Buffet!  She joined for more chat and chew as we sat in the couch area laughing
about little things.</p>

<p>Found out from Scott Larson, the artist who has pictures up this month, that the mayor of Tokyo
wants to put a stadium in the middle of Yoyogi Park!  WTF?  WTF?  wtf???  ftw???</p>

<p>Emiko just left a bit ago, so I'm chatting with Moonie as she works and DJs.</p>
