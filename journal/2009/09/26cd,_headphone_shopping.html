<p>Soness and I went CD and headphone shopping for her.  Found a perfect rack for drying dishes for
the kitchen, so bought that as well.  Asked them to hold it until we were done with other shopping,
then headed to DICE to look at CDs, with a little stop at Tokyo Hands.  Soness found and purchased
an India Arie CD, and then we headed to Yodobashi Camera by way of the world's shortest escalator,
which Jen and I documented some time ago, though I can't now find the proof.</p>

<p>Went to Yodobashi and looked at lots of headphones and even some iPod/iPhone speakers, but
didn't buy anything except Soness got an iTunes debit card.</p>

<p>Headed home and realized we forgot the dish drying rack. d'oh!</p>
