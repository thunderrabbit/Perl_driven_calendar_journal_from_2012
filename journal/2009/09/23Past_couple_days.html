<p>I had Chez Soness essentially to myself yesterday; Soness left at 6:30am or so, and Brook and
Helen left before I got my lazy bootay out of bed.  I slowly cleaned the bbq pit and dishes from
the BBQ and got some paper towels plus granola at the store.</p>

<p>Skyped with Kevin, who has put website production on hold as he may be moving his courses out of
Japan.</p>
