<p class="date">9:27pm JST Friday  4 September 2009 (day 14408)</p>

<p>This week I had four lessons scheduled, and two of my students cancelled.  Was supposed to have
two today, but I'm kinda glad Gen cancelled cause it was going to be at 9pm.</p>

<p>Emiko did not cancel, and I'm glad because I picked up her
old <del>Metropris</del> <ins>Metropolis</ins> for its article about Shibuya fashion.  I'll send it
to Sabina who sorta has a crush on Japan.</p>

<p>Emiko's word for today was squeamish, which she said she gets around small insects.  I'm spooked
out about big insects, but she's like, &quot;those you can see and escape,&quot; but small ones,
says she, &quot;will certainly come to me without my noticing.&quot;</p>
