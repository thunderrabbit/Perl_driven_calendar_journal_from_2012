<p class="dream">Flying slowly over Houston, I happily gazed over the familiar old buildings and
highways, reliving a story being told by a woman about how she flew her plane over Houston, but got
confused as to where she needed to go as it was her first time trying to find the correct address
downtown (and streets are not labled more than about 5 meters above them) so she got turned around
and had to turn around, but almost hit a building and flew close by it and then down along the
highway where another plane or flying car was hovering close to them, and then went way up and down
and then smashed splat onto the highway.</p>

<p class="dream">We were like, &quot;oh snap!&quot; and got the guy out of the wreckage and had his
blood being processed in a big rusty bucket; I watched as it poured out from a hose connected to his
heart, and then was sucked back in on his the up beat of his heart beat, but wondered why it was so
slow; seemed to be as slow as his breathing, but everything otherwise seemed fine and stable so I
didn't worry about it and woke up</p>
