<p>Pretty good at work today; finished the class on Friday and started the next bit, and now trying
to implement some new stuff using the class.  I'm definitely getting better: using Mootools to
create elements on the page, considering ajax to be an easy solution, and more good stuff.</p>

<p>Been learning git a bit; I don't quite get why my .htaccess file doesn't show up where I think
it should, but once I get that, I'll be able to make all the files I want and get the new version
of my journal going.</p>
