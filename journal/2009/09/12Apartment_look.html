<p>I think overall, for now, it's best if I don't move.  I wanted to move because it would be
easier than dealing with the issue that came up.  I saw the apartment today, and it's really close
to where Louise useta live, and I even went up to her old door, but there was a baby car in front
of the door so I guessed it was no longer her apartment.</p>
