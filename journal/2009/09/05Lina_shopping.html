<p>Just now at The Pink Cow after wandering through a new store called Opening Ceremony.  Lina is a
clothes designer, and wanted to check it out; I had nothin' much going on so I went with her.
She's quite an interesting character in terms of her upbringing: 13 years in Japan, and then in the
US until after university, and now back in Japan.  Her English seems fluently flawless, and it's
actually her Japanese that has suffered a bit.  Her boss was like, &quot;why are you learning
French?  You need to learn Japanese¡¢¤À¤Í&quot; hahahaha ah well.</p>

<p>We covered most of the gamut of topics, from hobbies to programming, and a lot about PB and
Francois.  She suggested I put an ad in Craig's List to get an equivalent rabbit.  Genius!!  I'm
going to do that tonight.</p>
