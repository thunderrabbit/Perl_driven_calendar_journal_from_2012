<p>Was up late last night working on work stuff; I had a sudden bit of inspiration.  I fixed a bug
that Alfonzo had left in the main code; he musta been tired, plus not testing.  Tsk tsk.</p>

<p>Chose to sleep instead of heeding any alarms on my phone.. Oh hey it's time for a State of My
Life Address!  Not much time till I get to Shinagawa though.</p>
