<p>Last night in my lesson with Yurika, which was the first after a few weeks because she cancelled
once and then cancelled the rescheduled lesson.  She bought me a cookie as an apology.  A few weeks
ago, when she turned in her homework, she said she was thinking about changing the format of our
lessons.  Fair enough; I know she needs to work on fluency more, so I figured she'd want to do
that.</p>

<p>We checked her homework pretty quickly, and then she was like, &quot;I wanna talk about
different topics,&quot; and then she told me she started a second business.  Hmmmm fair enough; she
doesn't seem like the business type but who knows..  And then she goes, &quot;but before talking
about business, I'd like to talk about dreams.&quot;</p>

<p>Ah; she's 'started' her own Amway business.</p>

<p>I remembered the time that Ricky at Chevron listened very patiently to my shpiel about Amway,
and even gave a few pointers on my approach: relax.  He waited until I finished and then gently
turned me down and said he recognized it as son as I started speaking, but knew it would be good
for me to practice.</p>

<p>So here's Yurika, giving the Amway shpiel <em>in a second language</em>; I'll certainly give her
the same respect as Ricky gave me.  It's a bit different in that she's paying me to give her spiel
(and help polish it), but when I think about it as 'business coaching,' I sure ain't getting paid
enough.</p>

<p>Amway works.  If you can convince enough people that it will work for them as well.  I wasn't
able to do that effectively enough, even though I signed up several people, they didn't sign up to
become rich, but to impress me, but then didn't go any further.  Props to Mike Cutaia who worked his
proverbial ass off as my Direct; I've heard he went Emerald some years ago, and wouldn't be
surprised if he and Susie have gone Diamond now.</p>

<p>I signed up to become rich, but when I signed up here on earth it musta been to be lazy, as I've
rather wanted to roam around and work a little bit at a time.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, blah blah blah; Yurika said she finished about &quot;this much&quot; of the whole plan,
and she didn't say &quot;Amway&quot; nor even the nature of the business, but we'll continue the
discussion next week.  I hope she's wildly successful.  I hope she's wildly successful and then
remembers me charging so little for our lessons (( 2000 yen + drink per hour lesson, plus 1000 yen
to check her homework via email between lessons (takes about half an hour or more) )) and then pays
me tons of money and then puts me on retainer as her English instructor.</p>

<p>Actually it would be good enough if she doesn't lose a lot of money. 
Good Luck, Work Hard, がんばって、ゆりか！</p>
