<p class="dream">I was driving, and could see the hood was all banged up; Charmain had done the best
she could to repair it, but there were still lots of pock marks, and the chrome part couldn't really
be repaired with the tools she had.  She was like, &quot;yah sorry; I know it's still messed up, but
you can go to the shell station and they can fix the rest of the way.&quot;  I headed out of the parking
lot and Charmain jumped onto the back of the car bumper and held onto the seats to stay on.  I
turned right, then realized I should have turned left.  No obvious traffic, so I did a giant U-turn
in the middle of the intersection as Charmain held on tightly.  She fell off for a second, but got
back on and we headed down the hill.</p>

<p class="dream">Running along the ridge overlooking the tracks, we heard the train coming but
needed to get to wait for the opposite-bound train to go by.  We were going to run down the steps
and then toward the front of the train, but I realized we would save time if we cut off the right
angle, so I went down the hill at an angle and stood on the tracks in front of the train stopped at
the platform to make sure my companions got on first.  The conductor saw us and waited for us no problem.
