<p>Tonight I'll meet Emiko at 7:30 for a lesson.</p>

<p class="date">8:34pm JST Wednesday 23 September 2009 (day 14427)</p>

<p>Lesson was good, actually more interesting than most of the ones we've had before; she had just
gone on a trip to northeast coast of Japan and brought back a book of pics from the area (she left
her camera in a station at the beginning of her trip, and didn't recover it until the end).  The
pics were beautiful and I was like, &quot;dood!&quot; I need to travel more around Japan.</p>

<p>She also told me she wanted to kick her brother out of her apartment; she owns it but he's
renting it from her.  His rent covers the bank payments; I told her she should buy another apartment
and let him keep paying for her current one.  She was like, &quot;hmmmm&quot; and I told her about
some guy I know in Austin who did similar.</p>

<p>Then she said something about how she wasn't sure if she'd be able to get married because in
Japan they say a woman who buys a house first can't get married (or something).  I was like,
&quot;hogwash&quot; and told her she can have a fundraiser and invite rich guys to $200 / plate
dinners and find someone she likes.  Done!</p>
