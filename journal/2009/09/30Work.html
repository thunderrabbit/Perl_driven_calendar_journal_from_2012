<p>Went to the United States for lunch with Kitty today.  Or at least it seemed like it!  We went to
a hotel in ¤Ò¤í¡¼ that caters to navy and peeps from Yokoska base, where everyone speaks English,
and all the prices are inexpensive, in US currency, and the cheesecake is dense like cheesecake.</p>

<p>It was her last day at work today so she bought a thank you cheesecake for everyone, and I got to
join her for a last work lunch.  Hopefully not our last time ever to chill out, but with Tokyo
lifestyles, I wouldn't be surprised.  But she does live in Zushi, which is quite close to Chigasaki,
so who knows!  Maybe she and her husband will come to Soness's next Chigasaki Beach BBQ.</p>

<p>In other news, I didn't get as much finished today as I wanted work-wise, but I just need to do
the same thing again one more time tomorrow and will be caught up.</p>
