<p class="dream">I'm watching the pre-performance performance at Grampa's Dream, the show Soness is
in for Carnival with World Family this year.  This is my second viewing, this time with Soness's
friend Mayumi, her daughter Kaede, and friend Naomi, with due-in-two-weeks unnamed baby in the slow
cook oven.</p>
