<p>Though this is &quot;Silver Week,&quot; I asked Alfonzo if I could come in to work an extra day
or two; I didn't want to lose momentum on the classes we're making!</p>

<p>I said NO to Monday, and he said NO to Tuesday, but we're coming in to work today, an hour later
than normal, but 23 hours ahead of when we &quot;have&quot; to.</p>

<p>Work was aight in that my progress got faster; it got to the point that I hoped it would be when
walking in the door this morning, but for some reason the first class I tried to write just wasn't
doing the right thing.  Not sure why, but even worse (?) is that it seems to be doing the right
thing now, and I'm not sure why.  Spooky.</p>

<p>Is it doing the right thing for realz or have I missed something in my testing?  The second class
I tested more effectively, comparing its output to the output of known working code.  Turns out the
known working code isn't as cool as my new class, so that's good news.  Yes.</p>
