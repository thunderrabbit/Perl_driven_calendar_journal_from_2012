<p>Funny funny play yesterday!  We saw _If the Shoe Fits_ starring Andrew, Ron, Stacey, and ...
dang I forgot the other actor's name.</p>

<p>Soness invited a whole posse of people.  I woulda come anyway, but I was in her group with
Sorcha, Ace and Jojo, Robert and Elias (current couchsurfers), and Leila (sp) from Carnival.</p>

<p>This was the night that Leila came up to me while talking to her friend on the phone, &quot;I'm
at the show now and Rob cannot keep his hands off of me!&quot; so I rubbed her calf a bit (I was
sitting; she was standing) and then invited her to sit on my lap for a bit while she was talking to
peeps.</p>

<p>Soness later was like, &quot;ahem; what are you doing mr no-girlfriend for now?&quot; and I was
like, &quot;nothing!&quot; and then &quot;hmmmm&quot; so maybe I'll watch myself a bit more
carefully.  But she started it!  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>The play was full of intrigue, with double-secret lovers and murder and brownies; and sooo
hilarous!  I'm glad I got my TIP-Pack.  :-)  Only 1000 yen to see the show!</p>
