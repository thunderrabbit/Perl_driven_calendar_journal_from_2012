<p>On the train now headed home from The Pink Cow where I saw Geoff and his mate play as Missing
Scene, then a whole posse of people come in after Rachel to see Rachel's friend Mana's band Weekend
Tokyo (or was it Tokyo Weekend?), who, apparently, just did their second live performance tonight.
It was great!</p>

<p>Rachel and I chilled talkin' with Toru until Mana arrived; Toru speaks Japanese, Mandarin,
English, Korean, and a bit of Spanish.  Rachel is Hong Kong American (therefore British American?
haha) and speaks English, Japanese, Mandarin, and wants to study Spanish.  I showed her the ASL
alphabet and how to sign &quot;my name is R-A-C-H-E-L&quot; plus &quot;R-O-B&quot; and
&quot;M-A-N-A&quot;</p>

<p>Now I wanna learn Mandarin and ASL more.</p>

<p>re-learned the kanji for &quot;¸µµ¤¡©&quot; Ah but dang I can't encode them in this Shift-JIS
encoding.  Crap.  Gotta switch my entire site to UTF-8.  This is peeing me off.</p>

<p>Met VJ David Roy for the second time; he puts on Flo Union, where I met him last year or so as I
was just getting into the idea of getting into Pink Cow more often.  Now it seems likely that I'll
get involved more effectively, including coming to Flo Union &quot;soon&quot; and maybe even
presenting something maybe.  Maybe.</p>

<p>Met a couple other people with whom David was chillin' including DJ Daisha and two women whose
names I didn't really catch cause the music was so bumpin'. </p>
