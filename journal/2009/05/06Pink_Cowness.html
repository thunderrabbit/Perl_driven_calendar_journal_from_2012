<p>Went to The Pink Cow at 2:45pm for my 3pm meeting with Traci.  She hadn't written it down,
though, so I chilled in Da Cow preparing for the meeting we had planned.  We met for a bit around
5pm; she gave me a burrito, and then Soness and Bob rolled in for their own burrito, and to make
sure Bob met Traci!  Wow!!  Great to see them, and then chatted with peeps from Pink Cow Connection
meeting, and talked with Andrew Shuttleworth for a while about JMW, and him not being able to commit
to joining that as well.  He gave some good ideas for poken promotions, including for a Pink Cow
event on Sunday the 11th.</p>

<p>Tom and Vicki (Traci's parents) were there chillin', so I happily joined them and got some lovely
ice cream and pie!  woooo!!  And then just as Soness was leaving, Vicki was all, &quot;yeah we're
thinking about going to Kamakura tomorrow,&quot; and Soness goes, &quot;well, you should have Rob go
with you to show you around, and then you can come sleep at my house that night!&quot; She drew maps
and stuff and we got the basic schedule outlined.  Wow!  The next day they wanna go to Hakone, which
is vaguely in the same area, so I'll show them on Saturday how to get there, and then head back to
Tachikawa on Saturday day for UER meeting from 3pm to 7pm, and then home to chill.</p>

<p>Met a man named Jason from <a href="http://goodpeople.jp/">Good People</a>, who offered the idea
of me coming to one of his events to give my cards and some sample massages to people in the
place.  Could be great!</p>
