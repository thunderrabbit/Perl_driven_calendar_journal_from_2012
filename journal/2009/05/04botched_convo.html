<p>I think I may have botched this conversation with Ami.  I basically blurted in with the most
difficult part first, without thinking it through, nor even having asked for some guidance.</p>

<p>&quot;I think we should not have sex, but I want to support you and help you get over your mom's
death.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah.  So translate that to Japanese, and that's what I said.</p>

<p>She cried, as if I had hit her with two 2x4s, and it's now 2:10am, and the conversation isn't
yet finished.</p>

<p>Started around 10pm, I'm guessing.</p>

<p>For the purpose of her privacy, I'm going to keep to myself the content of the conversation, and
the basic patterns I see us in.</p>
