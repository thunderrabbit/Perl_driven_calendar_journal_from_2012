<p>I told Ami I can't break up with her because she cries.  Told her I want to break up with her
right now.  <em>right now</em> And she cried.</p>

<p>(that's a summary of our three hour conversation (*))</p>

<p>(and it continues)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Basically, we did a rehash of past conversations, getting through to the core:  I want to break
up, and she doesn't.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>(*) It all started when I asked Ami if she'd like to come to The Pink Cow tonight to meet
Soness, et. al., and then head to Soness' place tonight for fun and chillin', where, in the
morning, I'm already planning to meet Soness at 9 to help in her garden and her couch-surfin'
friends are going to the beach.  Figured Ami could join them at the beach and then I'd get some
money from helpin' Soness; Ami would get some fun from the beach, and everything would be great.</p>

<p>Ami seemed concerned that I had apparently forgotten she has a lunch scheduled with her friends
tomorrow, and that when we talked about me coming back from Chigasaki tomorrow, it wouldn't be too
late.  Actually we didn't specify a time, only that 9 or 10pm was ¤ä¤À in Ami's mind.</p>

<p>Subsequently got a bit deeper into it; Ami compared me to a playa, and how could I love her and
still want to leave her.  And then a bit deeper:  I hate Japan; I hate Japanese language; I don't
want to be here.</p>

<p>Soon I was like, &quot;I want to break up right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Then broke through to the next core, at least on Ami's side: she's still hurt after her mom's
death in November. ¤Þ, of course, and I know that intellectually, but didn't realize how much she
still feels it.</p>

<p>She said something like, &quot;everyone important leaves me&quot; (and therefore) &quot;please
don't leave me.&quot;</p>

<p>I suggested that we do some ISIS, but ended up just doing some eye contact meditation and third
eye meditation instead.  Figured full-blown ISIS was too much to explain at the moment.</p>

<p>Then, after making and eating pancakes together, I suggested she write a two page letter to her
mom.  Needs to get through this pain.</p>
