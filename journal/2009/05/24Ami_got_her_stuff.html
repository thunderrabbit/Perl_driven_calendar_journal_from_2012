<p>Ami got her stuff from my room today.</p>

<p>She asked me again to not kiss/date/do any other women during my alone time.  I agreed to that
and agreed I would think of her.</p>

<p>At her suggestion, I will not contact her "as friends" until I am sure, after all my soul
searching, that I can't date her anymore.</p>

<p>I walked her to the top of the bridge over the tracks near my house.  As she left, I chased her
down the other side for old times' sake.  She laughed and cried and said thank you multiple
times.</p>

<p>I'll miss her and the fun we have had together.</p>
