<p>In Odawara, I saw Tom and Vicki off toward Hakone, with Free Passes for two days' worth of
travel around the Hakone transportation system (bus / train / cablecar / boat).  </p>

<p>I'm headed to Tachikawa now, and will be using the Shonan Shinjuku Line Special Rapid Service for
Tagasaki, via the Tagasaki Line, which only runs once per hour.  I'm a bit curious as to why the
train is in two sections, with different destinations on each part of the train.  I mean, I know the
train is going to split, but which part(s) will go to Shinjuku?  A train attendant said the car I
chose is okay, so hopefully I'm okay.</p>

<p>Dang I wanted to write more, but I'm tired.</p>

<p>In short, it's been really fun hanging with Tom and Vicki.</p>

<p>I may have errd.  In Yokohama, I heard through sleepy brain the announcement that the next stop
was Osaki, and thought that was on the Tokyo side of Yamanote Line, but it's actually right at the
bottom of Yamanote Line, so I jumped off and then was like, &quot;d'oh!&quot; and now am on the
Tokaido Line to Kawasaki, where I'll change to Nambu Line (my favorite! (*)) from end to end, where
I'll hopefully get to Tachikawa on time.</p>

<p>(*) not my favorite</p>
