<p>Near the second bar area, I sat next to Ami, who sat across from Kane.  We were joined by a guy
named Danai, who hadn't been to The Pink Cow since its previous location in Harajuku.  Talked
mostly about my trip to OZ for Clairvision, and about me-n-Kanae's respective adventures on PB, and
a bit about who's still in Japan.</p>
