<p>Ami cutely held my hand while we walked in the train station, through the quiet areas all
&quot;sorry, but you're still my boyfriend,&quot; and I was like, &quot;no I'm not,&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Got into a bit of an argument with her saying &quot;please&quot; and me saying &quot;no&quot;
and then me ripping U-Cow's head mostly off in a fit of anger just wanting to get *away* from Ami
literally blocking my way to go home, like Hitomi did a few times more than too many.  I'm sure
those old memories have an effect on me now.</p>

<p>Ami walked away, and I thankfully thought it was over, and walked the opposite direction to give
her time to get to the train.  I came around a bit later and Ami was waiting at the top of the
escalator, similar to Hitomi waiting for me on my way home during PB.  Gah.  Argued a bit at the
entrance to Toyoko Line (ground floor entrance in Shibuya) then near silence on the train where I
wanted to punch the drunk guy next to me who kept pressing against me as he hung from the hanging
handle.</p>

<p>More yelling in Musashi Kosugi and then finally went to TJ Bike in bicycle parking near Foodium
for quieter yelling, and there for some reason saying the same thing over and over finally worked,
and it sounds like Ami understands I'm being for real.</p>

<p>Baaaay sically, I told her I need to just be alone and stop focusing on physical relationship.
Told her it has to be 100% breakup and not with an underlying understanding that we'll get back
together when I get my brain together.  It's gotta be an underlying understanding that we're over.
Finished.  fin. 　おつかれさまでした。</p>

<p>But I think I may have learned something about sensitivity, though not sure.  Seemed that my
crude version of my truth didn't sit well with her, and she wanted me to apologize for saying it.
I said the same thing in a far different way and it was okay.</p>

<p>I said something like my version of our relationship had turned to just focus on the physical
and I needed to stop that for good in my life so I wasn't gonna do any more, plus not do anything
with her.  Gah.</p>

<p>I wrote it out a bit better in my morning pages (mourning pages?) and may scan them and put them
in here.  Might.  Should, for the sake of historical evidence.</p>
