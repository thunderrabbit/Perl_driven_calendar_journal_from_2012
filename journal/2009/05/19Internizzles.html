<p>So, there's these things called The Internets, with which information can be transferred quickly,
cheaply, illegally and otherwise.  The information is encoded as a series of alternating states of
the medium in which it's being encoded, whether electrical, optical, magnetical, or otherwise.
Generally the coding is done in a base 2 format like
101001011011001100110100111010110110101000101010101 or something equally repetitive.</p>

<p>When viewed at that level of detail, the content is pretty boring.  BUT, when decoded, according
to whatever rules the transmitting and receiving parties have agreed in advance, the information
may appear more interesting to a casual human observer.</p>

<p>Sometimes the information transmitted may appeal to several human observers, some of whom would
be willing to offer a portion of their effort (money, a different topic) in order to observe said
information, or even even be inspired to give said effort as a result of reading said
information.</p>

<p>But sometimes (most times), the information is simply *free*, with no requirement to offer
anything in exchange for the information.</p>

<p>The idea of selling information reminds me of the old-school ways of doing business, where a few
people had the ability to collect and distribute information via print media, then radio, then TV.
Radio and TV, I imagine, could have been used similarly to the internets, but due to the relative
low number of channels available for transmission, El Governmento specified rules on using radio
and TV for transmitting information, effectively reducing the number of broadcasters.  (Gotta see
about getting involved with ham radio at some point.)</p>

<p>Okay, so with information *freely* available on the internet, I think we just need a way to get
the right information to the right people.  Example:  I've got an old broken PC.  I need a new
ballpoint pen.  I'd be willing to trade this PC for a ballpoint pen.  But who, near me, has a pen
that they'd be willing to trade for a PC?  Do we have to use money as a mediator?  Moving products
all over town and money all over to keep track of who moved the most products and information?  I
just want a pen.</p>

<p>Have just arrived in Shibs; write more later maybe.</p>
