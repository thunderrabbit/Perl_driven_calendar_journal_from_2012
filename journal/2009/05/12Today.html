<p>Just now on the train in Sh</p>

<p class="date">11:27pm JST Tuesday 12 May 2009 (day 14293)</p>

<p>Just now got off the train in Shibuya so I can get on the next train that will leave from
platform 3 at 11:40pm, simply so that I can get a seat with elbow room so I can write.</p>

<p>Today I officially finished my Basic Shiatsu course, though instead of a diploma or any proof
that I took the course, Kimura-san clapped, said good job, and good luck, and please introduce
shiatsu to lots of people.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Just got on the train on platform 4; it has more seats available, so perhaps I can leave
earlier than 11:40, <em>and</em> have elbow room.</p>

<p>After my shiatsu lesson, I went to see Leslie at her place to give her a shiatsu session.  She
gave me a 30 minute session (she does massage as well), bought me lunch, and gave me 1000 yen.  I
was hoping for more on the cash side, but her payment was nice, delicous, and cash.</p>

<p>Then hung out for a bit in Shibuya area watching Project Camelot's interview of David Icke</p>

<p>before meeting Andrew for a moment to get 30,000 yen from him so I can pay my rent (basically I
didn't want to wait for Naoki to pay, though as of 10pm, he apparently deposited the money, so I'll
get it tomorrow apparently, and be able to do the bank transfer to pay my rent.  Need to focus on
that tomorrow).</p>

<p class="date">11:35pm JST</p>

<p>Train just left.  I essentially have elbow room.  woooo</p>

<p>Then a lesson with Akiko who speaks French (as opposed to Akiko our best English speakin' student
at EV), and helped her with a translation thing, and 3000 lovely yen from her.</p>

<p>THEN to The Pink Cow to watch a play called _The Pink Cow_, written by Alec, who
wrote <a href="http://www.crossroadscountry.com/">Crossroads Country</a>, a play about the history
of Afghanistan from 1970s to 2002, which includes, apparently, 6000 quotes from 100 real players in
the real story.</p>

<p>I gave him a DVD of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=loose+change+2nd+edition">Loose Change</a>.</p>
