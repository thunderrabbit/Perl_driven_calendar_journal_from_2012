<p>Saw Oliver! with Soness, Pushpa, Tomoko and Johnny yesterday.  Can't really say Johnny was with
our group exactly, but I sat by him in the front row stage right, and the three others sat across
the aisle in stage center seats.  Johnny was the lead actor in _Forum_ last year.  He vaguely
remembered having taken pictures with U-Cow after one of the shows.</p>

<p>Oliver! was great, and the first time I had ever seen it performed anywhere.  Afterward I hug-met
Kelly H (who I know from Soness' BBQ), Lou (my friend Louise from back in Gaba days), who directed
the show, Caitlin (big applause tonight) and Gemma (soft g sound) out with whom Ami and I went for
drinks last year after _Forum_.  Also met E, Ken, and a man named Nate who thought I looked
familiar, but I'm not sure that I've met him before.  Gave him my card though.</p>

<p>I wore a suit to fit the scene, and left my shtuffs at Soness' crib, so basically had to go back
to her house in Chigasaki last night to bring my stuff home today.</p>
