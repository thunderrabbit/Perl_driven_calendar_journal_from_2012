HI 

Thank you for your interest in the Cow-Go Creative Language Network!

My name is Rob Nugen; I'm the English-side coordinator for Cow-Go.  We had a little pause in winter, but are back in the process of creating the network of teachers and students so everyone can have fun while sharing language!

Please email cow-go@thepinkcow.com if you are still interested in meeting with prospective students through Cow-Go.  We're putting teacher profiles up on our Cow-Go website (currently through a service called "Keep And Share," but soon to be moved to cow-go.com).  Once we get your email, we'll send you an invitation to Keep And Share so you can put up a profile advertising your awesome talents!

So far we have had teachers offer to teach the following: English, Japanese, Guitar, Vocal, Bass, Drums, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, Russian, Photography, Martial Arts, Computer, Portuguese, Hip-Hop Slang, Art/Art History, and Design!

    Cheers
    - Rob

Cow-Go English Coordinator
