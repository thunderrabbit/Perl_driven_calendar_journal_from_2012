<p>Been testing MadMimi for sending The Pink Cow emails.  If you wanna use them, please email me
for the link so we can get the referral.  I'd post the link now, but not online at the moment.</p>

<p>The emails MadMimi produces will be much *much* cleaner than the ones Traci has been sending for
the past years that I've been on the list.  I know that will help with the message size.  I'll have
to show her that as a good point, cause she won't be able to use stuff like

<pre>
&lt;span style=&quot;text-color #043234; text-font 'Argentina Bold', 'San Serif',
'Courrier'&gt;howdy!&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>

<p>to markup the message.  Not that she *has* necessarily, but I've seen some big/bold/colored
headings in various parts of past messages.  Hopefully this will actually improve sendability and
user retention rate.</p>

<p>Now just gotta work out a system to make it easy for her to send the messages.</p>
