<p>Helped Jasmine and her student Tomoko get started, but actually Soness was the most help with
her excellent realtime translation.  I really love how she really translates in realtime, even
though the grammars are different, she can align them so they work out correctly.  It's really cool
to watch and listen.</p>

<p>Helped Soness with her questions about how to handle her computer's lack of HD space.  I
basically recommended she get an external drive because she wants to do some podcasts so I figure
she'll need some realtime access, and not just massive storage.</p>
