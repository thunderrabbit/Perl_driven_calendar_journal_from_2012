<p>I just counted 1100 (binary) * 100 (decimal) + 80 (decimal) steps from gate 31 to gate 4 in
Haneda airport.  My <em>seat</em> is on row 31.  But my gate is at gate 4.</p>

<p>I'm glad I got here plenty early.  And super glad that I made it through security with my
salinated dihydrogen oxide.  I put it in my pocket (400ml left in a 500ml bottle), assuming it
would not set off any alarms.  It didn't.  But my belt buckle did (I'm from Texas and have a belt
buckle the size of Texas to prove it (*)).</p>

<p>(*) not</p>

<p>But I forgot about the belt buckle and pulled my saline out of my pocket all thinking &quot;damn
can it really detect it??&quot; but no; I set off the alarm again and discovered it was my belt
buckle.  I hadn't needed to pull out my saline.  I was gonna be pissed if they were like, &quot;oh
you can't bring this through..&quot; I had visions of pouring it all over the floor and the whole
airport, and other visions of sitting them down for a good ol' heart to heart about how this
security crap is a farce to control us, and other visions, oh nevermind; she gave the bottle back
and sent me on my way.  I put it back in my bag as they scanned a half full 200 ml water bottle for
its explosive characteristics.  Oh it's water.  It can only be used to power cars and the like.</p>

<p>Also glad that I didn't need my passport, cause I don't have it.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  Just wanted to say it's 1280 steps from Gate 31 to Gate 4 in
Haneda.</p>
