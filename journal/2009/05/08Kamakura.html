<p>Have just visited πæ•Œ≈Á (Enoshima), a little island off the coast of Kamakura, a little coast
south of Tokyo, with Traci's parents, Tom and Vicki.</p>

<p>Have been greatly enjoying relaxed meanderings and pictures of U-Cow, including one with a woman
who called herself Yuko, though I imagine she just gave me a name that I couldn't track, unlike
Uncle Cow.  She was making octopus chips, and when I went over to see what she was doing, she
commented on U-Cow and we talked a bit.</p>

<p>Anyway, Tom, though he says he can't write novels because he's so used to writing consise
reports, loves telling stories.  Just need to transcribe them and we'd have a novel quickly enough!
Vicki likes to wander a bit more than Tom, and seems to be happily distracted with pretty, unique,
interesting, or otherwise noteworthy things.  In their relationship, perhaps she's the photographer,
and he's the story teller.</p>

<p>They've lived in Brazil (Porto Alegre (which is not on the sea)), and also in Buenos Aires.</p>
