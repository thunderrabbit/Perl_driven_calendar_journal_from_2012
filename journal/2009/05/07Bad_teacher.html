<p>Ah frack.  I realized this morning that I haven't checked Yurika's homework from this week.
Dang.  I've always tried to finish it within 24 hours, but with the Talks I've been having with
Ami, and the stress I've felt financially, I totally blanked.</p>

<p>And so, ironically, our lesson will be cancelled for tonight, so that's 3000 yen I won't be
getting.</p>
