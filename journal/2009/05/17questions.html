<p>Soness asked about my reasons for not drinking, and part of the story included how in high school
I was never invited to the drinking parties.  That conversation branched off to me being in rifle
corps and some guys saying I was gay cause of that (which I'm not).  Soness goes, &quot;well you
can't gloss over that so quickly,&quot; given that I've told her of the times I've been with men.  I
explained, however, that those experiences were essentially guys performing on me, and one of the
times I was paid $100 for the experience.</p>

<p>&quot;So basically you'd be a prostitute,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm, well, yeah, except for concerns about disease.&quot;  STDs are basically my only
concern in that arena.  &quot;I have considered being a porn star; I understand they are pretty
careful about that kinda stuff.&quot;</p>
