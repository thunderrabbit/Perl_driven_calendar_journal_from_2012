<p>So far today I've removed the Google ads from The Pink Cow website, and cleaned up a bit of
broken javascript that was miscopied on some of the pages.  The pages are all constructed with
tables and ばっかり em attributes, so from where I removed the ads a large space remains.  It's not
horrible looking, but certainly not optimal.  I might clean that up next, but Ami has asked if I
will meet her from 2pm instead of 3pm.  So I said I'd like to finish at 6pm instead of 7pm.</p>
