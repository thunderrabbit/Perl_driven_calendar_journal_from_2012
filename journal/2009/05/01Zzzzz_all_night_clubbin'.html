<p>Sho invited me to see him in Labo.  11pm in the door for 1000 yen, and I danced all crazy.  Met
Aya, tall with pink boots and pink hat, who kept giving me bits of her drink (as a reward for
dancing so crazily?).  She drunkenly assured me that next time we meet, she'll accept my namecard,
but not today.  Met Nana, a friend of Sho's, petite wearing all white.  Met Orie, big smile and big
camera.  Met Ayako, with big smile and said she'll call me about massage.  Met Yoshi, who performed
starting around 2:45am.  Met a couple of great dancin' guys, but didn't get their names very
effectively.</p>

<p>Then we headed to Velour.  Sho covered my part of the taxi.  Free entry into Velour by Sho
knowing the doorman.  Didn't stay very long, but picked up some more of Sho's posse.</p>

<p>Then walked to Oath.  Free entry cause it's free. Didn't stay very long.</p>

<p>Then walked to Soft, where the music was anything but soft.  They charged us 500 yen each to get
in, and I offered 480 yen, &quot;it's not 500, but it's close!&quot; and they let me in.  Met Emu,
who was padding around in stocking feet.  Met her boyfriend Hiyoshi, who played djembe.  Gave both
of them my business cards; Hiyoshi said he'll contact me.  Danced with a tall girl in black and
white, but never spoke a word with her.</p>

<p>It had been dark when we went in to Soft, and a bit past dawn when I headed out, leaving Sho and
posse behind.  Tiredness had taken over any networking plans.</p>

<p>Took the 5:40am train home, and set my phone alarm for 6am.  It woke me up exactly at Musashi
Kosugi.  Walked home after stopping briefly for bananas, granola, and soy milk.  Arrived at my house
just behind Bastian (who lives in 202, across the hall from me (in the biggest room in the house,
dangit), and who had just been out in Shibuya all night at The Hub till 2am, and then karaoke till
5am).</p>
