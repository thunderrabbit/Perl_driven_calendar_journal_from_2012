<p>Finished with the UER meeting.  As is often the case lately, I didn't want to be there at first,
but, as is always the case, I was glad to have been there afterward.</p>

<p>Learned a little bit about Irish history to augment my all but zero knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Can you list three countries that start with the letter D?</p>
