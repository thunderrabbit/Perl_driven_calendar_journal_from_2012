<p>Headed to Apple Store Ginza for a Poken Night from 6pm to 7.  Not sure what it will entail, but
I've got my poken in case anyone wants to buy 'em.</p>

<p class="date">7:19pm JST Sunday 24 May 2009 (day 14305)</p>

<p>I tweetcasted the presentation to the best of my ability.  It was essentially all in Japanese, of
course, but with the slideshow presentation, I was pretty much able to understand all but the
Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Talked to Peter and Rob after the event; they are interested in our ideas of incorporating Poken
with Japan Music Week; I'ma set up that meeting soon.</p>
