<p>I now have a Pink Cow email address.  Traci wasn't receiving emails from one of her addresses,
and I looked to see what was up and the forwarding was going to some strange addresses.  I added
her personal address to the list, but need to talk to Nao about what it *should* be, etc.</p>

<p>He was supposed to hook me up with admin access to the Cow-Go website, but I haven't been
notified that he's done as much.</p>
