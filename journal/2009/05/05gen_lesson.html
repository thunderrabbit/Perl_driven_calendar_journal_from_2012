<p>ホーリーシーット！</p>

<p>OMG this is realllly cool!  Gen, my lovely first student through
Cow-Go, <em>translated</em> (*) the book <em>_Getting_Things_Done_</em>, and its successor, and is now
contracted to translate <em>_Making_It_All_Work_</em>.  Wowowowwwwwwwwwww!</p>

<p>(*) supervised the translation of</p>

<p>So funny that he was like, &quot;yeah, so here is the text, &quot; and placed a new hardcover
copy of <em>Making It All Work</em> on the table, where it stood proudly with its new straight and
sturdy binding, &quot;and have you help me with pronunciation, etc,&quot; ... and then near the end
of our hour, when he deemed one of the paragraphs a bit boring, I was like, &quot;actually I love
this text and want to read it,&quot; he goes, &quot;Oh really?  Well, I'm actually somewhat of an
expert at this system, so if you have any questions...&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;An expert?  Really?  How do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I translated the first two books,&quot; etc and I was like, &quot;dood!&quot; and
upon my request, he told me the longer story.  It turns out the first book was translated crappily
by a different company (which subsequently went out of business), and so after Gen's successful
translation of the second book, plus the GTD system gaining popularity, <em>plus</em> the other
company's bankruptcy freeing its rights to the translation, Gen was asked to translate
the <em>first</em> book as well.</p>

<p>So, wow!</p>

<p>This, Soness pointed out via phone, is exactly what I've been wanting: an answer to the
neverending question, &quot;what do I do right now?&quot;</p>
