<p>Simon didn't seem to make it to the green train car by Hachiko by 1:36 so I went to Labi to show
Soness what kind of external HD options were available, and the difference between GB and TB.  Ate
indian buffet and she headed off to her practice in Shinjuku.  (I'm still in the buffet.)  Have
arranged to work in Soness' garden again on Sunday.  Might go on Saturday night to get an easier
early start on Sunday.</p>

<p>Next will call Andrew to meet him and repay 30,000 yen, and then meet Traci at The Pink Cow
about email and/or Cow-Go stuff.  Meeting Jasmine at 7:30 about Cow-Go stuff, and then heading home
sometime thereafter. </p>

<p>Need to cancel the gyoza party for Saturday.  It was inappropriate for me to ask Ami to switch
to friend-mode while I'm trying to break up with her.</p>
