<p>Naoki, who I met through <a href="http://www.cow-go.com/">Cow-Go</a>, and I, who I've been
meeting daily for years now, will have our first real lesson today in Omori.  He'll be heading to
Stanford soon, and wishes to take two lessons per week for the next 2 months.  That's great news for
my income; (disregarding travel expenses) the lessons will pay for 1/3 of my rent/utilities for two
months.</p>

<p>Good first lesson, talking about his trip to Stanford and his Qs about checking and savings
accounts in the US and his wife considering going to school at Stanford while he's there researching
ways of teaching computers how to understand lots of information.</p>

<p>Switched to topic of computers and Mediawiki, Pukiwiki (popular in Japan), and PBwiki (not sure
of its merits).. and then was telling him about my ongoing evaluation of Drupal, which is looking
generally good.  He made some suggestions for what we need on Cow-Go website.</p>

<p>THEN, when it came time to pay he whipped out his wallet and asked if he could pay in advance
via bank transfer.  10 lessons = 30,000 yen, exactly the amount I planned to borrow from Andrew to
pay my rent this month.</p>

<p><em>exactly the amount I planned to borrow from Andrew to pay my rent this month</em></p>

<p>If Naoki pays tomorrow or Tuesday, it's exactly the amount I won't have to borrow from Andrew to
pay my rent this month.   Awesome!!!!!</p>
