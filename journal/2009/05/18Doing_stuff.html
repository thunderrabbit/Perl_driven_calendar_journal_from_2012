<p>Woke up, wrote morning pages (in preparation for doing The Artist's Way), drank breakfast drink
and helped clean up a bit.  Soness asked if I could use her old printer (probably), and if I'd take
it to the convenience store to see what it would cost to ship it to my house.  I didn't do that today,
but did take home her old computer (Macbook G4 (my third!)) and some books, and *just* missed the
train (by two minutes) to get to JMW meeting on time.</p>

<p>Made an appointment with Soness' English speaking dentist after the cap from my non-English
speaking dentist fell out *again*, but this time down into the sink trap when I rinsed out my mouth.
Soness loaned me 15,000 yen to pay for that.  I really look forward to ample money via my own hard
work (and/or CPC).</p>

<p>Speaking of hard work, I got the drupal installation on my site to
display <a href="http://php.robnugen.com/drupal_2009may8,_v6.11/date-browser/2009-05">a calendar</a>
via the Date_Browser module that I was able to install
via <a href="http://www.drupaltherapy.com/node/76">Sean's excellent Date+Calendar screencast
tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The next steps for this are basically to do everything I just did, but use real data, and put it
on cow-go.com.  I've only got FTP access to that server (gah), but I think drupal, my knowledge of
it, and my permissions on the server are robust enough to get it all set up no worries.</p>

<p>For some reason, Ed has asked that we have a tighter core meeting than we've been having
before.  Therefore Soness and the people she's invited are invited not to attend.  Wha?</p>
