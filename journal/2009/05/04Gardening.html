<p>After a leisurely wake up at 9 or 10, we had breakfast of supergreenfoodspirulina and then after
ª‘¿Ó§µ§Û arrived to help Soness clean out her closets, Soness got me started outside, giving me an
overview of what she wanted to happen in her garden.  I started with pulling up some of the larger
plants, and then went to work on the bamboo.  This particular brand of bamboo features runners about
6 inches under, and I basically dug up a small network of runners spanning about 10 linear feet.</p>

<p>As a bonus, I got a blister on the palm of my hand, which I didn't notice until it ripped.  Got
some gloves from the local pharmacy type store (and some Calpis and dried mango), and Soness made
gourmet popcorn (basil for ª‘¿Ó§µ§Û, and parmesian for good measure), all of which Jen, ª‘¿Ó§µ§Û,
Soness and I enjoyed while Ben was zonked upstairs.  (He can sleep during the day, but not at night
unless it's completely quiet or white-noisy.)</p>

<p>Back to work on the garden, where I finished pulling up the bamboo runner I had started and got
started on stuff around the little carved rock pond.  Trimmed the bamboo near the fence in
preparation to pull it all out, but then Soness was like, &quot;oh you can leave that bamboo.&quot;
Ah.  Well, good thing I didn't raze its shoots or raise its runners.</p>

<p>More foodage and then it was essentially a good place for me to stop; there's still a significant
amount of work to be done next time or next two times.  Will have to sort out a time that I can come
down; Soness won't likely be there for the next few weeks though.  Work work work.</p>

<p>Bye to Ben and Jen and Soness; on the train now, about to arrive in Yokohama.</p>
