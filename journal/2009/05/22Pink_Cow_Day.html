<p>I've been in Pink Cow all day today with 4 cute songs in my iPhone earbuds for some hours; I've
pretty much got the melodies of those four hardest songs memorized.</p>

<p>Working on Cow-Go, massaged Vicki at 3pm, got free buffet for all my hard Cow-Go work.</p>

<p>Cow-Jam is jammin' right now, and I'm packing my shtuffs to give some more table space to paying
customers.</p>

<p>Crazybusy day tomorrow, and meeting Ami on Sunday at 11am; she's coming to get her stuff and
return my key.</p>
