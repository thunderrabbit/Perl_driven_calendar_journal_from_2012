<p>My 4 of 5 star review for <a href="http://access.nin.com/download/">NIN: Access</a></p>

<pre>
So awesome that Trent has released ALL his albums freely through NIN Access! With all the albums,
plus playlists based on the 'genre' of NIN music (Singles / Deep Cuts/ Quiet / Heavy ) and even
NINJA 2009 Playlist, plus all the best and worst of remix.nin.com, you can be immersed in NINage
for-e-ver.

Tons of images and videos from the current tour, live updates, forum and messaging with NINnies from
around your area, this app has got it all, with more to come!

I would give 5 stars, but some of the albums don't seem to stream properly. The Fragile (left and
right), Things Falling Apart, AATCHB.S all crash the app after not streaming. Most of the rest
stream correctly.

Some rough edges, but the app is FREE. Do you get this, people? Trent is bucking the industry,
embracing the social web, streaming free music, encouraging participation of fans. Get this app and
support Trent supporting us with free music.
