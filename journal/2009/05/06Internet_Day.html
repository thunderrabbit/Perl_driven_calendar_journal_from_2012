<p>Basically been online all day, spending a lot of time signing up for various things, of those I
found today, <a href="http://eu1.badoo.com/">Badoo</a> seems the most interesting.  For making
images online, <a href="http://aviary.com/home">Aviary</a> looks pretty cool.</p>

<p>Most of the other sites I found were basically undifferentiable, and/or too wordy in explaining
all their wonderful features.</p>

<p>Chatted with Colleenie Beanie for a while, and then Skyped her for a bit over an hour until she
was zonkingly ready for sleepytime.  Regarding Ami, Colleen provided the same analysis as I had
already determined, but with one added bonus bit I hadn't previously heard.  When a woman asks
impossible-to-answer questions, tell her it's an impossible to answer question, and not answer until
it's rephrased as an answerable question.</p>

<p>And in other news, I recently fixed the DB problem that killed ctbriefs, so
now <a href="http://ctbriefs.net/">CTbriefs.nET</a> is working again.  I even added a URL detector
so URLs can be hyperlinked.</p>
