<p>I don't have lab test results yet, but I have a sense of what the clinical trial will be like.
They've got a floor allocated for the trial participants, with eight beds in each of three rooms,
and three TVs in the main room, next to the nurses' station, and then four shower-bath combos on
one side of the building.  Anyway, hopefully it will be nice.</p>
