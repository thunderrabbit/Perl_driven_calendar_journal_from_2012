<p>Soness sent me her old printer/scanner!!!!</p>

<p>The delivery guys called me while I was on the train, but really close to my house.  I happened
to see a delivery truck in the neighborhood as I walked up several minutes later.  I was like,
&quot;I'm Rob Nugen,&quot; and the guy was like, &quot;oh!&quot; and got the box for me.  Great
synchronicity!</p>
