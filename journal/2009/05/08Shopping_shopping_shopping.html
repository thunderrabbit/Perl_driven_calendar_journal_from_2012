<p>I'm chillin' outside the super market watching the bags while Tom and Vicki are inside shopping
for foodage we'll prepare at chez Soness soon.</p>

<p>They bought me a necklace with a stone pendant with a rabbit on it!  The rabbit is carved in
relief (everything *around* the rabbit is carved down a bit).  Sweet!</p>
