<p>Met Miwa in Omori at 10am for our intro-lesson.  She seems keen (and signed up), but doesn't yet
know when she will have time to schedule her first lesson.  Maybe she wants to have a non-me
teacher. No worries; I want all our students to have the perfect match for a teacher!</p>

<p>Met Naoki at 11am in Omori for our 5th lesson or so.  4th or 5th I think.  We talked about the
Kindle, the focus of an article by Tim O'Reilly.  Wondered about different ways electronic books
can change the face of the medium.  I liked O'Reilly's point that the current Kindle is like
pointing a camera at a stage performance and calling it a movie.</p>

<p>Naoki and I thought about different ways, from Interactive Fiction, to stories being read aloud
by computer generated voices of the different characters in the book.  No one steal my idea,
okay?</p>

<p>Then zoom up to Shibuya to meet Shuntaro for our first intro-lesson.  He actually signed up with
Cow-Go and scheduled our first lesson for this Saturday.  For homework, he'll be writing a blog in
English; I hope he chooses a site that has English navigation.</p>

<p>Headed to Tachikawa now for RC meeting.</p>
