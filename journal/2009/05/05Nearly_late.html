<p>Had to run to catch my train for my shiatsu lesson..  Ami was all zonked out until just as I was
about to leave and then I'm like &quot;what do you wanna do today?&quot; and she goes,
&quot;talk&quot; and I'm like &quot;aight&quot; after a pause, and then, &quot;aight I also want to
talk but I've also got some other stuff to do like keep up with email, Cow-Go, JMW, and I have a
student at 9pm.</p>

<p>Then when I go to give her a hug, she stood like a pole, which certainly doesn't seem huggy to
me, so when she goes, &quot;no kiss?&quot;  I'm like wtf but relaxed a smidge and was able to tell
her, &quot;when you don't respond to my hug, it feels like a Tokyo wave (*), and I certainly am not
interested in pursuing more.&quot;</p>

<p>The overall situation, plus Ami's mannerisms, remind me so much of Hitomi.  Not in a なつかしい
way, but in a omg not again way.</p>
