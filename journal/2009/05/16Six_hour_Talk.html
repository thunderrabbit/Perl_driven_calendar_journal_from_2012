<p>Wasn't actually six hours talk, but six hours taken with meditative preparation, talking,
crying, talking, anger, talking, and then a bit of chilling after Ami went home.</p>

<p>Don't know that the conversation was particularly useful.  I'm still adamant about wanting to
break up because I have given all I want to give, and she's still adamant about her inability to
break up because she loves me.  She basically presented an idea that we stay in a hobbled
relationship that may mean we meet once a week, or may not, and will include no sex (at my request
cause that's a core internal issue I'd like to address), and will mean Ami doesn't say anything if
I wanna stay home or go out or anything not including her.</p>

<p>AND, I told her I think it's really really really really important for her to get some support in
Japanese regarding her mom's death, and her dad's alcohol<del>ism</del> <ins>consumption</ins>.</p>

<p>AND, I told her I can't give her an answer immediately.  I've got to meditate on this and decide
if there's any value in the planet to continue a relationship that I've already declared I don't
want to resucitate.</p>

<p>Her side, as per my understanding, includes: I've never worked on the relationship as a couple,
but only as myself; I'm cruel to expect her to change from relationship to friend or nothing, given
that she can do neither; she'd rather die than lose me (I don't think that's literally true); maybe
other stuff.  I guess we should have written down the key points.</p>

<p>Near the end, and against my previous request, she asked if she can kiss me.  I didn't really
relish it.</p>
