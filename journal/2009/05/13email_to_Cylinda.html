Hey Cylinda

Last night was listening to Project Camelot's interview of David Icke, a man who had some profound experiences related to the nature of reality.  What most people think of as "reality," he describes as a hologram in our minds.

He's essentially referring to a tipping point as well!

Strictly speaking, I have not had an interest in astrology.  I've not gotten over my question of how planets "out there" can affect me "in here"

But if I also believe we are all one, etc, then of course everything is related.

I won't ask you to sell me on astrology, but I'd be interested in reading a FAQ that addresses this question and others, if you know of one.

I've been hanging out semi-regularly at The Pink Cow, helping launch Cow-Go, the Creative Language Network of The Pink Cow!

Would you be interested in teaching astrology to people?  The general idea: after they pay 5000 yen registration, students pay 3000 yen per month to The Pink Cow to get a 10% discount-card at The Pink Cow, plus ability to choose from teachers via Cow-Go.

Students pay 3000 yen per lesson directly to the teacher.

      Blessings
       - Rob!
