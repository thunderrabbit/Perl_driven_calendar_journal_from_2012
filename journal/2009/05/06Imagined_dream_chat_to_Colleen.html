"And then 25 years later, I was almost 40 and we were doing this thing called 'chat' on something
called Facebook that's part of this huge network of 'computers' which are like machines that seem
smart but actually don't have brains and so anyway, there was a thing called an image, well actually
two, and these images included images inside them of like a moment in time that was from *before*
the moment during which the chat was taking place, and you were cleaning your 'teeth' with this
little hand held device with some friends, and then when I wrote a 'comment' on the image using my
own connection to the network of 'computers,' there was an error, and the comment was erased and
then I knew I was dreaming and I woke up."
