<p>Met Naoki at 5pm; he signed up for Cow-Go, and scheduled four lessons with me over the next two
weeks, with a likely 12 lessons over the six weeks after that!</p>

<p>Chilling and eating (*) the buffet, waiting for Soness, Ben and Jen to arrive, I met Jodi, who
knew one of the performers in tonight's Cow-Jam..  Actually didn't get to talk to her too long;
Traci invited me to meet her mom(!), who's cool as well as in town, given that I facingly met her in
The Pink Cow.</p>

<p>(*) I wanted an adverb before eating so it could be &quot;chillingly eating&quot; (**)</p>

<p>(**) Ben points out I had no worries so I was carelessly eating the buffet!  hahaha</p>

<p>Traci's mom, whose name I don't know, seemed well-traveled and quite interested in the ISIS work
I've done with Clairvision, as well as work with my men's group.  She's from Cali, has lived in
Brazil (and probably other places, ¤«¤Ê) and I look forward to seeing her again during the month
that she'll be here!</p>

<p>Soness sat for a chat and a impromptu hand reading, during which T-mom said, &quot;wow; very
interesting!&quot; a lot, until Soness was pulled away by her friend who needed to leave within 20
minutes.</p>

<p><del>Lindsey</del> <ins>Leslie</ins> arrived and gave me a bit of a shouldery massage while I was
talking to T-mom, and then we (Leslie and I) switched places, and then Soness came back all,
&quot;hey when am I going to get *my* massage?&quot; So I gave her a massage while we watched the
end of David's performance featuring Yes-C on drums, and Ben's entire performance, featuring David
on drums.</p>
