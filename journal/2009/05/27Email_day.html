<p>Today, the most productive thing I completed that had been on my tasklist was to sign Traci up
for Madmimi, giving her friend Lauren the referral.  In doing so, I e-met Lauren, who seems like a
pretty cool Tokyo-ite, given that her name and email showed up as coordinator for several different
things in Tokyo (democrats abroad), <em>and</em> in BarCamp which I just recently added to my list
of things to check out when I get time.</p>

<p>If my offline gmail would do the right thing, I'll, ah there it goes.  Okay, this is the end of
the email I wrote to Lauren:</p>

In searching for your email address online, I found you associated with BarCamp, which is something
I just recently noticed and put in the back of my mind as a possibly neat thing to attend ...
Interesting that you're already involved!  Wow!

   Have a great day!

<p>In other news, I need to send my resume to Andrew. One sec.  Ah crap I can't add attachments in
gmail offline. But I saved a draft so I'll do it later.</p>

<p>In other news, I chatted with Fred; he's going to UK for a conference regarding the stuff of
which is PhD is made.  Holy shiza we're in Hanzomon already!!  Good thing I didn't type past my
station!</p>

<p>Gah.  Fun, but not done.  Just changed the medicine at the bottom of my root-less canal, and
then will do the same next week and <em>then</em> the next week seal it up and call it done.</p>
