<p>Have been looking for open source projects that will allow Cow-Go students to interact with
their teachers, and perhaps to keep track of lessons...  I'm thinking it'll have to be really
simple or really custom made.  I think I'll talk to Gen about it today.</p>

<p>Have looked at Zimbra, dotProject, Dolphin, Joomla, and a few others.</p>
