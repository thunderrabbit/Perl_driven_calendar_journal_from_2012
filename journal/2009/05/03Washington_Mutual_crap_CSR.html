Hello kind person

I want you to know my concern and anger is *not* addressed with you.

However, I'm really really really really getting angry about the horrible level of service I have
received from this bank.

As soon as I get my Master Account thing signed and sent in to you, I am absolutely closing my
accounts because the CSR level has turned to absolute and utter tripe in the past few months.

Most recently, I requested a payment be made to my credit card for $10.  The transaction failed
because you don't have my Master Account thing.  Fine.

BUT FUCKING TELL ME GODDAMMIT!!!!  Now I have to fucking pay my credit card a fucking extra fee
because your shitfaced fucked up fucking system didn't let me fucking know it conveniently decides
to NOT PAY THEM!  FUCK!!

I'm fucking pissed and I'm fucking closing my account.

I imagine that I "can't" (*) close my account until you get my Master Account thing signed, and I
hope you guys enjoy the interest you're getting while keeping my money hostage.

I'll get the form signed.  I'll send it to you.

Then I will get my money OUT, and you will *never* ever see any money from me again unless you do
something REALLY REALLY useful to win back my faith in your customer service ability.

And unless something really really good happens soon, this message is going onto my blog and
Facebook and my journal and links on twitter, usenet and everything else I can think of.

<p>(*) I put &quot;can't&quot; in quotes, not as emphasis, but to emphasize it's only due to their
rules that I'd be unallowed to close the account.  So pissed about this.</p>
