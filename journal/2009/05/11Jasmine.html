<p>Met in smoke-filled McDonald's in Toritsu-Daigaku with Jasmine about Cow-Go stuffs, just to get
her sorted before her first lesson tomorrow at The Pink Cow.</p>

<p>The prominent non-smoking sign actually means no smoking on Saturday, Sundays and Holidays, from
10am to 6pm.</p>

<p>Jasmine, from Toronto, is funny, but thinks I'm serious when I'm just joking.  She seemed to like
Uncle Cow, though.  I look foward to chatting with her more.</p>
