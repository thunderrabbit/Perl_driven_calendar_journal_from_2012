<p>We arrived at chez Soness around 7:20pm, and had just gotten a good start on dinner after Vicki
went over each of the available spices, and found some bread crumbs to bread the chicken, and I
found some (grapeseed) oil in which it could be sizzled.  Soness arrived home around 7:50pm and
Vicki prepared a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, avacado, and Soness made a vinegar dressing with her
cool supergreenfood/spirulina breakfast shaker.</p>

<p>Salad was lovely, and then the chicken was great, served over something-like-rice-but-not-rice,
with a thick sauce over everything.  Soness and I were like &quot;mmmm this sauce is great!&quot;
and Vicki was all, &quot;it's the grapeseed oil!&quot; and we were like, &quot;wow!&quot; and it
went on like that. Soness got the pan with sauce left in the bottom, handed it to me all, &quot;oh
this is great; you should try it!&quot; and then snagged the last piece of chicken from the table
cause it hadn't been eaten yet.</p>

<p>I slurped up all the grapeseed oil sauce, wondering how it reacted with the chicken fat to make
such a delicious sauce.</p>

<p>THEN we had broccoli  soup, which had been blended into an o-so-delicioso puree featuring chunks
of broccoli and man it was gooood!!!</p>

<p>Dishes time ensued; Tom and I tried to kick Vicki and Soness (mostly Vicki cause mostly she
cooked) out of the kitchen so we could wash the dishes, and it was during that process (of washing,
not kicking,) that a funny conversation occurred between Vicki and Soness:</p>

<p>Vicki: &quot;and yeah so I just breaded them and threw them into the grapeseed oil..&quot;</p>

<p>Soness: &quot;You breaded them?  With what?&quot;</p>

<p>Vicki: &quot;with this bag of breadcrumbs; is that not okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Soness: &quot;Oh! That's brown sugar.  I was going to say, 'cause I don't have any breadcrumbs,'
but that explains it.&quot;</p>

<p>SO NOW, we present to you the secret of deliciously sweet breaded chicken:</p>

<pre>
instead of bread crumbs, use brown sugar.

<p>After that, we had bananas frizzled in the magic grapeseed oil by Soness topped with delicous
vanilla Haagen Daaz ice creammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.</p>
