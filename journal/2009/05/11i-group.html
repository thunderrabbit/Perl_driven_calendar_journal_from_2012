<p>In I-group, I basically talked about my fear around having apparent low cash flow.  My advice
from my higher self was basically: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>pay your rent.  Borrow the money from Andrew and pay it</p></li>

<li><p>Understand even if you lose everything, you are still safe and okay.</p></li>

<li><p>Remember you've got some cash coming in this week</p></li>

<li><p>You're doing the right things.  Keep promoting your skillz and networking</p></li>

<li><p>Believe in yourself and your skillz</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm supposed to send to Michael a link to the book _The Artists Way_; he'll buy it and let me
read it first, then I'll give it back to him.</p>
