<p>Chillin' in the clinic, about to get X-rays; we've done blood test, and EKG.</p>

<p class="date">11:00am JST</p>

<p>Now, after having free breakfast at Royal Host, we're back in the clinic waiting for our
respective turns to do turns on the treadmill (a device with a rotating belt used for exercise (so
it says on the form)), designed to slowly get our heart rates up to a certain amount above our
resting rate, and make sure some other aspect of our EKG stays steady.</p>
