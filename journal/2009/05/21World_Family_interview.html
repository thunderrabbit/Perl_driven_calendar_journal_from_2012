<p>Met <del>Zak and Sara</del> <ins>Zacharee and Sarah</ins> with Martin interviewing us all at
World Family today!  They both seem cool, and I'm sure we'll all get the jobs, as part time as they
may be.  Awesome!  There's a decent unpaid training period (learing 81 songs), but once we're in,
the pay is nice, as part time as it may be.</p>
