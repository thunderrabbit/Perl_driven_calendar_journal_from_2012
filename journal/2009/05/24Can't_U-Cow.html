<p>Just went to ドンキホーテー, where they no longer sell cows shaped like U-Cow.  Dang.  The dude
said something about blah blah blah when I asked if there were any stores.  His blahblahbla
included a reference to たんと which I believe means head honcho, so perhaps these cows aren't even
being manufactured anymore.  Crap.</p>
