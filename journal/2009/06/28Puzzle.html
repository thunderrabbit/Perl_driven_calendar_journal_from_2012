<p>Yesterday I was like, &quot;welp, we better work on this puzzle,&quot; to Jon and so last night
Jon and I invited people to work on the 1500 piece puzzle for an interesting diversion to our days
here.</p>

<p>With 8 people helping overall, but 5 total at a time for 2.5 hours, we had about 15 person-hours
spent on it got 300 pieces placed.  Dang.  Not even close.  Well, close to a good start, but a lot
of the work was forsaken when we had to clean up the dining room table for the night and though Jon
and I were on the same wavelength of carefully moving the pieces upstairs, the Japanese just swept
all the unplaced pieces into the box willynilly and all mostly randomly and chaotic.  Damn.</p>

<p>By mostly-random I mean we could probably find sections of same-color pieces in the 3-D pile if
we were to excavate them like archaelogists, but that would take even more time.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  I uploaded all the pics to my pic distribution email, and I saw them in my inbox (right?)
but I don't see them on twitpic.  Not sure why.</p>
