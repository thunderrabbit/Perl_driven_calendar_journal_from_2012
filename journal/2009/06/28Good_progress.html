<p>Feeling better, and making good progress with Cow-Go site.  I think we'll do it in Joomla!
instead of Drupal or Wordpress.  I basically coudln't find a good enough calendaring thing for
Wordpress, and couldn't even get a good start with Drupal.  BUT, assuming
the <a href="http://joomla.jp/">Japanese version of Joomla!</a> works well, I'm going to go with
it.</p>

<p>Thanks to Soness for helping keep me on track.</p>

<p>Okay, now unzipping the Japanese version of the Joomla tarball (actually it was a .zip file).</p>

<p>I should change this entry to &quot;Great progress!&quot;</p>

<p>I now have the Japanese Joomla! site up, plus all the calendar things installed and working.
Hmmm, thank you Joomla!</p>
