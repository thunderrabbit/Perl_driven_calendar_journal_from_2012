<p>So, like, wow!  I've just had a super productive day, though not totally in a website
construction way...  I finished the Avatar
introduction, <em><a href="http://bookcrossing.com/journal/7293967">Living Deliberately: The
Discovery and Development of Avatar</a></em>, which
introduces <a href="http://www.avatarepc.com/">Avatar, Contributing to the Creation of an
Enlightened Planetary Civilization</a>.  &quot;Sweet!  That's what I'm about,&quot; said I to
Soness, who bought me the book.  &quot;Well,&quot; says she, &quot;there's a course in Australia
this summer.&quot; &quot;Let's do it!!!&quot;</p>
