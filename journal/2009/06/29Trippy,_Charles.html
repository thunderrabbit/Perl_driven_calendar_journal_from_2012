<p>OMG</p>

<p>This, my friends, <em>this</em> is the first day of the internet of the future.  I'm really
really really happy about his project because it's a big indication that the old school method of
media distribution ain't gonna last.  The internets should be free.  Protect them.</p>

<p><a href="http://internetkilledtelevision.com/">http://internetkilledtelevision.com/</a> features
a video per day in the life of Charles Trippy.  Not sure how he funds his life, but he funs it quite
well.  Nice work.</p>

<p>I'm just thinking, &quot;how does he edit his vids so quickly????&quot;  The FAQ says Final Cut
Pro.  I wonder what hardware he's using.</p>

<p>Oohhhhhh  I just watched the first vid; video stuff is apparently his job.  Mmm  makes sense
that he knows how to do it.</p>
