<p>Skyped with Ani tonight; she's doing well with projects there, including some new recordings and
possibly a new art sellin' website for which I told her I'd be happy to produce some art!  She's not
sure that she'll come to Tokyo for JMW, but has been looking into ways to make that happen.  I
showed her <a href="/wiki/Category:Art">some of my artwork online</a>, and she got her Facebook URL
updated to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/anikiko">http://www.facebook.com/anikiko</a> at my
suggestion, and looked at <a href="http://bandcamp.com/">http://bandcamp.com/</a>, which I suggested
after she asked about ways to sell music online.</p>

<p>We scoped and tagged pics from her Japan trip after she uploaded them; nice fun!</p>
