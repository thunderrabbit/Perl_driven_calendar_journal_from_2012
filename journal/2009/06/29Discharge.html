<p>I'm being discharged from the hospital today.  That means I'll be in the hospital til Saturday
and then come back in for final checkup and then go home!</p>

<p>I asked if I can stay in the hospital.  Though we're given a stipend while in the hotel, I'd
rather be able to chat and hang out with Jon et. al.  Well, Jon.  I asked Robert if I can do that,
but the response from the overall staff is no.  Gotta make it the same as everyone else.</p>

<p>I imagine it's gonna be quite hard to stay off pr0n while in the hotel; I'm going to be
essentially in solitary confinement even moreso than when I first came to Japan and had Japanese
flatmates.  I know I know I would be better off if I knew more Japanese but I don't, plus I need to
work on Cow-Go site and get that monkey knocked out finished so we can move on to other projects.</p>

<p>I called Soness so she can be of more emotional support for me in my week &quot;alone&quot; in
Kagoshima.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm packing my shtuff now.</p>

<p>In the middle of packing, I heard from Robert, &quot;we haven't gotten the final decision from
Dr Fukase yet, so you might be leaving today and you might be leaving tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Just had lunch with the guys here, before which I was painting a bit and chatting with Jon who
drew me a map of the area, gave me some metallic ink pens, and registered his new poken which I
gave to him.</p>
