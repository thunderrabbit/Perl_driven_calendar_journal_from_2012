<b>fuji 2 highland</b>

thank you for Fujiphoto!

I brought two boxes of tissues, two boxes (two twobes) of twothpaste,
two towels, and two t-shirts for couchsurfers.

In other news, I paid all the bills except one of the KDDI bills which
was overdue. I'll put it on yer table, no pun intended.

 love love
  Lob!!
