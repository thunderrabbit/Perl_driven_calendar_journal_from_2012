<p>I might be out of the trial in a week; I nearly passed out when they checked my blood pressure.
My theory is that when I stood up quickly after having my supine blood pressure tested, that's what
did it. (*) Cause when I got up earlier in the morning (5:30am) and did it slowly (roll over,
crouched while writing morning pages, sit down to computer and then walk to breakfast at 6:30), I
had no problems.</p>

<p>(*) I had fallen asleep during that 20 minutes and then she was like &quot;okay stand up&quot;
and I stood up.  Did three blood pressures, the first was at 8:23am, and I don't have the data
still/yet.  The second was at 8:24 during which I was feeling woozy and then feeling terrible
during the third at 8:25.</p>

<p>Soon as it was over I had to lie down and the 8:27, 8:28, and 8:44 checks were while I was
supine again.</p>

<pre>
time   pressure    ?  PR   BPM
8:24   103 / 61   72  (A)  114
8:25    72 / 36   41        44
8:27   138 / 68   99  (M)   42
8:28   142 / 90  101        47
8:44   124 / 75   87        59
</pre>

<p>Now, when I first was in the trial, I remember my resting heart rate was about 44, and my
standing was about 76.  After we started taking the medication, my resting was at 76, and my
standing was 110.</p>

<p>I didn't take the medication today, and I think I'm going to be sent home in about a week.</p>

<p>I'm happy about that, but feel a bit guilty.  And Oh So So Hungry right now.  We just ate at
6:30 am and I'm super hungry again.  2.25 hours until lunch.</p>
