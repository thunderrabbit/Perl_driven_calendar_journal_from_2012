<p>Headed out to Kagoshima for a month.</p>

<p class="date">11:38pm JST Wednesday 17 June 2009 (day 14329)</p>

<p>First night we are in the hotel; John &quot;where's my martini?&quot; and I just got back from
his favorite (?) little restaurant, with white tile steps, friendly staff (if you come alone,
they'll sit you with new friends), and lighted toilet (it shows you where to go, and what you
did)!</p>

<p>On the wide screen TV, there was a movie that looked cool at first, but had a weak ending.  I
think the title in English would be _The Day The Earth Stood Still_.</p>
