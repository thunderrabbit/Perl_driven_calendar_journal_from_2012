<p>Rather than try to fill in all the few days I've missed on each specific day, I'll just write a
big blob entry here to summarize.  Basically been based at Chez Soness for the past couple of days,
working on her garden, including installing a fourth vertical fence thing, buying four more shorter
fence things, planting some tomatoes, cucumbers, and two plants I couldn't identify, and removing
some runners for bamboo that's growing in the way. </p>

<p>Was chatting on Skype with Fred during that, and happily using my iPhone to do the chat, though
it got a bit annoying cause I couldn't put the phone in untouchable mode and put it in my pocket
while talking to him.  If I pushed the big top button the call went on HOLD.  Wtf?  Why would they
make it do that by default?  Is there a way to change it?  Dang that is wack.  Fred told me about a
couple of close call bicycle incidents he's had in Austin, and about one that was closer than a
close call.  He's okay, but his bike got a bit messed up.</p>

<p>Corrected Yurika's translation and thought &quot;man wave.google.com will be perfect for
this!!!&quot; and look forward to its introduction this year.  My student Naoki showed me an article
for Wave during our lesson on Saturday, after which instead of going to meet Bob at the
Findateacher.net meeting, I headed back to Chez Soness to chill with Jesse (of the yoga variety, not
my friend Jesse from Gaba) and hopefully play some Scrabble, but we instead ate carbonara sauced
spaghetti and joked about my having mentioned white sauce and spaghetti as the option we did *not*
have the previous day (we had calzones) and lo, it appeared on the menu that day!</p>

<p>Bought twitternovels.com, with the idea of letting people specify @usernames and/or #tags to
identify tweets that can be compiled into a novel.  I hope it's a novel idea with its brightest
days ahead.</p>

<p>Went to JMW meeting today at Ben's Cafe in Takadanobaba.  Soness invited a slew of people and
the meeting freestyle-morphed into a presentation by Jon with a screen behind him (thanks to the
owner Yuriko (?) (dang, I should remember)</p>

<p class="date">11:24am JST Tuesday  2 June 2009 (day 14314)</p>

<p>Okay so now it's tomorrow and I'm headed to a meeting with Jon Lynch, Andrew Shuttleworth and
possibly the Peter and/or Rob and/or Robin from Akoni, Poken distribution in Japan.</p>
