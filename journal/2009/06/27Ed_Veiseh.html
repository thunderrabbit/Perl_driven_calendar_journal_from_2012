<p>I transcribed a journal entry from 1993 that included the day I
met <a href="/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=skate&date=1993/11/19">a dude named Ed</a>, with whom I skated
several times over the years.  He became professional skater Ed Veiseh.  So I just made a little
<a href="/wiki/Peeps:Ed_Veiseh">wiki page for him</a>.  Anyway, this is how the messages went:</p>

<b>Sir Veiseh?</b>

Hey Ed

Are you my favorite skater from back in 1990s in Houston? I'm Rob Nugen, who busted the shit outta
his head next to Party on the Plaza, escaped death and skated again 6 months later.

Joined you at Southside Skate Park a time or two, but never learned how to drop in. hahaha

That is, if you are the you I think you may be.
