<p>Nearly finished moving my stuff to a storage unit near Chez Soness in Chigasaki.  I will likely
crash at her place during the couple of days between moving out of my place in Motosumiyoshi and
going to Kagoshima.</p>

<p>Today I put four (4) bamboo fence things up along the fence around Soness' garden, after taking
down, halving, and tossing the old ones that had been there.  Cutting them in half was funner than
It thought it might be before I did it.</p>

<p>Headed back to Motosumiyoshi now to get another load (close to the end now!) and lugging or
 πı«≠ing it back to storage in Chigs.</p>

<p>Moving can be fun when one has time to do it bit by bit.  Thanks to the local grocery for
supplying ample boxes to store my stuffs.  :-)</p>
