<p>Yikes Stripes I haven't written a</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p>In a while.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I broke up with Ami near the beginning of June.  Sad sad, so sad.  Ripped U-Cow's head off
in Shibuya station, and Traci from The Pink Cow sewed him back together.</p></li>

<li><p>I work with Traci on Cow-Go!</p></li>

<li><p>I'm currently based at Chez Soness.  I moved out of Motosumiyoshi Sakura House on 12 June
2009.  BUT, I'm now living at CPC Clinic in Kagoshima (from 18 June to 18 July, perhaps + 4 days to
see the eclipse on 22 July!</p></li>

<li><p>My finances barely made it (*) to get me to CPC, where they'll be adequately padded for
multiple months of livin'.  (* actually they didn't; I had to borrow 20,000 yen from Andrew to cover
my rent)</p></li>

<li><p>With said finances, I'm planning to go to Clairvision in October - February (perhaps, or
December, depending on what kinda visa I can get) for the Building Team in Hidden Valley.  I need to
buy the KTs (Knowledge Tracks) from CV (Clairvision) so I can essentially be up to speed once I get
there.</p></li>

<li><p>Having a bit of trouble buying the KTs; my credit card's website seems a bit broken when I'm
trying to get a Shopsafe number (for use online), it balks.  Might be cause my credit card is
expired.  Hmmm gotta get to work on that.</p></li>

<li><p>Have several other things on my task list (on the app called Actions on iPhone), the biggest of
all being Cow-Go and Kevin's website, currently hosted at kyotoshaman.dreamhosters.com</p></li>

<li><p>I really hope to get a lot of these items done.  May need to prioritize so I can bang 'em
out.</p></li>

<li><p>Just before coming here, I met with Soness' friend Ross, who has an art-display space where my
art is currently being displayed!  Wow!!  I'm looking forward to inviting people to a show there
sooooon.  Then, on the same day, I met with Soness' friend Christine, an Avatar Master.  The Avatar
program sounds Really Cool, so Soness and I are planning to go to OZ in August to attend!!  OMG
that will be three trips to OZ in one year!</p></li>

<li><p>I gave to Ami the computer I bought from Jason for about 110,000 yen.  Gave it to her free
sorta because I needed to move, she had enjoyed using it, and I felt bad for breaking up with her.
It was kinda a relatively inexpensive divorce of sorts.  Plus Ami had certainly bought a lot of
food for us while we were together.</p></li>

<li><p>My current computer is my white MacBook, with 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo, 2GB 667 MHz DDR2
SDRAM, OS X 10.5.7 and 4.12 Gigs available on 74.21 Gig HD.  And I think there's no pr0n on here
anymore.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access here at CPC is good at times, and bad at others.  They just got it because
someone *cough* went to a different clinical drug trial company and found out *they* have internet
access available.</p></li>

<li><p>My best mate in here is Jon, &quot;Where's My Martini&quot;  We played about 8 games of
Pente last night; he got well-better during the game.</p></li>

<li><p>I-group turnout has been dwindling; Eric checked semi-out over a year ago, Enio has been
living 1/3 time in Japan and 2/3 in China, Kevin has moved to Kyoto, David has been busy with
directing movies, and I am in CPC.  That essentially leaves Michael and Takeshi, who chose to skip
last meeting.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been working through The Artist's Way (slowly), Avatar (slowly), and Clairvision
materials (slowlier).</p></li>

<li><p>Have recently not been studying Japanese.  But met a woman via Cafemocha (?) that lets
people support each other in learning languages.  She's fluent in Mandarin, and learning English.
I am considering learning Mandarin.</p></li>

<li><p>No pets at the moment.  But U-Cow and Rabby are here in the clinic with me.</p></li>

<li><p>Marble Track 3 has been put on hold; it was the one for which I was taking stop action
photos of it to make a movie of its construction.  Slow going that stalled when Fred arrived in
winter.  I had Rabby kick it off the set and now it's in a bag at Chez Soness.</p></li>

<li><p>Fred's and Ma's birthdays, plus Dad's Fathers' Day all landed on the same weekend recently.
I called everyone at least once.</p></li>
</ol>
