<p>Just for my reference, here's some things I can do besides looking at porn while alone in the
hotel:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go outside.  I'm sure this will be one of the most effective, but it will also mean getting
off the computer and away from working on cow-go site.  To be used carefully.</p></li>

<li><p>Meditate (outside).  Especially if I can find a place.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep the door open.</p></li>

<li><p>Open ye olde windoe</p></li>

<li><p>paint</p></li>
</ol>
