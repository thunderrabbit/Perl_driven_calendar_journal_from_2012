<p class="dream">I noticed janette was outside the restaurant so I went over to her all happy HI
dancing and dancing to see her, and welcome her to eat with me and tell me how things have been!  I
showed her my new house and then got a call from Bryn's friend Anthony who turned out to be my
friend Anthony from Millennium House in Japan!</p>

<p class="dream">He was like, &quot;yo Rob I'm just callin' to say thanks for callin' and I'm about
to move out of my house.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;really?  What's goin' on?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;and I was wondering if you could help me a little bit with finding a place to
be..&quot; he said hopefully.</p>

<p class="dream">I looked around at my current house into which I had just moved.  I was standing on
the balcony that arched over the Tokyu Toyoko Line as it arced its way up the hill.  Watching the
trains below me, both the Hibiya Line and the Toyoko Line, as they went around the curves; the
Hibiya Line had a gentler curve and sped its way up, and the Toyoko Line had to do a tight turn and
its cars actually spun around backwards to make the tight turn.  I went back to Anthony on the
phone.  &quot;Yeah the place I'm in now is just up the street from you and I've got plenty of room.
Thing is that I don't know if I'm allowed to have you over.  It's owned by Elvis as well so let me
give him a call and see if he's okay with it.&quot;  I added &quot;What time do you have to be out?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;In 1.5 hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;How may bags do you have?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Yeah four and a half.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I'm not sure why he said Yeah, but figured it was like yeah that's why I'm calling cause I can't
move all these bags by myself.</p>

<p class="dream">So I was lookin around Methil house trying to remember where I had slept the previous
night.  Certainly I woulda slept in the master bedroom, right?  Ma and Dad's old room.   But I
didn't remember being there.  I didn't sleep in my room I knew because I had just walked up to it
now for the first time.  Did I sleep down on the couch?  I tried to remember.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Okay well call me back when you're packed,&quot; I hoped I would still be busy
doing stuff cause now I was going to have to wait,  &quot;and I should have a place sorted out for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Thanks Rob I really appreciate it.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">So we hung up and I woke up, &quot;okay where am I sleeping now?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh I'm in CPC.</p>

<p>I guess that's why I couldn't remember where I had slept in Methil.</p>

<p>and I  guess Anthony is not going to call back in an hour.</p>

<p class="dream">Robert from CPC appeared, &quot;yeah that was so clear as he
called.  he must be really psychic.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Yeah that was really neat,&quot; I agreed..  &quot;You guys should do a trial
to see what causes it.  Maybe it's his diet.  You can have him eat whatever he likes and have
everyone else eat the same and see what happens.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Then Dude and Dr Cutie were there with their two girls.</p>

<p>I realized I was sleeping again and woke up to write  this.</p>

<p>Wrote this with my eyes closed:</p>
