<p>RC meeting was long and boring at times, but good overall かな; I keep getting annoyed by the one
girl who's like そうだね、そうだね、 and then she goes, そうだね、そうだね... etc, which basically
means &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;yeah&quot; over and over.  fucks sake say
something.  Um, yeah, I'm not proud of this reaction, but it's what comes up for me.</p>

<p>Now wait, I gotta specify that she says this not in agreement with others, but when it's her
turn to talk, and all attention is focused on her, with the question, &quot;how have you been for
the past three weeks?&quot;  &quot;Yeah... yeah... yeah...&quot;  what???</p>

<p>I gave to Margaret the bracelet I bought on PB 49th voyage after she took notice of it when we
were doing our first minisession.  I'm glad to have given it to her, and happy that when she heard
of its story, told me she had been given a keychain from Sri Lanka, but lost it recently, so this
can be her new connection to Sri Lanka.</p>
