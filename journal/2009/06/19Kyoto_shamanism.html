<p>Kevin signed up for Dreamhost today, giving me the referral.  My job now is to install Wordpress
for him on his new server.  He didn't actually get a domain yet, so I've sent a request to
dreamhost support to see if there's any easy way to move a dreamhost installation from
______.dreamhosters.com to ______.com</p>

<p>I imagine there's not.  Here's essentially what I wrote:</p>

HI Dreamhosties!

My friend Kevin signed up for DH, and used kyotoshamanism.dreamhosters.com as his temporary site.

My task now is to install wordpress there, and my task later will be to move the wordpress
installation to his new domain.

According to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress">http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress</a> it's a pretty easy task, so long as the 
database info stays the same.

But, it looks like Kevin's mySQL info will _change_ when he chooses a domain. The current suggestion
for his mysql server is something like mysql.kyotoshmanism.dreamhosters.com

<a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Move_WordPress_to_DreamHost">http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Move_WordPress_to_DreamHost</a> gives step by step on how to move the installation; 
is that basically what we'll have to do when switching from _____.dreamhosters.com to ______.com ??

Thanks!
- Rob
