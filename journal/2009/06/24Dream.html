<p class="dream">On the way out of town after the trial, I remembered I needed to stop by and pick
up my money.  I called the office from Laura (Guennie's) car as she was driving, and I had a bagel
sandwich and I got the bad news, &quot;um, eah, we won't have the money until tomorrow or
Monday,&quot; and I got, &quot;but I'm leaving town tonday,&quot;  &quot;yeah well we don't have it
all,&quot; &quot;can I get a partial payment?&quot;  &quot;no&quot;  &quot;can I have you transfer
it to my account lter?&quot;  &quot;no&quot;  &quot;wel you guys made the mistake, so I expect you
guys to fix it,&quot; and I realized that wasn't a very useful way of putting it, certainly not by
Dale Carnegie's standardards, so I tried another tactic, &quot;um yeah I know youguys are working
really hard,&quot; as I was agreeing with what she was saying as excuses, and by that time we
arrived at the location.  I saw the building, looking like a ranger station in the trees with
parking around it and saw al the families (mostly mommies with kids) and went up to the desk and
then walked away cause I was still on the phone and then walked by the drinking trough, and then
Danielle (Maggie's roommate) was like, &quot;see I told you,&quot; and walked by..</p>

<p class="dream">I was headed back to the car and saw an info desk with two girls, and I was like,
&quot;what if, hypothetically, you were going out of town and needed some money and your friend
owed some money but they didn't have it, what would you do?&quot;  and they gave answers like, save
money and where are you going to travel?  and stuff and I was like, &quot;well that's the thing; I
can't because I don't have any oney to buy things like food,&quot; and they go &quot;like
what?&quot;  &quot;food!&quot;  &quot;ohhhhh&quot; and the one girl pulled out an envelope and
handed it to me with a smile.  In it was US currency, some ones and fives and stuff, plus some
change.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;hmmm I like that it's US Currency!&quot; and &quot;in what
currency would you like to be repaid?&quot; and as I looked frther inside, there were several checks
as well, not yet signed, and I was like, &quot;okay, you need to write 'pay to the order of' on the
back, oh wait, no just sign the back, and I'll put your account number down.  do you have an account
number?&quot; and she did so she signed the checks and time was getting a bit rushed for me to get
out of town, and I was reading the check amounts written like, &quot;1.25 * 5000 dollars&quot; and
stuff like that.  Wow that was a lot of money she was handing over to me just cause it's in US
Currency and there are no checks in Japan.</p>
