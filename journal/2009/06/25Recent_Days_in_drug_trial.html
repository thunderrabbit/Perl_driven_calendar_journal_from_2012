<p>Today is day 7 of 25 at CPC in the longest clinical drug trial I've ever done, and the longest
clinical drug trial CPC has ever done.  After these 25 days, we'll be set free for 4 days and then
come back on the 5th day for final checkup and final payment.  I plan to stay around Kagoshima
during that time, though not sure what I'll do exactly.  Probably a lot of website programming.</p>

<p>(but that's not why I'm writing)</p>

<p>Recently, I've been doing a lot of website programming, with 15 different instances of Wordpress
installed in 3 * 5 different directories on my website.  I'm basically evaluating different
multi-lingual plug-ins, and different calendaring plug-ins.  The best multi-lingual plug-in I've
found for Wordpress is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/">qTranslate</a>,
though its current version (2.3.4) only supports WP 2.7.1, while WP is now at 2.8. (2.8.1 beta)</p>

<p>With qTranslate, I like that editing different languages in posts is as easy as choosing tabs
between HTML and Visual editing.</p>

<p>I <em>don't</em> like the inability to have different languages for the blog title text.</p>

<p>My favorite calendaring system is actuall GigsCalendar, in that I think it has the best
interface overall of all the different calendar things.  I compared these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Calendar 1.2.2</p></li>

<li><p>EventsCalendar 6.5.2.1</p></li>

<li><p>GigsCalendar 0.4.6</p></li>

<li><p>WPListCal 1.2.2</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ack.  I had to reboot my machine recently so I'm not logged in to each instance of WP; I left
the admin passwords as things like J5(d4JK*3q and don't want to log back into all of them to see
what complaints I had about each. </p>

<p>Anyway, related to the drug trial, I've felt a lot sleepy, a lot hungry, and a little sad..  I
think this must be the worst anti-depressant I've ever taken!  (Also the only one I've ever taken,
but.)</p>

<p>Speaking of ending sentences with &quot;but,&quot; Soness and I are going to the Co-operative
<a href="http://www.avatarpacific.com/engels/contentmain.html">Avatar Course</a> in OZ from 15 - 23
August!  We'll go for a few extra days on each side of the course to do our own thing; she wants to
attend trapeze camp, and I want to chill with Sally and Jax+Simon!  I better start sending some
emails, but it's almost not hit me that we're going fo' realz!!!</p>

<p class="date">5:52pm JST Thursday 25 June 2009 (day 14337)</p>

<p>Okay I just emailed them both; actually emailed Sally and messaged Jax on Facebook.  In the
middle of composing my email to Sally I had to be sidetracked for like 25 minutes to give blood and
blood pressure in supine and standing position.</p>
