<p>Hmmmm not sure if I shoulda stayed at The Pink Cow, but I wasn't really getting anything done
toward cow-go; Naoya, from whom I was supposed to get some login information, was like, &quot;can
we do it next week?&quot;  Ah for cripes sakes.  So I tried to hack the info out of the server (and
I got it), BUT, the only access to the server is via FTP; I can't do mysql commands through FTP so
I'd have to write a thing like PHPmyAdmin which would take more than a week and has probably
already been done.</p>

<p>Soness invited me to play hoolahoop on the beach so I'm headed out there, plus three suitcases
are arriving tomorrow via πı«≠ so I wanna be there to unpack those and bring them back home before
my doublebooked JMW and I-group meetings tomorrow.</p>
