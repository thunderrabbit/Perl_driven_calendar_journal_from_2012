<p>Just got my blood taken and now will be chillin' for a few minutes until they let us know who is
_on_ the trial, and who is reserve for the trial.  People on the trial will get the full payment,
and people who are reserve will get full payment if anyone feels ill on the first day of the trial,
but otherwise will get 15% thank you payment.</p>

<p>Just filled out our first questionnaire; we'll have a lot of these during the trial.  A few
different ones so we don't get totally bored.  My favorite nurse was the one administering the
forms...  forgot her name though.</p>

<p>Have been chillin' in TV room (with TV off), talking to Gavin, who has done vipassana meditation,
plans to do a 4 month bicycle trip in Himalayas, and then a 2 year trip from Alaska to Argentina.
And more; I don't remember all the deets.</p>
