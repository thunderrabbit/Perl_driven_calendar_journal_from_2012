<p>After a day of searching, I'm composing a message to Joomla forum to see how to get en and jp
translations of Joomla working together.</p>

<pre>
HI

My goal is to have Japanese and English versions of Joomla working together with Joom!Fish.

According to Joomla! Accredited Translations, because the Japanese language pack has only been done up to 1.5.10
(see http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/jtranslation/frs/?action=FrsReleaseBrowse&frs_package_id=33),

I installed the Japanese/English (jp-JP/en-GB) version of Joomla 1.5.10 by downloading from http://joomla.jp/ . 

I added Joom!Fish Version V2.0.3 (Flash).

It seems to have installed properly, but when I switch between languages, though some of the
language changes, the main menu headings (e.g. &quot;main menu&quot;) do not.

The menu headings remain in Japanese.  I installed the en-US language pack to see if that would
&quot;fill in the blanks&quot; but the basic menu titles still don't change.

In Components > Joom!Fish > Translation, I manually added a Japanese translation for
&quot;Home&quot; as &quot;ホーム&quot; and that works when I change from EN to JP.  (But if I'm not
logged in, it doesn't work, but that's a seprate issue.)

The site is visible at http://php.robnugen.com/joomla1.5.10jp/

As you can see, &quot;written by Administrator&quot; changes to &quot;作者： Administrator&quot; in
Japanese version.   But why don't basic translations like &quot;main menu&quot; seem translated?

Another option would be to install a 1.5.10 English version, and then add 1.5.10 Japanese language
pack.  But I don't see where to get old versions of Joomla.
http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/frs/ seems to only have ways to upgrade to 1.5.11

    Thanks

<p>And now, I've just read this thread,
<a href="https://www.joomfish.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=3872&p=17461#p17266">https://www.joomfish.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=3872&p=17461#p17266</a>,
which seems to say that the translations (done only to the &quot;Joomla! core&quot;) are so minor
that most of the work still has to be done.</p>

<p>So now my whole question will focus on installing 1.5.10 in English.</p>

<p>Actually, just for fun, I'm going to install the Japanese 1.5.10 pack in my 1.5.11 installation
and see how that goes.</p>

<p>Actually I'll make a new 1.5.11 install for that purpose.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>* parallel install Joomla! 1.5.11 in <em><b>en-US</b></em> and NO sample content</p>
<p><a href="http://php.robnugen.com/joomla1.5.11/2_sample_data_DNE/en_install/installation/index.php">URL</a>
<br/>admin pw = en
<br/>table prefix = enSDNE_</p></li>

<li><p>* parallel install Joomla! 1.5.11 in <em><b>jp-JP</b></em> and NO sample content</p>
<p><a href="http://php.robnugen.com/joomla1.5.11/2_sample_data_DNE/jp_install/installation/index.php">URL</a>
<br/>admin pw = jp
<br/>table prefix = jpSDNE_</p></li>

<li><p>* Can language be selected by admin?  user?</p>

<p><b>NO.</b> Turns out, though the installation screens were in Japanese for the Japanese one, the
only thing that's Japanese now is the title of the site and the &quot;Site Offline&quot; message.</p>
</li>

<li><p>* install Joom!Fish on NO sample content</p></li>

<li><p>* install Joom!Fish on NO sample content</p></li>

<li><p>* install Japanese language pack 1.5.10</p></li>

<li><p>Does it work?  Do menus flip from English to Japanese?  Stay only in English?  What about
when I'm logged out?</p></li>

<li><p>If translations can be translated, then manually copy from 1.5.10jp installation and be happy</p></li>

<li><p>Else ask about getting a 1.5.10 version of English Joomla! and install Japanese on that (maybe)</p></li>

<li><p>install English Joomla!  1.5.11 with sample content</p></li>

<li><p>install Joom!Fish with sample content</p></li>

</ol>
