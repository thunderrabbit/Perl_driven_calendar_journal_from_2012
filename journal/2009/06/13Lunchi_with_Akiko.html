<p>Headed from Chez Soness to Shibuya on the express train (Shonan Shinjuku Line, which runs on
Tokaido line as far as Kawasaki, and then goes to Osaki and up the west Yamanote Line for a bit
instead of Shinagawa and up the east Yamanote Line.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/peeps:Soness">Soness</a> is in Sapporo for a show this weekend so Nibbles (her
cat) and I had the place to ourselves.</p>

<p>Okay, so anyway, I'm meeting Akiko for lunch at 11am
in <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Places:Shibuya">Shibs</a> (feel free to create a page for
Shibuya!)</p>

<p>Nice time with Akiko, featuring lunch at the quiet ramen shop that Ami and I found in Shibuya
(where she introduced Biscott, the biscuit colored bear, and we talked about our latest relationship
gossip, Ami and P______, respectively).</p>

<p>Went to Baskin Robbins for ice cream, but there was a line so we went to Mark City's Cold Stone
where we had sweet cream with white chocolate chips (me) and banana with coconut bits (she), both in
chocolate dipped bowl-waffles.  Saw a guy with a map so I helped him out, and then discovered Akiko
is *still* lost around Shibuya, so I took her to the end of Mark City and to Shinsen station and
then to Bunkamura.  She had been to these placed before, but not in sequence... only along the
spokes with Shibuya station as the hub. </p>

<p>Now I'm on Chuo Line headed to Tachikawa for RC meeting.</p>
