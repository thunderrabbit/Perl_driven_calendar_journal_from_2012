<p>Moving book and winter clothes to storage today; it will be cheaper to store them than to keep my
apartment, and might as well shed them off now instead of waiting till the last minute.</p>

<p>Dropping off Tariq's printer at The Pink Cow, even though I never tested to see if I could get it
to work.  Will meet Awinter in Shibuya; he'll loan me 20,000 yen to pay my week of rent (I'm paid
through 17 June, but they want three weeks' notice).  I'll buy him lunch today if he's open to
that.</p>
