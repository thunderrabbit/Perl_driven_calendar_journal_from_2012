<p>I haven't reformatted the dream I typed this morning.</p>

<p>But I have called my credit card company to ask 'em why, though I have a credit balance, I can't
create a Shopsafe number.  I wonder if it's because this card has been expired for over a year.  But
I have created Shopsafe numbers since the time it expired.  Maybe there's some sort of grace period.
Anyway, they weren't able to give me a reason, and are escalating to a team and have requested 2
business days to get back to me.  Sigh.</p>

<p>And I have talked chattingly with Soness before her performance(s) today in ²¿²¿Ä® (I don't know
where she is).  Last night five (5) couch surfers surfed her couches (floors) and they all went to
Enoshima yesterday and then out to dinner and it sounds like it was great!</p>

<p>Okay, I just reformatted the dream.</p>

<p>Lunch is in 28 minutes.</p>
