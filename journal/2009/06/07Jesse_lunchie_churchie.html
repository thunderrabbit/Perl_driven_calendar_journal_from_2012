<p>Went to Jesse's church to meet Leilani, who Jesse said would like to buy a poken.  Ended up
having a spot of lunch thanks to leftovers from Cesario family lunch, and then sat through the
church service to wait for Leilani, during which I tweeted something
like, <a href="http://twitter.com/thunderrabbit/status/2061933182">&quot;Is it a sin to text while
a guest at church?  Hahaha&quot;</a>, but didn't get a clear response.</p>

<p>Met Leilani and her friend Elizabeth whose card includes &quot;Life Coach&quot; in her
description.</p>
