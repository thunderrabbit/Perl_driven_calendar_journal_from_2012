<p class="date">9:20am JST Sunday 21 June 2009 (day 14333)</p>

<p>Today is Dad's Day and my brother's birthday <em>and</em> my favorite day of the year because it
features the most daylight hours in the hemisphere I most frequently inhabit.</p>

<p>(And that's why I wanna go to OZ for their summer as well!)</p>

<p>I called Dad for a bit (he was driving home from Dallas), and I'll see if I can track down Fred.</p>
