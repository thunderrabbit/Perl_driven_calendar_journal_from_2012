<p>A few grrrs today at work with Alfonzo all telling me how to do stuff instead of listeing to my questions.</p>

<p class="date">7:27pm JST Thursday 13 August 2009 (day 14386)</p>

<p>Things turned out okay though; I should be able to easily finish the project by tomorrow, and
then be able to kick through the next ones way faster even.</p>

<p>I had to zoom out to get to lesson with Yurika on time.</p>

<p>According to the timestamp above, she was getting a tssty beverage for me before our lesson
started.  But in reality, I'm writing all these entries on the way home from The Pink Cow.</p>
