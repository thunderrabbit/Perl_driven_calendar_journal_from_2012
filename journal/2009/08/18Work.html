<p>Because my computer crashed on the way to work yesterday, I fell a bit behind in journaling,
emailing, and studying kanji, which I had planned to do on the train to and from work yesterday,
but instead read my book, chowed yummy treats, and played Scramble on iPhone.</p>

<p>Last night I revived my computer by reseating the hard drive and wrote this to Alfonzo:</p>

<pre>
My pooter is working again.  You may have been right; I just reseated the new HD (after seating the
old HD (after taking the entire case off (required removal of about 20 screws) because the rubber
grommets that hold the HD came squirming out when I pulled out the new HD the first time (which
gives credence to your theory that it was poorly seated))) and now it's working again.  Yay!
</pre>

<p>Because I had never taken my laptop that far apart, the whole task took pretty much my entire
available evening (after arriving home well fed from my snack-filled train ride which started after
my meeting with Ryoko, our latest new Cow-Go student).</p>
