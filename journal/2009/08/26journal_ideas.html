<p>I wonder if I can write in PHP a journal indexing engine that I'd appreciate.  I'd basically
keep this one (journal.pl) going, and leave journal.cgi going (for that guy), and then have
journal/index.php?date=yyyy/mm/dd&amp;type=all refresh to journal/yyyy/mm/dd/all ...  I think that
would be pretty cool.</p>

<p>Then I could tag each entry and stuff like that.</p>

<p>I actually think a good first step would be to re-encode all my existing journal entries in
UTF-8, though I dunno how much of a trick that will be to implement.</p>
