<p>Just went through two sessions on Anki, the memorization tool I'm using for kanji.  I may have
just learned the kanji Heisig identified as &quot;shining&quot;  (mneumonic is poster from &quot;The
Shining&quot;), &quot;draw near&quot; and &quot;separate&quot; (both via brute repetition),
&quot;lively&quot; (mneumonic is spitting while speaking), and one other for which I can't recall
the English (but if I see the English, I can draw the kanji).</p>
