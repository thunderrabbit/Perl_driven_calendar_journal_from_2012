<p>Went to the beach today, though not a lot of energy to rock hop all over the place.  Wondering
if I am just sore / tired / or, <em>getting old</em>??? surely not me!</p>

<p>Just to let you know, I watched the beginning of a video featuring Alex Collier talking about an
event that will happen in February, March, or April...  One that will likely wipe out two-thirds of
the world population!!!!!  So you better get ready, 1997!!!  (the vid was recorded in 1996)</p>

<p>I'm on the 500 yen extra train with my reclining seat.  I think I'll recline and sleep.  30
minutes remain to do so.</p>
