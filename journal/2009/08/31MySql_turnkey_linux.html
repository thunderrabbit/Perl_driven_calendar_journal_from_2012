<p>Now this is pretty cool.  I'm installing a Turnkey Linux mySql software appliance on a Virtual
Box system on my machine.  With this, I'll be able to simulate our database from work, and get
stuff done at home!</p>

<p>Wh, wh, wtf?  Why would I want to get work stuff done at home?</p>

<p>I don't know, but it's nerdy and fun and I likes it!</p>
