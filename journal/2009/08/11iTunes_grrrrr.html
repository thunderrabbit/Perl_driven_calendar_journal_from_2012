<p>Stupid iTunes.  I mean it's a great thing and coordinates my iPhone and music and all kindsa
stuff, but I have one (1) big problem with it, that's kinda hard to describe.  But basically I
can't tell it to chill out about not finding my music.  I've got all my music stored on Amazon S3,
and my Jungledisk drive isn't always connected, because I'm not always connected to the internets.
If iTunes starts trying to look for music while the drive isn't mounted, it panics and quickly
disables all the songs it can't find.  Like zoooom a hundred songs all marked as missing.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>To unmark them, to indicate they're available, I have to do each one individually.  The fastest
technique I can find is to look up their Info, which will intice iTunes to search, find, download
(around a minute for 5MB file), and then discover yes, in fact, the file exists.</p>

<p>That's roughly two orders of magnitude slower, AND manually intensive to restore the files'
status.  ARGH. iTunes, get smarter!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I'm choosing not to move my files off Amazon; it's cheap as chips to store them all, with 99.9%
guaranteed uptime, plus unlimited storage space.  Otherwise, solutions would be well appreciated.</p>

<p>Wait, what???  I just wrote all that, but just now looked at my iTunes and all (all) the files
are listed as available.  A magic solution has occurred, but I don't know how!</p>

<p>(( Even so, unfortunately, the files have already been removed from my iPhone, and will have to
be redownloaded from Amazon S3 to reinstall them.  Hours and hours of download. ))</p>

<p>Hmmmm  I might know a solution.  I closed iTunes and then plugged in my phone.  iTunes was
launched and the songs all had their DNE flags reset to !DNE, and subsequently downloaded.  Easy!</p>
