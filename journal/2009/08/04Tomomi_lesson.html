<p>From 7:30 to 8:30 was my first lesson with Tomomi since March, she said, but I can hardly believe
it was this year... she brought some English emails she had written, and I brought my brain for
corrections and we had a good time.  I asked if she wanted to pay a bit extra to lock down our
lesson time each week.  She does.  Nice.</p>
