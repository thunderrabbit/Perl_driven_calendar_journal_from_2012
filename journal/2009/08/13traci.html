<p>Talked to Traci for a bit, especially about the plan for Cow-Go: slow and steady, making sure to
provide excellent service to everyone along the way.  She suggested the same thing in terms of my
being single.  Just take your time and be true to yourself and your friends.</p>

<p>Excellent advice.</p>
