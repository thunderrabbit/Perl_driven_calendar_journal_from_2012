<p>Now,</p>

<p>I've had this problem before.</p>

<p>I forgot I didn't have proper id when going to Genny With A G's party one time, and I did it
again today.  I actually didn't <em>forget</em> it, per se, but I forgot that it's not in my
wallet.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>I had a good time talking to Roger, who works for a company that designs 3D graphics chips for
mobile devices.  He said Apple probably spent 2 or 3 man-months optimizing the cover flow on iPhone
to look just like it does on real iTunes, though it's running on a 3D processor with a tenth the
processing power.</p>

<p>Met a guy named Mike who works in PR for some company.  Didn't really talk shop with him cause I
know little about that industry.</p>

<p>It was while in line while talking to Mike that I thought to confirm that my ID was where it
should be.  D'oh!</p>

<p>Told him, and he was like, &quot;they're not going to let you in,&quot; a fact I already knew,
and further details that he knows a guy who <em>could</em> get me in on any other day, but
&quot;not today; I'm sorry,&quot; cause they're dealing with 5000 visitors coming onto the
campus.</p>

<p>On my way out, I saw Gemma and a friend of hers.  Gave a hug and brief greets.  Now I'm in Ebisu
station about to ... head home?  Yeah.  I need to clean the place up for Soness before she gets
back!</p>
