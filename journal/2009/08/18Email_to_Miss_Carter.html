Hey toots

I'm up to like level 55 in Mafia Wars; I have built up my max energy enough that I can leave the
frikkin' game alone to get stuff done in what we like to call the "real world" for nearly 15 hours
while my Mafia-energy continues to accumulate.

In other news, I recently got a job, so I'm getting some up close and personal time with this Real
World and making real money (not exactly *tons* of money, but nearly as much as I was making while
teaching English full time, and a lot saner on my brain.  (*))

(*) a little rant about Japan / Japanese people who want "to learn English":

ARGH!  The prevailing school system and social paradigm tells Japanese people to sit down, shut up,
and memorize this so they can parrot later.

As you may know, languages require a bit more organic thinking than parrotry, and the "shut up" part
of "sit down and shut up" does not lend itself well to people actually trying to use the language in
real world situations.

I had a student come sit in front of me for our first lesson (1 to 1 lessons) and say "yoroshiku,"
which in that case, I'd essentially translate to "yes please," or at best "let's do this thing," but
implied all the direction would come from me, especially because she did *not* have a book, notebook
nor writing utensil..  I thought, "um, wtf do you want to learn?  The topic of English spans quite a
range," and knew I had to quit that job.

end rant

Can you relate to unmotivated students?

What about to sarcasm?

In other news, Japanese people don't seem to understand sarcasm.

My best friend / housemate has left me in charge of her house while she visits Australia for 20
days, mostly to attend a course by a group called Avatar, and hopefully to attend trapeze camp for a
couple days as a bonus.

Initially, I intended to travel with her, but my position as assistant manager for a fledgling
language school has kept me here in Tokyo for the time being.  That, and my previously mentioned
job, which I didn't mention pays for my time as a computer programmer, changed my mind.  Plus I
realized I might not enjoy Australia as much during their winter as during their summer.

I hope you've enjoyed this letter written in E-Prime, and continue to have a lovely day!

     Peace and Mafia
     - Rob!!
