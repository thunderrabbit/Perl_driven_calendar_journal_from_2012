<p>I'm on the train home (have been since 9:38) and am trying to catch up a few journal entries
including that today I read that the CIA tried to install a US-sympathetic leader of Japan in 1956,
but were foiled by whatever foiled the plan.</p>

<p>I sure wish that people would stop trying to control other people and just be happy.</p>
