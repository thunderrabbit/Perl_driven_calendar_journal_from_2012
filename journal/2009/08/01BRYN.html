Hey Bestest Bryn!!

So great to hear from you right after I started getting e-reminders of
your upcoming birthday!  Now you're just over half my age!

I like how you describe Tony's character in terms of his ABL,
Annie-Bricker-likeability.  :-)  He must be a great guy!  I'm glad you
got to be best mates with him before his adventures in Japan.  Perhaps
I'll get to meet him too!

Just a quick update on my OZ plans; they have been moved back a bit;
my best-friend/roommate (actually it's her house, so I'm *her*
roommate) Soness and I were going to go to the Avatar workshop
together, but I realize I need to stay back to help with Cow-Go.

Instead of writing "Cow-Go, which ..." and trying to make an even
longer sentence, introducing Soness and several new Rob's-Life-Terms
in one swoop, I'll give Cow-Go part of its own paragraph:

The Pink Cow is my favorite restaurant in Houston, mostly cause Traci,
the owner works really hard to make it great.  She's starting a
language school called Cow-Go, and some months ago asked me to be the
English-speaking manager of the school, handling incoming request from
new students and teachers.  In short, I thought I could do it all by
email while in OZ, but I need to meet peeps face-to-face (darn
old-fashioned technology!  when will the future arrive???)  :-)

So I've canceled my trip to Avatar in OZ winter (whew!!) gotten a full
time programming job (contract work for 4 months), and will help Traci
get Cow-Go started; she thinks we can do it in 6 months.  I'm learning
a lot about what it might take to run a business!!(!)

<!-- 
During all this, as I'm living in Soness's living room (paying half
the rent so I'm not totally freeloading), she and I are becoming best
friends.  We're on a fast-track personal recovery wise; we're
triggering each other's issues, and supporting the recovery of said
issues.  She recently went to Bali where a palm reader was like, "wow;
you're in a really great, challenging, important relationship"  (my
summary of Soness's summary)
-->

Soness lives by the beach (!!!) and I think, in honor of Bryn's Day,
I'll go there right now.  (my multi-month string of daily Saturdays is
about to come to an abrupt pause!!!)

So great to hear from you.  I know whatcha mean about YA SWUUSI.  Hope
you're okay with missing GA.  Is SLC where you escorted me to the ER
late at night?  That was the best night ever!!!  Thank you.  :-)

   Love and Light
   - Rob!

ah!  You mentioned Wende; she's doing well as far as I know; I hear
from her about once a year; she and husband Peter (same name as her
big cat) have babies (2?) and a zoo worth of animals.  So glad she's
doing well!

Hey I think they are in Austin so you should definitely go see her!
If you have a chance.  Send my love if you go.

    More Love and More Light
   - Rob!
