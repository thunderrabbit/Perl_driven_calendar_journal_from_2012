<p>There have been some big earthquakes recently starting on Sunday night I think.  Soness said she
felt a big one then (which I missed), but then this morning we had a big earthquake, and during work
today another big earthquake.  So I
downloaded <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=323479274&mt=8">
今日の地震</a>, &quot;Today's Earthquakes,&quot; for my iPhone.  Just kinda intriguing in a
semi-scary way.  Alfonz kept saying, &quot;Earth is trying to tell us something,&quot; and I would
finish his sentence, quoting Earth, &quot;get. off.&quot;</p>
