<p>woah.</p>

<p>Not sure what to make of what just happened.  I rolled in to bicycle parking today, and one of
the guys beckoned me to a spot right on the ground floor, &quot;inside&quot; the building.  Prime
parking!  Like Presidential Parking!  OMG what have I done?  I have no concept of what it implies
that I was given such a great spot, but in my mind I've been rewarded for bad (pissy) behavior from
two days ago and a bit from yesterday..  ohhhh what, oh what does it all mean?</p>

<p>Are they scared of me?  Are they apologizing to me?  Should I bring them a delicious tasty
present?  Just ignore it?  Any suggestions from Japanese culturally aware friends would be
appreciated.</p>
