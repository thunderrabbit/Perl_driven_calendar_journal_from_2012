<p>Went to The Pink Cow for delicious buffet today and discovered there's no buffet during summer
holiday because very few people come to chow the delicious buffet!  <em>Le sigh.</em></p>

<p>But I did enjoy a delicious burrito, and met a dude named Christian who had a great idea
regarding Cow-Go.  I'm looking forward to doing that!</p>
