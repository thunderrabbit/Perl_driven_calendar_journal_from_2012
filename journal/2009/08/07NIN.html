<p>The only thing I cared about in the afternoon was seeing Trent in his last-for-a-while concert
in Tokyo.</p>

<p>The best, _best_, *best*, <em>-~!BEST~-</em> thing about the show (I mean besides the music) was
the rain.  The rain started when the show started, and the rain ended when the show ended.  Just
perfect perfect.  There was just a sprinkle during the first song, but then after
&quot;Closer,&quot; the rain poured down and Trent goes, &quot;Now this feels like a fucking Nine
Inch Nails Concert.&quot; and I was like &quot;yeahhhh!&quot; and then almost as an afterthought he
goes, &quot;if you're leaving because of the rain, you're a pussy.&quot; I go, &quot;let it rain!
Go home pussies!&quot; though I'm not necessarily proud of that language now, it seemed to fit the
moment. </p>

<p>Thanks to Soness using my phone to call her phantom friend Akiko, we scootched our way
relatively close to the front.  Not nearly as close as I had been in Studio Coast, but well closer
than in 1996 when I had a neck brace and stayed way in the back, but let me not digress.</p>

<p>I had my phone out so that I could use <a href="http://access.nin.com/">NIN:access</a> to text
live from the show... but it wouldn't work!  I hadn't logged into the app for a while (my fault),
but it seemed to be a combo of my not being logged in, and not getting good reception in Marine
Stadium.  Sorry about that, fans who wanted to attend.</p>

<p>Trent looked really good, well toned, with huge arms and I like his short hair, which I first saw
in Studio Coast, I think.  Looked like he was wearing ear plugs, which I think is pretty smart.</p>

<p>Because I couldn't text live, I didn't bother to record the set list, but here's what I
remember:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>?</p></li>
<li><p>Closer</p></li>
<li><p>I'm afraid of Americans</p></li>
<li><p>Burn</p></li>
<li><p>The Fragile</p></li>
<li><p>?</p></li>
<li><p>The Frail</p></li>
<li><p>Survivalism</p></li>
<li><p>The Hand That Feeds</p></li>
<li><p>Hurt</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not necessarily quite in that order.</p>
<p>Before &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans,&quot; he goes, &quot;this is a song we did in 1996(?) with
our friend David Bowie,&quot; and everyone was all, &quot;whoooo!!&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Before &quot;The Fragile,&quot; Trent was like, &quot;thank you Tokyo,&quot; and &quot;Thank you
for coming; this is our last show in Japan... wait no it's not, what am I saying..&quot; as I was
yelling &quot;TOMORROW!!! TOMORROW!!!&quot; ..  man I would love to zoom down to Osaka to see their
last show in Japan. damn.  Then he goes, &quot;let me catch my breath..&quot; and maybe that's the
point that the crowd was a bit quiet, and I shouted, &quot;THANK YOU, TRENT!!&quot; No reply, but
I'm sure he heard it, then poured his heart into &quot;The Fragile&quot; as a bit of a break before
the bumpin' songs started again.</p>

<p>As the intro tone for &quot;Hurt&quot; came on, just to show off my mad song identification
skillz, to Soness I was like, &quot;this next song is 'Hurt'&quot; and quietly (quiet for a concert)
recited the first few lines.  I sang along with Trent, but not too loudly.  I know he ended with
&quot;Hurt&quot; cause I was hurt to see them head off stage and the emcee roll on to thank
&quot;Nine Inchi&quot; for a great show.</p>

<p>I had great fun bouncing around with the crowd and Trent put on quite a show for us, giving his
all, as always, and I'd definitely be willing to shell out some bucks (or yen) to buy a DVD from
the show.</p>
