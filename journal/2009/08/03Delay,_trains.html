<p class="date">9:15am JST Monday  3 August 2009 (day 14376)</p>

<p>I made the 8:05 train at 8:17, when I hoped to make the 8:17 train which would go straight to
Shibuya.</p>

<p>As it is, I'm not yet in Shinagawa (though it's next, and we seem to be cruising along); I'll
make it to work on time, but not on time to meet Alfonz at 9:30am (I don't think).</p>
