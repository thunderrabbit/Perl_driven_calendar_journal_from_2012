<p><em>Just</em> finished the work I planned to finish at work today.  It was basically copy-n-paste
(with appropriate code-surgery and some other tweaks) so I had a good sense for how long it would
take.  Definitely good that we did the most difficult one first, although there are actually a few
tweaks (DB joins) that I need to do for this one as well, but they should be easy enough to do.
I'm <em>considering</em> doing them this weekend, but goodness gracious why work from home when I'm
not getting paid extra?  Meh, I may do it because I'm about to ask for some time off to meet Brook
and Ryoko to get them started on their Cow-Go adventures in English lessons.</p>
