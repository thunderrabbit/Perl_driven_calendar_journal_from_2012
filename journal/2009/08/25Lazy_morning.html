<p>Skipped the beach as I have been for the past couple of days.  Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe tomorrow.
But I did my meditation this morning, so I'm happy about that.  Didn't shower nor eat, but I
brought a bag of granola for snacking during the day.</p>

<p>Didn't waste time on Mafia Wars (I'll do that at work), but I did write two emails for Cow-Go,
trying to get some first lessons coordinated between new teachers and students.</p>

<p>Am on the Shonan Liner (500 yen extra for a seat) and have just studied some kanji
with <a href="http://www.ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a> using Heisigs Remember The Kanji deck.</p>

<p>I'll do some sleep-writing, just for fun.</p>

<pre>
Have about 30 more minutes to Shinagawa I think so plenty of time to fall asleep and be all zzzzz.
I noticed last night that some of the more messed up sentences *felt* normal, as well, I knew they
were a bit weird, but most of them felt normal and I was mistyping everywhere and though I can feel
a couple of mistakes coming through now, it's not like a whole lot are getting by, I don't think.
We'll see when I open my eyes.

The train is a bit lurchy at the moment, and we are probably about to pass Yokohama, but I doubt
that's true if we've still got thirty mnutes before Shinagawa.  Truth is, I have no realy idea of
how far we have to go.  Well, yes I do; we are after Ofuna and after the stops  closely spaced near
Chigasaki, and heaeded on the longer haul past Yokohama to SHinagawa

I just closed the curtain next to me cause the light from sun¤µn was keeping me more awake.

I just typed Japanese again; I wonder if it's correct.

getting a bit sleepier, here comes the craziness; I can feel it creeping into my brain and slowly
toward the tips of my fingers with its venemous not really venemous, but darkness sleepiness
lethargy and chaso coming through as it pleases and just let my brain go and keep my fingers on like
an automatic dish washer washng with no input or with extra crazy input. 

Dream words floating through my brain about a motherboard or computer not being able to work and
offered to someone who said thy wouldn't want it.  But if they don't want it why is it offered.
Mechancial door sound behind me as it opens and closes.  Trying to force the trip quote comes to
mind from Mitch Hedberge (rip) when I'm trying to force the crazy sentences out of my fngers.

I think I misstyped fingers just a moment ago; I didn't feel the i of fingers.  I think not.  Maybe
I didn.  am I writing crazily?  I can only imagine doing this over a really long time.  Oooh a
google wave has the infra structure to keep track of each keystroke typed (maybe) or jsust tur  off
keylogging altogether with the source code.

Definitely sleepier now I can feel hey I just wrote that a while ago with blackness and dark poison
talk.  No more, aight. just kep it real.  I misssed an e in keep ; I know it.  and and the and and
an extra space after , no before the semicolon.  I can feel these mistakes but not always catch them
in time to fix them.  Like I almost typed fixe but just barely stopped my e finger from coming
down.  part of it is my fingers are sleepy we're crossing a river now; I can hear it.

sorry this is so boring I was hoping for some really noutty stuff.

I'm goin gto pause for a bit.


Scenes from Bourne Identity oing through the movie screen in my brain, &quot;I'll call this number
back.&quot; click.  I need to watch them or read them again.  Haven't read them but it would be
cool.

Doing a review with all the sources in place would be neat.  I know that's grammatically correct but
doesn't mkae much sense.  Doing a review with all the sources in place.  Doing a review with all the
sources in place.  Doing a review with all the sources in place.  I just typed it like our extra
times and it didn't ahane (maybe a couple errors) bu I didn't change the text, so I'm not really
dreaming, just writing silly stuff down.

watching some guy smoke with a weird filter around his cigarete.  It's like the filger is part of
the pack, but the smoke guy is tryingto lead the lesson.  I have no idea what I ust typed except
smoker guy is trying to lead the leson and dreaming about cigareete filter pack.

what are w w man he just ate a cigarette.  this dream is gross.  let's move on t something more
interesting.

actually it's quite interesting to be able to tye while having these visuals.

watched Distrcit 9 last night.  I liked the scene with the guy inside the big suit like Alines, I
mean it's a done scene, but I still liked it.  Aliens did it they needed to have another alarm to
remind her about prep for another moview.

sitting down next to an old guy I've met before at the JMW meeting.  I' mbarrass me he says as the

I wonder if I'll get to meet Gordon from Kenya when he comes in October.  I wonder if it's
appropriate to buy another necklace to give to Ami.  Probably not but I want tod.  sorta as an
apology for breaking up with her.  Would she like another wone?  Maybe I can let her buy it, but
just tell her from where it came.

Actually Ami was at one day of that conference, but not sure why not the day I got the necklance,
and not sure if that was the first day or the second day.  I think the second cause I don't rmemeber
introducing her to Gordon with her necklace on (nor off; I have no idea wither way)

tired but not too many crazy sentences.  I wondr there I missed e for sure.  I wonder if there are
letters I miss more often than others.dssss   oops.

minimum wages must be covered by this method of typing that makes no sens Minimum wages must be
covered by this technique of typing.  but not asleep cause I justread o so to have a time for
slouchng in my chair. now is lsouching time..  it's not that I'm dreaming so much as just getting
tired.  

I think we are slowing down for yep now he's announcing Shinagawa.  Aight, well sorry for so much
boring writing and so fw nuggets but I hope it's all nugget s and good.</pre>

<p>Wow!  That's way more crazier than I thought!  I'm glad to have this though really can't imagine of
what use it will be later, but who knows!  I'm on Yamanote Line now (we're stopped in Meguro) and I
just read the above block.  funny funny stuff.</p>
