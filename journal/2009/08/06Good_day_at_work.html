<p>Last day of my first week at work seemed easier than my second to last day of my first week of
work.  Alfonz flexed his mad programming skillz and showed me a bit of how his brain works; he
poured some words into my ears as I half transcribed, half predicted and typed ahead of time what
he suggested we do for some input checking.  He's definitely a better programmer than I am; perhaps
because he always has been, but partially because I had a big-ass break for my first years in
Japan, plus my recent 7 month break from most things coding.</p>

<p>But I did get some good stuff done, 99% done with the project we wanted to knock out this week,
and he thinks he'll be able to do the rest tomorrow while I join Soness for a concert with a little
band called Nine Inch Nails.  Ahem, I'm getting a bit ahead of myself.</p>

<p>Went to lunch at the nearby organic cafe with Kitty, who's pretty much bilingual since birth,
though I don't know that she's doesn't know Mandarin as well (family is from Taiwan).  We covered a
range of topics from life history to PB adventures to other stuff I just forgot what I was going to
write because..</p>
