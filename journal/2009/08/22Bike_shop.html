<p>Didn't know what time the bike shop would open, but figured they'd be crackin' on weekend morning
so I got crackin' and rode Soness's yellow bike (with broken shifter), steering with my left hand,
and guided Soness's blue bike (with broken brake cable), steering it with my right hand.</p>

<p>Had a couple of dangerous moments as the blue bicycle basket interfered with the yellow bicycle
handlebars, causing them both to veer unsteerably one direction or another (that, strangely, was
never exactly the direction I wanted to go).  Fortunately those dangerous moments were on the
relatively empty back streets near Chez Soness, and I pretty much sorted out how to steer them both
by the time I got to the <del>highway</del> <del>freeway</del> two lane streeet.</p>

<p>But then had a bit of a problem with the speed accumulated going under the tracks, but all was
fine in the end; I stayed on the bike and the bikes never hit the ground ('cept with tires).</p>

<p>Anyway, got to the shop with all our parts intact ('cept those that we came to the shop to
repair), and discovered that the shop opens at 10:30am each day.  Not 9am.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>I looked for a place to put the blue bike while I headed back to Chez Soness to work in the
garden.  Decided it should be safe on top of the discarded bike stack that had obviously been there
for a while and wasn't likely to be *really* discarded on Saturday before 10:30am.</p>

<p>Got back to the shop at 10:30am, and found they were open, as planned.  They had all their
inventory of bikes out on the sidewalk, nestled side by side by side by side all the way and just
past where I had put the blue bike.  Not only was the blue bike safe, it was unreachable!</p>

<p>I slaughtered a few sentences in Japanese trying to explain why it was that I needed access to
the back of the store, but the guy bemusedly let me past the counter and I was able to retrieve the
bike essentially from the opposite side of the stack on which I had stacked it.</p>

<p>After all *that*, easy as pie.  He replaced the blue bike brake cable in 5 minutes for 700 yen,
and replaced the yellow bike shifter cable in 10 minutes for 1,200 yen.</p>

<p>I knew by then how to ride both bikes at once and headed home even more easily than pie.</p>
