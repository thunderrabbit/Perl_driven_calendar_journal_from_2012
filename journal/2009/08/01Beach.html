<p>Great day at the beach today, once I was able to tear myself away from making fake money in the
fake mafia of Mafia Wars on FB.</p>

<p>Rode the blue bicycle down there, with flipflops in the basket and asphalt zipping quickly by
bare toes protected by at least 3 inches of pure sea breeze.  Locked the bike at the beach and
walked with half full 1 liter bottle to the T bar of rocks on which I like to jog barefoot with
various tunes bouncing in my ears.  My iPhone's iPod function works well for the music part, and my
feet did well on the hopping part; three hours later and they're still happy sore and tingly with
blood, all of which remained on the inside.</p>

<p>A few times I had visions of missteps which would likely make me wish I had insurance, so maybe
I should get that now that I have some money.  But not now while I'm enjoying the sunshine!  The
very next moment.. guess what happened!  I carefully stepped my way down into the tetrapods to
enjoy some shade and rested for a bit.  (didn't break my ankle or anything; I was just
mis-foreshadowing about possible missteps.)</p>

<p>Went to Southern Beach where I found some guys digging a hole.  They said they were headed
to Brazil.  Cool!  Got some shaved ice and sugar with azuki beans put in my thermos (to save them
from using a plastic bowl).  The ice lasted a pretty long time in my thermos while I was rock
hopping on tetrapods.  Lots of wandering around to explore the area.  Got another pic of the guys
with the hole to Brazil on the way back.</p>
