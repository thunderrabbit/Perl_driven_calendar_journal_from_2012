<p>My seven month string of Saturdays has come to a temporary pause.</p>

<p class="date">8:56pm JST Monday  3 August 2009 (day 14376)</p>

<p>Work was good; didn't get as much done on my project as I woulda liked, but had fun talking to Alfonz and Nate.  We joined the morning meeting, which was mostly in Japanese, though I was able to take some notes.  I learned a term that I might translate as &quot;that's it,&quot; as in, &quot;I've got nothing else to say:&quot; いじょうです。</p>

<p>Yes, I'm sure it's a pretty basic phrase, but I just learned it.  Might even be misspelling it.</p>
