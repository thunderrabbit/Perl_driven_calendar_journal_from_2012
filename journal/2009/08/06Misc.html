<p>Today is the day I knocked onto the floor at work the remainder of my rice (from two days ago), and
picked it up by hand, bit by bit.</p>

<p>I copied from my S3 storage space on Amazon servers to my PC 16 files of a lecture by Stanislav
Grof, which I'd like for Sabina to hear.  Though it's obvious I'm copying them, and though I
downloaded them via some torrent site, I wonder if I can buy them online.  They were originally sold
as casette tapes, but when someone transferred them to mp3, some bits were FFed (FFed is the fast
forward way of writing fast forwarded).  Not super important bits, I guess, but still, I'd like to
respect the cat and listen to the full lecture.</p>

<p>I found a bread shop, called Dos Maggots or something, nestled in Shibuya station today.  It's got
good stuff, including a cream pastry thing with sliced apricots on it.</p>

<p>Forgot my belt, but my pants are pretty well fitted and stayed up enough that no one likely noticed.</p>

<p>Tonight is the night I heard Soness identify herself as Christian.  Woah.  I thought she had
grown out of that.</p>
