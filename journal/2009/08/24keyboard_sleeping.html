<p>I have a great idea, though.  I'm going to sleep and leave my keys on the keyboard and try to
type on occassion / stream of thought / see what happens.  I'll just finish this paragraph and put
everything that comes next down in &lt;pre&gt; tags.  Here we go.</p>

<pre>
Eyes are closed now and I just realized I forgot to set my alarm to make sure I weake up by
Chigasaki, but I'm sure it'll be okay.  I mean I haven't yet ridden past it.  I Haha my brain just
went to sleep for a miute in the middle of my senteence.  This is going to be great great fun.

Myst remember not to start new paragraphs but just hit return and not worry about including HTML
markup tags in this bit of writing.  

I am slowing down my through put, getting tireder, but still typing.  train just took a big left
turn sorta like woah now we;re facing America.  I just fell asleep again hahaha 

Okay, so I wonder if I can like really capture a long stream of thoughness from this process.  I
bought mango orange juice for my BOB portion of Traci's ther are to do more oops.  I just feel
asleep againish.  Not sure if

fingers  off keyz for s second.   zzz.

It's like skinning the snake off a frisbee with a dollar bill to cut the coin.  I can't do golf as
well as with those guys.
