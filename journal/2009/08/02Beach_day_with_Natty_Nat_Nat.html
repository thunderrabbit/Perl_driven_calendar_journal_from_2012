<p>Great day with Natalie, Ellie, et. al. on the beach yesterday.  It started out with just us
three, as Ellie's new husband Yosuke and the other lads had gone walkin' around, but a couple other
peeps arrived and we extended our tarps and kept chowing food, including Oreos.  Yum!</p>

<p>The day was drizzling rain at times and we moved to new location (in front of Salsa bar) then
under the umbrella, then back out, then back under the umbrellas; it was like a rain dance, but we
weren't in the driver's seat!</p>

<p>Remet Akemi (who makes crazy faces for photos) and Kana (trilingual (English, Japanese, Thai),
and their friend Karen (trilingual English, French, Thai) cool!</p>

<p>Here's what I texted to Soness:</p>

Definitely a fun time despite the rainy bits! Saw several aquaintences via Natalie and met Jose' and
Karen separately. I didn't salsa, but did some "gymnastics" with Yoshiyuki.

On the way home, the rain made the sidewalk a bit slick, so I barefoot skated the thin layer of
water while cycling (coasting) as fast as possible! So much fun and so ticklish!!

Food was picnicky (not nitpicky) and snacky salad, humous, couscous and some Oreos. I help buy some
drinks upon arrival, including chuhi, milk tea, OJ.

Gymnastics was just hand stands and cartwheels or roundoffs.
