<p>After much persusion, (&quot;why are you hesitant to gimme the details?&quot; &quot;Cause you're
still my little colleenie beanie about fifteenie!!&quot;) I wrote to Colleen the basics of my recent
dream with her:</p>

<p class="dream">I was watching the dream as a third person, watching you and me in the middle of a
room, with your parents on the other side of the door!  I dunno if you were nekked, but I was
totally hard and you were showing me your mad fellatio skills and I totally came and it was great.</p>

EEEEKkkk I can't believe I just told you that!    Are you traumatized????
</pre>

<p>Fortunately, she was not traumatized:</p>

<pre>
HAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA why were my parents on the other side of the door?! THAT is the
only traumatizing part of the story. But I literally laughed out loud really hard for a few minutes
when i read that last sentence. Who told you I had mad fellatio skillz!!!??!  Heeheehee.
</pre>

<p>Why am I posting this online???</p>
