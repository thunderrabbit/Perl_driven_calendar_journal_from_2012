<p>6am wake up for rock hoppin' fun!  I was a bit late(!) getting down there <!-- Soness had slept
besided me downstairs, so I sat for a moment watching her sleep -->, but it turned out I had plenty 
of time to get puffed out and I think I made it a *bit* longer than yesterday.  I ran five T lengths
(up the T bar, then its left side, right side, left side again, then back down the T) before running
(jogging (shuffling)) in elongated circles along the water and then up and down the beach hill for a
bit.</p>

<p>During my second right side T bar run (make that seven lengths above!), I <em>almost</em> errored
when I didn't quite have enough power to jump up from the rocks to the concrete blocks (only about
25 cm higher)..  I slightly bruised my left heal, which I can feel when I walk in shoes now.  Oh,
and on the other side of the bar I sorta stubbed my left toes, but not my big toe, so it hardly
hurt.  I was like, &quot;good job, feet, keep it up!&quot;</p>
