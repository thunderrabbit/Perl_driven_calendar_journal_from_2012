<p>After my lesson with Emiko, I got an email from Soness saying that she was available via Skype!
I walked to Apple Store to slurp their wireless (and charge my phone) while talking to Soness, but
she was talking to her mom for most of that time.  I got kicked out of the store at 9:12 or so, and
talked to Soness soon thereafter.  She's been in the avatar course for like 4 or 5 days now, and has
met some interesting/great people!  She said there's a lot more work to be done for her.  I'm
optimistic that it'll be great.</p>
