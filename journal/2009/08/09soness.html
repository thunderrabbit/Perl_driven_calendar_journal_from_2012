<p>Soness didn't get home until like 11pm last night; she had met up with her friend Herschel and
another friend whose name I've missplaced.  They were helping Soness get back to basics in her
religious beliefs, which, I must admit really spooked me out when I first heard her talking about
it.  All these oooky memories of my friends saying they'll pray for me and my family to make sure I
find the light of Christianity and <em>Accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior</em>, and I'm like,
&quot;Jesus Christ, can you guys just get over it????&quot; cause it just don't make no sense to me
that we would be given free will but not allowed to use it freely.</p>

<p>(There's several other things that don't make sense to me about religions, but that's the first
that comes to mind now.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I had been kinda oooked out and had a bit of a Talk with her to be like, &quot;um, yeah,
um, just don't tell me what to believe and we should be okay,&quot; and things were pretty great
after I was able to get that off my proverbial chest.  nice nice.</p>
