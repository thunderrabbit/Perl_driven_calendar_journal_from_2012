<p>Today at work, I didn't write any code on the network.  I just drew out screenshots and
flowcharts to prepare for a meeting with Alfonz and Nate, presenting my ideas to them.  By the time
we had the meeting, Alfonz had already seen it, so I was basically just showing Nate, who had a few
change requests and some really good ideas to make the flow better for end users.  Tomorrow I'm
going to draw out another flowchart across two pages to uncrunch the little boxes I had to use when
I drew V2 of the big controller script.  I'm glad to have persevered through the whole day without
writing code.  I'm pretty sure it's going to make the coding WAY faster in the end, and really
really easier to do/debug/maintain.  Not like my last job where we were always rapid developing
code.  Well, I drew some flowcharts, but mostly we just coded and often made a mess of things.</p>
