<p>Just finished lesson with Emiko, looking over her homework and things in Metropolis magazine.
Next week she's asked to meet at 2pm, to which I agreed, though I'd prefer not to meet on Saturday
at all; maybe I can ask her to shift to a different day of the week.</p>

<p>The people to my left are speaking Spanish; I think it's a lesson, but definitely more of a chat
than &quot;gato means Ç­.&quot;</p>

<p>At one point they started talking about Roberto, so I got sidetracked from Emiko for a bit.   oops!</p>
