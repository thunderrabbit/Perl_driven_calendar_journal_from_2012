<p>Yesterday was almost entirely focused on my computer, though I also cleaned the stove in the
kitchen. (as opposed to the stove in the hallway?)</p>

<p>Stove cleaning involved taking the whole thing apart and hopping into the shower room and
scrubbin' it all down.  I may have scrubbed a bit too hard in some places cause I can see the 
bare metal.  But I guess that's better than grease!</p>

<p>I'm trying to get the house all clean for Soness when she gets back.  Woo!</p>
