<p>Did some good coding today, though I really think Alfonzo has a computer brain.  He can look at
code and figure out what it's doing way faster than I seem to.  I keep thinking, &quot;dood!&quot;
when he does that and he keeps doing it.</p>

<p>Anyway, in my own slow careful way, I got some code completed, checked, cleaned, cleared and a
few action items to handle tomorrow.</p>
