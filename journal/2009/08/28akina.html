<p>Went to The Pink Cow for buffet tonight, and great to see the restaurant packed!  It had been a
bit quiet during the middle of August as people were outta town, but tonight it was poppin' again,
with so many peeps that I sat out in the front entryway where Akina was sitting with the till to
take money as people entered.</p>

<p>As I arrived she was carefully inking the inside of her arm with a pen that didn't really want to
write on skin.  I got my buffet plate from Moonie and sat with Akina and chatted a bit as she did
Facebook and I joined her in FB activity and friendship.</p>
