<p>Had a karaoke lesson with Emiko today, as in we had an English lesson in a karaoke booth because
I thought she might benefit from practicing fluency by reading and singing English.  She had trouble
keeping her eyes off the Japanese pronunciation guide, but generally had fun, and we may do such
lessons again, just not every time.</p>
