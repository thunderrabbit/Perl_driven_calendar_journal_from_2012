<p>Lesson with Emiko ran from 7:30 to 8:35.  We looked through the latest Metropolis magazine and
scoped some of the shorter, crazier articles and reviews, including a dog bark translator.  Give me
a freakin bruck here, people.  If you pay attention to your dog, you'll know what s/he is saying.
For $200, I can tell you what your dog is saying without even hearing it.  What a waste.</p>
