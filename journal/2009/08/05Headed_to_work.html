<p>I took the nice train to work this morning, er, that is I am <em>taking</em> the nice train to
work this morning, but it doesn't seem to be taking us anywhere past 藤沢（ふじさわ）, ah
nevermind; we're moving again.</p>

<p>It doesn't go to Shibuya though; this one goes to Tokyo so I'll have to change in Shinagawa...
Almost worth the 500 yen...  I think I'll keep doing it for a while though..  Yesterday I saw a
nearly empty train rolling up to the platform up to which I'd like to be rolled, right around the
time I got there via crowded Tokaido and Yamanote Lines.  I don't know of a way to ask the train
from where it came to see if I coulda used it.</p>
