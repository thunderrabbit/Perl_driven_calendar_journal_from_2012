<p>Work was aight today; I got a page finished in two days.. it allows people to update their
information, and includes json to load possible regions, and then Google maps v3 api calls to
convert an address to coordinates.</p>

<p>I don't know what's next for tomorrow, but hopefully something exciting!  Like an earthquake
wooooo!</p>

<p>Alfonz and I were laughing today from I conversation I started as, &quot;grampa, did you really
have to program computers through trial and error?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep, and we couldn't just talk to the computers, we had to use our hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;omg!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We couldn't say, 'computer, I want you to find the smartest dinosaur on this planet and
simulate its evolution sixty million years into the future and make me a clone so I can ride it
now.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really??&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We couldn't even say, 'computer, find all the bugs in this program and fix them for
me.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about, 'computer, are you going to be busy on Tuesday or can we go play frisbee at
the beach?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nope, we couldn't ask that, either.  We had to wait until Tuesday to find out, and even if
it wasn't busy, computers couldn't play frisbee back in those days!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woowwww.  You must be really old, grampa!&quot;</p>

<p>But what was really funny was even dumber as we mimicked hick voices, let's say from the
Simpsons, all like, &quot;Hey there, that's one mighty fine comPUter you got there...&quot; and
then even sillier, &quot;Hey computer, are you busy?&quot;</p>

<p>It musta been a location joke.</p>
