<p>Woke up again at 6am and zoomed down to the beach for a barefoot bouncin' runnin' rock hoppin'
jaunt.  Not an adventure, really, but just about 20 minutes alternating between bursts of energy
and listening to my breath panting.  At the moment, I can't really think of a way to... oh I know;
I have an alarm set on my phone for 6:45am that says &quot;'mon back,&quot; meaning &quot;gotta
head up to the house and get to work.&quot;  I was pretty much panted out by 6;43, and was back at
my bicycle before the alarm went off.</p>

<p>I headed out that direction at around 6:15, I imagine, so it took 30 minutes to get puffed out.
(That's a phrase I learned from Jax in OZ.  hahahah puffed out.)  Okay, so anyway, let's keep an
eye on that number and see if my endurance goes up to a nicely bigger number.</p>
