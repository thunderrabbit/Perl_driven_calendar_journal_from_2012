<p>Hahahaha I really enjoyed the moment my new friend Yuri goes, &quot;is her name Soness?&quot;
when I described my friend down in Chigasaki.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I had chosen a seat down by the stage for vegan night at The Pink Cow, and Yuri was the first
person to join me.  Based out of Australia, she's a tour guide for Interact (I don't know if
Interact has more than one base of operation), and led a tour in Japan recently, and has another
coming up next week.</p>

<p>YK joined us after a bit, and it was just before then that the great question came up.  I told
YK, but it turned out he was not sure to whom I was referring.</p>

<p>Right *now* I'm on Tokaido Line from Tokyo to Chigasaki.  I took YKs advice so I could get a
sleep, in which I now plan to sleepppz</p>
