<p>Maniatta is the romanization for what I think is the correct spelling of the phrase meaning
&quot;just made it,&quot; 「まにあった」</p>

<p>I just made the 9:36pm supa-express train for Chigasaki.  Not sure if it's a supa-express, but
it's the one that skips the most stations between here and there that I've found so far.</p>
