<p>I arrived just in time for the Power of Attraction workshop at The Pink Cow which was advertised
to start at 7pm (when I get off work), but everyone was just seated with buffet plates and the
speaker ready to go when I rolled in, paid my moolah, sat down with my plate (right next to the
buffet) and got to sit by Aarif, who had arrived right after me.</p>

<p>I put onthe questionairre that the workshop did *not* meet my expectations, cause it didn't tell
me much I didn't &quot;know&quot; already, though I did enjoy one idea of writing down my feelings
about a dream I have, and then imagining myself closer to it and writing down my feelings, and then
closer and writing down feelings, and then at the dream and writing down my feelings then.  Hmmm
that really helped bring to focus the path required to achieve that dream.  Wow!  I think I'll
write the guy and thank him for that one.</p>
