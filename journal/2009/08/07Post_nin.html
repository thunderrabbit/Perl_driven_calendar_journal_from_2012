<p>To finish out the concert, the next band was My Chemical Romance, of whom I've heard, but whose
music I've not heard enough to know any offhand.  Soness asked a nearby fan to sing a couple lines
and she was like, &quot;oh yeah,&quot; but we left anyway, figuring the mad rush would make the trip
home slightly unbearable.</p>

<p>The trip home, however, was great.  Because the stadium floor was padded with about 2 inch thick
rubber mat, which was all wet from the rain, a couple of guys were doing slip-n-slide, sometimes
crashing into innocent bystanders, one time sliding straight toward me and I stood with legs spread
and dude slid right between my feet.  Soness had a few slides and did relatively well despite
wearing a shirt (the guys' bare skin significantly helped with sliding).  I got a couple of pics of
her.</p>

<p>Though she said it was quite fun, I told Soness that I didn't need to slide; I had slid plenty of
times in my life, and this wasn't optimal sliding terretory for me..</p>

<p>Headed back to the station, enjoyed ice cream (I got my favorite: Popping Shower), and then
headed to our train line.</p>

<p>Train arrived with a thousand empty seats, each of which cost an extra 500 yen to use.  I was
like, &quot;yes!&quot; cause I knew it would be fast and relatively comfortable to Tokyo.  Turns
out, not only was it fast and comfortable to Tokyo, it was only one stop to Tokyo!  As in, we got
on, and the next stop was 20+ minutes later in Tokyo!</p>

<p>Took another train at 500 yen extra for guaranteed seats and headed back to Chigs.  Lovely
lovely night.</p>

<p>Thank you, Trent.  Thank you, Soness.</p>

<p>I think I'm going to write one of them a letter.</p>
