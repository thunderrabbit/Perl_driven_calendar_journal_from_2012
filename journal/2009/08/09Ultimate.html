<p>Played ultimate in the rain yesterday; it was great fun!!  I walked all the way from Kuji, down
past the baseball fields to the first bridge before finding the group.  I wonder if I should walk
the other direction by default.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Not a lotta players, but we had enough for five on five for a while, with a woman on each time.
To join, I wore Miranda's black tanktop (&quot;anti wife beater&quot;) because I hadn't brought a
dark shirt.  Had lots of fun slipping around on the wet grass, and I caught a really short kickoff
pass by runnnnning forward and then sliding about 5 meters on my shins on the grass; zoooom!!  Great
fun.  (hahah see? I told Soness I've slid plenty of times in my life (and didn't need to slide
after NIN concert-induced rain storm.)</p>

<p>Good to see some old and new faces: JC was there after his 1.5 years in Sydney, and I hadn't seen
Ellie nor Greg in a while, prolly because I hadn't been attending.  Met Miranda, Alex, Yuko, Sam
(again), and Max.  Shag and Doug were also there, but I had seen them recently.  I think that's
everyone in attendance.</p>

<p>After the game, we headed to foodage near Futakoshinchi station.  Got good Chinese eatin' up on
the 2F of a ramen shop.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best thing about eating was hearing of Anki, a tool for memorizing things.  JC is
using it to memorize kanji, and says he's memorized the meaning of over 1800 now.  Hmmm!  So I've
downloaded Anki and started memorizing kanji via an interesting technique: instead of trying to
memorize the reading, writing, meaning, and pronunciation, this is just focusing on meaning ==&gt;
writing.  So if I see &quot;prosperous,&quot; I can think of a kanji with two suns.  Done!</p>
