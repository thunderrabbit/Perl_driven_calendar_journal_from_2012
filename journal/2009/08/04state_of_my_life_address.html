<h1>State of My Life Address:</h1>

<p>A few big changes recently:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I moved to Soness's living room in Chigasaki.  Not sure how long I'll be there, but at least
another month to house sit her house and Nibbles-kitty.  Soness and I are fast becoming best
friends, supporting each other in our respective challenges.</p></li>

<li><p>I got a job!  Working for the company of my dreams, in that I had a dream about living in a
house with a balcony above the Tokyu Toyoko Line, and now my desk window overlooks that line.
Amazing!  Soness and I said, &quot;wow&quot; over and over after she noticed that connection. (I had
had the dream a few weeks ago.)</p></li>

<li><p>I've officially sworn off the use of pornography.  No more 4chan for me.</p></li>

<li><p>After reading just the first 50 pages or so of _No More Mr Nice Guy_, I'm making some
changes in my lifestyle.  One of which is taking better care of myself, spending money and time on
myself.  Therefore,</p>

<ol>
<li>This morning I went for a run on the beach before work</li>

<li>I'm riding the Shonan-Liner back home (faster, comfier, 500 yen more)</li>

<li>I did *not* wait around an hour for Soness to get off work</li>

<li>I asked Tomomi for 4000 yen per lesson instead of my normal 3000 per lesson, in exchange for
making it at a fixed time each week.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another of which is not using porn, so that ties in well with the above.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, and here's some normal stuff for somla</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Went to The Pink Cow with Akiko on Saturday.  We chowed buffet and she encouraged me to
write her a postcard in Japanese.  She nearly had me convinced; maybe I'll do it.</p></li>

<li><p>Been working on Cow-Go, and had the distinct realization that if I think of my job as be the
Englihs coordinator and grow the school to its full potential, I can't do it.  But if I just focus
on setting up one meeting with each new person, I can do it.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really talked to my mom or dad in a bit; been basically in touch with Fred, and
recently sent him a letter (written on semi-shredded paper hahaha) and helped him get started on
Facebook.  Not teaching him how to use it, but setting up his account and giving him the password
once people started to contact him about his profile.</p></li>

<li><p>I sent 200,000 yen to Mark at ELF so he can trade with it in FOREX.  That's kinda his hobby
and hopefully his future big moneymaker.  I trust his system enough to let him play with my money,
too.  But yes, I know it might never come back.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been seeing a lot of articles on UFO sightings and disclosure, etc.  I hope hope hope
disclosure is at hand, not that I think it will quickly bring about a lovely new world, but so I
can say &quot;see!! I told you so!!&quot; hahaha</p></li>

<li><p>I recently got a 500 GB hard drive for my computer, and, to transfer my data from old 70GB
to this one, I bought a 1 TB external drive to act as a backup.</p></li>

<li><p>Rode Soness's blue bicycle to Enoshima this past weekend to hang with Natalie et. al. for
picnic and salsa.  Good times despite the rain.</p></li>

<li><p>I've not gotten TJ Bike back from my old house.  Need to do that soon, but there's not
really a place to put him at Chez Soness.  We are thinking about a way to put a bike rack out by
the front door.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been doing morning meditations for two days in a row now.  I expect to do it daily for a
while, hopefully from here on out, as suggested by every true spiritual tradition I've acknowleged.
(For the record, Christianity is not one.  Stanislav Grof mentioned that one guy described
Christianity as an innoculation against true spiritual experience. hahaha sounds reasonably
true)</p></li>

<li><p>I didn't do Night Practice last night nor the night before.  Need to set up a bit better way
to do those (basically bring my phone charger home from work (forgot again today), get another
charger, or listen via my computer).</p></li>

<li><p>Soness and I have tickets to NIN, er, Summer Sonic (featuring NIN) on Friday.  Woooohooo!  I
told work I couldn't be there, and she'll do the same.</p></li>

<li><p></p></li>
