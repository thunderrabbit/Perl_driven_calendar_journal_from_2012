<p>Ack.  So long and boring today.  I just wanted to hang out with Tatiana, but she wasn't there.  I
probably need to stop going.  Today was the day we went to Showakinenkoen and played some games
including a new four person, three ball game that I made up, and finding shapes in the clouds, plus
a relay race by Talia, and then dancing around with Fumi, and handstands with Emma.</p>

<p>Headed inside from 6pm to 8pm and then Talia showed me where there's a yummy vegan restaurant in
Tachikawa.  It's vegan with fake meat and fish.</p>

<p>Talia and I had a bit of a discussion about <del>Israel</del> <ins>Palestine</ins>, and though
we admitted we didn't know the whole situation, were both loathe to concede any points.</p>
