<p>Went to The Pink Cow and met <a href="http://myspace.com/melindaortner/">Melinda Ortner</a>, who
plays piano and vocals for her band, of whom there was one other performer, Keiko on violin.</p>

<p>I kept thinking about Tori Amos and maybe just maybe I was &quot;discovering&quot; a new
up-n-coming artist before she hits the mainstream..  But turns out that she's got multiple shows
here in Japan and plays live in LA a lot, and is working on her second or third CD.</p>

<p>Keiko played an amazing rendition of a pop song that made me holler
&quot;Whooooooaahhhhhh!!!&quot; when she got to the melody...  Can't remember the song now, but on
violin it was amazing..  Especially since she said she just learned it starting today.  (The song,
not violin.)</p>
