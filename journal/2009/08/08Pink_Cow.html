<p>Went to The Pink Cow for delicious buffet dinner tonight.  Pleased that Moonie pretty much sat
next to me anytime she wasn't working, that is, until her friend showed up, which kinda makes it
sound bad, but really, she knows I'll be in there at least a few times this week so she'll see me
again. Talked about her dogs Karma and Dharma, which are pretty much the two cutest names for dogs
ever.  Dharma was found shivering next to his sibling's tire-crushed body on the roadway, so he's
pretty shakey still.  Anyway, we talked about our latest adventures and stuff like that.</p>

<p>I also spoke with Traci a bit, and got a new Cow-Go card for Emiko and one for Marina (I think);
I haven't met her yet.</p>

<p>Oh man I'm tired.  On the train headed home now.</p>
