<p>Met Naoto after work to talk to him about Cow-Go...  He wants to be a Japanese teacher for us,
but we don't currently have anyone hoping to be a Japanese student.  I told him that, and suggested
that if he become a student for now, we'd get to know him and his credentials, and then give him
students when they come.</p>

<p>He chose not to do that, but we talked about the idea of having an English Cafe at The Pink Cow,
perhaps on Saturday afternoons before normal opening time.  4pm anyone?  Hmmmm.</p>
