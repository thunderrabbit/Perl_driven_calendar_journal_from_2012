<p>Soness and I woke up a bit later than normal on Friday morning and slowly got some breakfast
then headed down to the beach for a run.  She runs 5k on occassion, and this is the first time she
has invited me to join her.  I was like, &quot;Five Kay???  That's almost a million miles!&quot;
cause it seemed like it might be more difficult than I could do, but ....  I did it, plus did rock
hopping afterward (which I really thought I'd really be too tired to do after the run).</p>

<p>Was definitely a bit winded and my stomach had been hurting, but pretty much I was able to do it
with no worries, and I'd consider doing it again.  If not again and again every day, which I might,
later.</p>

<p>After the run, I encouraged us to get some water, and then she encouraged us to get in the water,
which I did, enjoying (for the first time) body surfing, including some super fun backwards body
surfing surfs (fall back with the wave and let it carry me, but be sure to close my mouth cause the
water has a tendency to gush in!)!</p>

<p>We were sorta in the way of surf boarders, so I felt a bit endangered at times with surfboards
surging toward me on waves, but one of the best brief moment was standing as a girl on surfboard
went <em>slowly</em> right past me in knee deep water, and we gave low and high fives. (mine was
low, and hers was kinda up, cause she was crouching on the board).  She said HI and I was like HI
and thought, wow cause she had braces.  Didn't talk to her past that, though; I don't need any more
confusion.</p>

<p>Went rock hopping for a bit, and slept on the rocks for a bit, then wanted to get Soness out of
the water (she was surfing on someone's board by then) so we could go to Nine Inch Nails....</p>
