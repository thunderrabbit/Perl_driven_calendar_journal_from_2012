<p>Tonight was the first Pink Cow staff party in two years, so I'm happy I got to go!  Was held at
Traci's apartment vaguely near Shibuya, and featured a lot of the same peeps I see at The Cow, but
without interrupting cows &quot;mooooooo!!&quot; who have questions of various sorts.</p>

<p>Didn't learn everyone's name, but enjoyed a conversation ranging from linguistics to religion
and back again, plus lots of yummy food!  Didn't get to see Moonie much, though I stayed *just*
long enough that we passed at the front door.  &quot;Hi and bye!&quot;  I had hoped to chat longer
with her, but we'll have to save it for another night.</p>
