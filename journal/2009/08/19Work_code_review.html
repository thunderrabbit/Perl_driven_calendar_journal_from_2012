<p>Best part about work today was the code review at the end.  We spent two hours poring over my
most recent program, tweaking parts here and there to make it a masterpiece (?) of PHP awesomeness.
Remind me to never use &quot;PHP&quot; and &quot;awesomeness&quot; in the same sentence again.</p>

<p>I learned a couple tricks (one of which I shoulda realized and done already):</p>

<pre>
<del>if(in_array($id,array_keys($array))) { }</del>
</pre>

<pre>
<ins>if($array[$id]) { }</ins>
</pre>

<p>Gah, when I write it like this it's obvious, but when I created the array key-by-key before, I
still had its keys in my brain as separate entities or something.</p>

<p>The others were not so obvious, and had to do moreso with the classes I was using than just pure PHP.</p>

<p>Next code review will be tomorrow at 10:30!  Wooohoo!</p>
