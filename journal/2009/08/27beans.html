<p>Headed home on the fast train from Shinagawa now.  I just barely caught it, cause I didn't stop
to pee.  Or, I saw that this train was an option before I stopped to pee.  Luckly, there's a
restroom on this train.  brb.</p>

<p class="date">9:17pm JST</p>

<p>Whew!  That was prolly 800 CCs!</p>

<p>Fortunately for my meeting with Colleenie Beanie, catching this train means I'm much *much* more
likely to be on time.  Lemme check.  Yep.  We'll arrive in Chigasaki at 21:51, whereas the train
that left 3 minutes after this one will arrive at 22:00.</p>
