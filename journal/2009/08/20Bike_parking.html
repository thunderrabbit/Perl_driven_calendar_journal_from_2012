<p>I felt a bit embarrassed going in to bike parking, so I unnecessarily asked &quot;where is
parking?&quot; and the guy goes &quot;yes,&quot; and I go, &quot;<em>where</em> is
parking?&quot; (a bit passive-aggressively) and he goes, &quot;yes, ah, 3rd floor.&quot;</p>

<p>The above is in English, but the actual conversation was in Japanese.  On my way up the ramp, I
was thinking, <em>why would he answer yes to my first question?</em> and realized he could have
thought I asked, &quot;anywhere is parking?&quot; and the correct answer would be &quot;yes,&quot;
so it made sense.</p>

<p>The conversation was actually</p>

<blockquote>
<p>「どこでいいですか。」</p>

<p>「はい。」</p>

<p>「<em>どこで</em>いいですか。」</p>

<p>「はい。あっ、三階です。」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that's the correct kanji for 'さんかい' meaning 3F, or 3rd floor.</p>
