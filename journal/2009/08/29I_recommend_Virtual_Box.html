<p>There are rare occassions that I want to run a Windows only app.  I can think of two: Chrome,
and Regex Buddy.</p>

<p>To that end, I have installed Sun's <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a> on my
MacBook.  I can then grab .iso files of the operating system I want to install and install them on a
virtual HD via Virtual Box.  Then, I can essentially have two computers running on my one physical
computer.  Wow!!</p>

<p>Right now I have a virtual version of Ubuntu running in a virtual computer:</p>

<p>And I have good ol' OS X running the actual computer.</p>

<p>Allegedly, I have installed Win XP: Pirate Edition on another virtual box.</p>

<p>I *haven't* yet tried running more than one virtual computer at the same time, but I don't see
why not try, except I won't right now because my alleged Win XP, when running, chews up a tonne of
processing power, and I'm on battery right now.</p>

<p>Next thing to install, just for fun: <a href="http://www.turnkeylinux.org/">Turnkey
Linux</a>'s <a href="http://www.turnkeylinux.org/appliances/django">django software appliance</a>.
I'll do that once I get home.</p>
