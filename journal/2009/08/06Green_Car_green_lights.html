<p>I just found one more awesome thing about Japanese train system.</p>

<p>The JR system uses &quot;Suica&quot; debit cards on which people put money and then pay for
trains.  Right now I'm in the Green Car of the Shonan Shinjuku Line which requires one to pay a
machine outside the train for the Green Car seat.  Only reason to pay outside is so that we have a
big touch screen to tell our destination so it knows how much to charge the card.</p>

<p>On the train, we sit down and touch the card to a little red light on the ceiling which
determines we have paid and turns green.  Then the train conductor can come through and make sure
everyone is sitting under a green light, and appropriately chastise those who are not.</p>

<p>Though that's all cool, I've seen it all before.  The cool thing I just now saw was a guy
changing seats!  I was like, <em>yo! he's paid, but is now sitting under a red light</em> and then
he touched his card to turn his light green and the light over his old seat turned red.  Awesome.</p>

<p>heehee!  Two people just left two seats vacant on the other side of the aisle, so I moved over
and moved my green light as well, then played chase-the-red-light with my Suica card. hahahahha I
did it, of course, for testing purposes, to make sure such antics wouldn't break the system, crash
the train, or anything bad like that.</p>
