<p>Zoomed out of work right after 7pm; I was having a crunchy time trying to find a mootools 1.2
compatible pop-up date picker that would float above the screen.  I found all the right parts but
not as one package, and couldn't, in the amount of time available today, get them all working
together.  I wonder if Alfonzo can do it.</p>
