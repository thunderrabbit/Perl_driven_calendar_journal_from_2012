<p>Alfonza, Nate, and I went to my favorite local sushi place for lunch today.  I brought my own
chopsticks and an extra set that Nate used.  Alfonzo had to kill part of a tree.</p>

<p>When we left, it was raining a bit.  I walked all the way straight back; they took a taxi about
half the way.  The storm was impressive for a moment, but not long enough to make me run for
shelter.</p>
