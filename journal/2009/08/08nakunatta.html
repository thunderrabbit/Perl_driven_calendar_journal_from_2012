<p>Woah.  That's a first.  I just met a Japanese man; actually he started talking to me first
(that's the surprising part) and he told me his wife had just died two months ago.  Damn.  Takeshi
in my men's group just went through the same thing 8 months ago, and..  well he has a men's group
with whom to talk about it.</p>

<p>I gave my new friend my card as he got off the train at the station before mine.  I wonder if
he'll contact me.</p>
