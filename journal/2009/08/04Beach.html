<p>I woke up early, rode barefoot to the beach and ran on the rocks; can't really call it
rock-hoppin' cause I was kinda dragging, but really did pretty well for being so early in the
morning I think.  Ran on the beach, seeking the rocks for some extra challenge in the feet.</p>

<p>Got tired and did a 15 minute meditation practice on the stairs near where I met Soness (where
she holds the BBQ each year).</p>
