<p>Anki, the memorization software/website that I've been using for kanji in the past few days is
pretty awesome.</p>

<p>I'm progressing in my ability to write kanji; I can probably write 75% of the first 120 kanji in
the set which I believe is called &quot;Heisigs Remember the Kanji (RTK) 13&quot;, featuring 3007
kanji.</p>
