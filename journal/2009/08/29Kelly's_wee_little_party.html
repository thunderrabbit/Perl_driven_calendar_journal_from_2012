<p>Kelly H is celebrating her birthday today, which happens to correspond with some kinda event
called &quot;US Friendship Day&quot; (perhaps we should start with... jeez, where? Venuzuela,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Palestine?) at the US embassy apartment complex.  (that's my description,
but I'm sure it has a different name.)  I'll probably join karaoke tonight, (but I've got to start
cleaning up Chez Soness!!) we'll see soon!</p>
