<p>Watched District 9 today, at my brother's suggestion.</p>

<p>I liked the long exposition.  It was fully an hour before any wanton shooting started, and even
that wasn't really wanton; how else were they going to get into the building?.</p>

<p>I noticed that they never sealed the hole on the mother ship from which the aliens were ferried
to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>The three-way conflict between aliens, Nigerians, and the MNU seemed reasonable.  I liked
that.</p>

<p>I didn't really like that the aliens were generally shown as animals, with a couple smart ones,
but at least they could communicate with humans (and vice versa), had a bit of culture / planning /
etc.</p>

<p>I liked that our main protagonist never gave up, and almost never gave up his peaceful intentions
toward aliens.</p>

<p>After having read lots of stuff about US government exopolitics, I bet the reaction by MNU was
pretty accurate.</p>

<p>The father (in law) was a bad bad man.  Dang.</p>

<p>I noticed the head Nigerian guy (who practiced voodoo?) had a string tied around his left ankle
when our protagonist was brought before him when wanting to buy weapons.</p>

<p>The characters all seemed well developed, and even the organizations-as-entities seemed
appropriate.</p>

<p>Good times.</p>
