<p>Soness had a rough day at work yesterday (feels that she's been misled for 4 months), so we
stayed up a bit late talking.  After my work, I had a lesson with Gen in Gakugeidaigaku (he's
translating to Japanese the 3rd book in _Getting Things Done_ series) during which Soness called.  I
didn't answer, but met up with her in Yokohama (by virtue of her train being late (apparently a car
was in a crossing with the RR crossing arms down)) so I got to listen to her story (t'was a doozy)
on the train, and we bought some healthy + comforty food on the way home.</p>

<p>Dinner of beef-bacon (fried shabushabu), eggs, toast plus hollendaise (sp) sauce that she made
by hand!  Amazing and yummy!</p>

<p>She spoke with her friend Christine via Skype, though she wasn't able to offer a magic pill for
Soness.  Some things just are the way they are.</p>
