<p>I left work at 7, walked down the street, and from 7:30 ~ 8:30, I met Ayako for a lesson in
Motoya on 2F of Bunkyodo.  I hadn't seen her but once, about 3 weeks ago, so I confided in the
baristas that I had forgotten what my student looks like.  I sat near the first tables and hoped
she would recognize me or be recognizable, etc.  She did/was.</p>

<p>Lesson focused on her upcoming trip to New York, for which I suggested she visit Magnolia
Bakery, Strand Bookstore, and Whole Foods.  She may do the first one for her mom, but Ayako is
vegan and prolly won't join her for a sugar-shocker cupcake.  The Bookstore and Whole Foods are
much higher on her list.</p>
