<p>Code review at work today wasn't as fun as the first one a few days ago, er, a week ago or so.
Alfonzo messed up some of my code and then had to fix it later; I haven't seen it since then, but he
was like, &quot;isn't this supposed to work?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;yeah&quot; and had already
realized it was going to break when I glanced through the code after the review, but I knew he'd
broken it and he'd be able to fix it to his specifications without me even saying anything.
Done.</p>

<p>I worked on building the next screen, trying to take into consideration all the code we've
optimized (PHP, optimized??) in the past.</p>

<p>Another thing that kinda bugged me was that I had written a cool idea to setting CSS classes to
a buncha checkboxes, but I hadn't thought about the example checkboxes on the front sample screen.
Part of it was having not been in on this project from the very beginning, so I don't think of
these things that I've only briefly seen, not reallly experienced.</p>

<p>But I'm getting faster, better, stronger, more powerful than the 6 million dollar man.</p>

<p>If that show came out now, he would have to be at least 6 billion dollars if not a cool
trillion.</p>

<p>I'd like to see Chris Rock do some standup, starting with the key phrase &quot;Billion Dolla
Brotha.&quot;</p>
