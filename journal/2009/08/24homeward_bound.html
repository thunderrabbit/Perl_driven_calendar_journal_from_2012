<p>Right now I'm in the back right hand window seat in car 3 of #15 Homeliner from Tokyo to
Odawara.  Got on in Shinagawa, and someone sat next to me after not too long.  Turns out pretty
much every seat is full so I guess it's not surprising.  And she's pretty cute so no worries.</p>

<p>But, I'm going to sleep instead of anything else.</p>
