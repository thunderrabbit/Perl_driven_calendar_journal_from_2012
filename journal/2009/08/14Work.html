<p>Work dragged on and on today; I thought I'd be able to finish the page which I had started
flowcharting two days ago, but it's still not totally finished.  Thanks to Alfonzo's great idea for
another part of it I will be faster on Monday..  Maybe I should flowchart that over the weekend.
Hmmmm.. nahh..  hmmm yeah... hmmm  nah.  we'll see what happens.</p>
