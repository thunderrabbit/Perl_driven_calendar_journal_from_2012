<p>During the show, I kept looking over at a girl who I knew I knew from somewhere, but couldn't
remember where.  She had the same feeling, so after a bit I went over to her table for a chat.
Turns out I met her at World Family for our interviews for TE!  (Telephone English) Wow!!!  After
getting the latest TE talk out of our system (how the job is going for her and how I didn't pursue
it to acceptance), we mostly talked iPhone stuff as there were two other iPhone users at the table,
David (Pink Cow¤Î) and JP, who knew Melinda Ortner from LA before he moved to Tokyo 1.5 years
ago.</p>

<p>Even more interesting than that: Sarah was chatting with Jodi, who she had also met through a
job interview, and randomly at the Pink Cow tonight!  Wow!  As Traci says, &quot;it's a small Pink
Cow world.&quot;</p>
