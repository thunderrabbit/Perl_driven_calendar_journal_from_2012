<p>Pretty okay day at work today; Alfonz and I hope we can get my little project finished by this
week, hopefully by tomorrow, during which I'd like to extend a mootools class (therefore in
Javascript); I've extended plenty of classes, but never in Javascript so gotta learn a bit of new
syntax but I think I understand it already.</p>
