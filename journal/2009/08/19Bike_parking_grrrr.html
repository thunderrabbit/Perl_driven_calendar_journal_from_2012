<p>I'm on the train now, and I made it on time despite having to go &quot;all the way up&quot; to
3rd floor of the bicycle parking area.  I had wanted to park down on the ground floor; I spotted
some spots in the back behind the parking garage thing, so I headed that direction (instead of up
the ramp) though the guy at the front was all, &quot;3rd floor, 3rd floor please,&quot; in his
robotic repetitive voice to help guide sleepy bike parkers to ample parking spaces.</p>

<p>I had veered off his prescribed track, so he was like, &quot;hey, sir!&quot; clapping twice to
get my attention. I turned around, immediately grouchy, &quot;there is space!&quot; and he
repeated, &quot;3rd floor please,&quot; and I go, &quot;why?  there is space outside,&quot; and he
goes, &quot;outside is ...&quot; and I just picked up the bike to hurry up past people slowly
rolling their bikes up the ramp, put it in a second level rack up on third floor, and just left it
(the rack) down saying, &quot;you put it up&quot; to no one in particular.</p>

<p>Where did all this pissy anger come from?  I don't like it, but sometimes it just ... fuck I
don't know.</p>

<p>And why all the cussing?</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>
