<p>The Oceanic, the new PB ship, features something like 11 decks, two pools, three jacuzzis, four
outdoor decks, rooms with balconies, and only 400 passengers to fill it on this voyage.</p>

<p>Got to talk to Yoko, P, and Rei.  Met Paul (this is his first voyage) and дсдс (repeating
CC??).  Paul may contact me when he arrives back in Japan to work on his website.  Actually,
because his brain will have <del>turned to mush</del> <ins>metamorphized</ins>, I'm going to
contact *him* when he gets back to see if he needs help with his website.</p>
