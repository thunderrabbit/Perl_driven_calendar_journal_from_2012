<p>I left work at 7pm to meet Mark at Pink Cow, but he didn't show up.  I was a bit flustrated at
first, but then I was just like fukkit and relaxed and had a good time.  Realized that I don't
*have* to do anything, much less the paperwork that's needed doing for months.</p>

<p>Bought some cow chips and offered them to the two women sitting to my left.  I could see her
glancing over at the chips so I offered more, with a pretend-secret whisper to her friend &quot;目が
ここに見てるだから。&quot; and they laughed.</p>

<p>They shared with me their bean burrito once they decided what to get, and we chatted a bit.
Their names are Yuki and Mina.  Yuki kept telling everyone I'm a redneck (after I told her I'm from
Texas), and I didn't deny it after the second time.  We did the Bump with our iPhones to trade
infos and chatted a bit while the first band was on.</p>

<p>Heard from Soness and did a quick run to the local rock climbing gym to see about getting her
some liquid chalk before she heads out to Thailand tomorrow.  They didn't sell it, and the place
that does sell it closed at 8pm.  Headed back to The Pink Cow to see the next band perform.  They
combined Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and English in the performance, and I really enjoyed the
lead singer's smile.</p>

<p>Hugged her after the show, and got her URL: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hanaeryca">Hana
