<p>Met Emiko in 大手町 station, and walked to a bookstore very close to Tokyo station where I
helped her choose a textbook for her English lessons.  This counted as a free lesson, as I had
missed our previous lesson due to mis-entering it as 8pm start instead of 7pm, plus busy at work so
didn't check my calendar just to be sure, plus forgot all about it.  Offered her a free lesson as a
make-up, and she accepted.</p>

<p>After getting a book for her, I looked for Autobiography of a Yogi by Yogananda なんとか, but
they didn't have it in stock.  Good thing, cause they wanted over 1000 yen for it, which I had been
willing to pay.  Can prolly get it for a lot fewer yen at a used book store.</p>
