<p>Man.  I coulda come in at 5pm and get as much done as I have already today.  That's what it
feels like, anyway.  I did get to chat with Fred a bit, and catch up on a few emails, and
visit <a href="http://www.thepentacon.com/">http://www.thepentacon.com/</a>, and get some free
pizza, but it's like nothing work-related got finished.  Oh, but, well, I did get a bit of progress
on getting my local environment working, so that's good.</p>
