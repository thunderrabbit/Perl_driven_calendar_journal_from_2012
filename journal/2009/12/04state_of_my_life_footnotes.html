<p>(*) Hmmmm.  I'm thinking I should make an entry in my wiki for Little Blue Monkey, but not going
to put it under peeps (stuffed animals are the only inanimate objects that get that treatment), so I
was going to put it under the category Things, but my other two categories are called Peeps and
Places, so I wondered if I could keep with the (ah crap what's the word that means using the same
initial sound for consecutive words?) Ps so I thought Pieces or Parts, but THEN I realized I've also
wanted to have an entry for Events, which also doesn't start with P, so maybe I could start them
both with E, like Events and Extras, but extras isn't quite right either, but then I was like,
&quot;ohhhhh I got it!&quot;</p>
