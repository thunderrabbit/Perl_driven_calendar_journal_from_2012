<p>We almost made our deadline at work.  Website was supposed to go live today at 10am, noon, 3pm,
5pm, nevermind; we'll do it tomorrow.  I destroyed any of my previous records for time spent at
work, and time spent programming.  Arrived at work on Sunday morning, with sleeping bag ready to go
camping!  We slept about 5 hours that night (from 4am to 9am..  maybe it was 6 hours from 3am.)
Then we got up, started coding and didn't stop except for quick pee breaks and to stuff foodage
into our guts.  Coded straight from like 10am Monday 9:30pm Tuesday.  Nearly 36 hours straight
coding.</p>

<p>At times code was flowing, and at times slowing, but got stuff going and fixed first round of
bugs after semi-release and Alfonzo installed the new version and we've gone through another set of
fixes.  Man, we really coulda used another month.</p>
