<p>Went to Kate's cafe this morning, where we enjoyed delicious soup and smiley hugs.  Conversation
included Kevin and Jeff's plans to attend a seminar on 24 January, and therefore plans to watch a
movie on 23 January.  Also talked about other stuff or something.  Plus Kate's delicious soup! I woulda
stayed a lot longer but need to meet Simon to skate!  Yukiko walked me (and Toshiko) to the bus
stop; I told her I'd call her around 5pm if Simon and I were finished skating.  (We'd be near where
she was headed.)</p>
