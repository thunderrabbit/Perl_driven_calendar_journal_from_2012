<p>Wow; didn't I just write one of these???  (the idea is to write one per month)</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I live downstairs on my own little spot of heated carpet at Chez Soness in Chigasaki,
Kanagawa, Japan.  Been in Japan going on 7 years now (will be 7 in March).</p></li>

<li><p>I work with Nate and Alfonzo at a small company, and we just put a website together though
it's still unlisted.</p></li>

<li><p>My finances are getting better.  I've actually got like $6500 in the bank, iirc..  like
650,000 yen.  So with the US dollar relatively weak (85 yen per dollar oh snap), it works out to
7600 dollars.</p></li>

<li><p>girlfriend = false</p></li>

<li><p>My computer now has a backup drive again; my drive conked out recently after I loaned it to
Bananna who placed it carefully on the floor near her computer and I kicked it over (twice) in my
sleep.  When I woke up the next morning it was like, &quot;gggzzzggzgg&quot; instead of
&quot;--------------------&quot; as a startup noise.  eep!  Bananna took it to Akibakan in
Akihabara where I got it and they replaced it.  Nice.</p></li>

<li><p>just arrived in Chigasaki.  to be continued:</p>

<p class="date">12:18pm JST Saturday  5 December 2009 (day 14500)</p></li>

<li><p>I'm 14500 days old today!!  Headed to yoga with Paola now (and fellow student Emiko), but
will be a bit late (15 mins?).</p></li>

<li><p>My iPhone (* see footnotes) is something I haven't (consistently|ever) put in my SoML
entries.  Its name is Little Blue Monkey cause it has a blue case, and when I plug it in to my
computer, I don't have it sync automatically cause I don't change a whole lot on it.  I've got 690
songs across 49 artists, and 4.25 pages of apps.  Oh and 937 photos.  Recently I've been listening
to Mirah's album &quot;You Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This&quot; on repeat.  Before
that I was listening to AniKiko's albums on repeat.</p>

<p>Recent games: Finger Physics, Bumper Stars, and my &quot;long time favorite,&quot; Doodle Jump.
Recently also got a port of Adventure that Fred and I used to play on the Atari 2600.  なつかしいい！</p>
</li>

<li><p>Internet access for me is fine.  Solid at work and solid at home, plus relatively solid via
my iPhone.</p></li>

<li><p>My roommate Soness hasn't seen me much recently as I've been working working working, and
she's been traveling traveling traveling.</p></li>

<li><p>I-group meetings have recently drawn 3 or 4 men, though we cancelled the last one cause only
two could show up (I was one who could not)</p></li>

<li><p>My personal work recently, as I mentioned in a previous entry, has basically been to not
have a girlfriend.  It's not intense work, especially when I've been working so intensely, but it's
something, and I'm aware of the draw to have a girlfriend or have sex, but I'm keeping those
thoughts at the thought level and not manifesting anything.</p></li>

<li><p>It's not volunteer work in the sense of volunteering for a greater cause, but I volunteered
a lot of my time recently to get the new website going at work.  That seems to be over so I'm glad
to have some time back.</p></li>

<li><p>language study = false</p></li>

<li><p>I've recently been programming just in PHP, but now that the project is stablized, I'm
thinking I'll whip out a Python framework on my website (which was recently moved from a server
called York to a server called Nicosia (named after the capital of Cyprus), and now supports
Django).</p>

<p>Hmmm; just realized Fred has a standing request to help him with his project in Fortran.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently, Alfonzo and I bought a domain that we'll use to post answers to computer Qs of
various types.  Need to get the .net as well and then I'll post it.</p></li>

<li><p>pets = false, though Soness has her cat Nibbles, who often barfs on the floor.</p></li>

<li><p>marble track = false</p></li>

<li><p>recent music = Mirah, AniKiko</p></li>

<li><p>If I lost my computer, it'd be largely okay, cause my 1TB backup drive is back to backing up.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't done much art stuff recently</p></li>

<li><p>Part of our website is a media server.  I believe I'll be able to get that code installed on
media.robnugen.com and serve images from there.  Awesome.</p></li>

<li><p>earthquakes = no good ones recently</p></li>

<li><p>It's been getting cold, but not crazy cold.  I think it's like 8 - 13 degrees today, with a
modicum of water droplets falling from the overcast sky</p></li>

<li><p>I'm thinking I'll visit my brother in the US this summer, or we might go to Europe at the
same time.</p></li>
</ol>
