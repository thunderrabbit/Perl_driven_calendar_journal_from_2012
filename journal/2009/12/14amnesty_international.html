<p>Wrote a letter to Keiko Chiba, the director of something something overseing Judicial Reform in
Japan.  Amnesty International had a fundraiser at What The Dickens and I worte a letter as party of
their letter writing campaign.  I would transcribe it here but it's sent and i don't have a lot of
time before train arrives, but basically &quot;Thank you for supporting Judicial Reform in Japan;
this will bring Japan up on par with other first world countries.  For example in the United States
people are ggiven a lawyer if they can't afford one.  The following points will be a good start:
guarantee a lawyer for all defendants, video tape the questionaing and make the tape available to
the lawers, limit questioning to eight hours; anything more is psychological torture.  Theak you Rob
Nugen,&quot; and forgot to sign my name I just realized, gut it was a hand writtenn letter, and I
put my address (Soness's address) so they can contact me if desired.</p>
