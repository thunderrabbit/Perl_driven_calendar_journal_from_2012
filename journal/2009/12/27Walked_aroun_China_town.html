<p>Walked with Keiko around China Town once we had to leave the ship (at 4:30pm).  We were both
supa-hungry so went to a buffet, but it wasn't a buffet in the sense of a huge spread of food; it
was all-you-can-order, so I ordered a bunch of almond jelly desserts and Keiko ordered food items.
I massaged her feet under the table and enjoyed her しあわせ smile.  As we were walking around China
Town afterward, she was like, &quot;is there anything else you want?&quot; and I go,
&quot;nope,&quot; then revised it, &quot;well, just you,&quot; and she laughed a bit, &quot;yeah
just me, just for now,&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmmmm.  Ya got me there.</p>
