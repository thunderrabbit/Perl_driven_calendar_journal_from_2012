<p>So, back in the day, like when I was 10 years old, I already had the question in my brain,
&quot;what is this stuff called reality?&quot; cause I noticed that some things tend to be as they
are whether or not I believe they are that way.  (though I can't think of any cases of the opposite
case: I create reality in a certain way, so why would I have been thinking about this??</p>

<p>I would think things like, &quot;I can't remember exactly how I left my books stack, blue on top
or yellow on top&quot; (contrite but simple example) &quot;but there *is* an answer.&quot;  I guess
it was similar to Schroedinger's Cat, except the outcome had been known, just forgotten.</p>

<p>A bit later, I expanded on this idea a bit, trying to articulate different types of reality.
LIke personal reality, the state of which no one else knows (I named my dog after a cut girl at
school, I left my pencil on the left side of my desk).   But then there is a grouply believed
reality (earth is round sky is blue Texas is here France is there).  Then there's reality that no
one knows for sure, but assumes  (the forest survived the storm, the shipwreck is still sunk at the
point)..</p>

<p>Then there's my recent realizations about time.  Time makes a *huge* difference in our
perception of reality.  Without time as a demension, things would be realllllly different.</p>

<p>One quick example is a traffic intersection.  cars and people and trains exist in the same
physical place, but in a different temporal place, so no collission occurs.  I mean that's really
amazing that there's a dimension through which we're all smurfing one second per second, and it
makes things like a fourth spacial dimesnion if I think about it in a certain way.   Like a bunch
of maps of flatland all stacked up through the time demension</p>

<p>But then we get to more subtle stuff.  LIke I cut my finger.  I know the phrase &quot;this too,
shall pass&quot; (I used it last night on my FB status)  Perfect example: I ripped part of my
toenail off when walking up the steps in Kyoto Station.  So *now* have a bit of a bloody spot on my
toe.. well, let's say meaty or fleshy anyway it used to have a toesnail on it, but wait, no it
didn't; that was over there in time, and theis is now itn time.  There's no evidence that there was
a toelnail over this part of my toe.  I remember there having been a toenail, but why can't I
remember the toenail having grown back?  It hasn't yet?  what does that mean?</p>

<p>I imagine, through the division of labor, the skin cells and toenail cells are busy at work
converting oxygen into more of themselves through the labor of division.  One cell at a time, slowly
slowly.  ah man I just used &quot;time&quot; as a descriptor without noticing!</p>
