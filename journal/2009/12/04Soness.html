<p>Went to see Soness at The Pink Cow tonight on my way home.  She's not going to come home tonight
cause she has to be on the Shinkansen at 7:30am (in Shinagawa?) so this way she can get a bit more
sleep.  She'll couch surf with a guy named Neil who she met some time ago and again (by chance) at
The Pink Cow, and then this weekend she has shows of course, and will be out until Sunday.
(Basically our schedules are opposite each other.)</p>

<p>Charlie was there as well, so I got to say HI and Bye and thanks to him; he's a cool guy and I'm
sure we'da had a lot more fun had I not had to work as much as I had to while he was surfin' in
Chez Soness.</p>

<p>Soness told me about manifesting a pony in Okinawa, and about some of her self revelations while
down there.  I'm glad she's doing so much personal growth.  <del>Dwarfing any personal growth I've
been doing...</del></p>
