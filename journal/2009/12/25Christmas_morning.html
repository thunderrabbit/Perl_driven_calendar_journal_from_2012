<p>Slep until 8:07am, meditated for 15 minutes (for the first time in maybe over a month) and then
found Nibbles sleepin' in Soness's bed.  Took a pic for Soness's amusement and headed down and
out.  Ah man I forgot to get up earlier so I could 8walk8 to the station cause Soness's yellow bike
is already there.  Took soness'sBlue bike quickly to the bike parking lot though had two delays of
my own making:</p>

<ol>
<li>the bicycle lock fell through a hole in the bike basket so I had to stop and get it.</li>

<li>I was like aw man I forgot my contacts again!! when I didn't feel them in y pocket.  (the
case)..  Then I checked more carefully and found the case in my other pocket
</ol>

<p>Made the trai with 40 seconds to spare.</p>
