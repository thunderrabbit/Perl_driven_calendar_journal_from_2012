I really enjoyed Reflexion for a while, though haven't played it recently.  I probably got 40 hours
of playtime on it.  If you get the game, we can make levels and play eachother's levels, so that
could reinvigorate my playtime.  The level I made is called Wavy Blue Lines.

One game that's strangely addictive is Doodlejump (one word?) It's got a little character with a
long nose who's endlessly jumping up up up up the iPhone.  super simple game play, strangely cute,
and I still play it at times.

Dapple was a favorite of mine, and Ami has the WORLD high schoor (I'm just going to leave that
spelling of score; I guess high school was coming out of my fingers.)  I found Dapple because the
author's blog entry (about how much money he *actually* made on the app) was slashdotted.  The game
play is a bit complicated, actually: mix paint colors to get four+ adjacent same-color paint
blotches that then vanish.  There's a head-to-head game play as well which Ami and I enjoyed many
times.

nin:access offers *all* NIN songs free.  The app costs a bit to download, like 30 seconds of your
time, but it's worth it.

TheDeep is a pinball game that I enjoyed for a while.

Did I tell you about Finger Physics?  They made a Lite version.  It's fun enough that I bought the
pay version.  I'd love a way to make our own levels there.

Not seen Dragon's Lair nor ssh.   ssh on iPhone???????

I sometimes roll through the app store with your friends technique of most recent games.

I called Dad and Ma today (Christmas night y'all's time).  Everyone is happy and healthy so I'm glad
about that.

    Love Love Love
