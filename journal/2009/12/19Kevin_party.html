<p>Great time at Kevin's party last night, with lots of eating, drinking, dancing.  Kailash was
basically break dancing on the carpet, doing little sideways rolls and stuff, which was pretty
impressive given that he's only 2.5 years old.  He got two new girlfriends (しょ and her friend
Mona, both 11 years old).</p>

<p> Jeff and Kevin told a lot of dirty jokes, and I told the vaseline car joke, plus another I've
forgotten at the moment.  The celebrations included Kate's birthday party as well.  After flashing
on and off the hall lights, she became a ghost in the hallway through the frosted glass windows.
Later I got to be her &quot;love slave.&quot; She had me massage her shoulders and feet, and then
loaned me out for massages to Toshiko and Yukiko.  Kate left with しょ (her daughter; I think しょ
is her nickname) around 11pm, so I told her she could get an extension on possessing me tomorrow
(which was today).</p>

<p>Partytime did *not* go all night, but lasted til about midnight when everyone was either gone or
tired.  One the floor was a bit more cleared out, I danced with Yukiko on piggyback for about 10
minutes, at first calling her light as an angel, and then &quot;wow; that was a good
workout!&quot;</p>

<p>We slept side by side like platonic sardines, but smooched a bit in the morning.  All clothes
stayed on and no skin contact occurred below the neck.</p>
