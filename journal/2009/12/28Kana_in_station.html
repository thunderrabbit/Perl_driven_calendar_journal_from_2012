<p>Kana, who lives next next door to Chez Soness (I'm not <em>quite</em> ready to say me and
Soness), saw me in Chigasaki station, &quot;Rob!おはよう&quot; and I was slow to recognize her cause
I don't see her very often, and her long black hair was all hidden under a knit cap.  After a moment
of me forgetting how to say, &quot;great to see you, but I gotta run!&quot; I remembered her
name+identity and gave her an A-frame hug and &quot;HI Kana&quot;</p>

<p>Made my train with several seconds to spare.</p>
