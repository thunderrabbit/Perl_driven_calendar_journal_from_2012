<p>Mark and I are going to split the percentage of Cow-Go that I was getting before because I've
been way busy with work and haven't been able to keep up with everytihg, plus he has some
complimentary skillsets (sales, building a language school) that I don't have/want.</p>

<p>Spoke with Traci before meeting Mark.  Turns out DJ Miki is single.  Wow.  Single bilingual
and hottt.</p>

<p>402 days to go.</p>
