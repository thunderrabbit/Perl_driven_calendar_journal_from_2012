<p>After Yoga, Emiko dropped me off at Good Day books in Ebisu, cause I had asked about it, or
something...  actually I'm not sure how she knew I wanted to go, but anyway, I have for a while but
had never taken the time to go.   Anyways, I got _Autobiography of a Yogi_, a book that was
recommended to me by Kevin.  He actually gave me a copy which I left on a train after I was about
halfway through reading it.  I had been planning to read it while on the train, but there were some
really cute girls so I put the book up on the rack so it wouldn't block my view.  Grabbed my bag;
forgot my book.</p>

<p>The yogi book was in stock, and they're going to order Richard Hoagland's _Dark Mission_ for
me.  Nice.</p>
