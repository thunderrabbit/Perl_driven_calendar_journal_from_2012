<p>Fred chatted me something that took me a bit to figure out:</p>

<pre>
Fred: Places / Peeps: alliteration
      Items / Times: anagram
</pre>

<p>My brain was like <em>tick tick tick tick</em> as the wheels rolled back to when I had been
talking about these words.  <em> tick tick tick </em>.  Ah!!  For my wiki!  With his extra
validation that I had chosen some cool words, I set up the Items category and renamed the Events
category to Times.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to write a bit for my first Items entry, for this white MacBook</p>

<pre>
The border around the screen of my white MacBook features three pictures from プリクラ from back in
the days when I had Ami, Francois, and when Kellie and Dan (52nd) still lived in Japan, and before
Jesse and Anna got married.

Written on the left side, below the screen is M8R-xhja131, the code for my tr mailinator address.
The word MacBook has been highlighted in green, and my Skype-friend Geng Juan's name is written on
the right below the screen so I can write her name quickly when she chats, &quot;do you remember
me?&quot; on Skype on rare occassion.

I have a brown dot of glue on the W key, so I can distinguish it from the Q key when closing windows
instead of entire apps.  My old Firefox sticker now says &quot;uver the '' b&quot; and is missing
about 1/3 of its face.  Still have the entire Shark label that I put on while working at 77Hz.

Inside my computer I have Mac OS X Version 10.6.2 on a 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo processor and 2 GB
667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM.  HDD is 424.23 GB with 292.54 GB available
