<p>Met several cool peeps at The Pink Cow tonight, including Eve, Jo, Ian, Mika, Marina,
an <a href="http://www.bassinvaderproject.com/">Felipe Gomez</p> from Chile who played 6 string bass
in a most awesome way.  I had never seen anyone play by tapping the strings instead of strumming,
and I had really never seen anyone playing without touching the strings so that was doubly neat.

<p>I reiki'd Jo a bit after she read my name card &quot;freestyle healing&quot; and was a bit
sruprised but happy that she had never heard of it.  happy to share it with somone for their first
time.  Eve was like, &quot;dood you should really look into it I've seen some amazing stuff.&quot;
and I got, &quot;the physical world is not as we've been taught.  TV does not teach us
reality.&quot;</p>

<p>Man there are some drunk peeps on this train.</p>

<p>Um, so I hope to hang with them again; the group seemed pretty neat.</p>

<p>I had gone originally to meet Mark who taught a sample lesson to Erika, who ended up joining for
a bit of food (I got a burriot and she got a salmon salda and Mark got  a hambruger.  They didn't
stay long enough to see the live music, but that's when  my new peeps came up front.</p>

<p>Eve reminded me physically of Bananna, and Marina looked like a slightly smaller version of
Eve.  Jo has bright blonde haire  9short spiky) and Ian  kinda vertically angled wave and Mika had
her hair back in a pony tail</p>

<p>Dorothy was there for a bit while Mark and Erika were there; she and I chateted about our
iPhones and shared favorite apps.  Erika works as a dental hygenist, and likes nowboarding and
anything outdoor sporty like.</p>

<p>I didn't have U-Cow or I might ahave gotten some pictures.  I think I want a flash-enabled
camera.  Hmmm.  I wonder if a flash can be obtained for the iphone.</p>
