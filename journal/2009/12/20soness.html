<p>Got home last night and told Soness two things, though I couldn't remember the first one first
so I told her the second one:  I kissed a girl, and she was like, &quot;I knew it from the photo on
Facebook!  You're never going to make it 500 days!&quot;  And I was like, &quot;yes I will!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Oh!  And I remembered the second one.  &quot;I stubbed the <em>crap</em> out of my toe,&quot;
and she was like, &quot;Oh yeah I saw it on Facebook..  Gross!&quot;  &quot;You wanna see it
here?&quot;  &quot;no way!&quot;</p>

<p>Good to be back home.</p>
