<p>Was 15 minutes late to yoga, but fortunately for my conscious they did not wait.  I was surprised
at my ability to do a pose that was basically a plus shape on the wall.  well, no a um, anyway a
shape for which I don't have a name, but I was on one foot standing with leg straight, then my body
tilted sideways at a ninety degree angle and my other leg straight out parallel with my body and my
arms outstretched vertically up and down.</p>
