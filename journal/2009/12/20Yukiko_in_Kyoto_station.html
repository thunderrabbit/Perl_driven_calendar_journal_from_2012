<p>Called Yukiko when on my way to Kyoto station, and she met me there.  This was a good thing
because it gave me a reminder of me-in-relationship, vs me-single.  After changing my shinkansen
destination from … ¿Ó to ø∑≤£…Õ (and got 680 yen refund woot), I waited for Yukiko at the entrance
and thought, &quot;man; what am I doing waiting for her?  Why'd I even call her?  I could be
upstairs in the cafe getting a tasty treat and beverage.&quot;</p>

<p>Some gears clicked into place in my brain, and I went upstairs to the cafe to get a tasty treat
and beverage.  Got an banana-walnut pastry but no beverage cause they didn't have what I wanted.</p>

<p>Yukiko called when she arrived and I told her where I was.  <em>Hmmm; that was easy.  I guess I
don't necesarily need to stay planted when waiting for someone.</em></p>

<p>Told her what I had been thinking, and she said she had been thinking the same thing, &quot;why
am I going the opposite direction from where I need to go to get home?&quot;</p>

<p>We walked around a bit to in search of a 500 ml paper carton of milk tea (but the store was
closed so I got a plastic bottle; gah)</p>

<p>Bought her a ticket to come into the platform area so we could wait for the train together, and
while making a racist remark about the security guy not answering my question, but pointing me to
the ticket window, &quot;oh I can't answer your question cause you're white,&quot; I slipped a bit
walking up the steps and stubbed the crap out of my toe.  It really hurt more than I guessed it
should, so I checked once we sat down.  Left big toe nail bent back, broken, drizzling blood.
Wow!  So I took a picture and posted it on FB.</p>

<p>Chatty chat and a few kisses then my train arrived in a flash of white.  Man that was fast!</p>
