<p>Met up with Miki tonight to sort out some questions that came up regarding a journal entry.  She
wanted to meet before or after yoga, and I figured tonight the day before yoga would count as
before.  Our normal cafe was too crowded, so we went to my favorite ramen shop for discussions (near
the big Starbucks overlooking Shibuya crossing).</p>

<p>After I finished my ramen (she wasn't hungry), we went for a bit of a walk (inside cause there's
a bit of a cold drizzle tonight).  Underground via Exit 6, then under Shibuya Crossing, into Food
Show, then into Mark City all on B1, then up to 2F and into Tokyu Plaza 5F or so until 9pm and then
down to the JR ticket office where I bought tix for reserved seats on the bullet train to Kyoto next
weekend.  (To me, &quot;bullet train&quot; sounds cooler than &quot;shinkansen&quot;)</p>

<p>Headed back upstairs to our respective trains.  Everything is cool again.</p>
