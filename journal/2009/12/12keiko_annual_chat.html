<p class="date">12:02pm JST Sunday 13 December 2009 (day 14508)</p>

<p>Met up with my non girlfriend girl friend Keiko from 49, , during which we met while overlooking
the port as the ship docked in the morning in Port Sayed, Egypt.  That was the first time I saw
her.  We hung out randomly together at various parties dances deck dates, but we never kissed; just
stayed in touch over the years.</p>

<p>I did kiss her once last year as I was leaving her house after eating curry at the local Indian
restaurnat in motosumiyoshi and then chilling on her couch, debating in my head the pros and cons of
smooching her.  Primary con: I was with AMi at the time.</p>

<p>Last night we met at Ebisu staiton and went to What The Dickens (ironically, cause I've not been
there in probably a year, but have plans to go there and meet Soness and her peeps tonight)</p>

<p>What The Dickens was quiet enough for talking at first, and Keiko told me her latest and
(boyfriend whose name reinds me of &quot;red cow&quot; and busy at work)</p>

<p>She said something to me that really piqued my interest, and might (probably) be the same thing
that Soness told me (that I fear real intimacy.  Keiko said basically my level of affection goes
down over time with each girl I'm with.  wtf?  How do you know that?  Is it true?  wha?   were all
questions that tubled through my ipote at that time.</p>

<p>So I was like,  &quot;I can be ラブラブ！！ そうしますか？&quot; and she goes &quot;yes please!&quot; so we
were more ラブラブ for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>What The Dickens got noisy with a band called Minx.  After two songs, the lead vocalist was like,
&quot;I guess it's time to give my speech,&quot; and then paused into a more somber tone,
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to let you know, we are Minx. ONE TWO THREE
FOUR!&quot; and they jammed into their next song.</p>

<p>Keiko and I stayed for perhaps five songs, and I was like, &quot;shall we go for a walk?&quot;
cause I'd much rather speak with her on these annual meetings.  We sought ice cream, and went to an
Italian place called Palermo the Japanese transcription of which would be transcrbed in english as
parerumo, which I thought was interesting.</p>

<p>(I'm on the train to RC in Tachikawa, not yet wearing contacts not yet wearing contacts so I can
only see to make corrections if I hold the computer up close to my face like this, which makes for
a slow rate of typing and fixing mistakes.</p>

<p>I sat across the table from Keiko in Palermo, but then she asked me to sit beside her as I
started more deeper sharing (had already done some deeper sharing, so this was more deeper
sharing)  she was like, &quot;wait come sit here&quot; cause she wasn't catching all my words, and
I was talking about , well, stuff she wanted to undehear accurately.</p>

<p>Ever since I met her I was like dood we should date; she is hottt&quot; and every time I would
see her near Bradt (RIP) I would bristle <em>get away from my girl</em> cause he was all suave and
spoke better Japanese than me and always seemd to have a gaggle ogf girls around.  Unlike me of
course.  um, so  I was envious of Brandt</p>

<p>Sorry got a bit side tracked thinking about Brandt's death, er the announcement of Brandt's
death.  he and I had essentially started being e-supporters of eah other, as he was building
strayform and something else.  After his death I realized the need for services that would be able
to disperse passwords to designated parties after one's demise.  Anyway</p>

<p>Keiko listened wmaah, and I listened wmaah and despite all the affection, we never kissed more
than cheek to cheek</p>

<p>We talkeda bout the meaning of love, and decided to marry each other in ten years if we're not
maried by then.</p>

<p>Does ten years seem so far away that my life will then be over and desperate for a partner if I
don't have one?  interesting.</p>

<p>I assured her she was not an old woman cause an old woman wouldn't go to Roppongi clubbing over
night, and she corrected me, saying there are clubs at which a lot of seniors go (like our parents
age) and I'm like, &quot;eeep!!!&quot; I mean it's cool and all for them to be genki  but
clubbing?  wow!  eep?  wow!</p>

<p>We decided to go to Aghea together sometime.</p>

<p>walked her to Hibiya line and parted ways in the underground by the ticket gaes, under the
street that crosses perpindicularly under Yamanote line  at Ebisu.</p>
