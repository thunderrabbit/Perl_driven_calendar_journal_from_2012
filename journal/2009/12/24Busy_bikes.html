<p>To help Soness I carried her backpack to the train station for her 6:07am train.  She rode her
bicycle beside me as we chatted about the latest haps in my life related to Cow-Go, Emiko,
Yurika, and Mark.  Big hugs to her cute self in my big winter coat and then got her backpack on the
train and hugs and see ya next year.</p>

<p>Rode back in the dark, without my contacts, which was trickier than I guessed it might be!</p>

<p>Zzzzz until 8:12am</p>

<p>After several snoozes, I got up, got dressed, got out on time and rode TJ Bike to the bike
parking lot in the light, without my contacts.  Once I got to the train station, I realized I didn't
even have my contacts in my bag.</p>

<p>Dang.</p>

<p>I headed out of the station, two minutes before my 500 yen train was due.  Got my 500 yen back,
walked back to the bike parking lot to retrieve TJ Bike.  Realized I wouldn't be able to get prime
parking again; it would certainly be full to the roof by the time I got back, so I walked back
home.</p>

<p>On the way home I checked the next trains, and found one that left at 9:16am, straight for
Shibuya.  Ah crud no way I can make that if I walk back to the station.</p>

<p>Got home, 14 minutes before the train was to leave, put in my contacts, then I rode Soness's
yellow bike to the bike parking lot.  Showed the guy I had already bought a ticket today and rolled
in with her bike.  Was surprised to find the parking garage *not* yet full, so I was able to park
inside instead of on the roof.</p>

<p>Made my train (got a seat for 950 yen instead of 500) and here we are, approaching ¸ÍÄÍ (¤È¤Ä¤«).</p>
