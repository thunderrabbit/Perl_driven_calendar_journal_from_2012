<p>Counting down the bug fixes before going live.</p>

<p>I think they're on the last one, actually.</p>

<p class="date">10:27pm JST</p>

<p>Japan is so slow.</p>

<p class="date">10:28pm JST</p>

<p>Aw man, Alfonzo just doesn't understand that they don't understand.  He's trying to explain too
much shit about stupidness that they're not going to understand, so he should skip that part and
just get to the actual question instead of farting around all yeah there's a cross site scripting
problem so they think that's the problem that needs to be solved, BUT</p>

<p>BUT, and he knows this, the problem to be solved is just copy the files over.  They're going to
see the error and think &quot;oh we can't solve that error; it's on your system.&quot;  That part
is known.  We know.  We just need a copy of the files that it's trying to get and then we'll be
golden.  Just say give me the files.  Just say give me the files.  Don't confuse them with the
details of the XSS error.</p>

<p class="date">10:36pm JST</p>

<p>finally, he got the info he needed.  See Alfonzo is reallly smart.  Crazy smart.  He parses
source code in his sleep.  Just the brotha can't explain in human words all the stuff that's in his
brain.  The other guy now is off running elsewhere to figure out the answer to what he thinks is the
question, but I'd be pretty durn surprised if he actually knows the question Al was trying to
ask.</p>

<p class="date">10:39pm JST</p>

<p>Let's see.</p>

<p>Oh.  I was wrong; he understood the question.  Al already found the data anyway, but he waited
patiently for the guy to come back so that we could <em>keep the appearance</em> that we hadn't
found the data already and had a string on the command line waiting for an enter key to copy it all
to our server.  scp is great.  Thank
you <a href="http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/scp.1.asp">Timo and Tatu</a>!!</p>
