<p>Happily, now that my rent is halved at Chez Soness, and I'm getting paid $1000 more per month
than I was at 77Hz, I'm no longer living paycheck to paycheck.</p>

<p>Am even planning to go on a mini vacation to Kyotoooooh my gosh I forgot that's where Simon
lives!  I gotta make a bit of time to see him as well, and maybe SKATE!!  Whooo that would be
great..  Wow lemme write to him; brb.</p>

<pre>
Yo Simon

Guess where I'll be from 17 to 20 December???

If you guessed Bahrain, not only would you be wrong, but you'd have guessed the same thing my friend
Jen in Kyoto did when I asked her to guess what city I'd be visiting when I made plans to visit her city!

You and ·¯ can join us for tasty beverages on Friday night, or I'll have a bit of free time on
Sunday afternoon after wild binging and drinking the night before, so I'll be sooopa ready to SKATE!

Can we rent skates my size in Kyoto?

Havest thou free time on Sunday the 20th?

     Peace
     - Rob
