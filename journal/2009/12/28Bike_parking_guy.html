<p>I'm just wearing sandals (and no socks cause it's rainy) so one of the bicycle parking guys was
like, 「足さむたくないの？」&quot;aren't your feet cold?&quot; and I'm all 「さむたくない」&quot;not
cold&quot; even though they were a bit cold, just not *that* cold, plus I don't know how to 
explain in Japanese that I prefer cold+barefoot over warm+shod except to say 「沓がきらい」(I hate
shoes) which probably isn't very polite.  I guess I could use the polite phrase にがて, but it
means, &quot;not good at doing&quot; so I think it's a bit weird to say I'm not good at wearing
shoes, (though it'd be pretty funny!)</p>

<p>Ah.  Not so funny.  My dictionary says 苦手（にがて） means &quot;poor (at), weak (in), dislike
(of)&quot; so I guess my shoes fit this phrase.</p>
