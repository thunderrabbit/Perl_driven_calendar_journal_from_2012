<p>Met Jen and Taka last night, Jen first, at a station very close to Kevin's house, and then we
took a train and walked to meet Taka and two of their work mates, Andy and Simon.  Simon is also a
programmer, and we decided he's an English teacher who can program, and I'm a programmer who can
teach English.  He recommended an iPhone app called Japanese for 2300 yen, which I may get.  In
addition to teaching kanji, it allows me to draw kanji on the screen to search for them in its
DB.</p>

<p>Taka got 100% in a test of the 20 hardest kanji on my current iPhone app (iKanji), though he was
¥®¥ê¥®¥ê about two of them.  (&quot;very ¥®¥ê¥®¥ê,&quot; he says.)</p>

<p>On the way home, I showed them the spiral over Norway, and we looked up some vids upon returning
home.  The vids that show it being a rocket are getting more convincing, but I'm sure it was
something else.</p>

<p>In non-internet-related conversation, great to hear of the work they're doing with ¥¢¥¤¥Ì
and <a href="http://www.greenheartproject.org/">Greenheart</a>; Jen is PR coordinator.  Not yet a
paid position, but the organization has funding for their cool zero emmissions ship that requires
only 2 meters of water to dock, so it can help connect ports that can't afford big docks and don't
want big pollution.   (( read the site for more precise info ))</p>

<p>Jen told me about her namesake <a href="http://jenniferteeter.com/">Jennifer Teeter</a>, who
wrote a funny song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/qmkAL5SJuRQ">My Tapeworm</a>.  So cute!</p>

<p>Jen showed me an app called Project 365, with which I may upload a photo each day in 2010.  We
shall see!</p>
