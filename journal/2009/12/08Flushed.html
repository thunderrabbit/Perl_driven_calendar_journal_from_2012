<p>Though it's about 10 degrees outside, I'm a bit flushed sitting on the train.  I had to run fast
after riding faster toward the station.  It's been a day of firsts!  in reverse order of occurrence:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>first time I had to actually curl up on the floor to catch my breath after running for the
train</p></li>

<li><p>first time I dropped my 100 yen on the ground in an attempt to run and buy a ticket from the
machine all at once.  One older parking lot guy was laughing as the other picked up the coin saying,
&quot;but your ticket!&quot; as I was saying, &quot;run! train!&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>first time I did *not* cover TJ Bike on top of the parking garage</p></li>

<li><p>first time I ran up the down ramp past a couple people trudging slowly up the up ramp</p></li>

<li><p>first time I ran hollering, &quot;just a moment!&quot; past the bicycle parking lot guys when
they asked for my ticket as I came into the bicycle parking garage.</p></li>

<li><p>first time I had to buy a bicycle parking pass in a couple months</p></li>

<li><p>first time that I got to flush a bucket of compost down the toilet</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some weeks ago (2 months?), Bananna had the great idea of creating a compost pile for the garden
out of the kitchen scraps from the kitchen.  The bucket got too stinky and the neighbors
complained, so I put it in a plastic bag in the shed until someone could throw it out.</p>

<p>It was promptly forgotten by all, and then discovered by Soness last night when she went in to
the shed to get out the gas heater.  She said she didn't have the guts to deal with it, and asked if
I would.</p>

<p>I took it to the street cause today is garbage day, but when I poured it into a second bag, it
started to leak, and there was at least a liter of liquid ready to spill, so I figured it was more
like sewage than garbage so brought it inside (in the bucket to keep the bag from leaking, in two
towels to keep the bucket from dripping) and flushed it slowly, slowly flushing time at the same
time.</p>

<p>The process was kinda neat, and not as stinky as it woulda been, say, in summer, so I was
thankful for that.  There were no maggots that I saw (Soness said there were some, but she's
sometimes prone to hyperbole), but I did have to use something (my fingers were handy, haha) to keep
each entire half bucket worth of rottage from going down all at once.</p>

<p>The whole time I was thinking, &quot;please don't get clogged,&quot; and &quot;I've crapped that
big before; it should be okay,&quot; and about the giant crap episode from Southpark.</p>

<p>Rinsed out the bucket, put the towels in the washer, grabbed the normal bag of garbage and ran
out the door.  Looked at my phone, &quot;hmmm 9 minutes; I should be able to *just* make it.&quot;
and I did.</p>
