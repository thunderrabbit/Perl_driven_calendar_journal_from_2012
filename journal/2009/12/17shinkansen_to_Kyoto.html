<p>On the shinkansen, closing in on one hour aboard.  We're zoooomin' along, but can't see anything
outside really (cause we're in a tunnel, and) it's nighttime.  To get a rough estimate of our
speed, I note that it takes about 4 seconds for an opposite bound shinkansen to pass my window.  If
a shinkansen is 100 meters long, that's a combined speed of 100/4 meters per second, or 25 m/s * 60
s/min * 60 min/hour * 100 cm/m * 1/2.54 in/cm * 1/12 ft/in * 1/5280 mile/ft = 55.9234073013 miles
per hour!</p>

<p>I think the arithmetic is correct, so it appears one of my estimates is off.  If it takes 3
seconds to pass, then 74.5645430684 miles per hour. Hmmm still not fast enough.</p>
