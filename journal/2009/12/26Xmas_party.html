<p>Went to Nate's family's Christmas party tonight, and had a pretty good time playing with Nate's
3 year old nephew.  Alfonzo and I chatted about stuff related not to work, and everyone enjoyed the
delicious, huge spread of food and, later, desserts.  Wow.  About 20 people there, total, most of
whom were Nate's mom's co-workers.</p>

<p>I brought banana milk and ピルクル to drink, which I purchased at a convenience store just
outside the station gates where I needed to change trains.  The station guy let me out without
paying, and I bought him a little chocolate block (20 yen) as a thank you.</p>
