<p>A bit different lesson than usual with Yurika for two reasons.  First, she didn't have time to
transcribe her homework (possibly because i took thirty-six hours to check it instead of normal
les-than-twenty-four hour turnaround).   Second difference was the girl who we always see behind
the bar said she was going to quit next month.  That gave Yurika ad I some material to discus
(indirect quotes, especially), and we spent a bit of time writing notes to the girl.  Turns out
neither of us knew her name, so I went up to find out with a note on the inside reading
&quot;Congratulations on following your dream&quot; and &quot;thank you for the years of great
service&quot; and my email address and facebook URL.  On the outside I wrote, お名前は＿＿
to get her name, たえこ Wow!  Cool name I had never previously heard.  (I forgot her kanji)</p>
