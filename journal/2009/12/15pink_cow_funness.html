<p>Got to see Leslie at The Pink Cow; she's just gotten back from Texas after a two month road trip
whirlwind vacation there, twice to Ren Fest, camping in the mountains, Austin City Limits, Oklahoma
(north Texas), etc.</p>

<p>Tonight was Slang Bingo for Cow-Go international nights; David led cause Gary couldn't be there
apparently.  Had lots of new faces, and I think I spoke with 70% of them.  Met Hiro and Kento who
used to live in California, two funny girls sitting with David (of Flo Union), inventing a funny
set of images for their &quot;do it at home&quot; public service campaign.  Met Yuko and her friend
who were with Mike, who was wearing a cow outfit and santa hat.  I nicked (omg I've never used this
word before and am not sure how to spell it) I swiped Traci's santa hat for a while but then gave
it to Leslie once it got too hot.</p>

<p>Also swiped DJ Miki's cool glass ring with silver beads inside.  She forgot about it until I
showed it off during a photo op.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Woodrow were a bit cuddly during the Texas Hold 'Em game where David M and several
other peeps were playing (including Leslie).</p>

<p>(( The guy beside me on the train is sleeping/coughing/belching like he's going to erupt.  Reminds
me of Jabba the Hut.  I'm glad he's pointing at the window and his belly more than my computer, but
these things are kinda unpredictable, I imagine. ))</p>

<p>I hugged everyone bye in plenty of time to make the 23:03 train, but then noticed I was leaving
right at the same time as DJ Miki and her two friends, so I walked with them to Shibuya.  Talked to
Miki after tossing U-Cow to them.  We walked slowly, not the fastest route to the station, and I
realized I had missed the train so was glad when one of them (Fukutoshin Line) was like &quot;yo
let's go see the Moai, which has been stolen!&quot;</p>

<p>Miki translated for me, and we headed over, and sure enough <em>The Moai is Gone!!</em>  We took
pictures and I made some guesses as to how it happened.  There's a big white canvas mat featuring a
cartoony skull where the moai
used to be.  Printed on the map is a URL, something like steal-japan.jp.  Holy mackerel!  It looks
really strange to not see it there, and lots of people agreed cause they were all taking photos of
the empty spot.  I joked, &quot;maybe they'll bring it back all clean and shiny.&quot;</p>

<p>Parted ways soon thereafter; hugging Miki at the intersection as she headed toward Inokashira
Line, then hugging the Hanzomon Line girl near the Hanzomon Line sign, and then she ran back to us,
&quot;oh I meant the Fukutoshin Line!&quot; and hugged the Musashi-Kosugi girl at Toyoko Line, and
then dropped the other off with a hug at Fukutoshin Line.</p>

<p>Zoomed back toward Shonan Shinjuku and the times were all wrong.... oh snap!  I need the
Yamanote Line instead!</p>
