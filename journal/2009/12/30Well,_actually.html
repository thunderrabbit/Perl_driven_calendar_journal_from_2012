<p>It wasn't *all* work at work today; I got to have a lesson with Emiko who gave me a flyer on an
art project &quot;No Man's Land&quot; at the old French Embassy in Tokyo, and then met Stephanie
from France and gave her the flyer.  Stephanie will teach French to Lina via Cow-Go.</p>

<p>ps: sorry steph, but my current encoding can't write your e with accent.   grrr japanese
encoding.  I gotta shift my shiz to UTF-8!!!!</p>

<p>Took Stephanie to The Pink Cow and got to hug Moonie.  Figured I'd go back to chat with Moonie
(quiet night tonight), but had to go back to work and finished work so late that I'm just heading
straight home.</p>
