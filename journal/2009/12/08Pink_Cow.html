<p>Went to The Pink Cow to see Stuart again and meet some guys who perform(ed) in Blue Man Group in
Japan (Tokyo (Roppongi)) (the show has just ended in Tokyo after two years (one year + one year
extension)).  They are hoping the show will be renewed; they should find out soon.</p>

<p>I found pics of U Cow with Blue Men and showed them the pics.  &quot;Hey that's me!!&quot; goes
Callum, and I can now say with impunity, &quot;this is me, Ami, U-Cow, Marcus Lion, and
Callum.&quot;  but it would sure help if I had a link to the picture when I said it.</p>

<p>This was Stuart's last show, and he rocked out and we all had fun dancing.</p>

<p>Next to her new husband (whose name I think is Will), I sat with Margaret who I met at Soness's BBQ
2.75 years ago, back in the days with Francois, about whom we reminisced, because Francois was
Margaret's magic feather for singing; she was otherwise too nervous to sing, but when she serenaded
Francois, everything was fine.</p>

<p>When it was time to go, Soness decided to stay, so I was like, &quot;aight see ya!&quot; and then
I got a message from her saying that she was coming home too cause the people with whom she was
going to go out decided to go home.  She's probably going to be on the train right after mine; I
don't think she could have made this train.</p>
