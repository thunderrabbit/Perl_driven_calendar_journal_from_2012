<p>I'm not sure I can call this a Wild Skating Adventure, but I can certainly call it the first
time I've skated in a long time!  The area of Kyoto where we skated was pretty flat, with few
smooooothly paved areas, and zero parking garages.  We skated from his house, and then a bit along
the river, then skated up this street and past a large shrine, and down that street to somewhere
else, all the while discussing our latest discoveries online about what's really going on in the
world.</p>

<p>On our way home, he found a nice wooden box that was being discarded, confirmed the shop owner
didn't want it, and skated with a box the rest of the way.  The box chilled on a bench under a tray
of chopsticks while we ate at a sushi restaurant.  We tried fugu, the famously deadly blowfish.
Disappointingly, the fish was already cut when we asked for it; they were just like &quot;here ya
go,&quot; and gave us the plate.  It was chewy and a bit gross, but otherwise uneventful.
&quot;Well, Simon, thank you. You witnessed my first and last time to try fugu.&quot;

<p>Though I wore his helmet, knee pads and wrist guards, I didn't need them at any point during the
skate.</p>
