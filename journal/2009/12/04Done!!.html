<p>This weekend, I don't have to go to work.  Been working perhaps the last 5 weekends; I didn't
really keep careful track because it was fun; we had a deadline and getting it finished felt a lot
like being back at UH in the computer lab with Maggie and sometimes Marcel, staying up late to get
stuff written.</p>

<p>Today I wrote a pretty cool page that allows a type of record to be connected to other records
through linking tables in a many-to-many type way.  The cool thing: the different types of things
that can be linked are from different tables themselves, and I put together 2-D array whose main
keys are basically the types of things that can be added, and the subkey values describe where to
find those things....  so, just by adding entries to that array, without changing any other code, I
can have another type of thing attached to the original records.</p>

<p>Sure would be a lot easier to describe if I could show some screen shots.</p>
