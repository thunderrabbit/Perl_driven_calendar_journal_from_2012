<p>OMG.  How could this be??  I was sitting on a little wall, ready to continue reading
Autobiography of a Yogi, but then was like, &quot;¤¢¤Ã¡ª  I need to write in ye olde journal,&quot;
so I did that and I musta left the book there by the wall!   argh!!</p>

<p>I clearly remember putting it in the bag in my bag when getting off the train, and I didn't get
it out again until the wall.</p>

<p>Called Nate cause he'd still be up, and he headed out to the wall.  He's going to call me back
once he's got it.</p>

<p>Not there!  Aaaaaaaahhhhh  how can this be?  Is there some magical force keeping me from reading
the book?  This is so weird!</p>

<p>I just found it!  I had taken it out of my bag and put it on the table behind my computer.  I
have no memory of getting it out of my bag.  No thought of &quot;ah, the book!&quot; or &quot;gonna
read this soon&quot; or anything of the sort.  C'mon brain; wake up!</p>

<p>Welcome back, book!</p>
