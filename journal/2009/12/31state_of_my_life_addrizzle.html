<p>awesome! one hour until I start calling myself 40 years old.</p>

<p>(oh wait..)</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p>(that's better.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>awesome! one hour until I start calling myself 40 years old.</p></li>

<li><p>Been working crazy-much, wanting to get this new website finished...  we had a big push at
the end of last month, including camping at work overnight (twice!), and now another big push at the
end of this month, which would probably also include overnight camping at work, save that it's also
the end of the <del>year</del> <ins>decade!!</ins> and there are parties to attend.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm on the train now, in the &quot;Green Car,&quot; and will get to Chigasaki at 11:43pm (I
think), which is barely not enough time to get back to the crib before the tens digit rolls over.  I
was hoping to be in meditation across the border, but may not quite make it.</p></li>

<li><p>Listening to NIN in my headphones using my iPhone, code named Little Blue Monkey</p></li>

<li><p>Because Chez Soness is nearly an hour by train from Shibuya, I often pay a bit extra (between
500 and 950 yen) to get a seat, which adds up to I guess several dollars over the month, but I'm
happier getting to chill or sleep or chow, all while <em>sitting</em> instead of hanging from the
oh-shit handle like meat while packed in the car like sardines.</p></li>

<li><p>However, because of the smella long hours, I've not really been doing other things for myself, like
meditate, paint, visit the beach, write.</p></li>

<li><p>Working such long hours makes it a bit easier to not have a girlfriend, so that's
something.</p></li>

<li><p>A week ago, my mom was like, &quot;hey give me your US bank account info and I'll deposit
some money in your account.&quot; and I'm like whoohooo!</p>

<p>(to be continued...)</p></li>

<li><p>I emailed Keiko, and got an email back on my day off (!!) and found out she was going to
visit PB's new ship, The Oceanic (!!!)...  So I high-tailed it out of the house to see her and the
ship, and got to see Rei (I'm closer to being over her; my gosh did I love her a lot), and was a
bit sad to hear that if the next couple voyages don't get more passengers, PB may fold.  Oh man
that would be ... wow.</p>

<p>To prove the point, the voyage that leaves in August is only 80 days for only 99万円!!</p>

<p>And I'm thinking, &quot;hmmmm; I already have 77万円 in my account; I could make that 99!
Hmmmmmm!!</p></li>

<li><p>(...continued from above)</p>

<p>So, all inspired to sail around the world again, I wrote this to Ma:</p>

<pre>
HI Ma!

For just $10,000 I can sail on PB around the world in 80 days!!!!  I'll send you cards from every
port if you wire the cash by June 2010.

Wanna come too?  Just $40,000 and you, Jon, Fred and I can all go whoohoooo!!!!

For far less, you can deposit a few dollars in my checking account if you like.  :-)  (attached image has the deets)

  Love Love
    - Rob!
</pre>

<p>And that was four days ago.... and no reply yet!  is she mulling the idea over with Jon?  Is she
still lhao?  is she just away from the internets?</p>
</li>

<li><p>This morning, I looked
up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_phenomena">List of Internet phenomena</a>,
and found myself lmao at <a href="http://lolcode.com/">LOLCODE</a>,
and <a href="http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Genesis_1">Ceiling Cat rode invisible bike
over teh waterz.</a>, whahahahahhaahahaa!!!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crasher_Squirrel">Crasher Squirrel</a> also = hilarious</p>
</li>

<li><p>Helped Fred a bit recently with his FORTRAN forks.  Actually didn't realllllly help him, but
hopefully can sometime (tomorrow????).  Good to Skype with him a bit.</p></li>

<li><p>At Kevin's Christmas party in Kyoto a week or so ago, I met Yukiko, with whom I platonically
spent the night, but then enjoyed smooching a bit in the morning.  All clothes stayed on and no
stalking has occurred on either side, but we're staying in touch.  Soness was like, &quot;you're
never going to make 500 days!!&quot; referring to my intention to not kiss/date/etc anyone before
I'm 15,000 days old, and ignoring the fact that, strictly speaking, I therefore <em>didn't</em>
make it as originally planned, but I'm pretty much okay with it.</p>

<p>472 days to go.</p></li>

<li><p>I've learned a lot during this non-girlfriend process.  For one thing, I miss the pants off
of Ami,... er, um, not necessarily literally, but that too.</p>

<p>Another thing, precipitated exactly because Yukiko and I kissed, I felt myself getting a bit
agitated while waiting for her at Kyoto Station on my way out of town.  I caught myself before
falling too far into victim mode and went up to get a tasty beverage instead of wait exactly where I
said I would be.  Good learning experience there.</p></li>

<li><p>Almost to Chigasaki station; gotta pack up my 'puter.</p>

<p>See ya in 2010!!!!</p></li>

<li><p class="date">11:18am JST Friday  1 January 2010 (day 14527)</p></li>

<li><p>I called Akiko, Emiko, Keiko, Yukiko, and Ami.  Chatted with Emiko for a bit, Ami for a
while, and Yukiko for 1.6 hours!!!  Ami's in Kumamoto with her fam.  Yukiko is up north (in Aomori
or something I forgot) with her parentals.  Told me about her weird co-worker who won't tell anyone
where she's from (Fukui, as per the boss), and I told her about website work and possible PB voyage
(I said 10% likely, but it's hard to estimate..)</p></li>

<li><p>somewhere in all that I learned two new Japanese phrases: あけおめ and ことよろ, which are
shortened versions of, essentially &quot;Happy New Year!&quot; and the untranslatable phrase people
often ask to translate to English.  The long versions are あけましておめでとございます
 and ことしもよろしくおねがいします (there is Kanji for these (at least the second one), but I've
spelled them all out to point out just how short each one is (each character ends up being a
syllable of the phrases, so in the first case from 14 to 4 syllables, and the second from 15 to 4
syllables.</p>

<p>The point being they're really short.  A bit shorter even than just saying H-Y in English to mean
Happy New Year!</p>

<p>whatevs</p></li>

<li><p>I've heard &quot;whatevs&quot; can be further shortened to &quot;evs&quot; but I can't quite
feel it yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Macbook is largely the same as last SOML, though lemme check HD space available.  290.87GB
available of 424.23GB total.  OS X 10.6.2</p></li>

<li><p>Last night I torrent downloaded a copy of The Reader (of which I had never heard) after
Yukiko suggested it.  Watching now in Quicktime to the left Emacs window.  Drowned rat kid is
throwing up now.</p></li>

<li><p>Hard to type and watch a movie at the same time.</p></li>

<li><p>Soness is still in Thailand; has been there for a week and will be there another
week.  I can't say I've been alone in the house very much, given such long work hours, but huggin'
on the Nibbles kitty each night and day.  Haven't made the house cleaner than it was when she left,
but it's not much dirtier either.</p></li>

<li><p>Okay, so at work I don't plan to stay until a million o'clock, but do hope to finish up the
stuff I've been tasked to do before the year begins anew.  <em>Might</em> be able to extract some
code from five different classes into one parent class and save a lotta damn bug checking.</p></li>

<li><p>made unwim.net, but haven't gotten farther than first entry on Programming Languages.</p></li>
