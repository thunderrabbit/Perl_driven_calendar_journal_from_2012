<p>I emailed Keiko a couple days ago for Merry Christmas purposes, and she replied back today,
saying she was headed to Yokohama to see the ship before PB's 68th global voyage departs tomorrow.
I was like, &quot;wow!&quot; and thought, <em>I love PB, and I love Keiko</em>, so called her back
all, &quot;yo; you're going to see PB?&quot; &quot;yep!&quot; &quot;Are you going alone?&quot;
&quot;yep!&quot; &quot;can I join you?&quot; &quot;yep!&quot; and so I'm headed that way now.</p>

<p>Arguably, I'm going to see the new PB ship, enjoy なつかしい PB memories, and hang out with
Keiko, but really I'm mostly going to hang out with Keiko.</p>
