<p>Simon has a pretty cool apartment.  It's basically a ten mat room with two fish tanks each
featuring three &quot;sea monsters&quot; I like to call them, but they're actually something like
lotl, but that word doesn't show up in my dictionary; I don't remember the spelling.  They're
underwater dwelling lizards that never lose their gills, which look a bit like ferns emanating from
either side of their heads.  He rattled off the names as I was like, <em>how can you tell them
apart????</em></p>

<p>I could distinguish one of the larger ones from the other two because its gills were smaller (&quot;he
grew up in a rough neighborhood&quot;).  But I couldn't uniquely identify any of the three small
ones.</p>

<p>I could readily identify his orange cat named Marmelade, who liked to burrow under the covers
and scratch her right eye which was continually watery and nearly shut.</p>

<p>Simon, having a generous heart inside his huge chest, gave me a pair of skates!!  I just need to
get new wheels and replace a bolt, but otherwise, I am again the proud owner of skates!!</p>
