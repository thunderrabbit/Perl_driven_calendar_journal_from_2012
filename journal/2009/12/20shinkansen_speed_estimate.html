<p>I realized the trains are a lot longer than 100 meters.  I guesstimate each train car is 18
meters long * 16 cars = 288 meters per train.  288 meters / 3.5 seconds for the train to go by...
oh man I just realized I made a huge mistake when calculating before; I need to halve my answer
cause we were both moving toward each other.  Anyway, here goes:</p>

<pre>
18 meters / car
16 cars / train
1 train / 3.5 seconds
60 seconds / minute
60 minutes / hour
100 cm / meter
1 in / 2.54 cm
1 ft / 12 in
1 mile / 2580 ft

=
376.697098909 miles / hour
</pre>

<p>But that's combined speed for both trains headed toward each other, so divide by two to get
188.348549455 miles/hour.</p>

<p>I bet the actual speed is even faster, so the train must be even longer than I realize, or my
time estimate of 3.5 seconds is too slow, or both, or all three, or whatever; good night.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Wow!  Wikipedia says the train cars are 25,000 mm long for 14 of the cars, and 27,350 mm for the
two end cars.</p>

<pre>
25,000 mm / car        27,350 mm /car
14 cars / train    +   2 cars / train     =    404700 mm / train
1 train / 3.5 seconds
60 seconds / minute
60 minutes / hour
1 in / 25.4 mm
1 ft / 12 in
1 mile / 2580 ft
529.33790253 miles / hour

264.668951265 miles per hour per train</pre>

<p>Welp, now my estimate is too fast.  I guess my 3.5 seconds is too <em>fast</em>.</p>
