<p>Johnson
s Motor Car has performed at The Pink Cow a few times, though I've not yet seen them there.  Soness
told me I *had* to come for their bouncing goodness so I went to What The Dickns last night.  The
first  few songs they played were not really my style, and the last few songs they were playing
were not really my stele either, and none of them were jump worthy.  I was like, &quot;um, I'm
going to Chigasaki,&quot; and Soness goes, &quot;please just wait for Johnsons Motor Car; you're
going to love them!&quot;  [blink]..  oh; I thought, um, nevermind.&quot; so I went and sat down
in  the least smokey area I could find an waited through the next three last songs, each proceeded
by &quot;can we do one more??&quot;</p>

<p>Johnson's Motor Car came up and set up, and I imediately noticed their very cute drummer.  And
she became even cuter while playig, with big happy smile and hair flying around; omg he is sooooo
cute!!!  IAfter a couple songs of jumping (very little room to dance in What The Dicketns) I went
over and bought their CD, and then moved myself to the front row so I could watch her bouncy hair
genki smile thrashing away at the drums; totall amazing!!</p>

<p>I noticed after a bt that she only had her award winning smile while she was high speed popping
out the beats   During the slow parts of songs she was just expressionless like most drummers I
see.  Then the song would wind up to high speed beats and her high profile smile would light up my
eyes and ensure my bouncing to the bats for the whole song.</p>

<p>On occasion, the guitarist, a really tall broad shouldered man, would get in my way of seeing the
drummer, so I would try to duck or jump higher to see her.  The lead fiddle guy has a great radio
announcer voic  Especially during their inital intro.  I don't know if I got used to his voice or
if he wasn't as radio DJ-ish later, but he did shred several hairs from his bow while playing.  He
would rip them out between each song and then make more during the next song.</p>

<p>After their last song, the lead vocalist fiddlist voice amplified above our shouts of encore
said, &quot;so we could walk off stage and pretend we're back stage and wait a minute before coming
back on, or we could just keep playing a couple more songs.&quot;</p>

<p>they played a couple more songs and I loved the drummer's smile during the fast bits and decided
what I needed to do.  After they finished their encore, and she was the last one to extricate
herself from all the equipment, I greeted her &quot;thank you!&quot; etc and gave her 10000 yen
tip, &quot;this is for your smile,&quot; and she goes, &quot;oh did you get a CD?&quot; and I'm
like, &quot;yeah I already got the CD; this is for *you*&quot; and I found out her name ¤ê¤Ê.  I
think.  Anyway, wow, oh and i got a picture with her, though it's a bit dark.</p>

<p>Soness and I stayed a bit longer while Eric  told us their shoow has been re-signed for another
season (eyear??) so we'll be able to go back to Ble Man Group next year.  Awesome!  Prolly starting
in March or April. Sweet!</p>

<p>Soness invited him to come down to Chigasaki for surfing lessons and then it was about time to
go so they quickly headed upstairs to say HI to Callum and others and i saw Jojo and Ace so went to
talk to them then headed upstairs to quickly say HI to them and kidnap Soness so we would make our
last train.  Hugged Callum and Eric and congrats to Callum for ther show extension, and said HI to
the guitarist of Johnsons Motor Car.</p>

<p>Made a bit of a faux pas as I tried to explain my experience of the previous band, using the
phrase &quot;these guys suck&quot; but then taking it back saying, &quot;this is not my style
music,&quot;.. just asically trying to compliment JMC  awesoe jumping performance.</p>

<p>WE rushed to the station, and actually made the second to last train, but then got a phone call
from Ace, saing Kit wanted to join us, so he came and we made the last train and heaed home with
Kit.  St by a lion-haired guy named Taki, or was it Taiki, and chatted with im a bit until he got
off in Kawasaki.</p>
