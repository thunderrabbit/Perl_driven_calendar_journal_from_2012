<p>Mamiko was not at RC yesterday so I could not address my cursh on her, but I didi get some
compliments on my beard even before saying that I don't feel very  attractive (okay, I used the
word cute) when I have a beard.  The only reason I've let it goet son long: I can't find mthe
charger to Dan's green shaver.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Wondering if I should call Mamiko instead of waiting six weeks until the next class.</p>
