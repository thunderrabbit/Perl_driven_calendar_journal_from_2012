<p>Kinda crap day at work.  I wrote a pile of code and cleaned it all up pretty like and then was
ready to slot its data in place and went to the test page to see where it should go.  Oh.
Nowhere.  Crappy McCrapperson I didn't need to write it at all.  Dammit.  6 hours buh-bye.  Don't
fucking need this kinda setback when we're close to deadline again.  Dammit.</p>

<p>Then, because Alfonzo was gone today, Nate was all coming up to me asking about little tidbit
issues, some of which had been fixed already and others of which they weren't show when the issue
occurred.  Or where.  WTF?  Damn G if you can't show me the error, I prolly can't fix it.  Ended up
missing the 9:3? train and so I was like fuckit and just watched the cool parts of Bourne Identity.</p>
