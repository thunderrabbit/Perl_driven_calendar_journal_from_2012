<p>I'm in an interesting quandry sorta with Marta and Janette.  I told
Marta I would go to the Bibby's on August 5th.  Then I emailed Janette
and asked what time I should come on the 5th.  She said 1am.  Hmmm.  I
wonder if I can leave late on August 4th and still have Marta happy
with me.  Weird.</p>


<pre>
From Janette
Date 3pm Saturday 3 August 2002

what i mean is: if you are coming on aug. 5th, then let the show begin
as soon as aug. 5th does. you asked what i preferred.Ê i imagine you
arriving in the cool and stillness of the wee hours of the nite,no
traffic from denton, something wierd on the radio, coasting to a stop
in front of my quiet cozy house, taking off your clothes and sliding
into bed next to me. that's my preference.  i need to work at my notso
favorite job sometime on monday and tuesday and the rest of the week
actually.Ê i'm thinking of going in today to get a head start on
stuff. i don't know what your plans are but i'm good with whatever
happens. i'll be glad to see you whenever i see you. we can be
intimate or just hang out as friends,whatever you are comfortable
with.

<p>Yesterday, Marta received a phone call inviting her and me to go
out with peeps on Saturday (today).  We did not get the message until
today because we attended a YRUU lock-in at Plano church (tons of
fun!!!!).  Today Marta got the message, called her peeps back and it
turns out that the date has been moved to tomorrow (Sunday).  In
Dallas.  In the PM.  So I was all, "I'll just go to the Bibby's
afterward."  So I'll be there sometime on Sunday night.  That's
tomorrow.  I don't know what time.  Right now I'm interested in
intimacy; I'd like to play it by ear moment by moment.</p>
