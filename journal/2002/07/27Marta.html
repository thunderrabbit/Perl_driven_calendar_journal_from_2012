<p>Marta and I flopped around in bed for a couple hours this morning,
sorta wrestling, sorta hugging, both of us wearing t-shirt and
bottoms.  We kissed or licked or bit a little, but no sloppy tongue
action.  My guts have been hurting some, and it may be a combination
of having had a lot of water, and not a lot of orgasms (zero in the
past week, which is significant for me) and being a bit aroused by
rolling around with Marta.  I'm hoping the guts will all relax
soon.</p>
