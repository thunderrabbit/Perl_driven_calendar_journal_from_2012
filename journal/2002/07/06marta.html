HI

Welcome to a different side of Rob:

It's 1:45am on Friday night/ Saturday morning.  I have to be awake and
smart in 7 hours.  I hardly think I can get this all out to make it
sufficiently understandable, but thank you for listening.

Even though I broke up with Wende, I'm still in relationship with her
because I still let her reactions/thoughts/etc affect how I think and
act.  I'm relatively okay with this ("relatively okay" is what we in
my men's group would call a 'word fuck,' which often comes down to
saying something that's not what is really meant)

In a vacuum, I'm okay with still being in relationship with Wende.

However, there is a girl named Marta who I met at Plano Rally.  She
fell in love with me (that's my judement that she fell in love with me
- she never used those words) because I was all happy bouncy ROB at
the rally.  Great.  Excellent.  I love that.

And due to her flirtations and such, I began to fall in love with her.
And I told her this.  "I'm beginning to fall in love with you." and I
meant "fall in love" in terms of what M Scot Peck (?) said in _The
Road Less Traveled_ (?) in the chapter on "Love"

Something like falling in love is effortless.  It won't last if the
two individuals are allowed to remain close long enough.  Ultimately
the individuals will realized that the apparent one-ness is actually
an illusion, and that the other individual is still an individual and
still has his/her own thoughts/fears/agendas/etc, and did not,
therefore, solve all the problems of the first individual.

Marta seems to have taken my thought differently, maybe "more
seriously."

I'm an excellent flirt.  I do it as a technique to keep my sexual
supply line full.  At times in my life I have wondered if I'm a sex
addict.  Using the definition of (something like) "allowing the
addictive behavior to repeatedly interfere with 'real life' means it's
an addiction."  By that definition, I am often a sex addict.

Not in a teen porn ring way, or a rape way, but (*)

<p>(*) At that point in the message, I fell asleep.  Upon waking up the
next morning, I feel ten hundred times better.  And I'm choosing not
to send this message to Janette.  It's a bit more revealing about
myself than I choose to be now while I'm not sleepy tired.</p>

<p>Below is the message I am sending to Marta:</p>

Super Smarta Arta:

I felt really sad last night, that I have caused such craziness in our
flirty friendship.

I cried cried cried when we hung up.  So mad at myself for bringing
such drama to things, and I'm not even a drama person!

I feel significantly better after having slept (I hope you do too).

I have a single request: please please please please please please
come to SWUUSI.

It will be the intergalactic planetary best fun you'll have all summer.

	With Love
	- Rob!
