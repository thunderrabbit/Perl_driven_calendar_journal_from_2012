<p>Marta and I just had a heart to heart talk while cuddling in her
bed after reading the play _Old Wicked Songs_.  We agree that we
cannot be sexual so early in our relationship, but that I really want
to and don't want to and I really love her and cannot be committed to
her and all this apparently paradoxical stuff.</p>

<p>I still haven't told her that my heart is with Sally mostly, or
maybe Bronwyn, and that I want to be fuck buddies with Janette.  But I
have told Marta that I cannot be monogamous with her.</p>

<p>Me an Marta's relationship has included cuddling under covers, with
her robe coming open enough for my knee to touch her pubic hair, and
kissing and biting tongues, but not full blown tongue kissing.  And
yes to nibbling fingers and licking fingers and necks and biting necks
and ears.  Nice stuff that traditionally has made me want more.</p>

<p>We're about to go eat.</p>
