<p>I just got off the phone with Sally while driving home to Dallas
from San Antonio after the youth advisor training.</p>

<p>So great to confirm profound robust everlasting love for one
another, even as she's dating a local guy named Rick who she's known
for a while.</p>

<p>Once she told me that, we went on to all the other subjects in the
world, including how awesome the other is, and about learning
languages and I was all, "oh oh oh oh!  I learned how to say 'ti
crecivaya de rushka' which means 'you are a beautiful girl' in
Russian." and just as I was saying it, all excited to be talking to
Sally, I saw a state trooper chillin' just on the downside of a hill.
I looked down and saw I was going 80.  D'oh.</p>

<p>That's why I seemed a bit distracted while saying you are a
beautiful girl in Russian.</p>

<p>But he stayed put, and I slowed down.  It was all great all
around.</p>

<p>And she likes Eminem.  :-)  Maybe doesn't love him as much as we
love The B eastie Boys, but it's alll good.</p>
