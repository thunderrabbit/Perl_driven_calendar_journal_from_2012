<p>After chatting with Colleen for 1.5 hours on AIM, which was great
because at first she was feeling blue, and by the end she was feeling
joyful, and funny because we were sitting basically next to one
another in Bibby Kitchen, and were breaking new artistic ground with
combining technology and real life, we played Apples to Apples with
Josephine, Meg, me, Skyler, Heather, Paul, Colleen, Hillary all
playing.  Good stuff.  It was the first time I had played.</p>

<p>During the game, Josephine said something really funny that I was
going to write down if I remembered it.</p>

<p>Colleen and I tied; we kept being either the top two winners or
bottom two losers in almost every round.</p>

<p>After the game, after some hours of discussion that had already
happened, I paid Colleen $5 to take a bite of an onion.  It was less
gross than expected.  Then I took a bite of it and got my five dollars
back.  Plus I got a free stick of gum out of the deal.</p>

<p>Chatted with Katy B-H, and now it's bed time.  But I don't know
where I'm going to sleep.  Gotta scope out a space.</p>

<p>Good night!</p>
