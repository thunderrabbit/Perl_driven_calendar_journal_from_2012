<p>Sally and I went to Santa Monica to skate today.</p>

<p>Utterly beautiful and incredible.</p>

<p>Cool things</p>

<p>Wait, uncool thing first:</p>

<p>Watched a guy catch a stingray and not let it go.  (That was out on
the pier.)</p>

<p>Cool things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Going out on the pier wearing skates even though signage
clearly prohibited skates.  Saw an old woman wearing skates at the far
end of the pier.  Watched waves crash below us.</p></li>

<li><p>Sally's front wheel coming off her skate, and me having
replacement parts for it in Scott.</p></li>

<li><p>Skating from Venice Pier to Santa Monica Pier along the
beachfront bike path thing.  Sally getting faster and more confident
in her skating abilities.</p></li>

<li><p>Trying to leap from section to section of the curb with light
poles in the way.</p></li>

<li><p>Finding a playground with gymnastic jungle gym equipment!
Parallel bars, uneven bars, balance beam, high bars, rings, ropes, and
other things to climb on, swing from, fall off.</p></li>

<li><p>Climbing, swinging, enjoying all this equipment without
falling.</p></li>

<li><p>Enjoying the sunset while standing in the surf.</p></li>

<li><p>Pictures of college students being funny on the swings instead
of studying for finals.</p></li>

<li><p>Pictures of skaters filming kick flips over a 4x4 foot square
hole in the concrete.</p></li>

<li><p>Buying some sage for Sally from a cat who buys and sells drums
from Ghana.</p></li>

<li><p>Skating on a curved curb thing.</p></li>

<li><p>Chillin' in Scott, listening to some of Sally's childhood
stories, and how they affect her modern life.</p></li>
</ul>
