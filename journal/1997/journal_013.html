8 October 1997
<p>
Today we presented my new invoice service to the supervisors and managers of the groups who will be using it. They loved it! It lets them view the invoices much more quickly and queues as many as they want to the printers and it's all good.
<p>
Now it's just got to go through testing, and will be moved online hopefully pretty soon. The next big part is converting the old data to the new format so it can be read.
<p>
Yay!
