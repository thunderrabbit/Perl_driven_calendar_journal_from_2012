Sunday 9 November 1997
<p>
Today at church we discussed the next few upcoming events:
<ul>
<li>Wednesday Night LRY Hangout Dinner at Souper Salad</li>
<li>I won't be here next weekend 14-16 November</li>
<li>Construct-O-Con Lock-In at Emerson church 21-23 November</li>
<li>Little Rock Rally 5-007 December</li>
</ul>
<p>
I encouraged them to attend as many of these fun events as possible!
<p>
One weird thing: Amber was in attendance at our meeting, and I was certain I had seen her before.  Turns out she was at the San Antonio Rally <b>last</b> weekend.  Woah!
