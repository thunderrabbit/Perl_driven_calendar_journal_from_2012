Thursday 23 October 1997

Today I treated myself to a wonderful massage, the first of hopefully many over the next several weeks.  
My goal is to release emotional and physical knots in my emotional and physical bodies.
<p>
During the massage, I relaxed to a point where essentially my body was asleep while my mind was awake and enjoying the sensations.
<p>
Next week we will start temporal-sachral (sp) balancing.

This evening, an ambulance pulled up in front of our house.  Turns out a guy friend of our downstairs neighbor was laid out on the 
couch and not waking up...  He was talking to the EMS dudes when I went down to see what was up.
