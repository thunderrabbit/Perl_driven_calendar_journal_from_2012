2 October 1997
<p>
Today I changed the format of my journal index to this calendar
look.  Yeah it looks kinda weird with various width columns and such, but I like it better.  Gives me a better sense of when things happened.

Today things are kinda screwed up at work.
My supervisor said, "people should be jumping through their asshole to get this fixed."  I thought that was a really funny phrase. He said I could use it anytime I wanted.  :)
