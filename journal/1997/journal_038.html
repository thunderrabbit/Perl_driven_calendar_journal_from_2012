Tuesday 11 November 1997
<p>
After doin' almost nothin' at work yesterday, I got more accomplished today.
<p>
The files that the new Invoice Service uses are simply too abundant, so we have to archive them into .zip files. We don't have the zip source code, so my code has to make a system call to a batch job to extract the desired file.
<p>
I made a little test program today that does just that.  Perfect!
