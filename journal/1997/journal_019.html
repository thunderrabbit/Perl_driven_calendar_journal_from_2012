17 October 1997

Today at work I talked with Marc Loustau of the youth office, and he more fully described to me the ConCon staff position for which he had encouraged me to apply.
<p>
Turns out the position is not just advisor, but adult coordinator, the one and only adult who acts as advisor for all the other adult advisors. (Does that make sense?)  
<p>
It makes sense to me, and I feel greatly excited about the possibility of holding that position.

Also while at work I got some of the details worked out for getting youth to San Antonio Rally. We're going to have a fabulous time!

After work, Wende and I went to La Jaliscience, the local inexpensive and quite tasty Mexican restaurant for dinner. I had a chicken burrito. Wende had a beef fajita burrito. Yumm-eee!
