6 October 1997
<p>
This day I completed and sent to be tested my latest project at work. It's an application that allows users to display invoices and print them and all that. Many people will use it each day; I'm really excited (and almost nervous) that I have written such a highly visible project.
<p>
I tested the shit out of it, made sure my documentation covered every detail, every message that the user might see. I designed it to be easily modified, and easy to understand.
<p>
This is the same project that got the inadvertant 
<a href=journal_007.html>stress testing</a>
a few days ago. It's finally complete, after months of work. I'm excited to see it go online.
