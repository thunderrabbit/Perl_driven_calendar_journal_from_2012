16 October 1997
<p>
Last night Wende and I went to CiCi's Pizza, and invited our youth group to join just for fun.  Laura was there promptly at 7.  We talked about school and her trips to Disney World and stuff.  Actually Wende had more to say than I; I've never been to Disney World.  <em>sniff!</em>
<p>
I encouraged Laura to get involved with Houston Rally planning, telling her how awesome the experience has been for many youth.

Today I have finally gotten caught up with my journal entries.
