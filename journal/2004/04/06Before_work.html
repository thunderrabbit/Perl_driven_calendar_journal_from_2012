<p>Before work today I studied.  This was quite an effective use of my
time, so I'm quite happy I was able to get up and do it.  I might be
able to attribute it to my new emacs-powered todo-mode thing.
Awesome.  Quick easy way to stay focused.</p>

<p>I copied questions and wrote answers like</p>

<p>犬が好きですか。　はい、大犬がすきです。</p>

<p>And when Riki saw it, he crossed out the 大 of 大犬, and I was
like, "oki inu!" and he's like.  大きい犬。</p>

<p>Oh. okay.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I showed him chiwawaworld.com videos and we laughed.  He started
rapping in Japanese and I came in with the lines above (*).  We laughed.</p>

<p>(*) Do you like dogs?  Yes, I like big dogs.</p>
