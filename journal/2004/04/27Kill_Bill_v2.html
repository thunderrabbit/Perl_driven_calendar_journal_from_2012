<p>Going to see Kill Bill with Jimmy before work today.</p>

<p>Ooops.</p>

<p>Just when the cowboy bouncer guy was looking out the window to see
why dogs were hollering outside his trailer, the movie cut out.</p>

<p>That's fucked.</p>

<p class=date>12:45pm</p>

<p>Again. "I can't even imagine... how bad that shit
must <em>sting</em>" shhhweeeooooo.  [audio out/movie off]</p>

<p>I'm going to call Quentin and tell on these guys.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Good movie.  Less blood.  Good ending.  Better dialogue than
v1, but still doesn't touch Pulp Fiction.  I like the Chinese
scenes.</p>
