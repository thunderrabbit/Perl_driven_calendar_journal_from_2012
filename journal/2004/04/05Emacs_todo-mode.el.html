<p>Awesome.  I composed an email to Fred asking if he thought an emacs
Things To Do mode could be easily enough created to create one.  Then
I realized it had probably been done already.  I found todo-mode.el
and downloaded the file.  I searched for where to put .el files on my
computer... and found that the mode is already <em>installed</em> on
my machine.  Nice.  I just had to tell emacs to load it automatically
when editing .todo-do files.  emacs rules.  Free code rules.  The
internet rules.</p>
