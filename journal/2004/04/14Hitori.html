<p>裕子 and I have been hanging out today.  We met at Kosugi, grabbed
some takoyaki and drinks then went to a big polished marble table by
the small river to eat under the cherry blossom trees that have
recently lost their blossoms.</p>

<p>Fun times were had.</p>

<p>I was a bit grouchy, no I was pretty much fucking pissed, having to
walk to kosugi, and having to walk back to my house (walking with her
is fine, but still I want my fucking bike back!!).  Came back to my
house and cuddled under covers because it's cold today (for some dumb
weather-related reason, I'm sure) and went through our pattern of me
wanting to snooze-cuddle and her wanting us to be awake.</p>

<p>She said she wanted real talk, and ultimately she got it.</p>

<p>I (as I have been for the past few days) was horny and was like, 
"おっぱい見せて" and after she was like, "<em>where did you learn
that?</em>" (I told her Riki taught me) she was like "だめ" (no) and I
was like why (I know the reason) and she's like "I am not your
girlfriend."</p>

<p>So we got into a girlfriend discussion and I told her straight up
why I can't have a girlfriend right now.  Tears were involved, as I
described having been engaged to Wende and how I've given up
"everything" to come to Japan.  My fiance', my house, my car, my job,
my beloved youth group.. I didn't even mention my investment club
cause it would be too hard to explain in my then state of tears, *and*
lest I not mention it again, I've been relieved of my bicycle in
Japan!</p>

<p>"I've known you for 5 months.  I knew Wende for 5 (make that 7)
years [when I broke up with her[. You've got no chance]]."</p>

<p>How do I explain in halfJapanesehalfEnglish why I've chosen this
solo adventure when I can't even explain it to myself?  I told her
that I don't even know how to say it in English, but I want to do
something big for the world, and I want to do it alone.</p>

<p>But I don't know what it is.</p>
