<p>I'm wearing my contacts tonight so I can throw down when I dance.
Whatever throw down means; I'm gonna do it.  And sweat.  Oh yes;
don't even worry about that.</p>

<p class=date>6:29am JST Sunday 18 April 2004</p>

<p>Fun night.</p>

<p>Four different dance floors (plus a big ramen tent), with one dance
floor outside by a pool, with no barrier between the pool and the
people dancing.  No splasualties, though.</p>

<p>Ali and I ventured around the place a bit, checking out the hip hop
dance floor, at which the DJ played what nearly could have been one of
Ali's CDs that he plays at Nova.  Except, Ali points out, one of the
songs was performed by a different artist.</p>

<p>There was a woman there wearing a cat-like ball mask.  Another was
wearing a white leather outfit that was like a Jetsons swimsuit.</p>

<p>Back to the big dance floor, where there was more room for me to
gyrate wildly.  I developed a new dance called The Convict, where I
keep my ankles and wrists "locked" together.  Another dance called oh
man I forgot what it even looked like so I can't think of a name for
it.</p>

<p>Also that night/next morning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After around 3:30am, I was pretty tired and took a nap on the
stairs, sitting sideways, with my back against the columns of the hand
rail.  Not the most comfortable bed, but I definitely slept.</p></li>

<li><p>During the night, exploring such a big area, I found us using
cell phones for herding purposes like <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:douglasadams.com+%22These+kids+are+connected+to+their+herd%22">Douglas
Adams described</a>.  This helped me feel young.</p></li>

<li><p>As we were leaving, and I went to the coatroom to get my
backpack, this really tall, fit, beautifully blonde braided ponytail
woman got her things as well.  I was like, <em>???  Do I know her or
just wish I knew her???</em> cause she looked familiar, but maybe only
because she reminded me of Sally.  I asked Morag the exact question as
posed in my brain and she's like, "you know her; she's with our
group," and I was like, <em>woohoo!</em> and <em>are you sure; I think
I'd remember if I had met her tonight</em></p>

<p>so as we were all walking back, I was like, "what's yer name
again?"  "Kelly."</p> and it turns out I had not previously met her.
On the train I found out that She's from Montreal, and has been here 5
months, but(!) will leave in 2 weeks.  She liked the dance area by the
pool best.  She came to Japan right out of university for lack of
anything better to do.  I didn't exchange contact information with her
for two reasons: (1) I was tired, which makes me fall in love more
easily (2) she would be leaving in two weeks, and I didn't want to try
and work my way frantically into her schedule to make up for 5 missed
months.  Release.</p></li>
</ul>
