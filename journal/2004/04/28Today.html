<p>Though it's minimal (only displays students' IDs (no names)), my
student reminder thing works.  Awesome.  It didn't work today because
I snagged the date as $year + 1900 . "$mon/$mday" but the month is
returned with 0 = January, so it returned 3 which I was interpreting
as March instead of April.  Fixed that, cleaned up the code a bit,
and now it works.</p>
