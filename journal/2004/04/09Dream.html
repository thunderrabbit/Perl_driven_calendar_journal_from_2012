<p class=dream>I was the leader of a war.  This war was human against
human, set not in the present exactly, and very loosely run. I had no
desire to be the leader of this war, but the position was kinda
relegated to me because ther was no one else willing/able to do it.
Not that I felt very able, but I kinda faked my way through, by
asking my friends what they knew about troop momvement and stuff.
The terrain was Japan; we had troops fighting skirmishes on hokkaido
and honshu. We had super limited resources - no maps.  But we had
some bandaids that I improvised into a map; a square band aid for
hokkaido, and a couple of square bandaids together to make Honshu.</p>

<p class=dream>I didn't really know how to support my generals, so I
first thanked them for their efforts.  I used a combination of stuff
I leared from my men's group training, and winged te rest.  I thanked
them from my heart and complimented their efforts.  Maia Cudhea from
YRUU was one of my generals and she was taller than me.  I looked
into her eyes and placed my right hand over her heart.  "Thank you
for your efforts here today."  She was the last of my generals that I
thanked; suddenly their was information from a battlefront. We were
fighting dinosaurs according to the TV monitors, and a pile of
bandaids had been prepared for application on the wounded.</p>

<p class=dream>I dreamt twice that I wrote this dream down.  once via
emacs, and once with pencil.  Then I woke up and wrote it for real.</p>

<p>(I hope!)</p>
