<p>Clayton, Carla, Phong, and Tomoko's byebye party tonight.  The
place was <em>packed</em>; we took up all four tables in the back of
WaraWara.  I moved around the room a bit more than I have in the past;
in the past I've just picked a point and planted myself there for the
duration of the party.  And I've often been hesitant to leave; don't
want to miss something or someone or some shit like that, so I just
stay and stay.</p>

<p>Tonight, I could feel the brazen arrogance of my ex roommate Frank
coming through when I talked to some of the new teachers.  I was like,
"you won't get fired; I was seeing tons of students and no one cared.
Just don't sleep with them and you'll be fine."</p>

<p>Just before the room reached peak capacity (that I saw this
evening), Ali presented Tony's photocopied teacher cards to Carla and
Clayton and Phong.  I'm guessing that Tony was a bit daunted at how
loud he would have had to yell to be heard over all the crowd.  But,
for Tony, the cat who can't help but say funny things, the room would
have shut up.</p>

<p>I chatted with Erik for a bit about movies and learning Japanese;
it turns out that he goes to Japanese classes a 5 minute walk (if that
far) from my house.  Wow.  I don't know that I'll switch up from
Ayana-lessons on Friday; I didn't really like group lessons
before.</p>

<p>(( I might not take new Japanese lessons at all, but find a
Mandarin-English exchange partner in Metropolis.  I wonder how that
would be; I know basically 0 Mandarin.</p>

<p>Maybe I could take lessons from Kat. ))</p>

<p>As I prepared to leave, I waited for a bit to hug Carla, as all
the Japanese staff had just arrived (after they had their own
welcome party (hi-hi party?) for the new staff) and were swamping
Carla.  Lots of tears (none from me, it seems) and promises to stay
in touch.  Real promises.  Really in touch.  Handshakes to Neil and
Andrew; didn't see Ryan.  Hug to Morag ("I'll send you that letter
soon."  (I wrote her a letter during a no-show back in January or
February)) who I didn't really talk to all night.</p>

<p>Oh, so as I prepared to leave, I realized that this may be one of
my last times to hang with this group.  Lyle would invite me to things
and Carla would as well.  But Lyle's been gone for a month and Carla
will be on a plane to Beijing in two days.</p>

<p>Chatted a bit with Yuki on my way out the door; maybe we'll
actually email each other this time.  Told her I've started keeping a
Japanese diary.  I need to write in that tonight before I get
engrossed in my gaba db project.</p>
