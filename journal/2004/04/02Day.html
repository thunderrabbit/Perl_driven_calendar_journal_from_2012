<p>Yesterday I had Kozue, a student who really inspires me.  She's not
the highest level student I've met, but she <em>keeps a diary in
English.</em>  This is not such an amazing thing in itself, but she is
really pushing herself to expand her English skillz.  She showed me
her diary and asked me to make changes in it, and I was lik,e,
"um.. many changes.. okay?"  And she's like, "okay."</p>

<p>And as I thought about it, I recognized I'd have to change neearly
every sentence, so in order to no waste her time and mess up her
diary by writing all in it, I typed the changes so she could print it
out.  I can type far more quickly than I can write neatly, so I
figure it's a much better use of her time.</p>

<p>I think she agrees; she has selected me as her instructor twice
since then.  Yay.</p>

<p>I'm nearly inspired to keep a diary in Japanese, but I'm torn
between keeping it online vs keeping a written version.  The written
version would be easier for people to check, and the online version
would be easier for me to archive.  A written version would help me
practice my kanji.</p>

<p>Got home at 11pm and stayed up until silly 1:30am though I have to
be at work at 10:am today.</p>

<p>I taught 9 lessons yesterday.</p>
