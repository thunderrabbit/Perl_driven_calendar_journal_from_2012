<p>I've been spending all my free time on my student reminder thing.
It can now display navigation buttons and handle invalid data.  It
requires few mouseclicks to work.  For instance, I had originally
thought to have a radiobutton set to say what kind of data is being
entered, and then entering the data, but instead it will detect the
type of data entered and process it accordingly.</p>

<p>Highlights of today:</p>

<p>Japanese lessons are going great since I started my Japanese diary
(thank you, Kozue)</p>

<p>Went to see Appleseed with Jimmy.  (The movie has great effects,
but the story is weak).  The movie copied Matrix a lot.  Before the
movie he gave me an example layout for my new roller coaster book.
After the movie, we chowed at his house.</p>

<p>Talked to °ì½Å in Japanese while she was cooking her dinner, and
when Matte didn't want his serving, she gave it to me!  Whooo!</p>

<p>Olivier agrees that my Japanese is getting better!  He sent me a
nice email to that effect.</p>

<p>Carla said I'm a great person and we'll always know each other.</p>

<p>Tomorrow (gotta be at work in 8.25 hours) starts 12 days in a row
of work.</p>
