<p>Takako and I are at Korakoen, aka Tokyo Dome City.  We've ridden
Thunder Dolphin, Geo Panic, Zombie Paradise, Bikkiri House (sp), and
Spinning Coaster.  We ate and I fell asleep for a bit while she
decided what she wanted to do next.  Her choice: shopping at the mall
in which this park is semi-embedded.</p>

<p>We walked over that direction, and I saw something that made (and
will make) me leap for joy: bunjee trampolines.</p>

<p>They let us flip; I plan to do double backs, maybe double fronts,
and maybe triple backs.</p>

Oh yes.</p>

<p>Takako showed up just in time to get my bouncing on video.
Fabutastic.  While being strapped on to the bungees, the guy was all,
"wakkawakka" in Japanese and I was like "err?" and he goes, "do you
speak English?"  "Yeah; do you speak English?" I asked, because
obviously he did; his intonation and such was excellent.</p>

<p>He goes, "do you want to bounce high?"</p>

<p>"Yeah; I wanna do double backs and double fronts."</p>

<p>He was all something like, "sounds good; I want to see them." (*)</p>

<p>I asked his name, and he might have said Masaru, but I honestly
don't remember now.</p>

<p>(*) this comment, I realize now, could have been "yeah right,
jack; that's what everyone wants to do."</p>

<p>Once I was strapped in, he pulled on the bungees to get me
bouncing.  I didn't have much contact with the trampoline; my feet
would barely skip on it when I was full force down on the bungees.
When he bounced me, he was flying way up in the air with me, which
kinda surprised me.  I was like, "you comin' with me?"</p>

<p>We were apparently noteworthy; I could hear the crowd oohing when
we started to fly.  I wasn't any higher than the other jumpers had
been; I imagine they were impressed with his unusual bounce
height.</p>

<p>I tried a double back, and got about 1.75 back and my glasses hit
the tramp when I decelerated.  I regained my balance as I saw someone
grabbing my glasses off the tramp.</p>

<p>I was surprised by how difficult it was to do double backs.  I
tried to do some more; or maybe I tried some singles next, and got
them down well.  Blah blah blah; the video will show all.  I'll post
it in all its sideways glory first, and maybe someone can rotate it
for me.</p>

<p>I was to get two double fronts in a row.  Relatively clean ones at
that.  I didn't even try triple anythings.</p>

<p>As it became apparent I wouldn't be able to achieve more than what
I had already (I was pooped), I said, "¤ª¤ï¤ê" to Masaru.  He let me
down and asked if I was alright.  I go "that was *awesome*."</p>

<p>"<em>you</em> were awesome."</p>

<p>"Thanks mate."</p>

<p>awesome.</p>

<p>I had to maintain care so that I wouldn't collapse/crumple off the
trampoline after the exersion.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After some reflection, I realize why flipping was so flipping
difficult.  The bungees were accelerating me up, so I had to lift my
legs against that acceleration to rotate.  I wasn't weightless like I
normally am on trampolines.</p>

<p>Yayayayay Takako for getting the video.  Best ever!</p>

<p>My body is just now recovered from the aerobics of that event.</p>
