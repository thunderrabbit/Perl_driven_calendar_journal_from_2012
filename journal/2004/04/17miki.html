<p>KG Miki texted me tonight; she was in Motosumiyoshi at her new job!
Wow!  I was heading out to Carla's thingie so I met Miki at her work
to say HI and plan a movie with her next month.  Damn - 3 weeks in
advance is pretty far for a movie, it seems.</p>

<p>I'm reallly excited for Miki having a new job; she wasn't enjoying
her previous job (her boss, actually) so she had to quit.  She's only
working one day a week so far in this one, but hey it's a start.</p>
