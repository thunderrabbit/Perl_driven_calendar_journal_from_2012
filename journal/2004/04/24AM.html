<p>I was up a bit late last night so it was a bit of a trick to get
up on time, but it's all good in the hood.</p>

<p>I'm able to understand a bit of what this 5-ish year old is saying
next to me.  Stuff like, "3 people wakawakawaka" and "[hey] that's
cool!"</p>

<p>I was just thinking about Bryn and Kris Scott; I don't know which
one first: Bryn because she did this year overseas thing before I did,
and I now have an appreciation of how difficult it must have beAn for
her.  Scott because I was listening to one of his songs recently,
"Bryn: See You Sunday"</p>
