<p class=date>1:15am JST Sunday 4 April 2004</p>

<p>12 lessons today.  I was antsy by the end.  I didn't think about
that aspect of teaching so many in a row.  I wonder if I'll get used
to it.  Misato has braces.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Kozue is my first student.  I start at 12:15 tomorrow.
Oh, also tomorrow Mieko and Tazako are supposed to come for the open
house.  Awesome.</p>
