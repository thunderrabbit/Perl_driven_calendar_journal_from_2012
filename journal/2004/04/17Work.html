<p>Fun.  Three students selected my lessons today, for a total of four
lessons.  My last two lessons will be with the same student.  Yasuko
said that she enjoyed my lesson most of the instructors she had taken;
and I remembered we had done many roleplays with her introducing me to
Mr Kleenex.  That's one interesting thing about all man to man
lessons.  Role plays requiring three people allow us to talk to boxes
of kleenex and the like.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>This time I called her and she transferred my call to Mr Plant, or
took messages for Mr Plant.  She did well with learning several
variants of the conversation.</p>

<p>Had Hiromi for my last two lessons.   She said she has selected
lessons with me for the next several days.  Cool.  I'm glad that my
teaching style is enjoyed by at least a couple students.</p>
