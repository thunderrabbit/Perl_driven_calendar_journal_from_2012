<p>Finally!</p>

<p>It's been *months* since I've felt a good earthquake, and I just
felt one just a moment ago.  It lasted for near 30 seconds, and was a
nice side to side shaker.  No vertical that I noticed.  Coooooool!</p>

<p><em>Bourne Identity</em> is good.  I was surprised to see that the
actor is Matt Damon, not Ben Affleck.  All the way through the movie,
I had the wrong name in my head.  Oops; sorry guys.</p>
