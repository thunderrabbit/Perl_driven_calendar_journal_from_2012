<p>Kill Bill Vol. 2 comes out in Japan on 24 April.  I invited Shoko
to see it with me.  She said she was interested in seeing Kill Bill
Vol. 1 first.  She suggested that we invite more people.  She actually
said (translated) "only 2 people seeing it is not good, right?"  Uh,
right, of course.  But she didn't have any suggestions of who to
invite (*) or where to watch the movie with more than two people. (Two
people can just watch it on my computer)</p>

<p>(*) this is an example of the kind of thing that feeds the
<a

of Japanese women</a>.</p>

<p>(( I've just spent 45 minutes reading some of what google found. ))</p>

<p>(8:30am ooh just felt a cute little earthquake too!)</p>

<p>Okay anyway jeez the point of the story is I took a bit of a risk
(for me) and decided to act on my idea of having the party here at my
apartment in the TV room.  I wrote KILL BILL VOL 1 9PM FRIDAY IN THE
TV ROOM on the message board and suggested the idea to everyone who
visited the TV room that night.  Everyone seemed to like the idea,
except possibly John who (I think jokingly) was like, "Friday night
is <em>my</em> TV night," but then later never admitted to that
claim.</p>

<p>This gives me a hint of what would be required to self promote a
business or a book or something.</p>
