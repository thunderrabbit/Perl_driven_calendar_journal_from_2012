<p>Today my first student is Kozue, who has now progressed to Snaps 1.
She keeps an English diary, and inspired me to keep my Japanese diary.
I've got several lessons today, with plenty of breaks to study
Japanese.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll write a mass-email update soon.  A lot has happened
since my last one.</p>
