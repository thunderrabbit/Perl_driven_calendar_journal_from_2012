<p>Ummmmmm.</p>

<p>Cool: I had 11 lessons today.  My last lesson was with Kozue, my
cool English-diary student.  Her sentences are getting better.</p>

<p>I had a fun chat with darnit I forgot her name.  but she was cool.
Conversation Gambits is her book; oh I kinda remember now she was
wearing a light green sweater.  Still can't think of her name though.
She lived in UK for some years and thanked me profusely for all the
corrections I gave her during our convo.</p>

<p>Robert Dawkins has taught 3131 lessons at Gaba.  I've taught 168.
I guess it's okay that he has a more packed schedule, and that more
students choose his lessons than choose mine.</p>

<p>I'm going to tweak my journal code a bit so that it detects the
type of browser and sets the encoding so the characters will show up
correctly on the browser.  I'm not sure how I can know the "correct"
settings for several different browsers.</p>
