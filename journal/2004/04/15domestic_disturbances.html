<p>I could write it all; I think I remember enough to write for an
hour about all this.  J is slightly intoxicated tonight and K seemed
to be getting a bit irritated with him.  Understandably so, I judge;
people are trying to sleep around here.  When I heard K say "I'm going
to hit you," and J say "I'm gonna hit you back," I was like, <em>no.
this is not going to happen</em> and I went out into the hallway.  I
grabbed J, who put up less resistance than K, who was fightiing mad,
and who was calmed a bit by Riki.  We got them separated and K went
about her going-to-bed business, and I listened to J a bit.</p>

<p>Tom got his alarm clock so J could sleep in another room, and
maybe that's the end of the disturbances for the night.</p>

<p>Oh, alcohol.  Why do people love you so?</p>
