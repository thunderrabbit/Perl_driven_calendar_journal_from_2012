<p>I called my dad on the way home.  Good to talk to him briefly.  He
said today many square feet of concrete was being poured for a new
garage and new driveway at his house.  Holy cow wow!!
For <em>years</em> there has been only a gravel driveway.  What an
amazing change.  I wonder what other changes are in store for that
house.  I hope he's enjoying all the changes.</p>
