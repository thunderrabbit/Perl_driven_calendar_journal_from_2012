<p>I got a note written on a small piece of paper and placed under my
door, apparently from Rene last night:</p>

<pre>
Mr. Rob

Please pay you 
  rent

  Thank you

     Rene
</pre>

<p>???  It's a bit late to be asking me for my April rent, and a bit
early for May; holy cow I hope he's not asking me for April rent
cause I no longer have the proof that I paid it (unless I tucked it
in some realllly safe place), but I *know* I paid it..  We'll see
what happens with this.  (He's not in his office now, and didn't
answer his phone so I left him a note.)</p>

<p>Holy fuck; it looks like I haven't paid my April rent.
Dammmmmmn.</p>
