<p>Aw man.  When I got home this AM around 7:30, I found the Kill Bill
tape had been removed from the TV room.  The tape is due today in
Nakameguro, and I wrote a note on the board like, "Who has the Kill
Bill tape?  Please put it by room 20.  It's due today in Nakameguro
Tsutaya" (I specified this last part so they would know not to take
the initiative and return the tape to our local Tsutaya)</p>

<p>Went to sleep for 3.5 hours, woke up and a couple people were
awake, but none knew the location of the tape.</p>

<p>Went to work, came back home, and found the tape returned, but
without its plastic sleeve, and not rewound!  Oh jeez come on guys!  I
think you can take more responsibility than that.  (And rest assured
knowing there was no note nor a couple hundred yen to pay the late
charges.)</p>

<p>Yarg.</p>

<p>So I'm noticing that I've projected my personal level of integrity
on others and I assume there were no extenuating circumstances; maybe
returning the tape to my room was the absolute best they could do.  I
dunno.</p>

<p>yarg even so.</p>
