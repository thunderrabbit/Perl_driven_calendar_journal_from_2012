<p>I was pleased with how I handled a lesson at work.  The student
was using a business book, and was far in over his head on
vocabulary.   He was not able to fill in vocabulary words in a speech
given by some business guy in some business situation.  Words like
"propose" "looking" "success" "working" etc.</p>

<p>I figured I could just say, "good work" and move on to the next
lesson, which he would likely understand just as little, or we could
work more on this lesson.  So I had him write all the vocab words,
then I wrote sentences with blanks and had him fill in the missing
words.  Then I wrote more sentences with blanks and had him fill in
variants of the missing words.  "success" -&gt; "successful" or
"working" -&gt; "worked".  Then I had go over the original speech
again, and I think he did it a bit faster this time.</p>

<p>That lesson was at the same time Rene was teaching Mariko.
