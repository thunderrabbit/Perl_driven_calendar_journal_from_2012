<p>Productive this morning.  Did laundry, wrote emails, met Yuuko at
¿Ó∫Í to see about Dan's camera.</p>

<p>Camera is ready, but needs to be shipped to Yodobashi.  13,000 yen
(fuck they told me 10300 yen I thought).  It's weird that it will be
here tomorrow (or the next day) after I just happened to go there
today.  I hope they woulda sent the shit over without me having come
in today, but it's weird.</p>

<p class=date>2:23pm</p>

<p>Now I'm at Gaba; Yuuko and I have eaten at the nearby ramen shop.
I'm now in my suit to teach my one lesson today.   Aright.</p>

<p class=date>4:11pm</p>

<p>The lesson went well.  Yuuko and I rented <em>Bourne Identity</em>
on the way to my apartment.  It's a lovely warm day now.  Naptime for
a bit.</p>
