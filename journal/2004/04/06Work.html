<p>At work yesterday, I just *happened* to look at my schedule for
today (which I had specifically planned to be my day off) and was
quite surprised to find classes scheduled.  Fuck!</p>

<p>I was a bit freaked at first; I had made plans with Yuuko, but in
the end, all the classes were moved to other teachers.  (Save one; the
student had chosen me specifically, so I'm going to go in for one
student.  It's kinda weak to have to go in for one lesson, but there's
a positive feeling that the student chose me mixed in.)</p>

<p>It will all be good.</p>

<p>After work, Shoko checked my Japanese sentences.  She was really
helpful; She didn't just check my sentences, but quizzed me on them as
well.  I'll likely ask her again and pay her (with white chocolate
and/or dinner) for her efforts.  Awesome.</p>

<p>She's a new staff member, so I don't know her very well yet, though
we both seem to like each other.  She says she wants to see Kill Bill
vol 2 (but she hasn't seen number 1 yet), so I'll invite her when it
comes out.  She has her hair permed a bit (I'm making the brash
assumption that because she's Japanese, she doesn't have naturally
curly hair), which I usually don't like, but it doesn't bug me on her.
maybe it's cause I've never known her hair otherwise.</p>


<p>(As a side-story to meeting her for sentence checking, I was like,
"Shoko, can you check my sentences after you're finished [with work]?"
and she goes "okay.  Maybe ten minutes later."  I thought she meant
ten minutes after Gaba closed (which was in 40 minutes).</p>

<p>I went downstairs <em>[to get some juice or a coke, flipped the TV
off and then I almost choked]</em>(*) to call Yuuko and reschedule our
meeting for today and grab some snackage while I waited for Shoko to
get off work.</p>

<p>Came back upstairs and she (with help from Rene) was writing me a
note because she was *leaving*!  Oh crizzap; she had said "ten minutes
later" which is Japanese English for "10 minutes <em>from
now</em>"</p>

<p>I explained the very important difference to her, and she practiced
the new sentences "in 10 minutes," & "10 minutes from now.")</p>
