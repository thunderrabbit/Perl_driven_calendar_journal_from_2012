<p>Work was pretty good; I had 8 lessons and my mood is far better
than it was when I started.  Had some cool students that seemed to
enjoy my lessons and I enjoyed being in one of the new cubes (number
14) that has been recently added to our school.</p>

<p>Hung out with Jesse for our two shared free lessons, playing
hackey sack for the first one and eating kababs and playing hackey
sack and exploring Jiyugaoka for the second one.  I had a couple of
students who I had had previously, but no students who specifically
selected me today.  Tomorrow, though, I start with Kozue, who
specifically selected me.</p>
