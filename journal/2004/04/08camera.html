<p>Yay.   Dan's boss' camera is finished.  I'm on the train now to
get it from Yodobashi camera in 川崎。 I'm really glad to have this
adventure quite near completion.</p>

<p>Couple days ago, Dan sent me an email (on ketai of course)
including a forward from his boss:</p>

<p>This was the day after Daniel told me something like, "actually I'm
kind of enjoying this.  Every time I lie to him about it, I feel like
I'm James Bond or something, like we're in this spy thriller.  In any
case, it's going to make a great story later, so let's enjoy it now
while we're in it.  Tell the guys at Yodobashi Camera to keep it as
long as they like."</p>

<p>CAM (*) is complete.  However, KAM was unsuccessful.  A woman was
handing out tissues in bold yellow packages - the same color yellow
as The Bride's suit in Kill Bill.  I was like, "sumimasen" (excuse
me; I've walked by you 3 times why won't you give me one of your
tissue packs?) and she's all, "gomenezai"  (I'm sorry.)  Grr stupid
profiling in Japan.  Oh, do they call it targeted marking?</p>

<p>(*) Camera Acquisition Mission</p>

<p>The camera cost 13,740 yen.  I got to watch part of Tomb Raider in
the store.  Camera seems to work perfectly.</p>
