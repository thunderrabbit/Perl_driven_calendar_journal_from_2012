HI Claudia

Gracias por la email.  Lo ciento, no tengo los fotos de 300 dpi.  Mi
camera es barato.  Los fotos en el homepage son los mas dpi.

(I hope you're not offended by my attempt to remember my high school Spanish.)

Thank you for your email and interest in my photos.  I'm sorry to say
that I don't have any 300 dpi versions. The photos on the website are
the highest resolution I've got.  If you would like to use them
anyway, feel free to do so, with credit as "www.robnugen.com"

Will you please tell me the URLs of the photos you like best?  I am
interested in writing a book on roller coasters, so I wonder which
ones caught your attention.

	Take care
	- Rob

Dear Rob;

We are a group of Brazilian professionals who have been developing a
didactic material to be commercialized and used in schools all around
the country.

We are not part of a publisher company; a local school, which believes
on the quality of our project, subsidizes our work.

First of all, we would like to congratulate you about your excellent
photos, we could found then trough the your website.

We are writing to express an interest in inserting some pictures from
Fujikyu Highland in our books and CD-roms, illustrateing our geography
lessons.

Of course we will be crediting you.

If it is ok for you, I would like to ask you, if you could send this
image by e-mail in high resolution (300 dpi).

As a small institution we cannot afford with high amounts,
specifically dollar amounts. We hope that you can understand our point

We feel that your work could contribute a lot to our project.

If any further information is required, we are at your disposal or you
can visit our website www.jpiaget.com.br.

We are looking forward to hearing from you soon,


Yours, faithfully
Claudia Y. Miyashita
Search and production.
