of UFO sightings excite Iran</a>

<pre>
	According to Reuters, state-run television today broadcast a
	sparkling white disc flying over the capital of Tehran, saying
	it was filmed last night.

	People were reported rushing out into the streets in eight
	towns last night to watch a bright "extraterrestrial light
	dipping in and out of the clouds."

	The Islamic Republic News Agency also reports colorful objects
	seen beaming out green, red, blue and purple rays over the
	northern cities of Tabriz and Ardebil and in the Caspian Sea
	province of Golestan.

<p>Wow!  UFOs, right???</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

	Sa'dollah Nasiri-Qeydari, head of the Astronomical Society of
	Iran, told the wire service the stories were unfounded.

	"In my opinion, flying saucers do not exist," he said,
	insisting his telescopes would have spotted any potential
	invaders from space.

	"The people who have seen these things are not experts:
	farmers, villagers and pilots," he added.

	Nasiri-Qeydari suggests people could actually be viewing the
	planet Venus, whose light could be given different colors when
	filtered through the atmosphere.

<p>Wow. It turns out I was completely wrong about Venus.  This expert
standing out in his field, says that Venus doesn't shine serenely at
the horizon, as I thought, given that Venus is closer to the sun than
us.  Instead, in his *opinion*, flying saucers don't even *exist*,
*PLUS* his infallible telescopes would have easily spotted any craft
coming our way.</p>

<p>Of course, it was just a bunch of villagers and pilots who saw the
lights.  No experts.</p>
