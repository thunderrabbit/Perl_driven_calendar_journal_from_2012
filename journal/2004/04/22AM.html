<p>I walked with Dan to the train station.  Brought my skates, skate
wristguards, and skate helmet home.  Didn't bring home my kneepads
because they wouldn't fit in my bag.</p>

<p>Good to chat with Dan for a bit.  He was on his way to teach his
kinders; cool deal is that he gets to wear casual clothes to do
it.</p>

<p>We went opposite directions on the train; his came first, and I
mock ran after him in slow motion.  I'm so glad we have similar sense
of humor.  Dan is money.</p>

<p>Home, showered, collected all my money and have 59,000 yen in bills
and about 1000 yen in change.  I'll offer 50,000 to Rene and the rest
tomorrow, but he'll say just pay it all tomorrow.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to go bowling with Takako tonight.  I didn't reply to
her some days ago when she asked if I wanted to go with just her or
with a group.  I texted her today to ask when and where to meet, but
haven't heard back from her.  It is still early though.</p>

<p>For some reason, though I'm way tired; I'm feeling a great need to
work on my student tracker.  I haven't quite found the reason for that
urge; it's almost like an addiction, but how am I addicted to writing
computer code?  What's underneath that?  Productivity?  Self
worth?</p>

<p>Yesterday, during one of my lessons, I suddenly visualized the
house Wende and I owned together.  I nearly couldn't finish the
lesson.  What on earth have I done?</p>

<p>I continued the brainwaves and came to the hint of a possibility
that I would be able to settle some day.  That being settled and
creating a space for myself (and partner) could be satisfying
work.</p>
