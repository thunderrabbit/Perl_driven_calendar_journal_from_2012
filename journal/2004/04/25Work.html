<p>Pretty good day at work; I realized that I can use emacs via the
terminal window, but only on the local machine; I can't easily save
data on a network drive that is accessible from the other computers
(I'm in a different cube from day to day, so I need to save files in
some non-cube-specific manner)</p>

<p>I had two LUTs today.  87% for the first one and 91% for the second
one.  Oh, I had Noriko today!  She's past lesson 1 of book 0 and I
helped her get started on lesson 2 of book 0.  We looked at sentences
like, "I'm Noriko" and "Are you okay?"  and "Yeah, thanks."  (after
Kei ate it while surfing, Lukas helped him out of the water.)</p>

<p>To start, I translated everything on the comic for her, and then
once she pretty much understood all that, we ended up looking at the
difference between "today" and "every day."  I am studying English
today.  I study English every day.  Man, she works so hard.</p>

<p>Jesse wasn't there today.  When I texted "WR U @?" he replied "FAR
AWAY"</p>

<p>I wanted him to help me test my student reminder.</p>

<p>Now, I'm about to arrive in Kawasaki for Carla's second (third?)
bye-bye party.</p>
