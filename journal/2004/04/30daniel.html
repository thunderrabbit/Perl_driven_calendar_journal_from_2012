<p>What a great day.</p>

<p>Specifically, what a great day to hang out with my friend Daniel in
Jiyugaoka.  The weather is money and the women are beautiful (if
they're not smoking).  The technologically cool thing about this cool
day is: we're sittin' on a bench (which has been so recently painted
as to look like fresh wet sticky cloth-antagonistic paint) outside,
listening to BBC.CO.UK/radio4 while typing a journal entry using a
pirated internet signal.</p>

<p>Daniel = fun.</p>
