<p>Party after work to say bye to Hikari and Yuko.  I sat across from
Shoko and practiced a lot of Japanese.  It was pretty cool and I would
have a stronger crush on her if she didn't *smoke* argh why do cute
girls smoke?  I asked her and she was like, "I can't quit" and I asked
her why she started and she said it seemed interesting.  Ugh.  What a
nightmare.  She seems cool in most other respects.  Similar age/taste
in movies/etc.</p>

<p>We may see Kill Bill Vol 1 on DVD together, and then go see Kill
Bill Vol 2 when it comes out.  Maybe.</p>
