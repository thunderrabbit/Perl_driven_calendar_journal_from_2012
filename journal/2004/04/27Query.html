<p>Thanks to Tim for offering help on the query and oooooooh special
thanks to Maggie for thinking of a new way to structure the
query!  I haven't tried it yet, but here's the new structure:</p>

<pre>
select L1.* from lesson_taught L1 INNER JOIN lessons_taught L2
  ON L1.studentID = L2.studentID 
  WHERE L1.date <= '2004/04/26' and L2.date = '2004/04/26'
</pre>

<p>Hey, that reminds me that we hadn't tried select l1.* with the
original query.</p>

<p>One challenging thing about the development of this code is that
while I'm in the live environment (office), I don't have access to the
code.  I've emailed myself copies of the source data from the live
environment, but it's not *quite* as satisfying to make it work in the
non-live environment.</p>
