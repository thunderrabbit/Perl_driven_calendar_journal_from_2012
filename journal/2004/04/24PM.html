<p>At Gaba, during the first lesson (Jesse and I both had a free), I
tried to show him my student reminder, but I couldn't get past the
login screen.  On my machine at home I just enter the password and hit
enter and it submits the data.  There's no actual submit button, and
the machines at work don't submit the data with just a carriage return
(or ctrl-cr or alt-cr or shift-cr or any other combination I thought
might work).  I'll fix that when I get home tonight.</p>

<p>Work today was pretty cool; 13 lessons with a break; money, dude.
I didn't have many students overtly select my lessons online, but I
had two students who I know pretty well.</p>

<p>One student was interested in getting a .xls file of all the
comments teachers have written for her, but I don't know if that's
possible.</p>

<p>During the last lesson, Jesse and I played a game of "talking" to
each other during the lesson, which was not a conversation by any
means, but just mimicry, though still really funny.  A couple of times
we had to work hard not to laugh.</p>

<p>After work we played hackeysack outside the entrance to Gaba, and
came up with new names for ourselves.  His name is far better than
mine: my name is Doctor Kick, and he is Turbo Stall.</p>

<p>We've gotten noticeably better since we started playing regularly
about a month ago.</p>

<p>Shoko and Robert came out while we played, and Shoko gave a few
decent kicks, a couple of which we were able to work with.  They
didn't really want to play though so they left.</p>

<p>We continued playing, occassionally having to retrieve the footbag
(unnamed, as yet) from behind a vertical grating thing, until Jesse's
friends arrived.  Junichi and Chisako.  They were patient enough to
watch for a bit, but didn't want to play.</p>
