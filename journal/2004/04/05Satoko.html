<p>Just yammered a ton with Satoko; a student I met for the first time
today.  She's got quite good comprehension (or fakes it *really* well
haha) and ended up asking me a lot of questions about her computer and
email and internet and websites and stuff.  I told her about
gmail.google.com and mail.lycos.com as a more conventional web based
email.</p>

<p>She asked about my life in general and for the first time I told a
significant bit about my experience in Japan and my two lives before
Japan, mentioning no names.</p>

<p>It's quite rare that I yammer far more than my students, but she
queried and I dumped.  I hope it wasn't too much; my sense is that
it's all good.  She was quite capable of changing subjects and guiding
the conversation if she had chosen.</p>
