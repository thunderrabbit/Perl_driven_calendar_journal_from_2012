<p>So far today, I was able to get my butt out of bed to return the
video on time, and I've successfully written a page and a half of
questions and answers from the book.  yay for successful homework
completion!</p>

<p>Now it's time to write a letter to Erika and do the other things
on my list.  Hopefully Dan's camera will be ready today.</p>

<p class=date>3:54pm</p>

<p>Yay for kickin' it outside with Hitoe and Matteo, the couple who
live below me in the building.  They were just enjoying the newfound
sunrays and Riki was there for a bit spraying various things with the
water bottle Matteo had been using to stay cool.</p>

<p>Hitoe is off her crutches and has basically the rest of this month
to heal her ankle before she's back on the job as a World Wide Tour
Guide!!!  I asked her how she got herself hooked up with that job.
Suddenly I felt myself wondering if it's really what I want to do.</p>

<p>Hitoe helped me tell her in Japanese how to make chocolate chip
cookies, the recipe I have in (oh I forgot the butter!!  janette -
how would they turn out without butter?) my head (imperfectly, it
seems,) after some months spent kickin' it with janette, the
Chocolate Chip Cookie Queen.</p>

<p>Later today Hitoe will check my sentences that I wrote this morning
for homework for lesson with Ayana tomorrow.</p>
