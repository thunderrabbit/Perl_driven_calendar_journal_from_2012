<p>Had two great lessons at work.  First great lesson was my first
lesson of the day.  Noriko, 45 year old housewife who tries <em>so
hard</em> to get this stuff.  For the past 8 lessons, she has been
working on the first part of page 1 of book 1.</p>

<p>I saw the notes from the first time I worked on this lesson with
her, and I noted that I had gone well beyond her current abilities.
Today, I think she may understand it; I translated the sentences and
wrote directions and notes in Japanese to help her understand the
classroom instructions.</p>

<p>Stuff like, "say _____"  and "ask me" is beyond her
understanding.  Everything I say she repeats.</p>

<p>So we started today with a question that she kinda knew how to
answer.</p>

<p>me: "Who is he?"  (pointing to a character labeled Antonio
in the book)</p>

<p>she:  "Who is he Antonio."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>During the lesson, I learned that I was going way over her head
even by gesturing to myself, "who is he?" and then gesturing to her,
"He is Antonio."</p>

<p>She took that to mean insert her name for Antonio's name, with the
following result:</p>

<p>me: "Who is he?"  (pointing to a character labeled Antonio
in the book)</p>

<p>she:  "Who is he Noriko."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay okay, let's take a step back here.</p>

<p>I translated the questions and the answers to Japanese, and
labeled who should say what in the resulting coversation:</p>

<p>私 "Who is he?" だれ　です　か。</p>

<p>の "He is Antonio."　だれ　は　アントニオ　です。</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Lots of high fives as she got that down, and then we bumped it up
a notch:</p>

<p>私 "Is he Niko?" だれ　は　ニコ　です　か。</p>

<p>の "No he isn't."　ちがいます。(*)</p>

<p>私 "Who is he?" だれ　です　か。</p>

<p>の "He is Antonio."　だれ　は　アントニオ　です。</p>

<p>(*) Noriko translated this one; I think that's what she wrote.</p>

<p>She got this, and could sometimes get the addition of gender.  "Who
is she?"  "He is Annette."</p>

<p>That took nearly the entire 40 minutes.  Awesome lesson, and she
told me in Japanese that I am a good teacher.  Awww my heart just
melted.  I'm so glad.</p>

<p>The other awesome lesson was with a woman who was officially in
book 3, but the "homework" she wanted help with was *SUPER*
difficult!  She had been asked by her boss to translate from English
to Japanese an analysis done by a lawfirm (?) regarding the recent
nomination of a chair and vice chair to a Manufacturing Council as
part of the United States Department of Commerce, and how this newly
proposed council is different (and hastily thrown together) than the
originally planned council as proposed in January 2003.</p>

<p>It took me a few readings to understand everything; I was really
glad to be able to explain everything to her, including with drawings
to represent the originally proposed council and the newly created
one and how congress' worries of overseeing the new council were
mitigated by incorporating part of the original proposal.</p>

<p>Really happy to have had such good lessons.</p>
