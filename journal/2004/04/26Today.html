<p>So far today I've written in my japanese diary and worked a lot on
my work project.  At this point there's so functionality, though it's
not very useful *quite* yet.  One query isn't working like I want,
and I'm not sure why.</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM lessons_taught
  WHERE date < "2004/04/26" and studentID =
  ( select studentID from lessons_taught WHERE date = "2004/04/26" );
</pre>

<p>I tried "and studentID in" for "and studentID =" but that didn't help.
The subquery works and the main query without the "and studentID"
sub-query works; I'm not sure what's the dealio.</p>

<p>Anywayses, right now the code can smurf in an html report and throw
the pertinent data into the db, and it can output all the records in
the db for a particular instructor.</p>

<p>次は自由ヶ丘です。</p>
