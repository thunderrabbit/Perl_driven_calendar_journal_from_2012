<p>I think after checking homework/chatting with Hitoe, I'll go to
Dan's apartment and give him the camera.  I wonder if he's off work
today or if he'll get home at 10pm.</p>

<p>Operation PAG complete.  I wore my GAP hoodie inside out for this
one.  Met Dan at Hioyshi station.  I don't know if he noticed my
hoodie.</p>
