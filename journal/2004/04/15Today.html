<p>After spending many hours on my website-comment thing, I went
downstairs to hang with Hitoe and Matteo a bit.  Bought a diary from
the local 100yen shop and wrote my first entry which Hitoe checked
and corrected for me.</p>

<p>Yay Japanese diary.</p>

<p>Spent about an hour finding webpages to learn a bit about using
MySQL on my site.  Fred suggested using this for my Gaba student
tracker thing.</p>

<p>Now  it's time to head over to Jonathan's (family restaurant
(upscale Denny's)) to meet Haneda Miki.</p>
