<p>KG Miki called me last night, sad about Carla leaving Nova and
Japan.  I really wanted to help comfort her, but I couldn't
realistically do it in Kawasaki for there is no safe place for her to
let loose and cry.</p>

<p>So she came over to my apartment this morning and cried some.  Lots
for her.  She asked me if I had ever cried.  Def.</p>

<p>I wanted to stay and hang out with her all day, but I'm on my way
to work now.  I can feel myself wanting to grok/possess/have her, but
I don't think it's actually Miki, but just being close to a fellow
beautiful soul that I'm enjoying, and ..  it's like I'm
differentiating between being in the state of bliss with her and being
with her.</p>
