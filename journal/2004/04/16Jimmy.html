<p>Hung out with Jimmy today and worked on my roller coaster book.
He sketched out steps to complete a $50-$100 coffee table book, and
steps for a smaller softback type book.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Munched spaghetti and I borrowed his Tsutaya card to rent Kill Bill
Vol 1 because I didn't trust that Andrew had rented it.  (( Last
night, knowing that I would be at Japanese class at 10am today and
then hanging out with Jimmy, and knowing that today was the first day
Kill Bill would be available for rental (starting at 10am), and
knowing that Andrew didn't have anything else to do (he's kickin' it
jobless style until he moves to Kyushu in 2 weeks for work), I gave
Andrew 1000 yen and my Tsutaya card and asked if he would rent Kill
Bill for me before it's sold out.  And then call me when he got it or
if he confirmed he could not get it.  Either way, call me.  He said,
"I'll try," and I let him off the hook instead of saying fuck that
I'll ask somebody else.  I recognize that I gave away my power and
can't hold him liable for not following through.  He said I'll try,
and I let it go. )) It's possible that there will still be copies
available when I get home in 20 minutes, but I didn't want to take
that chance; plus I don't have my Tsutaya card readily available.</p>

<p>I devoured several chocolate chip cookies and a cup of ice cream
(after the good sized bowl of spaghetti and chicken) as we discussed
possibilities for the book.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>I emailed a bunch of pictures to his work, with which he will put
together some sample layouts for the book.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Thanks, Magnet.</p>
