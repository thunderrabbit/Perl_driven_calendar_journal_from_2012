<p>tired.</p>

<p>Today I cleaned my room.  Absolutely beautiful.  Even vaccuumed.
This cleaning was due to the possibility of Miho coming over this
evening.</p>

<p>First lesson at work was 6:15.  I went in early cause I'm cool
like that and Shoko asked if I could cover Devron's lesson at 5:30.
No problem.  Bang extra lesson just like that.</p>

<p>Had a few good students, including two who seem likely to choose
my lessons again.  Awesome.</p>

<p>After work I went home to change, went back to Motosumiyoshi and
met Miho.  We walked to Jonathan's and chowed.  She pancakes and me
lasagna.  Then we had dessert.  Sweet beans and machi and ice cream
for me.  With super sweet syrup that was too sweet to enjoy in
teaspoon form.  Wow.</p>

<p>She helped me with some kanji and I wrote the following
sentence:</p>

<pre>何時に侍の時計持ってましたか。</p>

<p>Afterward, she did come over to my apartment, and looked through my
scrapbook.  I'm glad to have made my room clean and basically have my
scrap book up to date.</p>

<p>She left.  We never touched once.</p>
