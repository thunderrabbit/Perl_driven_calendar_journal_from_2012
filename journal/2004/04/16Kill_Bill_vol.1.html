<p>Watching Kill Bill was fun.  Andrew was the only one who joined me
from 9pm, but Jackie donated a bucket of microwave popcorn to the
cause.  Andrew had rented the film, but didn't call me.  Turned out to
be a good thing that he didn't call me, though; he had rented a
dubbed-to-Japanese version of the film.  If he had called me, "I got
the tape," and then it turned out to be in Japanese, that wuld have
been a d'oh! moment.</p>

<p>Watched the movie and laughed at the ridiculously copious
blood.  Wow.</p>

<p>Matteo came down and watched starting around 9:30; he was surprised
that we started it at 9, which surprised us since it's been written on
the whiteboard all week.  KILL BILL FRIDAY 9PM IN THE TV ROOM.  I
guess some advertising misses its intended mark.</p>
