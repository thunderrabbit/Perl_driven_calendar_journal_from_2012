<p>Hung out with Hiromi during lunch.  First time for us to talk,
really.  She said she wanted to hang out with me more.  I've never had
a Japanese woman so forward with me; we'll see how it goes.  (It
reminds me of Bonnie. (who I can't find in my journal for some
reason.  Was she pre-online-journal?))</p>
