<p class=date>4:00pm JST Friday 9 April 2004</p>

<p>Eating takoyaki outside, sortakinda hoping that Hitoe and Matteo
would be outside again, I heard Eminem emanating from somewhere.
"Lose Yourself" came on, and I decided to take the hint; this was my
one chance to invite Hitoe and Matteo outside.  I soon discovered that
the music was coming from their room!  Matteo was apparently at work,
so Hitoe and I chilled outside for a bit, sharing life stories.  She's
been in this apartment four years.  Wow. </p>

<p>I wanted to keep talking and enjoying the sunshine, but I had to
go to work.</p>

<p class=date>4:39pm</p>

<p>Scratch that.  I was on my way to work (wearing my sandals, oops)
and I called Maiko to see what time I had to start and she was like,
"not until 7:45" and I'm like, "whoah."</p>

<p>So I closed 5:30 and I'll go in at 6:15 to see if I can get some
lessons earlier.</p>

<p>Chatting with Hitoe and Shoko now.</p>

<p>°ì½Å and ¾½»Ò</p>
