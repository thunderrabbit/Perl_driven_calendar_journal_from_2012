<p>I feel so sad.  My life is so different than it was 13 months
ago.</p>

<pre>
without the express written permission of the national football
league.

<p>And so so so so different than it was whenever that was a long
time ago when I (we) lived on West Bell.</p>

<pre>
Thank you so much for the plenty of planning time invitation.  
I choose not to go; I can't face your family.
