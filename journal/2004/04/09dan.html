<p>Dan and I hung out for a bit after my lesson.  We met at
Motosumiyoshi, grabbed some foodage, then I grabbed the train tickets
I've been saving for him.  About half are new to his collection,
which will probably put him over 100 cards collected.</p>

<p>We hung out by the stream/brook/creek thing, watching sakura
petals float downstream.  We played Pooh Sticks and sang songs to
each other, including animal noises of mountain lions and dogs and
ducks.  Dan is awesomely fun.</p>

<p>Walked the rest of the way to Kosugi as Dan told me the made up
history of a building or some such as we walked past.  Hilarious.  I
showed him the persistent feather in the tracks at Kosugi, and we took
the local train to Motosumiyoshi where I got off.  He tried to
pursuade me to visit Tsunashima with him, but I needed to eat more and
such before work.</p>
