<p>I'm chillin' at my old apartment, soaking up some internet rays
while I wait for first train to take me back home.  After work I
joined the latter half of Jen's birthday extravaganza.  Got to say HI
briefly to KG Miki and Miki H and Mamiko and a couple others who left
before last train.  Dan had to leave around that time too because he
has to teach kinders in the am.  He'll be awake in about 3 hours I
think.</p>

<p>The party moved from the one place to the Wan across the street,
which the girls call Dirty Wog.  They're open until first train.  I
sat between Michelle from Philly and Karen who are Morag's roommate's.
Michelle replaced Lisa, who was opposite Karen from me.  There was a
new guy named Takuto that Jen immediately and always thereafter
called TicTacToe.  He was cool because he designs clothes, and had
designed (and made?) his felt green fedora with flower.  He helped
Michelle and I with Japanese, and later talked with Lisa about Lisa's
new house in Hayama.</p>

<p>After all the fun in the bar; we all left and Lisa invited us for
more entertainment at her house, even dragging me by the arm at one
point.  I was like, "no way am I waking up two people (Morag and
Michelle) and Lisa said Morag wouldn't mind and Michelle didn't
count.</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep.</p>
