<p class=dream>I was in a shopping mall in Japan and I met up with
Christine, my girlfriend during college.  She went into the restroom
to change her babies' diapers and while I waited for her, the cleaning
guys were cleaning the floor in the big commons area.  I was not
allowed to walk where they were cleaning, an area that slowly grew in
size.  Eventually they were cleaning inside the restroom, thereby
forcing her out before she was finished.  She came out with only one
baby, the other one being cleaned by the floor cleaners.  Christine
trusted that the integrity of Japanese workers meant they would do a
good job and return her baby promptly.  So Christine and I and her
Japanese husband and one of her babies went to watch a movie about
World War I.  They were showing a relief map with lines and arrows and
graphics, but no real images of the war, and definitely no video
footage.  Though her baby continued to not return, Christine didn't
seem to concerned; I found out that she and her husband had many
children; and Christine was so fertile that they couldn't conceive
just one child at a time.  She took this opportunity to raise just one
child as a blessing, it seemed.</p>

<p class=dream>I showed Christine some Japanese written by a fellow
student of mine and Christine was able to read it.  Then I realized
it was written in Romanji.  I couldn't find anything written in
Japanese in the book.</p>
