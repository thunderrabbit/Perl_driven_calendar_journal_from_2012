<p>Yuuko and I Talked today; I felt no trepedation (sp) for I knew I
had been honest with her all along.  I spelled out my relationship
history for her in order to explain why I choose not to have a
girlfriend right now.  At the end of it all, we are choosing to remain
friends and choosing to no longer kiss.  I'm a bit sad about the no
kissing, but I think it will be better for me overall; it will keep me
away from the dangerzones.</p>

<p>She asked if she was just my playgirl and I was like no way; citing
all the fun stuff we've done together, as proven by the pictures on my
wall of us on rollercoasters together; we've had tons of fun and I
hope we can still do that.</p>
