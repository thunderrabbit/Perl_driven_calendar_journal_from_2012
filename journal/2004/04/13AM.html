<p>Kinda poopypants today; just slept until I had to get up for
work.  I was up vaguely late, but still I slept for like 10 hours.  I
kinda decided <em>fuck this poopypants stuff</em> and called the
magnet to get some more energy toward my book, but it only worked
vaguely (it seems).</p>

<p>I'm not like yahoo the past couple of days.  Bummed about my bike
and have been really horny lately.</p>
