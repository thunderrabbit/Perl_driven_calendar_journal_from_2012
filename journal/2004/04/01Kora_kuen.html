<p>¤¿¤«¤³ and I have been having big fun at Tokyo Dome City.  We've
ridden 

<ul>
<li><p><a href="/images/coasters/tokyo_dome_city/thunder_dolphin.jpg"><img
src="/images/coasters/tokyo_dome_city/thumbs/thunder_dolphin.jpg"
align="left"></a> Thunder Dolphin three times (in an attempt to sit in
the front seat (we're not allowed to choose coaster seats here in
Japan) so I can get a good video from on the train.  I got a video the
first time we rode, but 50% of the screen is taken up by the seats in
front of us because I wasn't willing to hold the camera way up high.
("Hey; look at me; I've got a camera!"))</p></li>

<li><p>Geo Panic (small indoor coaster) twice</p></li>

<li><p>Wonder Drop (short outdoor flume ride) once</p></li>

<li><p>The Big O (big hollow ferris wheel with Thunder Dolphin
coasting through it) once</p></li>

<li><p>Sky Trip (human power tandem bicycle cars (I mimicked what I
hear on trains when they stop at stations, and called it Jitensha
Densha (which rhymes for "Bicycle train") much to my own amusement,
and I hope Takako's) with two seats side by side) once</p></li>

<li><p>Tower Hacker (mid-sized drop tower) once</p></li>

<li><p>Sky Flower (slow drop parachute tower) once</p></li>

<li><p>Linear Gale (back and forth hanging ride on a vertical U shaped
track (weak ride, but okay if there's no line)) once</p></li>

<li><p>Zombie Paradise (slow cars through a kiddie haunted house)
twice</p></li>

<li><p>Hyper Illusion (movie on curved screen with moving chairs
(weak)) once</p></li>

<li><p>Spinning Coaster (mouse-trap coaster with 4-seat cars that
rotate as momentum dictates) once</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=date>12:04am</p>

<p>After all that riding, we headed across the street to Jonathan's,
which I describe as an upscale Denny's.  A cool thing about this
restaurant is the entrance to Jonathan's has an entrance to 7-11 in
it.  Like go in the Jonathan's door, and then go into the 7-11 door.
Or go up the stairs to Jonathan's.</p>
