<p class=dream>I had a dream that I was late for Gaba.  I had been
sleeping late in the afternoon after staying up crazy late at night.
I tried to find out what time my first class was, but the girl on the
phone was new and didn't understand what I was asking.  She told me
what time I was allowed to work, and then what time I worked
yesterday, and then Jesse showed her what information I was looking
for.  Miranda was there, but she wasn't upset that I was late; she
said it happened to everyone now and again so I shouldn't worry about
it. Cool.</p>

<p>I was really surprised and relieved when I woke up.</p>
