<p>Well the good thing is that I've gotten a great start on my
student tracker.  I've sketched out the structure of the program and
have coded the skeleton, including having fleshed out the
authentication code.</p>

<p>And I just figured out that I can store html output from new cgi
objects like this:</p>

<pre>
$query = new cgi;
($output) = $query->p("hey man");
</pre>

<p>So what's the ooops?   Oops it's 4:20am, and I forgot I have
Japanese lesson in 5.5 hours-ish.  I was thinking my first
appointement tomorrow is meeting Jimmy in Shibuya.</p>
