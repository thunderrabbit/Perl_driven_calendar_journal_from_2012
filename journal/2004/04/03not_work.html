<p>janette hasn't been writing me back as much as she used to.  I
wonder if she's busy.  I actually wonder if she's mad at me.</p>

<p>Walked around with Jesse after he and I and Eric went to a chinese
restaurant near Musashi Kosugi station.  Pretty good restaurant.
Jesse and I talked about the nature of God and he tried to logic me
into Christianity.  Good luck on *that*.</p>

<p>We played hackeysack in the middle of the street/RR crossing.  When
the bells started ringing we calmly walked off the street and the
returned after the train passed.  We're funny, if I do say so
myself.</p>

<p>Tonight I missed hanami festival with people from my building. (I
was at work) I'm kinda bummed about that, but overall, it's cool.</p>
