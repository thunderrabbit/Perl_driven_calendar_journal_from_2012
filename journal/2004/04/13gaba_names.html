<p>I've started a .pl file that will help me remember names of
students, especially students who I will see again in the near future.
It uses the html output from one of the online (intranet) reports to
figure out what students I will teach.  Eventually it will process the
names and times and see who I've got multiple times in the (near)
future: names I ought to spend a bit more effort at memorizing.</p>
