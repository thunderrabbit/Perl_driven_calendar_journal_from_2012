<p class=dream>Introduced to Benny's parents by Benny, and he was
quite specifically more quiet and didn't interrupt me while I was
saying HI to them.  Afterward, he asked me about his performance, he
was basically trying to calibrate his frequency of interrupting to a
more sociable level.  As I was answering him though, he started
talking to his girlfriend.  I was like, <em>ah well</em>.</p>
