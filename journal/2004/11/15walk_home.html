<p>So.  That's how long it takes me to</p>

<ol>
<li><p>pack my stuff at Louise's house (Jiyugaoka)</p></li>
<li><p>walk home</p></li>
<li><p>unpack my stuff at my house (Motosumiyoshi)</p></li>
<li><p>check my heart rate (61 beats per minute)</p></li>
<li><p>type C-t (write timestamp) in emacs</p></li>
</ol>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>One of the above took the bulk of the time.</p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with my heart rate.</p>

<p>I paused for a moment as I crossed Toyoko line and the other one.
I considered walking home along (on) the tracks, but I'm not sure
what type of trouble I would find if I were caught.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It seems I could walk to work from home in 74 minutes.</p>
