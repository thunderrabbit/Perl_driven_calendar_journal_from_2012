<p>Went to L-Breath, a camp/ outdoor sports store to check prices and
stuff.  They have GPSs available for way more than I can get in the
US.  I don't know about tent prices and stuff.  Found there are
portable throw-away propane tanks that can have stoves or lanterns
screwed on to cook or see.  The smallest size with pizo-electric
starters were 7087 yen per stove or lantern.  I'll probably get those
if I choose to cook.</p>

<p>I need to start chatting with people who camp.  What to get, what
to leave, etc.  It seems, I could get all the basic stuff (tent,
sleepin' bag, foldy mat, GPS (yes, it's basic), lantern, stove) for
100,000 yen.</p>

<p>Certainly I can crush that price if I go to the camping-store area
of town.  I can double crush it if I buy used.</p>
