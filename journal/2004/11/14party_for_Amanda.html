<p class=date>2:49am JST Monday 15 November 2004</p>

<p>After Akiko's lesson, I zipped straight to the train station and
caught the 8:03pm local train for Shibuya.  Sent a message to Jen that
I would arrive in Jiyugaoka at 8:11pm.  I was surprised when I saw
the clock say 8:12 when I got off at Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>Found Amanda and some non-inclusive friends.  I was like, "HI, I'm
Rob," and they were like, " ," or "hi," after they had been all
chatty together.  Jen and Tetsuya arrived and the Ikumi and we called
Jeff to say we had all arrived.</p>

<p>The restaurant was a grill-at-yer-table restaurant, which would do
quite well in Texas, I believe save for the lack of barbecue sauce.
Jeff and I tossed on sliced tongue and other bloody bits, cook cook
cook, done!</p>

<p>Amanda and her friends were pretty much all collected on the other
end of the three tables we had filled.  I would have been inclined to
visit save for all the cigarette smoke choking the area.</p>

<p>Cake was layers of chocolate and chocolate cake mixed.  Nice.  Not
super big, though.</p>

<p>I sat across from Ikumi, and next to Tetsuya on my right.  Tetsuya
was between me and Jen, and across from Hide ("he day") who was
between Ikumi and Jeff.  Michael (next building / Gaba) came and sat
next to me, but he was quite drunk and making very little sense.</p>

<p>Once Jen and Tets left, Jeff then Ikumi went soon thereafter.  I
was like, "welp; there goes my table," and decided to rock out,
balancing my urge to stay until the party was *over*, and my urge to
not inovertantly stalk Ikumi.</p>

<p>By to Amanda and Katrina; thanks for the party and fun.</p>
