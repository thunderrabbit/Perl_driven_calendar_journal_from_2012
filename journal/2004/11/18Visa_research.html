<p>Wow.  The Chinese embassy is open until noon each day.  How the
hell do hardworking Japanese cats get visas to China?</p>

<p>I'll zip over there in the AM on Wednesday.  Or maybe I can just do
it from Sapporo, at which time I'll be closer to ready to go over.
But I should get it done while it's important and not urgent.</p>
