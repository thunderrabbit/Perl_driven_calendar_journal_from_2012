<p>Played Monopoly with Katrina on Wednesday night.  It took me
forever to go around the board once; I went to jail <em>three
times</em> in a row before collecting my first $200.  Then it
continued to take forever for me to get a set of all three properties,
but somehow I had ended up with lots of cash and I bought four houses
per property and she landed on it once and bankrupted instantly.  Not
as fun as it could have been.</p>

<p>We need to get some more people to play with us next time.</p>

<p>Next time I ask her, if she says no, I'll say, "I <em>promise</em>
not to beat you."  Haha</p>
