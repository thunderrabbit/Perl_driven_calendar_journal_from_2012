<p>Been able to work on my journal code a lot; figured out how to
keep it from doing the annoying double refresh when no date is
entered.  It will be really easy to implement, and I'm not sure how I
couldn't have seen that before.</p>

<p>I basically understand all of Fred's code for the journal index; I
just couldn't really have written it myself.  I should be able to hook
up the ability to view types of journal entries soon.</p>

<p>Been talking to Jen a lot about me-an-Hitomi.  I gotta quit seeing
her for my own sake.  Gotta have no girlfriend for a while.  Ack.</p>

<p>Go, pendulum, go.</p>
