<p>Met Jen, Tets, Ikumi, et. al at DWs tonight after work.  It took
me 36 minutes to ride there not including locking TJ Bike.</p>

<p>Usually I stay put in my own little spot (once I select one) at the
table, but when I started hearing "Fujiyama" being uttered by peeps at
the other end, I helped myself into the seats over there.</p>

<p>Gave my 10 cents worth of yammering about how Fujiyama is money,
Dodonpa is weak, Tondemina is basically weak, and the haunted house is
weak.  Fun to be knowledgeable about something.</p>

<p>That conversation shifted to other topics and I scooted back over
to chat with Ikumi and Jen, as people on their end had started to bail
out for the night.</p>

<!-- p>Ikumi was talking about how she wanted a (tall) boyfriend, and
I was like, "I want to be your boyfriend, but I'm a bad boyfriend;
it's better if we're just friends."  The conversation didn't go much
past that and some gazing eye contact, but I put it out there.</p -->

<p>It came time to leave, the last trains were heading toward the
station.  I met the cat named Steve there for 8000 yen of
reimbursement for Yahoo!BB and NTT charges at the apartment.  He paid
in four new 2000 yen bills.  Cool.</p>

<p>Ikumi declined a ride with me and TJ Bike back home, so I raced
her and Jen back home.  I had a five minute head start before their
train came, but I got stopped at two pesky traffic lights (after
hauling <em>ass</em> down hills only to stop at the bottom) but
I <em>tied</em> them at the exit of the train station.   I literally
rode up as they were coming out of the stairs.</p>

<p>And then, as we were yammering, Shoko came out!  So Jen dinked (*)
Shoko and I pumped (*) Ikumi back home, with a quick stop at the conveni
for Shoko.</p>

<p>Arrived home and found Hitomi chillin' with Riki downstairs, which
I was really glad to see her getting the heck out of the boring room
and into some conversational situations.</p>

<p>Took a shower and wrote this and going to bed soon.</p>

<p>(*) Aussie and American ways to give someone a ride on bicycle.</p>
