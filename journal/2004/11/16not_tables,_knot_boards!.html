<p>Wow.  Riki just gave me three (so far, four total once he moves
out) knot boards that I imagine I could sell for several yen.  Several
dollars even.  He says they're from Holland, and his grampa had
them.</p>

<p>He said they were tables, but I searched a bit online and found
they are commonly called "knot boards," available new between $84 and
$119 for big size and around $40 - $50 for medium size.  Or so.  I'll
see if I can find a market for them in Tokyo.</p>
