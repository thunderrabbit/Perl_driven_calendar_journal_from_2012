<p class=dream>I looked outside up at a billboard that said smvrfing
a few times and I knew it must be a type-o, and was horrified that it
might have been my billboard.  Did I submit it with a type-o?  I
looked at the product they were selling and determined no - I had
never sold that product; it was not my error.</p>

<p class=dream>The product was a hampster tube shaped like a ring,
and it had no decorations on the inside of the ring, so Boss Lady
told my friend to add pictures to it to spruce up the ring.  I turned
around and she was typing in commands on a computer screen and the
hampster ring with a large radius was inside a glass enclosure, and
an computerized arm was slapping stickers onto the inside of the
ring.  I was impressed that the robot arm was so versatile; it could
select the right sticker, or maybe print the right sticker, put it in
the right spot on the ring.  Plus I couldn't even see the arm.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "how does it work?  where is it?"</p>

<p class=dream>And she was all, "there, by the phone inside the
enclosure."</p>

<p class=dream>I jokingly thought that if the computer arm is getting
information by phone, it would have to repeatedly say, "ちょっと待って"
and then "もしもし" over and over as it listened to what it needed
to do on the phone and then did it.   hahahaha!  A robot arm talking
on the phone.</p>

<p class=dream>Rene and Jesse were there; Jesse was complaining that
OS X should be able to give users a useable map of the filesystem.  I
was like, "just use locate and updatedb," but he didn't seem satisfied
with that solution; he wanted to see inside each file instantantly.
"well, wait for the google desktop for OS X."</p>
