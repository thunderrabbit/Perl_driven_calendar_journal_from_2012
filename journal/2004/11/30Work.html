<p>Had 7 lessons tonight, all of which were decent to good.  One set
of contact info given to Mieko.</p>

<p>Had Naotoshi for two lessons; he's doing *so* *well* due to his
continuous hard efforts at studying.  I think he's catching up and
surpassing my Japanese ability.  Man.  I gots ta study!</p>

<p>Hitomi called me during the 5 minute break after my second to last
lesson and said she had printed a lot of stuff for Hakone for me and
Daniel.  Oh my gosh how awesome!  So I ran downstairs and grabbed it
and was about to run back, but thanked her again and gave her a kiss
on the hand and then ran back.  Wow; how awesome!</p>
