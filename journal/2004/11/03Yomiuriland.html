<p>Hitomi and I talked through the situation; she wanted to talk as
soon as she got back from when I wrote the previous entry.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We rode TJ Bike and Mimi Bike to Yomiuriland!!  It took probably 45
minutes, which is not as long as I expected.  The trip included
stopping for drinks and the guy saying, "oh this next bridge is for
cars only you'll have to go waayyyy around..." and showed her a map
and all that.  So we turned and got a bit lost, but before getting too
lost, a taxi guy was like, "go right next to the bridge no prob" which
we did, and included me porting both bikes up and down some stairs,
much to the amazement of an old woman who was at the top of those
stairs at the time.</p>

<p>The last hill to get to Yomiuriland is a hefty one, but we made
it.</p>

<p>So we're here at YUL and it's way more crowded than it was when I
was here last time,but it's not as crowded as it could be.  It looks
like we'll have to wait for about six Bandit cycles, instead of 1 last
time.</p>

<p>ps: Hitomi hands make a good table, a la Bryn at Luna Park in
Melbourne, OZ.</p>

<p>Fun so far.  Video on Bandit got cut off halfway through, though I
haven't seen where; my batteries are low (stupid me) so I am
conserving power. Then we both did the bunjee jump and were like
whoooo like all kinds of fun and got those videos and then a bunch of
other cats wanted to bunjee.  I was like, "we should get free
tickets!"</p>

<p>Then we sat in the last seat of White Canyon and I got a video, but
from last seat.  NOW we are in the front seat of white Canyon,or we
are in line for first seat.  I hope my batteries last.</p>

<p class=date>1:16pm</p>

<p>Kickass.  My batteries made it.  On the way up the chain incline
thing, I noticed first that I was on picture mode, not video mode.
Then when I switched to video mode, I saw I had enough memory to
record 33 seconds worth of video.  The previous video was 90 seconds,
so I switched to Play mode so I could delete it, but was was running
out of time up the incline and beginning to panic and pressed play
instead of delete cause usually that's what I want to do.  So the
video was playing, and I was like, <em>no no no</em> and had to relax,
think, then deleted the video, and then switched back to video mode,
just in time to record the ride.  Nice.</p>

<p>I'm gonna call this a successful trip to YUL; I have a video from
the front seat of White Canyon.</p>

<p>Here is the <a
href="/images/coasters/yomiuriland/white_canyon.avi">video of White
Canyon</a> that I took from the front seat.  It's 22.5 megs.</p>

<p class=date>3:17pm</p>

<p>We rode a few wussy rides, oh, and we met this 14 or so year old
girl who reminded me of Joana Olson (whose name I just now remembered
quite quickly)... She was riding the Craaazzeee Houuuuusstoooonn ride.
She zoomed back into line to ride it again, and again, and again.
(The ride is two towers; a launch tower and a drop tower.  She
preferred the drop tower.)  It was funny to see her scamper out of the
ride back into line.  While she rode that, we rode next to her once
(to get aerial pics of White Canyon) and then we rode the big
innertube down a bigger waterslide ride and could still see her in
line or on the ride over and over.  I'm super glad she was having such
fun.</p>

<p>We got ice cream, then rode the ferris wheel after trying to ride
the suspended gondola, but turns out it's not actually part of the
park.</p>

<p>Now we're going to ride a secret ride.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Haha the secret ride was not a ride at all, but the "Sea Lion's
Show" I had seen it before and knew Hitomi would like it so I told her
to close her eyes, which she did well, but she opened them as the
woman checked our hand stamp credentials, [welcome to our
attraction!], which I can't really blame her, but I had hoped to be
seated before she found out where we were.</p>

<p>We were both in tears of laughter for one part of the show; the sea
lion barking into the microphone to the song sung by the lead
show-girl.  (and by show-girl I mean girl in the show, not
strip-tease-dancer-girl.)</p>


<p class=date>5:14pm</p>

<p class=note>(the time above is a guess)</p>

<p>We explored the area I explored last time I came to Yomiuriland,
but this time we couldn't get to the part I wanted to get to.  It's
some mysteriously unused part of the park, including an ampitheater, a
very tall bridge only wide enough for a sidewalk, and a set of trails
up a hill.  We did, however, get to the White Canyon side of the
bridge, and could see where it ended, which I didn't think I had seen
before, but I'm having deja-vu now that I had seen it last time.
Anyway, the bridge was still there, still old, still incomplete...  a
mysterious project that was never finished?  Never fully taken down?
There seemed to be evidence that it was currently under construction
(the slowest construction project *ever*) as we found some asphalt
poured in a couple of sections and a clipboard with a checklist, a
pen, and a tape measure.</p>

<p>Aw man; I should have taken a picture (with Hitomi's phone camera)
of me holding that stuff as if I were using it.  I did joke that we
should fill in as completed a lot of items on the checklist.</p>

<p class=date>6:24pm</p>

<p>Tadaima.</p>

<p>Just got home.  And one presidential candidate is the victor.  I
just don't know which one.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Welp, no one knows which one yet.</p>

<p class=date>7:36pm</p>

<p>Wow; I am falling asleep while trying to read about perl objects.</p>
