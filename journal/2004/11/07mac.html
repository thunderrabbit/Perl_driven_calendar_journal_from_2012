<p>Kickass.  It took a bit more finagling that it should have, but
everything seems to be cool with my computer.  A screw that had not
been replaced is what the guy claimed was causing the mouse to not
wake from sleep.  He reseated the spacebar, and now it is working
beautifully.  I thought it was just old, but apparently I fucked it
up when I took off all the keys and cleaned my keyboard.</p>

<p>'far as the battery messed up, Sawako said resetting the memory
board button should fix that.  She reset it, and now I'm upstairs
with 78% battery left to go.  If it stays all good for a couple
hours, then we're golden.  I *might* stay here that long; I've got
plenty of cool stuff I can do on my site.</p>

<p>Plus we've got rockin' music in here and a comfortable, well lit
area with free internet access.  And if it dies before the battery
indicator says 60%, I'll know her solution did *not* work.  We'll see
how it goes.</p>

<p>Why am I blabbling on about this?</p>

<p>Oh, I know one reason; my spacebar feels so so yummy; I just love
typing now!</p>
