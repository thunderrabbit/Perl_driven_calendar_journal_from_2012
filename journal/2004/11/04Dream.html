<p class=dream>There was a tomato who had become a celebrity cause he
could answer yes/no questions and move a little bit.  I got the
opportunity to play with him, and needed to understand exactly what he
could do.  I put him on the edge of a counter and was like, "can you
say yes?" and he nodded, falling into my hands.  "Can you say no?" and
he shook slightly side to side.</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay, do you want to make a movie of you being
attacked by a shark?" and he vigorously said no.  "Okay, would it be
okay if we had a stunt tomato?" and he was like, "oh yeah, that would
be fine," for he had suddenly developed the ability to talk.</p>

<p class=dream>I took him to the local fast food restaurant, and he
knew the manager and asked her if she could give him a tomato as a
stand in for him.  She said she was really busy, but that if I tossed
a paper airplane in the window at 4pm with a reminder note written on
it, she would look for a tomato for us.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a mangey old dog and a girl, and me, and we
were all trying to prove who was boss.  The dog kept putting his paw
on top of my foot, and I kept squashing his paw with my foot, and he
would say, "gambatte!" (which means '(you) try hard', but in my dream
meant, 'I give up!'), but then when I quit he'd immediately put his
paw over my foot again.</p>

<p class=dream>Then the girl started to bite me, and I was like,
"stoppit; you'll draw blood and infect me with whatever horrible
diseases you have" and I tried to squish her and the dog down
together to get rid of them, but it didn't work.</p>
