<p>I'm super close to having slices of my journal available.  Note
that by default, type=daily shows up in the URL.  Other options are
ultimate, YRUU, KTRU, dreams, SoML, sleepy, ..  and others I can't
remember.  Next I just need to fix my navigation to show links to
those types.  I can type them by hand for now.</p>

<p>Going to go get foodage for chowage today.</p>

<p>Oh, the one thing I know doesn't work is the Cancel link on the
comment page.</p>
