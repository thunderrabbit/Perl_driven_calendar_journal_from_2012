<p>Watched part of <a href="http://www.secretsofwar.com/">Secrets of
War</a> on History channel, and learned some stuff about the 1950s and
1960s.  I had always heard theories that Kennedy was shot because he
nearly brought us into nuclear war.  This implied that the soviet
leader Krushtev (sp) nearly brought us into nuclear war.
Interesting.</p>
