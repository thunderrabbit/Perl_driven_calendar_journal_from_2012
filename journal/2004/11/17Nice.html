<p>I *just* made it onto Nambu line.  As I was going through the
ticket gates upstairs, the first people were coming up the escalator.
I *busted* running toward the escalator, barely squeezed between the
wall and in front of someone walking to the escalator and rizan down
the steps, squeeped through the crowd and the doors were closing, but
I got my arm inside.</p>

<p>Either drag my body to Kawasaki or let my ass in.</p>
