<p>After lesson (she bought a dated but good book with conversations
and then the grammar points in detail) and dinner and roller coaster
TV shows at Jimmy's, I went to Jonathon's to study.  I didn't order
drink bar; I just got drinks. Hitomi came after a while and checked my
work and got her own drinks, assuming I had ordered for both of
us.</p>

<p>We could have jetted, I'm guessing, and I think we would have, had
we not just started this every-night study routine there.</p>

<p>This was the first night she stood on Mimibike's seat on the way
back and I was really nervous, but she was really not.  We made it
back with no problems.</p>

<p>Watched the end of Star Wars Episode 2 from Yoda's crazy light
saber fight until Amidala and Anakin were getting married.  Showered,
now bed.</p>
