<p>It took me 1.25 hours to ride TJ Bike to Cinecitta, park illegally,
debate his security while walking to the ticket windows, buy
front-row-center movie tickets to _Secret Window_ for 9:15, walk back,
find TJ well, and ride home.</p>

<p>On the way there, I carried TJ over an intersection on the
pedestrian bridge.</p>

<p>On the way back, I almost smashed into the back of a bus while
trying to merge with traffic to go around the bus.  But I recovered
and didn't even have to stop.</p>

<p>Haha; I like how I titled this entry "movie_tickets."</p>

<p>Now, it's laundry and shower time.</p>
