<p>Daniel is up early, and I'm gonna just get up so we can hang out on
his second to last day.  I gots to work at 4pm to 10pm.  Yesterday, I
closed my 10pm - 10:40pm lesson cause it was empty.</p>

<p class=date>11:03am</p>

<p>Wow.  We headed out and saw a guy cutting persimmons (sp) from the
tree in his yard.  Daniel commented that it was cool and the guy
straightup gave us each a persimmon.  Awesome!  Then the dude was
like, [why don't you climb the tree?] and I was
like, <em>awesome</em> and [is it okay?]</p>

<p>It was okay, and I went up onto his roof and cut three fruits, with
the full intention of giving them to the guy, but he insisted three
times that we have them.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I think I'll write him a note of thanks.</p>

<p>Later, I was like, "well, the dude has a fruit tree and fruits are
falling, rotting on the ground; he's got to get rid of them
somehow."</p>

<p>We took them back to my room and now we're heading toward museums
in Ebisu.</p>
