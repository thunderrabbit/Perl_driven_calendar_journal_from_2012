<p>Incredible amount of wind tonight.  Enough to rip the industrial
strength canvas building cover from a section of the construction
across the street.  I debated climbing up to that point and in, but
there were too many windows that could see such an entry, and there
was plenty of racket to attract attention to that area.</p>

<p>I can definitely feel the house shaking when the wind gets going.</p>

<p>weather.com says the wind is from the Southwest at 38 gusting to 52
mph, and from the Southwest at 61 gusting to 84 km/h</p>
