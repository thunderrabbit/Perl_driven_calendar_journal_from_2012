<p>Showed Daniel the way to my house and Jen suggested he bunk out in
one of the free rooms.  I went over to Rene's at 9:30pm (after his
office hours) and paid my rent (for December and January) and then
asked if Daniel could bunk out in one of the empty rooms.</p>

<p>Short version: Rene was like, "no problem," and came over with
fresh futon covers and set up Daniel with fresh futon covers, fresh
curtains, and a key, all the while <em>apologizing</em> for not having
been ready more quickly.  He had no idea Daniel was coming!!  We
apologized proffusely and tried to have him not worry about it;
("Rene, don't worry about the curtains; it doesn't matter."  "No no;
if you are paying money, and you are not have curtains, this is not
good," and shooed us out of the room until it was done and
perfect.)</p>

<p>Rene works so hard around here.  Wow.</p>
