<p>Hung out with Teddybear Tomoko today in Kawasaki.  I rode TJ Bike
there in 20 minutes from Motosumiyoshi.  She measured him for the
custom stickers she's going to make.  I'm really happy about that.</p>

<p>We rocked over to TokyuHands on 5F of Dice and bought some bright
yellow tape that I want to tape candystripes around TJs tubes to make
him more visible, more unique, and more ghetto.  I'll just tape right
over the painted lettering; we debated painting over it to cover it,
but that end result would be either expensive, or would look ghetto
and look like it was *trying* not to look ghetto.</p>

<p>Then we chowed Okonomiyaki on the 8th or so floor of Dice
building.</p>

<p>She told me she wants to learn how to make a <em>clock</em> out
of <em>brass</em>.  Like a real clock.</p>

<p>Woah.</p>
