<p>At home, chatted with Ikumi, Jeff, Shoko some and we (then I, as
they all went to bed (oh, but Shoko came back for the end)) watched
blonde Angelina Jolie as a reporter in a movie where a prophet
predicts she'll die in a week.  It was okay.  More memorable but less
delicious than the pudding Shoko bought for me.  Mmmmm.</p>

<p>oops, falling asleep here</p>

<p class=date>3:06am</p>

<p>Um, listened to Roger's lastest tale of trying to get some custody
of his daughter back.  Got to read the gory details (in English) of
his court settlement.  His story and his wife's story
are <em>quite</em> different.</p>

<p>It's amazing how quickly I can fall asleep (and wake up).</p>

<p>I decided (after Jen asked me who was my best kisser, and I came
up with my best most memorable kiss as Abbey Venice) that I needed to
go ahead and write down the details of my optimal life mate.</p>
