<p>Just had a good cry for what reason I have little idea.  It was
triggered when Hitomi called me after calling me this morning
basically saying she wanted to meet me on Thursday night after I
finished with my student (after I had just told her this morning that
I was busy and could not meet).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This morning Hitomi called and was like, "can you meet on
Wednesday?"  "no; I'm busy."  "Thursday?"  "no; I'm busy."
"Saturday?"  "sigh; I guess.  Fine, okay, yeah fine."</p>

<p>Then she called me this afternoon; "I want to meet you early; can
you meet me on Thursday?"</p>

<p>And I'm like, "  "</p>

<p>And she's like "moshi moshi?"</p>

<p>And I'm like, "chotto matte" and put the phone down to try and
come up with why I don't want to meet.</p>

<p>I was like, "what do you want to do?"</p>

<p>She's all, "anything okay: talk, walk around, ride bikes, watch a
DVD; anything okay."</p>

<p>I knew that meant she wanted me to come up with something, and all
I'll come up with is let's go to my room and fuck.</p>

<p>Jeez, Hitomi..  Fine we'll meet on Thursday, but if we meet on
Thursday then we won't meet on Saturday.</p>

<p>She goes, "okay, but chotto yada"</p>

<p>My first reaction was like, "fuckit; it's all off; I'm not meeting
you at all; fuck off."</p>

<p>But I tried to explain; this is just like what we had and I
couldn't do before; I don't want a rolling list of Hitomi meeting
times; we just end up fucking in my room and it's not good for my
spirit or studies or website or other friendships.</p>

<p>She misunderstood my point, and it just set me off the emotional
deep end; I can't fucking do this.  And I started to cry.</p>

<p>She knew something had gone wrong with her plan. "Why are you crying?"</p>

<p>My tears were honest, and my answer poured out "I can't speak
Japanese; I don't understand what you want; I don't know; I have to go
to work; I can't do this." Or something to that effect.</p>

<p>She goes, "shigoto gambatte" and I was like "thanks" and hung up.</p>

<p>Cried for a good 5 minutes.</p>

<p>I can't put a logical reason on why, but I feel marginally better.</p>
