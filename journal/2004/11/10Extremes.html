<p>I added |&lt; and &gt;| to the bottom of the sidebar; they go to
the very first or very last entry of the type that being displayed.
At first I was trying to do it with extra logic in sidebar, but I
realized I could do it far more easily in the updater (which already
(easily) calculated the last entry date) and got it finished
quickly.</p>

<p>Wha?  Something freaky is happening with the dates now; I wonder
what I did.</p>
