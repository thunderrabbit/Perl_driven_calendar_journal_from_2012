<p>At work, which was pretty easy, I took a picture of the guys who
play the shell game down beneath our window.  A guy across the street
yelled at me to stop, and I felt a bit bold for a second and aimed the
cameera at him, but didn't get a very good shot.  OM was a bit like,
"ah, you shouldn't rat on someone else if they're not hurting you
directly."  I haven't ratted on them, but do have a photograph.
Extortion crosses my mind as a word that might mean force them to pay
money for me to not pgive the photograph to the cops, but I don't
really think I would do that.</p>

<p>Because it's nearly anonymous, I'd consider posting it here,
though.</p>
