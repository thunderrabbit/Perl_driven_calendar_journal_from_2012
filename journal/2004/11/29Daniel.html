<p>Hung out with Daniel today; after saying bye to Jen (who is going
to Perth for 10 days), we chowed 8 and 10 takoyaki and then went to
Tamagawa park, to which I had never previously been.  Nice place that
used to overlook Tamagawa (Tama River) until a utility building thing
was built, blocking the view.  I am actually presuming the park was
built before the utility building; I don't know if it's true.
However, I am certain that the hill on which the park was built was
there before the utility building.</p>

<p>Daniel gave me his thoughts on the socio-economic-political status
of the US (after I asked if he thought the US dollar would crash to
worthless (short version: no)), and I could see that my impression of
the US is definitely different from my vantage point than from his
vantage point.  It's probably at least as much a Rob vs Daniel thing
as a Japan vs US thing, but he definitely is less concerned about the
future of the US as a nation than I am.</p>

<p>The weather was basically perfect; the sun shining; the chocolate
muffin and azuki bean dessert were yummy.</p>
