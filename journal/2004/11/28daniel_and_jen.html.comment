<br>I love you Rob!!! :)<br>
<br>
I am at an eating disorder recovery program and I....feel more alive and real that I believe I ever have. I am learning so much, so much is coming together and making sense. I have been a sugar addict since a baby. I know this b/c of my childhood memories- ex. hiding ice cream sandwiches in the living room behind the couch (from my teenager brother) before I was old enough to know that frozen things melt...Things I didn't remember until I sat down and worked on my Step 1 (writing my life history) um<br>
I don't have much time on here..I just really wanted to say hello. And there is a kindred spirit here that if you don't mind I would like to give her the link to this website. She is a writer and beautiful and sings folk songs. We sing harmony together. Do you remember right before you left I said I had something important to talk to you about..when you got back... well it was bulimia. I wanted you to know that ahhh i have to go i love you<br>
