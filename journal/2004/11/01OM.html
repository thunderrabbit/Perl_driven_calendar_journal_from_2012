<p class=date>11:01am JST Monday 1 November 2004</p>

<p>Went to OM today to try to fix the internet connection while he has
rocked off to Phillipines.  9am arrived and called NTT (phone company)
and they spoke good English: "your phone line is cool; it must be your
ISP.  Call them."</p>

<p>I called them, and prided myself in being able to <em>nearly</em>
understand (especially given the context) the recorded Japanese
yammering that included [10am] to determine the message was saying,
[we open at 10am; call back then.]</p>

<p>So Jen and I chowed breakfast at Yoshinoya, (which included her
telling me about her mom nearly scalping herself in a car accident,
not knowing her scalp was flapping back, <em>posing for pictures</em>,
and then going to the hospital where the nurse said, "I'll take care
of things," meaning "I'll call yer mom," but which Jen's mom took to
mean "I'll call yer lawyer and hook you up with a big lawsuit
settlement," so when the lawyer came, Jen's mom was all, "oh, it's
already been taken care of; don't worry your pretty little non-scalped
head about it," and as a result, never got a settlement, (and included
me telling Jen how I learned to dance, which amounted a lot to how I
didn't learn to dance, and how I learned to hate line dancing and
therefore any concept of dancing where specific foot placement is
involved, plus how my friend Christina taught me how to dance in a way
that was non-threatening to my shy character (of that time) by
standing, not moving my feet, and just imagining I was seaweed, waving
gently about in the water, a dance move I demonstrated for Jen in the
restaurant,)) and I called them back at 10am.  No English speakers
were there, but I was able to finally understand they were giving me a
new number to call.</p>

<p>((One thing I realized after a while was they were using a
superformal form of Japanese, which is part of why I couldn't tell wtf
they were saying.  The grammar seems to use much longer forms, and
more question forms, or maybe I'm just full of hooey.  Also, because
the woman was being so polite, she would ask me a question that
amounted to, "can I give you a number to call?" but would not give me
the number until I said "yes" and then when she asked, "will you call
them?"  she would not hang up until I said yes.  but I kept saying, I
don't understand.  She never lost her patience, and I kept not knowing
what she was saying.  Anyway, it was a relief for me to finally figure
it out that the number she had just given me was essentially the End
Of Transmission; it was time to hang up and call them.))</p>

<p>So I called the new number, and though the guy was genkier,
allowing me to pick up on meaning via cues of intonation, he spoke no
more English than she did, which was none.  However, his increased
genkiness meant he was talking more quickly, making it trickier
overall to understand.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to understand much of what he was saying beyond
"YOOZA NAMU" (username), which I gave him.  I tried in a few different
ways to tell him, [I don't care what you do, but if you can get the
internet to work, then go for it.]</p>

<p>He kept being all [yah it's a messed up situation that requires a
Japanese speaker, eh?] and I'm like, [we ain't gots no Japanese
speakers up in dis joint,] an he be all like [da hey you talkin' bout
dawg? hook up one a dem dam Japanese speakin' mofos on dis line and
stop talkin' yer damn efft up Japanese an shit.]</p>

<p>So I made some guesses at what information he might possibly want
that could get past this hurdle.  I was like, [I gots my username,
password, physical address, birthdate..] and he was like, [is that
right? well I don't give I flying flip about that stuff.]  So I was
like, [is the money okay?]</p>

<p>And I knew I triggered something with him cause his answer was
differently unintelligible from what he said before.  So I simplified
it, to literally "money is okay?  money is not okay?"</p>

<p>He chose "not okay."</p>

<p>Okay!  Now we were getting somewhere.  But, I have no financial
information so I can do no more good nor harm here.</p>

<p>Jen called Yoshi, but got no answer, so we left, but then decided
to call him again, so we came back, called him, faxed him the details
of what had happened so far, and then we left for real. Best faith
effort fully attempted.</p>
