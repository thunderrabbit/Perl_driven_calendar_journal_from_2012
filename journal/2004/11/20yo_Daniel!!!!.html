<p>Oh my gosh Daniel just called me; he's about to hop on the plane
for Tokyo!!!  This was not a 100% surprise phonecall; I knew he was
coming, but I just had never written down *when* he was coming.
Tomorrow we're going to hook up for dinner, and then he'll do his
thing for a few days in Tokyo, then jet to Hong Kong (? (somewhere not
in Japan)) and then come back for a few days actual hang out time with
me!  Whoohoo!</p>

<p>It was so interesting to hear a complete foreigner to Tokyo.  He
was like, "I think we're going to be staying in .. Shi-buka?" and I
was like, "I've never heard of Shibuka; is it Shibuya?"  "Yeah,
that's it."</p>

<p>"Awesome.  Shibuya is fucking convenient to my place."  Upon
reflection, I don't know why I said "fucking" instead of "super" or
"incredibly" or "".</p>

<p>"Really?  That's great!"</p>

<p>We're going to meet at Hachiko tomorrow night; might as well give
him a taste of the culture instead of me getting lost trying to find
his hotel.</p>

<p>I told him to ask for Shibuya Eki and then Hachiko.  When he leaves
his hotel, he should call me; it might take the same amount of time
for us both to reach Hachiko.</p>
