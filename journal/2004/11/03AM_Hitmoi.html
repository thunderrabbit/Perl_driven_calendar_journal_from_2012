<p>This morning Hitomi is in a bad mood, but I don't know why.  She
and I are s'posed to go to Yumiuriland today, and when I woke up at 8
and was like, "cool let's go," she seemed angry, because last night we
went to bed late and I had said let's get up at 10, she's not saying
anything this morning.  This is not a game I want to play, "what did I
do wrong?" or "wtf is wrong with you?"  I need communication.  This is
a Last Straw.</p>

<p>(he says, but they're still planning to go to YUL by bicycle.)  If
she doesn't fuckin' genki-up, there will be problems today.  I need to
watch myself; we're just doing this thing called go to YUL, and I can
go again alone or with someone else..  (one more thought was in
there)..  Oh, it's like we're acting like everything is cool, but
everything is not cool. That seems to be the way to do it in this
culture.  That sucks butt.</p>
