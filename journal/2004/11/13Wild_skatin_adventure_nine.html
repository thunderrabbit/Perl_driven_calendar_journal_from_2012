<p>Nice synchronicity:</p>

<p>I'm in the process of moving my Wild Skating Adventures from the
/skate directory (don't bother going there; there's really nothing to
see) into my journal.</p>

<p>I just read <a
href="http://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=skate&date=1995/01/13">Wild
Skating Adventure 9</a>, which includes the following description of a
moment I remember clearly:</p>

<blockquote>
We went to Allen Center and played disc up there for a good 30
minutes.  I looked out over the edge of the building at the cars
scurrying along I-45, and I began to imagine what my life will be like
in 10 years from now.......will I still be skating, or will I just
have to remember this view forever?
</blockquote>

<p>That was 9 years, 10 months ago.</p>

<p>I have a better idea of what my life will be like 10 years from then.</p>

<p>I wonder what my life will be like 9 years, 10 months from *now*.</p>

<p>Will I have written a book?  Will I be a millionaire?  Will I be
happily married?  Will I be living someplace warm?</p>

<p>I hope so, on all four counts.</p>

<p>Those seem like good goals.</p>
