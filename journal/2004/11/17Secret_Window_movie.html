<p>The movie starts in 2 hours, but Ikumi is texting me and it seems
like she thinks the movie starts really soon.  I'm working on my site,
but I may go out there if she wants to chow before the movie.</p>

<p>Movie was pretty good.  Good enough to see on video, but not
really worth full feature price.  It was just another, "wait, but if
you're me, then who am I?" plotlines.</p>

<p>Suspenseful fo sho, but not too terrible.  Ikumi said she may have
problems sleeping tonight, but I'm sure she'll be okay.</p>

<p>We ate at Jonathon's in Kosugi after the movie.  I'm thinking of
more specifically writing Japanese journal entries.  でも、大変です。</p>
