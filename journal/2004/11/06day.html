<p>I'm writing today about yesterday cause my computer was locked up;
occassionally after coming back from sleep mode, occassionally the
mouse doesn't respond.  I don't know if it's a hardware problem
(doubtful) or software (driver) problem.</p>

<p>After OM I went to the Apple Store in Ginza to have them look at
it, but I ended up waiting for over an hour (due to their new signup
in advance thing) and had to leave before I could talk to someone.  I
did, however, check my gmail from </p>

<p>oooh gotta go to sleep mode now.</p>

<p>made it</p>

<p>I checked my email from one of their computers, so the time was
productive, but still frustrating.  Now today I'm suprised that it's
working; gotta get this shit resolved, though.</p>

<p>Okay, so last night I went to Louise's play with Hitomi, and really
liked it; I went from loving the main character to feeling sorry for
her to being afraid of her.  Good skillz, Ellie.  Chose not to hang
out after and meet the cast.</p>

<p>Went home with Hitomi and she said she would leave by midnight, but
she didn't and we spent the night and I'm like, "this can't work; I'm
not getting my own shit done." and she's like, "we can change
together," and I'm like, "argh no; can't you see??"</p>

<p>And that's where it was left this morning after I had to zoom out
to come to work.</p>
