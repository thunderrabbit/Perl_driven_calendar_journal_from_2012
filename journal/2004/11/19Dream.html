<p class=dream>I was being led up a trail in the woods, so I could
ride my bike down the longest stretch and just zoooooom down at super
sonic speeds.  When we reached the top, we were actually inside a
mansion, at the top of a really long ramp.  I got on my bike inside
the mansion and looked down the ramp.  "Nooo way am I riding down this
with no brakes."  The ramp was gravely, and I didn't know how much
room I had at the bottom to slow down.  If only I knew that, it could
possibly be no problem to use no brakes.</p>

<p class=dream>"This is the top of the ramp," he said.  and basically
challenged me to not use my brakes as much as I wanted to.</p>

<p class=dream>I released the brakes and was just zoooooming down the
ramp and then turned down right down the hallway at a T intersection.
I had been like, "which way???" and he goes, "you're at the end of the
west wing; any way you choose goes down."  So I justs turned anway I
pleased, and ran down the steps in this beautiful mansion.  Well
dressed people were sometimes blocking the way, but I just deftly
avoided them.  Running down a spiral, two or three steps at a time,
fancy footwork to keep myself entetertained.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p class=dream>The people in the party didn't really know what to make
of me; was I sane?  a security breach?  an experiment gone wild?  They
didn't say anything to my directly, and no one interfered.</p>

<p class=dream>I got to the bottom, having soundly beaten everybody
who was coming down any of the steps or elevators at the same time
(though they were not racing me; I was just racing them) as my wild
descent, and heard the end of an art tour of the house.  There was a
painting on the 5th floor that had never been completed due to a
recession, and the family had run out of money and had to sell
everything.</p>

<p class=dream>I hadn't really noticed the painting; I had just run
by it.</p>

<p>"Stop and smell the paintings." ???</p>
