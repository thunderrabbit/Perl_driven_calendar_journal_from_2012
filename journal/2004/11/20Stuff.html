<p>I don't understand exactly what Hitomi is trying to tell me, but
something about what I told her when we first met in April.  Hmm.</p>

<p>In other news, four million quintarks delivered on a change dish is
funny.</p>

<p>In different news, I think I'm on a train that's about to get
passed by a fast train.  Past fast.  A train that, had I known this
line more completely, I would have gotten on in Yokohama.   But I
have a seat here.</p>
