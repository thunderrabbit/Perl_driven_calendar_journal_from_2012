<p>Crashed on my bed in like an upside down fetal position.  My hips,
back, neck, descendingly supported by the futon cover and janette's
blanket and my legs folded up over me, kinda.  I 100% zonked out that
way, and then woke to rearrange myself under said blankets flat on my
back with knees bent over a pillow.  Slept for about 2 hours and woke
up wondering if I had dreamt that Hitomi cooked.</p>
