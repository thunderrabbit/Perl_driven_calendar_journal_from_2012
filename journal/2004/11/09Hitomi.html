<p>Argh</p>

<p>Last time I hung out with Hitomi, I was like, [I can't hang out
with you as often anymore], and she was like, [can we talk about it
in your room?] and I'm like, [no], and she's like, [why?] and I'm
like, good grief Charlie Brown, because I just said no, and then I
relented and was like, [will you let me sleep?  I have to be up
early.]  "Of <em>course</em>" she said.</p>

<p>In English "Of course," and in Japanese "もちろん" she said.  Both
langugaes.</p>

<p>Subsequently she stayed overnight.  Gad.</p>

<p>The next night Fifty One minute Phone Call occurred, and in the end
I'm like, "I'll see you on the 20th," and she was like, "okay."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The next morning (yesterday) she texted me to apologize.  I didn't
respond.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This morning she texted me to ask if we could meet tomorrow after
I go to a movie with Satako.</p>

<p>I'm like, [no].</p>

<p>And she called me to plead her case.  "After tomorrow, I won't
meet you often."</p>

<p>"Noooooooooooooooooo."</p>

<p>How can I explain that if I saw her two days ago, and I see her
again tomorrow, that counts as "often."</p>

<p>"Not often," in a way, has started.  But texting me and calling me
every day does not feel like "not often" to me.  Stoppit!</p>
