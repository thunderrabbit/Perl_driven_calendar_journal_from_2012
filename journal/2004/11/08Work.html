<p>Not going to ride TJ Bike to work.  It will be 57 degrees with 20%
chance of rain on the way home.</p>

<p>Hiromi no-showed again today.  That's seven in a row for her.  I
doubt I'll see her again.</p>

<p>I went to my semi-local wireless hotspot near work during an empty
lesson and worked a bit on my site.  Had a problem with getting the
days to print correctly, and once I decided the printing code was
correct:</p>

<pre>
print HTML_OUTPUT join ", ", (sort keys %{ $list_of_days_per_year_month{"$year/$month"} });
</pre>

<p>I went to where the keys were being populated, and found the error
there after a little bit of debug via printing research. I had</p>

<pre>
                $dd = $_ =~ m!_?(\d\d)!;
</pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre>
                ($dd) = $_ =~ m!_?(\d\d)!;
</pre>

<p>So $dd was getting the value 1 (true) instead of the actual digits
I wanted.</p>
