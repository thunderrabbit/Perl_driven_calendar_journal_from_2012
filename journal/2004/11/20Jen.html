<p>Jen is feeling pooey today.  She's zonked out on the train, feeling
a little bit fluey.  Well, she's as zonked as one can be on a train
with people getting on and off and all the other commotion associated
with a verbally silent AM train in Tokyo.  Oh, except for the
announcer guy on the loudspeakers.  This guy is actually
understandable.</p>

<p>(wow; that includes that I can understand him, <em>but</em>, the
context is pretty well defined, plus they say the same stuff every
time.</p>

<p>Tetsuya is leaving for OZ in 4 days.  Jen thinks he's a bit
nervous.  We think he'll be fine.</p>
