<p>I've renamed all my wild skating adventures that were in ~/skate/
into ~/journal/ subdirectories.  Have custom 404 refreshes for all of
them so people who find the links via google will go to the
corresponding entry in my journal directory.</p>

<p>This is a step toward getting everything in my site auto-indexed.</p>

<p>It's really cold and I'm really hungry, but I *think* I can resist
going outside to get strawberry pudding, which is just what part of
my brain wants for brain candy.</p>
