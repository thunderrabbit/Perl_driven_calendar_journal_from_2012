<p>Oh, I need to add to the money influx list: Takako gave me lesson
fee plus transportation (for which I didn't ask, but am thankful) and
Ayana bought me a cranberry cheesecake thing from Starbucks yesterday
after she was late.</p>

<p>"I think I am the world record late today."</p>

<p>Funny Ayana.</p>
