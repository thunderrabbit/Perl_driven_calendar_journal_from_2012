<p>Japanese lesson was not as bad as I thought.  We chatted a bit
about Osama Bin Laden's recent speech; I was mostly able to express
myself in Japanese, but hardly accurately and definitely not
eloquently.  But definitely better than, say, when I arrived in Japan.
(especially considering the speech hadn't been given yet.)</p>

<p>For a variety of possible reasons, we looked at a couple of new
grammars that were not too difficult for me.  Even learned a new
counter: "satsu" さつ or 冊。</p>

<p>This was the day we met in the Starbucks in Nakameguro because
Ayana was working across the street from there.  Today the whipped
cream machine wasn't working properly, resulting in the staff trying
to tweak it in various ways that did not include filling it with more
product, and resulting in her saying in English, "I'm sorry," very
remorsefully and immediately following up with the standard, 
"ありがとうございます！" very genkily.  What a weird thing.</p>
