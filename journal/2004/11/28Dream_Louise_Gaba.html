<p class=dream>I was being interviewed for a job at Gaba.  I was on
the hot seat with all my peers watching.  Louise was one of the
leaders.  I was not given clear instructions on where to sit, etc, but
I figured it was all part of the test.  The first question was read,
"Which is vowels, given at the beginning of the lesson?" and then as
I was asking, "is this a grammatical quiz as well as a question?"
Louise interrupted, saying, "you read the wrong question," (not "you
read the question incorrectly"), and there was general chaos for a
bit cause someone else said something.  I found myself not able to
see the group, as Lousie kept blocking my view.  I finally got to say
my peace, "if there is an unintentional grammatical error in the
first quiz given to candidates for an English teaching job, I don't
want the job." and David was like, "blah blah blah" basically telling
me I was wrong.  I listened to his claim and I responded, "I hear
that you believe it is best if we do our best no matter what tools we
are given.  And I definitely agree with that.  But, (and I think
you'll agree with this) (*), I think that we can do better work if
our tools are better." but Louise was stretching her arms in front of
me again, blocking my view of the room.</p>

<p class=dream>(*) For some reason I said this parenthetical part even
though I as simultaneously thinking, "this is not appropriate to say!"
cause I was otherwise making a perfect I-statement as taught by my
mens' group, but I was still saying it, partially motivated by my
desire to test differences to see what worked best, like learning by
mutating things to see what worked best.</p>

<p>While writing this dream, I wonder about two things: 1) does this
represent that I let (my love of) women block my life task?  (Louise
blocking my view as I was trying to explain my point), and 2) I think
my life path should be something that computers cannot conceivably do
in the foreseeable future.  That means it won't be anything to do
with language (teaching (translating), writing).  I think it will be
something to do more with how the mind works, or with soul/spirit.(**)</p>

<p>Funny: I wrote "or with soup/" instead af "or with soul/" at
first.</p>
