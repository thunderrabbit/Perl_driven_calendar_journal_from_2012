<p>I hadn't dreamt about dinner.  Or if I did, my dream came true;
Hitomi cooked chicken, spinach, and mushrooms for me.  Soooo yummy.  I
told her they were the yummiest food I have ever had in Japan, being
careful to specify the country.  I could have said "outside Dallas,"
but she probably wouldn't have understood.</p>
