<p class=dream>In a big field with a fence around it. Sean, Bill, some
other guy, and I were throwing discs, practicing before a game of
ultimate.  Sean was his normal excellent catching and throwing self;
Bill was his normal throwing and catching self; I was doing relatively
well considering I haven't played in well over a year.</p>

<p class=dream>Bill threw a long toss that went past the fence, and I
was going to climb the fence and get it, but ultimately chose not
to.  The field effectively only had a fence on one side; the field
sloped up a gentle hill and I couldn't see any other fences.   There
were two trees widely spaced, and not close enough to cause concern
for collisions.</p>
