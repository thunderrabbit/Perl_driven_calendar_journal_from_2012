<p>Wow.  Hitomi gave me 2500 yen for Mimibike yesterday.  But I'm
still in possession of Mimibike.</p>

<p>Today Katrina gave me 3500 yen for the CD player that I loaned her
indefinitely.  She kept asking me about it and I kept not worrying
about it, but she apparently was more worried than I.</p>

<p>Yay influx!</p>
