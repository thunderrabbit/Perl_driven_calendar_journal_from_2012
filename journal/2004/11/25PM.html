<p>After looking at the interactive games on <a
href="http://www.zefrank.com/">zefrank.com</a> (some are really
good/cool), I took a phat nap in the afternoon.  Took a sinus capsule
before the nap and feel better after the nap, maybe
not-coincidentally.  I have a bit of a headache still, though.  I
stopped by a bike shop to get foot pegs for the back axel so Hitomi
and i can more easily ride Mimibike together.  I indicated with my
hand what I wanted, and he said, "stepu?" and I'm like, "hai" and he
said he didn't have any, but went on elaborately about something else,
possibly why he doesn't have them and/or where I can get some.</p>

<p>I went to the next bicycle-sales place (department store) and
indicated with my hand and asked for a stepu.  He was like, "??" and
went to another bike and did the <em>exact</em> same hand gesture and
asked, "stand?"  Yes, stand.</p>

<p>He was like, "Ummmmmmmmmmmmm" and I'm like, "do you have them?"
and he got his courage and said, "kochiwa, nai."</p>

<p>Thank you.  Okay.  And I rolled out.</p>

<p>Now I'm on the limited express train to Shibuya for my 7pm lesson
with Takako.</p>
