<p>Bought eggs, mushrooms, sausage, spinach and made a 5 egg omlette
including the above mentioned goodies.  Ate about half of it and have
the rest in storage.</p>

<p>Jackie was friendly to me, which was nice; I quit talking to her
after she was meaner than usual a couple weeks ago.  I think it must
have been a short term thing.</p>

<p>Now I'm headed to Shibuya to teach Takako and then meet Hitomi.</p>
