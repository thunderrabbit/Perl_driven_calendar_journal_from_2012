<p>Woke up after 6 or so hours of sleep.  Super tight shoulders and
neck.  Stood in the hot shower for about 20+ minutes while my laundry
was sloshing around in the cold washing machine.</p>

<p>Have just hung my clothes, just in time to go teach Sanami.</p>

<p>I wonder what it will be like today.</p>
