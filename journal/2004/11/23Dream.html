<p class=dream>There was a shower in the corner of the room, which a
window looking outside, a small refrigerator in the corner with milk,
orange juice, eggs, salad in it.  Benny and Carla were outside
talking in their coded way "did you see the angle of that item?"
"oh, yeah; he will talk to that car tomorrow."</p>

<p class=dream>They turned into Barbie and Charlie, outside talking
about sellling the pond; more like fighting about it.  Barbie didn't
want to sell it; there was a secret room of stuff through which she
wanted to rummage, and Charlie saw it as a way to make some money.  I
was in the corner of the living room trying to get some food, but the
refrigerator was too dark to see what I was eating if I was inside, so
I wanted to pull the shower curtain around me.</p>

<p class=dream>I realized that I just needed to start the shower and
just do it, instead of wondering why I couldn't.  Once the water
started spraying, I was able to make adjustments; move this paper out
from under the table, point the shower nozzle closer to down, so it
wouldn't spray on the living room carpet.</p>

<p class=dream>I rinsed off, then left the shower running while I put
some clothes on and went out to check on barbie who was on a couch
outside.  She was on vacation, and hadn't wanted to talk about the
pond, but Charlie brought it up.  I gave her some hugs and kisses to
help her feel better, and she thanked me.</p>

<p class=dream>I headed back to the shower, got back undressed, and
was sitting next to a guy so I got dressed again.  He was the manager
of a club down the street, and Barbie was commenting that two dollars
per person is okay, but a minimum of five people was a bit unnecesary.
I tried to explain this to him, but he was adamant, but willing to
make jokes about it, in the form of, "well, let's just cancel the
discount all together and just go back to the original price," or
"let's just close the club."</p>

<p class=dream>I added on to that, but I kinda messed it up.  "I'll
just burn it down tonight." and then to say I was joking, "Don't
worry, I'm not joking.  Wait, I messed that up.  I am just joking;
I'm not going to burn it down."</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was like, "say man, what's your name, anyway?"
cause I had thought he was Marcus from Gaba, but I realized he
couldn't be here (wherever we were) and he said his name was Marcus,
but actually it was Takayashi Makarusa or something, so he just
called himself Marcus.</p>

<p class=dream>I followed him upstairs to see how a manager/owner
goes about his day, and he first was asked to clean up vomit on the
top floor.  I was going to offer to do it, but I woke up.</p>
