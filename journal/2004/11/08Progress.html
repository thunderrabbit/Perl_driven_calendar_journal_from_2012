<p>I don't think I even mentioned that I broke up with Hitomi (again)
last night.  It was really hard; 51 minute phone call, including
Richard translating for me.  He didn't tell me much that I didn't
already know; a few details, but nothing major.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But the progress I'm talking about is with my website.  I'm close
close close to having slices of my journal available.  It's nice to
much more carefully understand the code (Fred wrote the intial, and
now all the regex stuff has been gutted.) and I'm excited about the
progress.</p>

<p>But now I'm ripping myself away to go buy food to cook for work
today.  Working hard to keep the bigger picture in mind.</p>
