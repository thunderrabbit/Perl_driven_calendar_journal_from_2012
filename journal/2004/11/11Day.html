<p>Thursday I had my 10am Chinese lesson with Riho, then went shoppin'
with Shoko for foodage.  We sang Oh Happy Day walking to and from the
shopping street.  Interestingly, we saw Riho in the 100 yen store.</p>

<p>I had to get back to get ready for my 4pm Chinese lesson with
Shufen, so we didn't dillydally a whole lot.  Took a shower and all
that and just as I was gonna go, I got a text from Shufen asking to
cancel the lesson.  I'm glad I hadn't gotten out the door.</p>

<p>So, I studied Japanese for just about an hour, which is good for
me, and I realized how quickly some things can leave the brain, but
how a little bit of review can help a ton.</p>

<p>Left a bit later to meet 郁美 and her friend ともこ in Shibuya at
ハチ子.  For an instant, after I saw 郁美 go up to some random woman,
I was surprised.  Oh.  That must be ともこ。</p>

<p>We zipped over to Starbucks where I've taken Japanese classes for
over the past year (except for the past 3 weeks (skipped once, then
twice in 中目黒)) and chatted for a bit.  Ikumi bought me a apple pie
type thing.  Mmmm.</p>

<p>Tomoko and I will meet there each Thursday night at 7pm for the
near future.  My first student at 4000 yen per hour.</p>

<p>Arrived home and watched the last 3/4ths (exactly that much) of
Austin Powers II.  We laughed.</p>
