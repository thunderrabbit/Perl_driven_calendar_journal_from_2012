<p>I rushed to catch the 10:40am limited express train to Shibuya,
making it with 3 minutes to spare.  I woulda had time to get my hat
and hoodie had I remembered them while I was close to the apartment.
It's a super sunny day right now, but it will be cold tonight when I
go home from work.</p>

<p>Daniel and Rick were late; they had taken a different line than
Yamanote; it is parallel to Yamanote in Shibuya, but its platform is
100 meters farther away from the main part of Shibuya.  So they got
off and promptly found some interesting buildings that they wouldn't
have seen otherwise, otherwise known as lost.</p>

<p>They arrived a bit later and we chowed at an Italian restaurant
that was in the area of another restaurant that piqued Daniel's
interest in his book, but we never found it, though I stopped for
directions at two police boxes.  This gave Daniel a sense of how wack
it is to find something given its address in Tokyo.  Rick didn't seem
as phased; maybe he already knew.</p>

<p>The restaurant included a shrine (in the toilet room) to all things
soccer, including a soccerball print toilet seat. and a Lego soccer
goal next to the sink.  Daniel got some pictures.</p>

<p>The meal was pretty great and filling, including delicious pumpkin
soup and some pudding dessert custard thing.  Daniel gave me half of
his.  Woo!!</p>

<p>We headed out with a plan in my head to walk to Harajuku station
and then train to Yoyogi and then Ginza on on eof those lines that I
think goes from Yoyogi to Ginza.  They wanted to see something in
Ginza, and I wanted to show Daniel the Apple Store.  We ended up
taking a taxi to save time, and he drove us to the Sony Building,
which is one thing Daniel wanted to see, so we scoped it and their
wares including a 2 megapixel camera the size of a a pakc of
shoelaces, weighing 5 grams..    It was $4000.  The guy was like,
"though it's 2 megapixels, the optics make it worthy of a 4 megapixel
camera."  Wow.  Or yeah right; I don't know which.</p>

<p>Rick was unimpressed with Aibo (or more unimpressed with the women
cooing and petting it to see its (non) reaction..  Walked away, "I
don't know why anyone would want one of those."</p>

<p>Reached the top, went to the bottom (should have gone one floor
lower) and then down into the subway where we could be led by the
exit signs to texit A13, which is next to the Apple Store.  Walked by
the Sony building on the way out, but  we hadn't wasted more than 2
minutes waiting for the light and walking the wrong way across the
tstreet to the train station entrance.</p>

<p>Apple Store didn't have any of my batteries in stock, but he
showed me  how I could buy it online, but said I couldn't do it from
inside the store for some reason.  Weird.</p>

<p>Rick and Daniel scoped the wares in Aple Store and then we headed
back downstairs into Ginza station where I set them out toward
Akihabara (where purchases will almost certainly be made) and I
headed toward work.</p>
