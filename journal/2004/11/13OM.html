<p>OM was pretty good today.  I got 500 yen extra change back, which
was weird cause there was a supervisor supervising the
transaction.</p>

<p>I gave Jen some printouts that ended up in my bag after they were
printed officially without having accessed the internet, for some
irrational fear that we're more susceptible to viruses and such if we
surf than if we're just connected.</p>

<p>(okay, yes, strictly speaking we are, but not much.)</p>

<p>Hitomi sent me two pictures with her phone; she's traveled
somewhere near a volcano and the area looks really interesting for
exploration.  I imagine I'll find stuff like that when TJ Bike and I
go rockin' around the country.</p>

<p>I've pretty much broken up with Mikiko, the cute genki pigtail
clerk at the convenience store across the street.  Jen pointed out
that I get too attached to people who are insignificant in my
life.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p>So I broke up with Mikiko.  Not that she ever knew we were an item,
or that we went anywhere or did anything together, including talk,
except I found out her name and her days off (which I've nearly
forgotten).</p>

<p>I studied Japanese today; rewrote a bunch of sentences that I had
written for homnework and then had Ayana's corrections added.</p>
