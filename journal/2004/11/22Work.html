<p>Got to work at 3pm and got caught up on email a bit and chatted
with Louise.  First lesson Mari chose me and we had fun checking her
awesome homework after I answered her questions of "what does
proelbmsw mean?" and "what does bno mean?"  Oh my god how unhelpful
some typists are.  "It means some people don't take care to proofread
their comments after they type them."  Second was a new student (who
had also chosen me) and we had equal fun.  Third was Mita who didn't
choose my lesson and who has made an amazing amount of progress for
having had 155 lessons.  I had her last lesson ever.  To keep myself
awake I acted as her waiter and took her order and brought her things
to represent food.  Pretty fun/funny-ish.  Fourth was Makiko who chose
my lesson and commented that she would choose my lessons more often
if she could find them, so I gave her a code to more easily look up
my schedule.  We had a fun lesson and played with "after that," which
I contrasted correct and incorrect usage.  "I lived in Japan for two
years.  After that I ate at a restaurant."  vs "I lived in Japan for
two years, and after that I rode my bicycle to Hokkaido."</p>

<p>After that, I went to the convenience store.  After that I lived
in Japan.</p>
