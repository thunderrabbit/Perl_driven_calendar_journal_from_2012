<p>Sanami was in a really pooey mood at first.  Her mom had apparently
forgotten I was coming; Sanami was still in her school uniform.  Two
older women were smoking and gossipping in the kitchen.  Bottles of
alcohol (gin & vodka, not beer) were in the living room.</p>

<p>I didn't present any new vocab for Sanami; we just colored at
first and then jumped around on the new floor mat.  Took apart some
of the shapes and put them back together.  Did in/on/under with the toy
cat and dog.</p>
