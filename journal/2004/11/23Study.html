<p>After a nutball wack full day of wackness in the
why-the-fuck-are-we-doing-this-to-each-other department, Hitomi and I
are going to Saizeria to help me study Japanese..</p>

<p class=date>2:20am JST Wednesday 24 November 2004</p>

<p>I'm really (*) happy with the amount of studying I did tonight.  We
had fun (!), too. I'm basically too tired to type it all here, but I
might do it anyway.  Gonna brush my toofs first, in case I fall
asleep while transcribing.</p>

<p>(*) I was going to say "I'm pretty happy," because I only studied
so well one time (tonight), but given that it could be the dawning of
a new era in studying, and I did all that studying in just one night,
I'm really happy.</p>

<p>(!) Both of us on Mimi Bike (me on the seat and Hitomi pedaling
lasted until we reached Bremendori), with me standing while pedaling,
and Hitomi on the seat padded with my stocking cap was pretty fun.  We
rode to Saizeria, an open-late Italian-esque Denny's style restaurant.
On the way back, I took us up and over the train tracks on the bridge
that appears it will soon be in direct conflict with the new elevated
train line.  However, it's possible the new elevated lines will stop
right at the bridge.  (But then why were they built there?  There's a
full switch yard right next door.)  Given the length, straightness and
elevation of the new lines that have been built from Kosugi right up
to that bridge, I think the bridge is doomed.  Maybe I'll get
pics.</p>
