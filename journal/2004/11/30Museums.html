<p>Went to Tokyo Photography Museum near Ebis with Daniel.  The
coolest thing was not aphotograph, but a sound wave visualizer that
had little syrofoam beads in a horizontal plastic tube and a speaker
box at one end.  The speaker played tones and the styrofoam beads
danced around in the  low pressure zones of the rarefactions (sp) of
the sound waves.  Awesome cool!  I got a video of it which I may put
on here.</p>
