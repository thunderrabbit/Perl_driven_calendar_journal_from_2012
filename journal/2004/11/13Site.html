<p>I've gotten a couple of 404 errors.  I think one was somebody
exploring but the other probably was not.  I haven't researched it
yet.  I need to add the HTTP_REFERRER to the items the 404 email
sends me. I thought I had already, but it doesn't seem to be there.
Could be misspelled.??</p>

<p>I worked a bit more on moving my Wild Skating Adventures into my
journal pages.  I'm really happy to have them both in chronological
order, and easily retrievable through the skate slice index.</p>

<p>When I'm on the train, and I think someone is watching me type, I
like to reach up with my left pinky and turn the screen off, then
keep typing.  My little way of being a hypocritical jerk, I guess.
Everyone in the world can read it when it's online, but *you* can't
read it now.</p>

<p>It's a little bit different because when it's online there's no
personal connection.  Interesting psychology could be explored
here.</p>
