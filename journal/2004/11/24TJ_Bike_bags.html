<p>I'm going now to get bags for TJ Bike.</p>

<p class=date>4:29pm</p>

<p>Got the bags.  The bags on the back need to be moved back a bit;
the back of my shoes hit them when I pedal.  But right now is not the
time for such adjustments.</p>

<p>Right now, I need to make some adjustments to the tension in my
neck and shoulders.</p>
