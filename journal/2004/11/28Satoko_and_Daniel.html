<p>Met Satoko after OM at Sakuragicho station.  She didn't really
want to rock out to Shibuya, but we went out there anyway cause it
was becoming apparent that I wouldn't be able to successfully guide
him to anywhere he could meet us in our area.</p>

<p>ChattyMcChat with Satoko on the train and then met Daniel at
Hachiko.  We chowed kaiten sushi, which Daniel had been craving since
the first time he came to Japan last week (and then went to Hong Kong
for a few days).  He did not like natto.  He was surprised to hear
that his bag would be fine; the staff just had us leave it on the
steps that led to the rarely used upstairs area.  "If they take your
bag; I'll buy your dinner."  "That's a 3000 dollar camera; that would
be a lot of sushi."</p>

<p>We chowed a lot of sushi (but well less than 3000 dollars worth)
and then went to Haagen Dahz for ice cream.  Woooo yum!  Satoko had
vanilla scoops with espresso, which I assured her I hated; Daniel had
as much chocolate toppings as possible given that no pure chocolate
ice cream was available.  I had cookies and cream, vanilla, banana,
custard pudding, and maybe something else.  Satoko said, "ぶたみたい"
(like a pig), which I thought was pretty funny.  I assured her that
since I had been in Japan longer than she (strictly speaking, this is
true) I could be trusted as more of an authority on the point that "ブー
ちゃんみたい" would be equally appropriate.  She didn't agree, but
she's only been in Japan for 2 months (since she got back from LA (for
a year, during which time she obviously forgot all her Japanese)).</p>

<p>We told Daniel a bit about the beautiful mustang Sally in LA, and
we told Satoko a bit about San Francisco.</p>

<p>Tired-time, so we headed back home where Satoko gave me excellent
advice about running around Hakone.  (Take Acti to Odawara; _______ is
the best sweets place in Hakone; and where to find the boiled eggs in
Hakone.)</p>
