<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<ol type='A'>
<li><p>I've gotten my navigation to allow slices of my journal to be
viewed.  Just finished that today after having been working on it
indirectly and directly for a few weeks, causing me to easily forget
about studying Japanese.</p>

<p>I still want to clean up the directory structure behind the
scenes and write a auto-navigation generator thing that will make all
the indices be automagical.</p>

<p>That's actually what I was working on when I realized the basic
logic I was using was more suited for my journal slices, which I had
planned to do afterward.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Millenium House near Motosumiyoshi in Tokyo Japan.
Jen from Perth, cute Shoko, Ikumi, Katrina, Riki are my most frequent
buds here.</p></li>

<li><p>I have TJ Bike, and Mimi Bike now, which I got from Louise de
Brisbane from Gaba work.  Mimi Bike is a little green road bike with
knobby tires and no suspension.  Hitomi named it.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitomi and I rode Mimi Bike and TJ Bike to Yomiuriland last
Wednesday.  I got to ride White Canyon for the first and second times.
First in the last car and second in the first car, from where I got a
video of the whole ride, though my camera was low on battery
power.</p></li>

<li><p>My camera is Canon IXY 30 (3.2 Megapixels) with 128Meg SD
memory card.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is still my PowerBook G4 with 30 Gig HD, 512 Meg
ram.  Recently I went to the Apple Store in Ginza and they replaced a
screw that was apparently causing the mouse to be locked on wake from
sleep, and reset the motherboard, which was supposed to fix the
battery.  The battery still doesn't last long, though it's not super
old.  They also fixed the spacebar, which I had seated incorrectly
when I cleaned the keyboard a couple months ago.</p></li>

<li><p>I have recently broken up with Hitomi (again).  She's been
calling me each day even so.  We are supposed to meet on the 20th,
and she wants to meet more often than that.  If she keeps calling me,
we will meet less often than that.</p></li>

<li><p>I still work at Gaba in Jiyugaoka and OM near Yokohama.  Gaba
schedule is 月、木、金 from 4pm to 7, then 7:45 to 10:45.  Sometimes
there are no-bookings during those times.</p>

<p>At OM I work with Jen 9am to 4:30 on Saturday and Sunday.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't studied Japanese in a while; I'm kinda losing
interest and was really sidetracked by my journal slicer, and
Hitomi.  I haven't studied Chinese hardly at all.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been riding TJ Bike to Gaba most days if it's warmish and
not raininig.  I haven't ridden him to OM.</p></li>

<li><p>At Gaba I don't really hang out with Jesse anymore; I barely
see him, it seems.  I more often just chat a bit with Roscoe or
Andrew.  Haven't seen Simon in a while; I think he must be on
vacation.  Louise has been working days instead of evenings, so I
haven't really seen her recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been somewhat in email dialogue with a guy who rode bikes
with his wife along a big trail that spans North America.  I'd like
for him to make a travelogue website for me like he did.  Turns out
his sister made his site, so I'll talk to her.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really seen Jimmy da Magnet a lot recently, but one
time: he came over to pick up his Saturday Night Live video and we
chowed dinner recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been in email touch with Fred a lot and Sara Farina from
UH and ColleenieBeanie from YRUU.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets, except Spot with Jennifer in
Houston.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't heard from Wende in a pretty long time.  Especially
not since I snailed her and her parents letters around her
wedding.</p></li>

<li><p>I gotta jet to work.</p>

<p>And by jet, I mean ride TJ Bike.</p>

<p class=date>4:36pm</p>

<p>According to my most recent experience, I can ride to work on TJ
Bike in 30 minutes without breaking a sweat.  I get a little bit
sweaty under my backpack, but I'm not counting that.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been asked to copy GTS 6 CD for Gaba.  A student lost her
copy.  I'm not getting any renumeration for it, but oh well.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have my keyboard for my Handspring Visor.  janette
said she found it and would send it to me once she got back from
Austin.  I think she's gotten sidetracked.  I may remember to
remind her soon.</p>

<p>I haven't been in touch with janette in a while.</p></li>

<li><p>I use gmail as my main email account thing.  Still
robnugen.com, but that sends it all straight to gmail.</p></li>

<li><p>I've learned about a9.com and clusty.com, but they still
haven't taken my interest away from google, the #1 search engine on
the planet.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm finding myself with very short temper for students who
don't try hard.  Yet I am such a student.  Or at least I see myself
that way.  Interesting.</p></li>

<li><p>When people ask me if I'm "still on track" for my planned
bicycle adventure, I tell them yes because it still seems so far away.
But I gotta get crackin' on getting camping gear and a GPS and a
reliable way to keep its batteries charged.  And I'd like to have a
video camera on my helmet..  plenty of work to be done.</p></li>

<li><p>I've got 400,000 yen in my local bank account, and $1500 in the
US.  Since Bush "won" again, and will likely continue to spend the US
into the biggest deficit ever, I am not sure that US currency is what
I want to have.  I'll keep my yen here.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't been out of Japan since I came in March 2003.
Wow.</p></li>

<li><p>I have basically given up on the idea of writing lots of
letters to my homies at home.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently (basically this month) I have been on a really tight
budget.  500 yen per day for food.  I've been cooking eggs, rice,
mushrooms, spinach, and sausage / gyoza.  Good stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>I have never been drunk nor done illegal drugs.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not done anything artsy in a while; my most recent
painting is still in Bell Wistaria in Tsunashima.  I never got the key
back after I loaned it to Dan; I dunno if I'll see that painting
again.  It was never officially finished; I just put it up on the wall
for storage while I didn't work on it.</p>

<p>I don't really have room in my room / life for it.  I could give
it to Hitomi I guess.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really exercised my arms recently.  I stopped doing
pushups (when?) and haven't really played frisbee since I've been
here.  Except once with Mutsumi, who I've not really been in touch
with since we hung out in Denny's.</p></li>
