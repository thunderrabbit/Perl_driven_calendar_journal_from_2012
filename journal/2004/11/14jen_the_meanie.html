<p>Jen, after saying, "I'll go home with you," was on her keitai the
entire time and jumped on the Express Train while I was gawking at the
escalator, wondering about its sleep modes.  It was moving slowly
until people got on; I wonder if it would actually stop if there were
no people on it for a longer while than apparently had passed
previously.</p>

<p>So I got to the bottom of the escalator and saw Jen was on the
train (behind closed doors) and smiling sheepishly on the phone.</p>

<p>Okay, I gotcha; just run off without me, eh?</p>

<p>There's pretty much no way for me to catch her, given the way the
trains run.</p>
