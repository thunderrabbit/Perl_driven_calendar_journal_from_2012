<p>Took the train home to Motosumiyoshi and realized I had left
Mimibike (my little green bike that I bought for 3000 yen from
Louise) at Musashikosugi last night.  Argh.  I didn't want to risk
leaving it *another* night, so I walked over there to get it.</p>

<p>On the way past Musashikosugi station, a woman came up to me,
"massage?  massage?" and I was like "no" and just walked by.  Then I
remembered the funny game of accepting and trying to give a massage to
the woman.</p>

<p>Got to where I had left Mimibike and found a scooter.  No Mimibike.
I'm 90% sure this is where I locked her to the fence.  The fence was
not cut; my chain must have been cut, or my lock was picked.</p>

<p>Crapdogs.</p>

<p>I didn't kick anything, but I thought about it.</p>

<p>On the way back past the massage offering woman, she asked me
again, "massage?" and I was like, "okay" and reached for her
shoulders.  She was like, "okay" and I massaged her for about 2
seconds before she turned around and said "thank you, now come inside,
3000 yen for half hour,"</p>

<p>And I just ignored her and was like, "私の自転車はどこですか。" and
she said, "I don't know.  Only 3000 yen and you will feel better."</p>

<p>"no no no; it will cost me 3000 yen to get it back; I ain't got no
money."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I told Hitomi that if she could get Mimibike back, she could have
her.  (Hitomi could have Mimibike)</p>
