<p>Nearly at Motosumiyoshi station now.  Then I'll ride Mimi Bike home
and switch to TJ Bike and..  wait-a-minute..  I should ride Mimi Bike
to the bike place and get some new brakes. </p>

<p>I chose to ride TJ Bike, just in case he needed to be measured.
Good thing, cause he did.  The bags we ordered are pretty similar to
the ones I had ordered before.  I think it will all be good.</p>
