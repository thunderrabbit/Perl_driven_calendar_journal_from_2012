<p>I got a good idea on the way home today: walk around the block with
Ikumi while I learn vocabulary, and she learns her neighborhood.  She
believes she is super bad at directions, so we walked around the
block, she taught me everything in Japanese, and therefore she had to
look at things carefully.  We both benefitted and both want to do it
again sometime.</p>
