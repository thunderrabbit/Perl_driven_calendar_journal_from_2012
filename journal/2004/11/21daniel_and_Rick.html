<p>After work, grocery shopping, falling asleep, I received a phone
call from Daniel.  Their plane had been delayed 2 hours.  He wasn't up
for meeting me at Hachiko "after all [they] had been through," getting
from Narita to their hotel.  And I didn't feel like waking up, *but*,
I realized I would definitely wish I had gone out there if I didn't,
so I did.</p>

<p>And, had big fun.  Got to see a band playing near Shinjuku HALC
building; they were two harmonizing female vocalists, a dude on
guitar, and a lot of backup synth.  Gelado was their name, I think.
They were playing near the courtesy shuttle bus stop, and I took the
courtesy bus to their hotel from their when it arrived.  I wonder how
far one could get by riding courtesy busses around the city!!</p>

<p>HI Rick nice to meet you, big hug to Daniel, great to see you.  It
was a bit thinking about raining, so we took a taxi from their hotel
to Hachiko, but I recognized part of SHibuya before we arrived so to
save taxi fare, I was like, "this is cool" BUT, we ended up at a
pretty expensive restaurant that served <em>presentation</em> more
than food.  Ah well.  I still got enough to eat; Rick wasn't down with
thin slices of raw beef with mayonnaise drizzled across.</p>

<p>Walked to Shibuya's Times Square and I showed them Hachiko.  There
was a band playing.  They were wailing guitars and a vocalist and
synth drums, and a lot more popular with the crowd (may have also been
the time/location) but less popular with us; Daniel headed across the
street to some place I had never been, but it turns out I had just
never been up that escalator; I <em>had</em> been up where the
escalator finished, which was the Inokashira line in Shibuya
station.</p>

<p>They were pretty beat after such a long flight and jet lagged, so
we headed back to the hotel via Yamanote and much cheaper taxi.</p>

<p>Hung out with Daniel and talked to him about his art (cool big
photos printed on canvas!!???!!) and then I headed home, arriving on
nearly the last train.</p>
