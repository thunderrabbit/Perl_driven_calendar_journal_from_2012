<p>Went to Shibuya with Daniel after my work tonight.  He had met a
guy, or the guy had met him, wanting to find English speaking friends.
We asked him where we could find yamamba girls, and we ended up in
Harajuku, but none were in sight.  Daniel did get a picture of some
cats and of some girls' huge rings.  Our friend told us that
costume-play people gather in the area on holidays.  That's a bonus
bit of information.</p>

<p>Walked back to Shibuya area, and our friend bowed out on the way
back.  Found a much more happenin' area and got some pictures of
people both with and without consent.  Jen calls them monsters, but I
call them cute.</p>
