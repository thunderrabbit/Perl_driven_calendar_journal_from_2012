<p>Hung out in Dean (and Shoko's) room with them and Jeff playing
video games tonight.  Started with Halo 2 (my first time to play and
I have *NO* idea why people get <em>addicted</em> to that game) and
then did a car driving game (weak compared to the Grand Theft Auto
series) and then Tekken on Playstation.  I just hit random buttons,
sometimes with the controller upside-down to let different fingers do
the tapping.  Did pretty well with the character Christie (apparently
the one "every beginner uses") against the others, but didn't
actually win overall.  Still had fun.</p>

<p>But, now my clothes smell like smoke.  Nighmare.</p>
