<p>Ikumi never came down, but Daniel and I went down to Jen's room
and chatted while the end of _Life of David Gale_ was finishing on
Jen's VCR while she was officially packing for her trip home
tomorrow.  She assured us that she only panicpacked (I brought the
term over from Maggie and Molly from UH days) and wouldn't really be
packing tonight.</p>

<p>I learned about Jen's sister Karen's three world trips, about
Daniel's secret to staying alive during The Running with the Bulls in
Pamplona (he's been three times and has all his bodyparts intact),
and about how Jen's someone's parents killed themselves after 54
years of marriage when they were terminally ill.</p>

<p>The movie ended and Daniel and I headed up to let Jen sleep; I
saw Daniel off at his room and wrote this.</p>
