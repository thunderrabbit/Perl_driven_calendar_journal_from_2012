<p>First lesson with Takako went well; she was on time, thought she
said she got lost. getting to Starbucks.  The lesson went slowly at
first; the first 7 minutes took 20 minutes, but then she asked me some
more interesting questions and it went rather well after taht.  The
rest of the hour lesson took like 30 minutes it seemed.</p>

<p>Ayana texted me druing the lesson; she wants to meet at 12:pm
tomorrow instead of 10am.  Cool with me; I hate getting up so early.
Maybe I'll get some studying done before the lesson.</p>

<p>Hitomi was in Starbucks after that, so we hung out after the
lesson.</p>
