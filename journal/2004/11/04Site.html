<p>Today I pretty much spent the entire day working on my site.  Got
some visible (behind the scenes, therefore invisible) progress done
on viewing various types of journal entries.  I've decided to forego
the idea of maintaining the same directory structure for all my old
crizap; I'm going to smurf it into a new structure that (for now) I
like better.   I'm starting with my Wild Skating Adventures; the
first five have been moved to my journal.  1993, 1994.</p>

<p>I'd like to put pics up from yesterday, but I haven't yet.  I'm
too tired to do it now.  Japanese lesson (for which I've hardly
studied (two weeks!!!!)) is tomorrow at 10am.</p>

<p>I'm not feeling arghy about that; I'm just like, meh.</p>
