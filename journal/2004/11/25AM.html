<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>My nose is itchy and clogged and runny.</p>

<p>My neck hurts like crap.</p>

<p>It's coldish (yet sunny) outside.</p>

<p>When my sinuses are all wack like this, I don't like to talk.  At
any moment snot might just start pouring out like a snot faucet.
Ick.</p>

<p>For this reason, when I met Riho for our English/Chinese exchange,
I made it an English/English give.</p>

<p>I can imagine a future where I'll want to actually do something,
and for that future, I was able to make it to the store to buy
groceries (10 eggs (no dozens), spinach, pre-cooked sausages) plus
non-janette-quality strawberry pudding/custard snack.</p>

<p>And I can imagine a future where it's realllly cold in my room, so
I refilled my gas heater with 600 yen worth of kerosene.  Way cheaper
and more efficient than electricity.</p>
