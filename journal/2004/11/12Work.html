<p>Had four lessons at work today, including beautiful Mai and two
relatively high level women, one genki and interesting, one the
opposite, and one other student who I can't think of right now.</p>

<p>Mai was a late show today.  I was reading Andrew's copy of Bill
Bryson's universe for laymen book.  Pretty good I think.</p>

<p>Chatted with Kobayashisan after work; he's my bicycle guardian who
hangs out in Jiyugaoka.  Rode home without incident until I was nearly
home and had to hit my brakes hard when a guy on a bicycle with his
girlfriend on back suddenly turned where I planned to be soon
thereafter.</p>
