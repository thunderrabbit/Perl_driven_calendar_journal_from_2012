<p>Hung out with Hitomi after lesson with Takako.  We chowed at a
kaiten sushi place and then tried to get ice cream at Haagen Dazs,
but it was closed.  The other nearby ice cream place was similarly
closed, except its sign said the open hours were until 10:30, and it
was only 10:16 by my clock.  yarg.</p>

<p>We went back to Shibuya station and chilled on a ledge (by a cold
window, hence the chilling) and she gave me a lovely tea mug with a
2005 calendar on it, and some sweets and some othe sweets; yummy
yummy!  We talked about us and stuff and what boundaries are okay,
and I was impressed with her ability to resist.  It seems she isn't a
little helpless neko at all.  We'll probably hang out on Saturday the
27th with Teddybear Tomoko, and if not, then we may visit camping
supply stores in Tokyo.  It would be cool to start getting some of my
campiing stuff together.  The bags for TJ Bike should be here within
a week.</p>

<p>We moved to an empty picture booth (as opposed to all the full
ones around, right?) and chatted more.  I think I understand her, but
not 100% sure on that.</p>

<p>Said bye.  Somehow we said bye and are going to our separate
homes.</p>
