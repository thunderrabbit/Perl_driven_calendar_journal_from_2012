<p>Got a 404 email via a Houston Skate group website link.  Designed a
way that my 404 code can refresh to new links if it can tell where the
user wanted to go.</p>

<p>There are now links to updated versions of Wild Skating Adventures
00, 01, and 02.</p>

<p>and a general redirect to my skate journal entries for the rest.</p>

<p>But right now I've got to get off the computer and get some
foodage.</p>
