Seagate Ships World's Largest HD

How does 400GB in your PC sound?
 
  November 17, 2004

Seagate Technology today announced that it has shipped the world's
largest PC hard drive to various retail outlets. The Seagate Barracuda
7200.8 hard drive is now available in a 400GB variant, plenty enough
for all your por-, err, data.

The drive is also first to store 133GB in a single disc platter, with
three making up the drive. The dense discs allow Seagate to use less
discs and less heads to make up the total capacity of the drive,
making for faster performance and reliability.

The Barracuda 7200.8 uses Seagate's native Serial ATA interface
technology with NCQ (native command queuing) for speeds that rival a
10,000-rpm SATA drive.
