<p>I was going to write something about this morning, but I can't
remember what.</p>

<p>I may start using my handspring visor to write journal entries;
(gotta find my collapsable keyboard first) to practice for my
adventure.</p>

<p>Oh, I remember.</p>

<p>Charyl suggested that I look up Garvin GPS, and I therefore found
<a href="http://www.pfranc.com">pfranc.com</a> which seems to be a
site hosted by a guy who knows about custom hardware and helping
people and GPS.  I wrote to him to see if he can give me ideas/input
for a low power GPS thing.</p>
