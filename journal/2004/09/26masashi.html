<p>Had my last lesson with Masashi tonight.   Well, the last
scheduled lesson before he goes to New Jersey for 6 months and then
Chicago for 18 months.</p>

<p>We walked to Tsutaya after that because I wanted to show him the
movie Suicide Circle.  We had talked about scary movies during our
lesson.</p>
