<p>*just* made the train today; I was up late last night going through
my handspring visor's memory, removing lots of stuff that had been
designed as steps to do to get me to Japan.  Oh, and jobs to look for
when I was jobless in Houston.  I removed all of those; I'm in Japan
and I don't need a job in Houston.</p>

<p>This morning I bought 11 tickets for the price of 10 that will get
me to Yokohama from Motosumiyoshi.  And back.  Woah; those will be
good for a while, since I only go 2 times per week.  I think they're
overkill to get me to Shibuya.</p>

<p>Yesterday (I just remembered this while I was considering writing,
"I think it's time for a State of My Life Address," and then how it
would look with that text and then the next text line would be the
same, but in H1 font), I was taken by a couple on a train.  Taken by
the heart.  They had an infant between them, and he was blissfully
sucking his thumb, flopped over on his dad's lap, and patting/pawing
his mom's arm (like a kitten nursing).  He woke himself up from this
state and (oops I gotta get the train soon) was blissfully flopping
around between them, with full attention from both parents.</p>

<p>We arrived at Yokohama, or were arriving at Yokohama when the mom
had to get up, carrying the baby.  As the train's acceleration shifted
non-uniformly, she lost her balance toward me, and certainly could
have recovered, but with her precious cargo, I thought it would be
okay to help insure she was okay.  I put my hand up and kind blocked
her shoulder, giving her some support, and she regained balance
easily.  (It was a simple gesture and I offer this support routinely
to people who are tipping toward me on the train.  Usually they
recover before contact is made, and usually (therefore) they never
know I have offered such support, especially since it happens most of
the time to peole who are tipping backwards as opposed to forwards,
for people more readily recover from forward-tilting moments than
backward-tilting moments.)  After the train fully stopped (a few
seconds later) she said, "thank you for helping me."</p>

<p>"No problem."</p>

<p>And bang; I was gone out the door, wondering if it would have been
useful to say something else, quickly discounting any variants of
"take care (of yourself/your baby)" and settled upon a variant of
"thank you for taking care of your baby."  So I sent her a mental
postcard in e-mail (ether-mail).</p>

<p>I think it's time for a State of My Life Address.</p>

<p>oops, gotta get the next train.</p>
