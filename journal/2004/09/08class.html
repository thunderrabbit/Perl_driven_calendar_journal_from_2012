<p>Class with Mika was fun, which is good because she said she read
my site, and I'd hate to have to write that it was crap and have her
read it.</p>

<p>She's a genki fun girl who is interested in skydiving and surfing,
but hasn't been skydiving.  Same as me, but I haven't done either one.
We chatted about cool activities such as bicycling across China and I
showed her the promotional magazines that I got from various bike
shops.  I'm getting closer to locked onto a bike that I like.</p>

<p>Should be able to get it and bags and gear for around 100,000
yen.  (~ $1000 US)</p>

<p>Now I'm rocking over to Masashi's house in Okurayama to chow; he
invited me there to meet his family and I feel honored.</p>

<p>I'm not well dressed though, but I'm not too worried about it.  I'd
rather be relaxed than make other people uncomfortable for not being
as well dressed as me.  Like that ever happens.</p>
