<p>Hitomi is upset tonight, but I don't know why.  If it's because of
something I've done, then I'll be very interested to know if it's
something that I could agree would be worth being upset at me about.
That's a weird sentence.  I'm tired.</p>

<p>Just gossipped with Jen, Ikumi, Shoko and Amanda downstairs.
Amanda has just moved in from OZ with a girl named Katrina I think.
She (Amanda) also has a job at Gaba (in Shinjuku), which is pretty
cool that she got that job instead of a crap job at Nova.</p>

<p>Talked to Ikumi a bit about website design and Jen expressed
interest in designing websites and Ikumi was all encouraging and I was
all quiet thinking, "website design ain't easy as eating pie."  But I
don't want to quelch any simmering ideas.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that's like, <em>if you won't talk about it,
we are done.</em></p>
