<p>I'm not impressed so far with nomonthlyfees.com.  They seem really
unprofessional with typos and writing style in general.  I tried to
ssh to my account, but ssh wasn't enabled.  When I asked them about
it:</p>

Hello.

Due to the recent HACK ATTEMPTS, Flooding of our network, Server
Defacements, etc., we have been forced to TIGHTEN our security for SSH
ACCCESS.

FOR SECURITY PURPOSES, your account will need to be moved to one of a group
of SPECIAL MACHINES where we will group many SSH USERS together, so that we
can monitor more closely the activities of the SSH SESSIONS, etc. and so
that we can BETTER/FASTER defend against the HACKING and FLOODING, etc.

IN ORDER TO HAVE SSH ENABLED ON YOUR ACCOUNT YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING (FOR
SECURITY REASONS THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS):

GO TO THIS URL, and FAX A COMPLETED FORM TO 909-888-4269

<a href="http://nomof.com/SSH_authorization_FAX.htm">http://nomof.com/SSH_authorization_FAX.htm</a>

INCOMPLETE OR INCORRECT FORMS WILL BE DISCARDED!!!

Thanks.

Joseph

<p>I mean jeez, don't they know writing in all caps is considered yelling?</p>

<p>I had asked Charyl if they have ssh and she's like yeah, so I've
asked her to handle this form; I'm not going to fax it to them from
Japan.</p>
