day at Fujikyu Highland.  We didn't get to ride a million rides; the
lines were just long enough to make them uncomfortable, except for the
weakest rides.  The new ride, called <a
href="http://www.fujikyu.co.jp/fuji-q/attra/tonde/index.html">Tondemina</a>
is pretty good, but not awesome.  It should do full 360 vertical
rotation.  And it should last longer in any case.  It seems I didn't
take a photo of it; just video.  It's basically a disk hanging from a
spindle.  Like an upside down version of a plate spinning on a stick.
50 people sit facing outward and it turns and then the pendulum swings
about 270 degrees total.  I was more intrigued by the physics than by
the action.  It seems that the disk spins more quickly at the top of
the pendulum swing.  I wondered if the disk was slowed by the
rotation, or if the motor slows it down due to the difficulty of
revolving a disk perpendicular to its direction of rotation, or if it
was an optical illusion.</p>

While wating in line for Fujiyama, we saw some people filming an ad
for Dodonpa.  The woman in pink, second to right, was frantically
wailing about when Dodonpa whizzed by on the track overhead, trying to
pull her friend to it.  I don't know why they're making ads for
Dodonpa.  It's over a year old.  Maybe people are noticing that it's
too short, and not worth the wait.</p>

<p>We did the haunted house.</p>

<p>While waiting in line for the haunted house, we got to see people
come out of the exit.  80% of them were screaming / running out.  The
rest were noticeably disturbed, if not flat scared.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/004fujikyu/heels.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/004fujikyu/thumbs/heels.jpg" align="left"></a> I
noticed something strange.  About 10 percent of the women coming out
of the haunted house were wearing high heels.  I know I've lived in
Tokyo for a while, but it still just freaked me out.  <em>Dude; in a
haunted house, dark, possibly scary: wear some footwear that will let
you run!</em>  Then I was like, <em>dude!  You're in Fujikyu Highland!
It's an amusement park!  not Fujikyu High-heel land!</em></p>

<p>We went through the house and it was only vaguely scary 1 time.
Most times it was just boring with scary guys jumping out after we
walked by.  Hitomi hung on my arm, trailing behind, which is perfect
for the guys cause they know who is the most scarifyable.  Hint for
people who are scared: go first.  The cool thing is that a couple of
guys commented that I was funny, cause I was making animal noises by
Hitomi's request.  We walked through the different paths in the
building, and possibly went through all of them.  There were no places
that were pitch black, and no really scary visuals.</p>

<p>A few of the actors played people who were distrautfully unable to
wolk, but tried in a crippled-looking falling manner.  One guy was
sitting in a wheel chair, not moving until Hitomi got close.  He
reached his hand slowly out toward her.  I reached my hand out toward
his hand and we barely touched fingertips, like a too-cool-for-school
giving of five.  Funny.</p>

<p>At the entire end of the whole thing, I saw the exit.  We had just
walked through a room that had a bunch of "bodies" hanging in burlap
sacks, and then through a room with dead/dying bodies on an array of
beds.  The bad guys crept up on us, and I was like, "寝ていい？"　[is
it okay if we sleep here?] but he just said, "see you, punk rock!"
which seems to be the only English he knew.</p>

<p>Then I saw the exit and I was like, "that's it?" and wanted to go
back through to see if there was anything scary we had missed.  The
guys were all crowding us out, though; no going back.</p>

<p>Emerged outside where everyone in line was watching the exit for
screaming escapees.  I gave the tilting-hand "so so" sign.</p>

<p>One guy goes, "wowwww" and a few people gasp / clapped!!  Wow is
right!  I didn't expect that (or any) response!  Well, that's not
true, I hoped for a response, but that was more than I expected.</p>

We rode HamuHamu Kingdom after that.  It was cute, and I tried to
imagine riding it when it was Birdmen.  After that, we rode the log
ride, and I got a bit gooshed by water, but not terribly so.</p>

<p>The 3D scary sound thing was weak.  Fun were the gocarts and the
little 100 yen kiddy thing.  I wondered how much trouble I would get
if I picked it up and rode it outside its little barrier.  That would
be hilarious!</p>

<p>Here's us on the gocarts, photos taken while driving:</p>

the way to our hotel, I found a flower and tried to call janette, but
the connection was bad.</p>
