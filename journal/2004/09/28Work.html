<p>Also yesterday at work, I had Makiko, who is equally beautiful,
well, she's really pretty and beautifully made up. I should get a
picture of us on here.  I have a little picture, but not a big one
that will begin to show what I mean.</p>

<p>Anyway, she's beautiful (and married (sigh)) and she likes my
lessons enough that she chose my lesson specifically so she could
review for the test that she'll take on Friday.  She wants to have her
picture taken with me when she passes the book on Friday.  So she's
chosen my lesson again for this Friday.  Nice.  Really a stroke for my
teaching ability.</p>

<p>Today at work I have two lessons and one student: Hiromi, who
always chooses my lessons.  We speak in half Japanese and half
English; now that I've stopped trying to teach her, the lessons are
quite enjoyable.  When I was all worked up about actually having her
make some progress, it was a nightmare.</p>

<p>After the two lessons with her, I'll meet Mutsumi at 9:15 at
Denny's.</p>
