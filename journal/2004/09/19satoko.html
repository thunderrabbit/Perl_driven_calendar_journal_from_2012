<p>Hung out with Satoko and her friend Takako, both from KQ Kawasaki
Nova.  Satoko has just returned from a year in Cali (near Sally) and
this is the first time I've seen her since then.  We went to
Jonathan's for dinner and then hung out at my house with Hitomi for a
bit because Satoko is looking for a place to live.  I suggested my
building because there are plenty of people with whom she can speak
and maintain her English.</p>

<p>I didn't remember Takako when I first saw her, but during the
night, I began to recall her as being a very quiet student.  I was
like, "I remember you!  You never said anything!" which might not be
very supportive of her English progress, but she didn't seem to
disagree with my claim.</p>

<p>She and Hitomi spoke Japanese very quickly.</p>
