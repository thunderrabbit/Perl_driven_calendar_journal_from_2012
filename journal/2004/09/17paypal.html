I feel angry.

I don't think my email was read.

My credit card was issued in the United States.  My credit card bank
(MBNA) is in the United States.  After my credit card was issued in
the United States, I moved to Japan.  My credit card company,
providing good customer service, allowed me to change my address to a
Japanese address so that I could receive my US-issued credit card
statements from a US company (MBNA) in Japan.

I am a US citizen.  My credit card bank is a US bank.  My credit card
was issued in the United States.  I moved to Japan.  My credit card
company understands that people move.  Why can't paypal understand?

After my credit card was issued in the United States, I moved to
Japan.  After that, my credit card expired, as credit cards do.  My
credit card bank, (MBNA), located in the United States, sent me a
credit card with an updated expiration date.  The updated credit card
has the same account number as the previous one.  It's for the same
account.  That account, as mentioned before, was opened in the United
States.  The credit card for that account was issued in the United
States.

Now.  If, after all of the above is read, including the intentional
repetitions to drive the point home, paypal cannot figure out that I
am a US citizen with a US-issued credit card with a Japanese mailing
address, I am going to do the following things:

1) be very mad at Paypal, and post mean things about paypal on my website.
2) ask my credit card company to change my billing address to the United States.
3) be mad at Paypal as I update my credit card information with a new expiration date and a US address.
4) ask my credit card company to change my credit card address to Japan.
5) complain about Paypal some more.

Just because you have a monopoly on this idea of sending money online
does not mean that you can continue to maintain the monopoly and
provide poor customer service.

I'm sorry to dump all this on the person reading this email.  I doubt
my complaint is based on something you did personally.  I hope you
have a nice day.
