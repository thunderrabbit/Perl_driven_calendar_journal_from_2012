<p class=dream>A guy who sometimes got into shady business deals
approached me with what he said was a great business deal.  He told me
to choose a number, and to write it down.  I was testing him: "Now
when *I* am asked to choose a number, I choose stuff like," I decided
to go easy on him, "negative four.  Is that okay?"  He didn't flinch,
so I was like, "sometimes I choose pi.  Or two pi."  I decided not to
get into the imaginary numbers; if he wanted me to do any kind of math
with the number, I wouldn't be able to.  "Okay, and multiply it by
nine.  Now add three."  I'd have 9i + 3. Okay, okay, okay.  I went
inside wrote out the number "seven" and the digit "7" on a piece of
paper.</p>

<p class=dream>Came back out.  He was like, "okay, I have a roll of
stickers here.  Find the one that has your number on it."</p>

<p class=dream>"It's the first one."</p>

<p class=dream>"Oh, you can find another one if you want."</p>

<p class=dream>I found a sticker labeled seven.  It had a dollar
amount on it: "$505,284,837,956,149,420"</p>

<p class=dream>"Okay.  I will give you that dollar amount."</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "are you sure?  That's a big number."  I
verified again that receiving this amount of money would make me the
wealthiest person in the world.  "hundred, thousand, million, billion,
trillion, quadrillion."  Yep.  I could pay off the US Treasury debt
thousands of times over.  I could build a house with a swimming pool
on the moon.  I could afford a bigger apartment in Tokyo.</p>

<p class=dream>We were sitting out on the front porch, and he had
stacks of ten thousand yen notes.   Some people walked by and we
kinda covered up the cash, and I was like, "hey man, if you just give
me 10 million dollars, I wouldn't care that it wasn't the 500
quadrillion."</p>

<p class=dream>He admitted that would be easier for him to come up
with.</p>

<p class=dream>I was smiling bigtime, and just really thankful that
the universe had provided for me.  I intended to put the 505
quadrillion sticker in my scrapbook; "this was the moment my life
changed," etc.</p>

<p>I woke up, and I felt really let down.</p>
