<p>Mostly messed around on internet today.  Downloaded a few hundred
megs of porn and took an hour nap.  Verified that Misaki plans to
actually come to our lesson today; she cancelled the last 3 of 4
lessons, but said, "yes sure" when I texted her phone, "will you come
to our lesson today?"</p>

<p>After her response I wondered, <em>do you want to come to our
lesson today?</em> cause I don't really.  The 2 hours may go like
molasses; I'll see what I can do about enjoying it more than doing
situps.</p>

<p>Wow... two hours of situps would kill me.</p>

<p>Looking at seti@home, I see that my Thunder Gaba account is
averaging 40+ workunits per day.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Oh, also today I played <a

Funnel</a> to which I was led when I went to play <a

Penguin.</a></p>

<p>My train is here in Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>Now I am here in Shinjuku for the lesson.</p>

<p>It wasn't terrible.  There was lots of silence while she dug
through her book humming and hawing for something to say.  I was
patient and closed my eyes for part of it.</p>

<p>The best part though; she signed as completed the four hours worth
of lessons that she cancelled over the last month.  I'll get paid for
them though they didn't happen (though in one case I had already
arrived in Shinjuku when she cancelled.)  Anyway, I didn't confirm my
plan with her, but I may give her 1/2 of my pay for those four
lessons.  If I can do it via paypal I will.</p>
