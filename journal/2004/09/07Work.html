<p>Today at work I had a no show during which I talked to Misato, the
woman who knows French well and wants to volunteer in Sudan.  She's
currently not allowed to volunteer there, though; conditions are not
safe enough to ensure a high likelihood of her survival.</p>

<p>Before that time, I set up three computers to run setiathome.  The
machines are kept running all the time.  I didn't set up a cron job;
I'll just check them periodically.  Actually I should set up a cron
job on my machine to see if I can do it, and if I have to, I'll do it
on other machines.  My <a

shows it should finish in about 3.5 hours per machine.  3 machines
will churn out <a

results per day.</p>

<p>Wow.  That's exciting enough to make me want to commandeer more
computers.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Six lessons today.  All of them blue.  (Blue is the color of the
text on the computer when students choose our lessons specifically.)
Three no-shows today.  50% no-shows and all blue lessons is amazing!
I've never had that happen before.</p>

<p>I used the time to read about NASA (all the orbiters seem to have
sustained no damage during the storm that ravaged Florida) and do
email and get a total of four computers to look for aliens via
setiathome.</p>

<p>And I checked my email about 100 times.</p>

<p>Kimie, who chose my lesson so she could do her level up test with
me, did well on her level up test.  Not the best test ever, but, as
usual, I didn't grade nicely.  Even though she is nice.</p>

<p>There is bigtime wind outside.  I don't know if it's raining or
not, but it's exciting.</p>

<p>Oh, I also finished Michael Moore's _Dude, Where's My Country?_,
which I recommend.  Gotta turn the US around and quit being led to war
by Bush in search of cash.</p>
