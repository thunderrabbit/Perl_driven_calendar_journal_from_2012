<p>Yummmmmm dinner at Masashi's house!  Met his wife again and her mom
and we had a great time with an elaborate spread of 手まきsushi.  (手
= て = te = hand, and まき = maki = seaweed paper) so make it yerself
by hand sushi rolls.  Super delicioso and quite a fun time had by all.
Talked a lot about my upcoming bicycling adventure (with questions in
the back of my mind wondering if I'll be able to do it, and definitely
appreciating talking about it and making it real) and a bit about
Masashi's upcoming adventure in Chicago.</p>

<p>I was perfectly dressed to fit the occasion, and at the end of the
meal I tried to convince Masashi that it's a good idea for him to
help with the dishes.</p>

<p>Their apartment is in a cool building with 8 floors, but the
elevator only visits floors 1, 5, 8.  Wow.</p>

<p>We used the stairs, which visit each floor.</p>
