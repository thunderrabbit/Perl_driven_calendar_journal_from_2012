<p>I got to chat with Sally last night!  She was feeling blue with all
the hard work she's been doing over the past years, which seems to be
amounting to a whole lot of nothing.  I totally know that feeling; I
was glad to have the opportunity to listen to her pain.</p>

<p>She's doing some kick ass stuff, too!  Teaching drum lessons,
working to get paying drumming gigs, working in a job she
loves... awesome.</p>
