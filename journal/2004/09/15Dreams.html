<p class=dream>Cooking with janette, and we had melted a bit of
butter into each mold of a metal ice cube tray.  Each melted pat of
butter had to be poured into individual cups in a chandelier, where
candles would cook each dish.  But the chandelier had bamboo strips
around it so we couldn't get the ice cube tray inside to pour out the
butter.</p>

<p class=dream>janette quickly came up with a solution of putting the
chicken into the butter first, and then shredding the chicken and
putting each piece of chicken individually through the bamboo strips
and into the chandelier.  janette is such a genius!</p>

<p class=dream>Fred and I were walking in a small ditch and I
accidentally dropped a piece of trash.  He bent down to pick it up, I
thought, but he threw it into a sewer so it couldn't be seen.  I told
him to get it out and he said it was only a dream so it didn't matter.
I agreed with him that it didn't matter in a dream, but that I would
prefer if he didn't do it because it was <em>my</em> dream.  He
conceded and picked up the trash.</p>
