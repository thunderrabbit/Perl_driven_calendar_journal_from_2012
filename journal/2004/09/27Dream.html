<p class=dream>I was reading an article that said if Russia ever drops
a nuclear bomb on the US it will be on Florida. (*)</p>

<p>(*) FL has just had four hurricanes hit it in one season.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a picture of some people doing some sort of
construction on NASA and the implication was that this was a
strategically important thing and the bad guys wanted to destroy it.
I panned back in the photograph and could see the large picture that
they were working on; a big building was being built; a very large
construction project of which they were just a part.</p>

<p class=dream>I started to collect my things to go again, and an old
man had arrived.  When I was about to pick up my spool he was reaching
for it as well.  I was like, "that's mine," but then I saw he had a
real need for it: his spool was broken, and he had been trying to use
his broken spool so he could travel.  His brother (?) was pushing his
wheelchair, and the broken spool was being used to support the man's
leg so they could roll without the leg dragging on the ground.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "oh damn. okay, you can have the spool,"
and I picked up the old busted spool and they were really thankful,
but the brother was more like, " I hate having to push him around all
the time, but yes, this does make it easier thank you."  The brother's
wife was there, too, and I was like, "goddamn you must be patient."
and she was like "what [did you say]?" and I was like,"um" <em>gotta
quit cussing in front of people I've never met before</em> "gambatte;
you've been so patient!"</p>

<p class=dream>And they started to roll, and it rolled really easily
and they headed downhill and my spool started to roll downhill away
from them really fast and I just watched as it careened down the hill
and smashed into a million pieces against a wall.</p>

<p class=dream>I started to cry; what was the sense in me giving them
this gift just to have it destroyed so quickly?  Who feels worse, me
or them?</p>

<p>It was nice to wake up from that.</p>
