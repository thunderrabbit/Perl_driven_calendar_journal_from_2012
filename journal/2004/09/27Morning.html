<p>I studied a bit of Chinese and I've come back to the conclusion
that I need to work on pronunciation first.  One issue: my two
teachers have different accents: Taiwan and Beijing.  It's the same
issue as English students have with Canadian, Australian, Irish,
American, British teachers.</p>

<p>Mostly today I compiled a package for janette.  It's got ramen,
train cards, funnily-angrily-written notes, toothpaste, and super
secret things in it.</p>

<p>I just need to get a box to put it all in to send.</p>

<p>Today the weather is whiney drizzly rainy.  Gack.  I'm not going
to ride my bike to work.  My attempts to ignore the impending winter
stop when it starts to rain.</p>
