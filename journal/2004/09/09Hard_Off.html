<p>Hard Off is a funny name that means "reduced price hardware."  In
Japan, "price off" is Japenglish for reduced price.  Book Off is
intended to mean a reduced price bookstore, and Hard Off is a reduced
price computer hardware store.</p>

<p>Jesse was like, "wow!" and wanted me to scope the stuff, and I must
admit it was possibly cooler than I expected, but not as cool as I had
hoped.  He thinks there are good deals to be found there if we look
Hard enough.</p>

<p>They have porn there as well, so it could be Hard Off like get hard
and get off.</p>
