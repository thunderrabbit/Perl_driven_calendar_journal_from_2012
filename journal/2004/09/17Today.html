<p>Cool!</p>

<p>This morning I slept until 12:38pm when Erik from Nova called me.
His fellow Japanese student was looking for an English teacher.  The
Japanese lesson they attend is within five minutes walking distance of
my building so I walked over, and met his friend.  We arranged to
have a language exchange English for Mandarin twice a week!  That
should help jumpstart my Mandarin learnin'</p>

<p>Today my Japanese teacher cancelled our lesson because she worked
until 7:30am this morning.  I had been mentally preparing to ride my
bike out there, visualizing the route in my mind as I looked at the
map.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed during this process: I wasn't using any words -
no Japanese, no English, not even Tagalog.  Just visual images in my
head and in lines on the map.</p>

<p>Erik and I went to kaiten sushi for lunch - the shop was pretty
big, but there were very few customers during the 2-3pm timeslot.  We
talked about language a bit and movies, I Robot, and Will Smith.</p>

<p>On the way home, I asked him about the origin of a statue that
depected a hen standing on cat standing on a dog standing on a horse,
all of whom were howling, neighing, clucking, meowing, not
necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>I asked him the origin and he didn't know and a woman came up and
started talking to us.  She wanted to practice English and told us in
very broken English how she had gone to Nova for a while but didn't
learn as fast as her cohorts, so she quit.  Erik and I guessed later
that she didn't move forward because she talked more than listened.
We tried to correct her a few times, but she was locked on her method
of speaking.</p>

<p>She told us, though, her version of the origin.  There was a bad
man and he wasn't scared by the horse neighing or the dog howling,
etc, but when all four of the animals got together, he was scared
away.  And that's how teamwork got rid of the bad man.</p>

<p>Watched the latter half of Rabbit Proof Fence with Shoko and Jen.
Shared drinks and mango pudding with them.  Jen was chopping pumpkins
for pumpkin soup.  Oh, some big green zucchini for pumpkin soup.
Good fun.</p>
