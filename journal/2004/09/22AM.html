<p>hitomi woke up early and woke me up at 5:40am to get ready to go
to fujikyu highland! woot.</p>

<p>i'm tired, or it would be a bigger woot.  but, in a way, i've
become weary of fkh's lines.  or, maybe it's just because it's been
the same story: dodonpa is far too short, fujiyama is awesome, we
always miss the money haunted house.</p>

<p>and we're always late.</p>

<p>at two stations we *just* missed the train (by a few seconds).  at
another station we missed a train while hitomi was negotiating our
day-pass train tickets which give us a discount at fkh or something.
I hope the lines at fkh will be short; the park switched to winter
operation hours yesterday.</p>

<p>Yay!  I forgot to bring contacts today, but then I remembered I
had put my contacts in my backpack a long time ago so that I wouldn't
have to remember.  So, I *have* my contacts and will therefore be
able to see on Dodonpa, if we ride it.  But fuck that; I'm going to
wear my contacts even if just for Fujiyama.  This time when I ride
Fujiyama and take a video, I will be more careful to keep my fingers
out of the video.</p>
