<p>Today, after deciding upon my next website project (I wonder if
I'll do it), I went to Sanami's for her lesson (tried to teach her
stuff like "red circle, blue circle, green circle, purple triangle,
blue triangle, green triangle, pink square, orange square, blue
square"..  I don't know if she would understand these in Japanese, but
I think she would.</p>

<p>Came back for a "barbecue" frying vegetables and chicken and little
sausages on a hot plate outside with Shoko and Jen.  Lovely fun for
the whole latter afternoon.  Gus came out and Jen and Shoko showed
their limited awareness of the US states and we showed our limited
awareness of Australian states and territories.  Shoko and Jen talked
about Janet Jackson, and then Matteo came and Jen and he raved about
Michael Jackson.  I did my impression of Michael Jackson's dance
style, which was pretty crappy, but recorded for posterity on Jen's
camera.</p>

<p>Now I'm about to shower and go to Roppongi to watch _Deep Blue_
with Hitomi.</p>
