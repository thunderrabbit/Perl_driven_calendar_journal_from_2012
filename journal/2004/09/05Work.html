<p>Work was tiring today.  I tried using steps each time - 7 flights
each way and it wore on me after about 15 reps.  But fun overall.
Checked my email a lot and chatted plenty with Jen and OM.  Next week
I'm going to try and secure internet access for my computer.</p>

<p>I'm in St Mark's Cafe now, waiting for my lesson with Akiko at
7pm.</p>
