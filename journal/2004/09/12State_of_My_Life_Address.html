<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm doing computer work for Jen's uncle, OM(!) <! and by "doing
computer work," I mean, "running cash for his horse betting
operation."> instead of working at Gaba on weekends. The work is
easier, the dress code is more relaxed, the pay is higher and the
hours are shorter.  Awright.</p>

<p>(!) don't tell him that OM stands for Orange Man</p></li>

<li><p>I have made great progress in a relatively short time (by just
getting off my mental duff and doing it) on preparing for my bike
tour.  It seems that the following things may be true:</p>

<p><ol type=i>
<li>While in China, I can't easily legally broadcast my location; I
need a radio permit, and to get that I must be a resident for a year
and be a member of a club, etc.  So I will probably get a Geko 301
(includes compass and barometric altimeter (I may not use/care about
the altimeter, but it could be cool.)) GPS, and upload my coordinates
that way.</li>

<li>There is a complicated way to use cell phones to do it, but I
don't understand the way well enough to implement it.</li>

<li>I can just store my tracklog and upload it once I get to an
internet access point.  To do that, though, I still need to figure
out how to interface my Mac or my Handspring to the GPS to get the
data out.</li>
</ol></p></li>

<li><p>I own the domain chatbotchats.com, but I haven't put any
content there yet.  I'm a little bit stagnant on it because it is
still taking a while for the domain to be ssh enabled.  I don't want
to use it unless I have shell access.  Come on stupid
nomonthlyfees.com.  Don't suck, please.</p></li>

<li><p>I also own thunderrabbit.com, but I haven't really added any
content there recently.  I don't know if I'll keep on keeping it past
the byebye date.  It could be interesting though to write in a
different style about my bicycle tour, like in a child-story style and
post those entries on thunderrabbit.com</p></li>

<li><p>I also own robnugen.com, where this post is intended to
go.</p></li>

<li><p>I write in my journal basically every day, multiple times a
day.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Motosumiyoshi in Millenium House, basically in Tokyo,
Japan.  Shoko and Jen have been my primary buds who also live
there.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitomi has been my girlfriend for a while.</p></li>

<li><p>I've climbed Mt Fuji, and I've considered riding my bike to
fifth station and then hiking the rest of the way to the top.  That
could be a cool thing to do next year.</p></li>

<li><p>My basic plan that I've been developing (2 weeks ago I didn't
even know realtime tracking was rather common online) my plan to be
realtime tracked during my trip around China.  Turns out doing it in
China would be hard due to licensing restrictions.  It's super common
in the US and in Europe, though.  I may hook it up once I arrive
there.  I don't know about Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>So my plan is basically to buy a bike, buy GPS equipment
(Garmin's Geko 301 is what I've been looking at with interest),
practice riding on longer and longer rides from Tokyo, and then in
March heading off for a rather long ride to Hokkaido and back.  Then I
can go to Kyushu and back or go to Kyushu and beyond, rocking out to
Korea and then south along East China and then southeast Asia and then
north along West China and then into Russia or Mongolia and then
Eastern Europe and Western Europe.  And then across the US (with a big
big stop in Virgina and West Virginia to see my family) and then
Texas.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm working at Gaba 3 days during the week (·î²Ð¶â), and at OM
on weekends.  OM is easier and fewer hours and mo money.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't know how to scuba dive.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't been north of Nikko in Japan.  Haven't been south of
Hiroshima.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't been out of Japan since I arrived 19ish months
ago.</p></li>

<li><p>In two weeks I'll teach Masashi's last lesson with me in Japan.
He's taking the opportunity to work in the US for two years starting
next month. (Actually the lesson starts in 2 weeks and 45
minutes)</p></li>
