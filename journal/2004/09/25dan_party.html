<p>We had a Christmas party last night at DW in Tsunashima.  Dan and
Kei (sp) declared that it would be a good time for a Christmas party,
and Jen agreed since it turns out she and I have to work on Christmas
and Boxing Day.</p>

<p>Hitomi and I arrived late because we had her lesson and something
else before going out there.  One thing I was really happy about:
after having been at DW's for a while, I was like, <em>man,it must be
getting late</em>, but it was only 9:30.  I would be just getting
home from Gaba if I still worked there on weekends.  Awesome.</p>

<p>We chowed a bit and drank a bit (I had a Calpis Sour, a Calpis
Water, and a Pineapple Sour)</p>

<p>Um...  we exchanged presents and Dan got the chocolate that I
bought and he liked the train tickets I brought him and I got a kiwi
via Tetsuya I think.  Aiko liked the little cup and saucer that Hitomi
bought (at my recommendation), and Hitomi likes the little
throw-a-ball and catch it game that she got.  Overall, big fun.</p>
