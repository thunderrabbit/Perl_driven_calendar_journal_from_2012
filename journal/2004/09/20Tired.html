<p>I'm tired.</p>

<p>Heading to Hitomi's house now; we're going to see "I, Robot" tonight.</p>

<p>I figured out how to get emacs to print a list of numbers:</p>

<pre>
(defun countify (number)
  (while (<= number 100)
    (princ (number-to-string number))
    (terpri)
    (setq number (+ 1 number))))  ; do C-x C-e before this comment

(countify 5)  ; do C-x C-e before this comment
</pre>

<p>Next steps will be how to make the start and finish numbers
optional and then how to put the output into the kill-ring.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I don't know why these don't work on my version of emacs.</p>

<pre>
(defun countify (&amp;optional (start 0) (finish 100))
  (setq number (start))
  (while (<= number finish)
    (princ (number-to-string number))
    (terpri)
    (setq number (+ 1 number))))

(countify 5)


(defun argtester (a b &amp;optional (c t) (d "yes"))
  (mapc #'print (list a b c d e f)))

(argtester 'aa 'bb 'cc 'dd)
</pre>
