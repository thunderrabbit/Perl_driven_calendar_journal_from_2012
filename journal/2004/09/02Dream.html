<p class=dream>In a big modern house that was very tall and not so
wide wanting to take a hot tub bath with Hitomi, but the hot tub had
been moved.  She knew it was downstairs so we headed down there and
there was someone in the shower, we could tell by the slippers at the
door (big red fuzzy slippers) and we saw someone in the hot tub/pool
water with a feather boa on and heard someone crying in the shower
room beyond that.  Don't know who was crying and Hitomi went up to the
person in the hot tub/pool and they were like, "well we were just
about to go on a camping trip and go to a hot tub," and at this point
I thought we were being discluded from the hot tub, "and that is an
Adult hot tub, so yeah, come on in." and we got into the water, and
when I got in I literally couldn't take my towel off, so I let it get
soaked under water and I swam across the pool.  Someone from YRUU
asked me if they could use my towel, but I was like, "no" cause it was
my only stitch of clothing and they were like "I only have a T-shirt"
and I figured that was enough for them .  At the other side of the
pool I arrived and saw several familiar faces, including David Park
from my high school days.  I was like, "David Park, right?"  and he's
like "yeah" and said something else but I ignored him; I had a really
iimportant story that related to his <em>name</em> not anyting else,
so I was like, "minasan, listen - when we were in typing class, the
teacher was like, 'P-A-R-K' and I looked up at David and David looked
up, but <em>NO ONE ELSE LOOKED!</em> We should have all been clapping
and cheering that <em>We could type his name!</em> but Nooooooo just
type type type," and I reflected that had we not kept typing, I might
not be able to type as well as I can now, but I didn't say that; it
would detract from the story.  I slipped back into the water and
heard someones pager vibrating.. Oh it's my alarm.</p>
