<p>We had two significant earthquakes today.  One around 7:30 local
Tokyo time and the other closer to midnight.  We've had lots of
earthquakes in the past month.  Like 5 in a month.  That's way higher
frequency than the past 18 months I've been here.  I'd love it if Fuji
decided to blow his top.  It would just be like <em>wow</em>.</p>
