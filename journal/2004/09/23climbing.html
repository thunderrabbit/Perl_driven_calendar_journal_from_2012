<p>Hitomi and I are climbing a stream rocky and I got a video of her
climbing. She's definitely girly about spiders, but she doesn't mind
climbing on rocks.  Nice.</p>

<p>We found a toilet available for public anti-consumption, but I
don't have a GPS to let me list it in findatoilet.net.</p>

road.  More high heels.  Now, yes, she could have been on her way home
from work.  And yes, she could have found the most comfortable high
heels in the world.  But, it seems to me that sneakers would be even
*more* comfortable.  No one was around to see (except me and Hitomi);
throw those heels in a bag and put on some comfy shoes!  She was
walking on rocky not-smooth asphalty concrete with hills and bumps and
occassional metal grates.. Wow.</p>

<p>Hitomi and I climbed down into the concreted riverbed and went
upstream.  I noticed a strange something that I couldn't identify and
then realized it was a set of <a

spillways designed to slowly let the water downhill.  Back and forth
troughs which made for easy climbing.  I had Hitomi close her eyes, or
at least not look up as I led her down to the bottom of the spillway.
When we reached the bottom, I had her look up at it.  She was like,
"wow!" cause it was almost certainly an unexpected view of sloping
angles in an otherwise somewhat random looking terrain.  We climbed
the trough without incident.  This pic is Hitomi looking down the
thing we had climbed.  The dam to the right is described on the plaque
below:</p>

<p align=center>12.5 meters tall, 102.3 meters long, 8,210.9 cubic
meters maximum capacity.  I like how the measurements keep getting
more precise.

had a great time climbing on places that I wasn't allowed to climb.
What was funniest: we had climbed up the stream and found the DO NOT
ENTER sign from the back.</p>

align="left"></a> We headed a bit higher up the stream, and found a
smaller, more easily accessible mesh.  Hitomi got a video of me
climbing it, but I wasn't particularly fast.  I took these while
seated on top of the mesh.</p>

<p>There was a James Bond wire pulley thing at a kiddy park near all
the dams and rocks and stuff.<p>
