<p>On the way back, we had plenty of time to get the express train,
but we wondered if we would have time to take the local train *back*
to Lawson to get some food and get the express train back home...</p>

<p>According to the (quite reliable) train guides, we would have
seven minutes at Fujikyu Highland station to run to the convenience
store and be back before the express train came.</p>

<p>We devised our plan: Hitomi would take the local train back to the
end/first station, so she could be sure to get a seat.  She would sit
in the last car on the train, so we'd know where to meet each other.
I would get off the local train at FKH station, run to Lawson to grab
some food and then come back.</p>

<p>We did that, and I even had a minute to spare (well, 30 seconds
given that I also had to get across the tracks before the train came
through).  Hitomi had a tiny change, though: she had secured a spot
in the last car, but as the train approached the station, the
announcer was like, "only the first three cars will stop at the
platform."  The train was longer than the platform, so she had to run
to one of the cars that I'd actually be able to see to confirm she
had made it, etc.</p>
