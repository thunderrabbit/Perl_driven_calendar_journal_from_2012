<p>Chinese lesson was fun, and included very little Chinese.  Shufen
told me about her intriguing situation with Will and how he slept with
other women and she wasn't too impressed with that so she's not going
to contact him anymore.  Plus he moved back to Ireland.</p>

<p>Shufen is getting a map from the bookstore next door (we're in
Starbucks on the 5th floor of Lumine in Shinjuku)</p>

<p>Oh, hey, I have internet access here!</p>

<p>Wait; no I don't.</p>
