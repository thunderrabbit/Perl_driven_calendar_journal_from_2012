<p>Saw <em>I, Robot</em> with Hitomi tonight.</p>

<p>I liked the cars with spherical wheels.  That's pretty cool, and
makes sense, I think.</p>

<p>I liked how they took the three laws and took them to a new
seemingly inconsistent conclusion.  I don't know if the book did the
same.</p>

<p>I didn't like how Sonny was like, "I did not kill him!" and then
turns out that he did at the end.  It would have been cooler if he
ultimately admitted, "Dr whatshisface made me promise... he made me
break the window."</p>

<p>So a secret could still be kept, and Sonny would never have lied.
That would have been cooler.</p>

<p>Will Smith is a hoss.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>Oh, I like how when the girl was feeling up his arm, they did not
have sex.  How refreshing.</p>
