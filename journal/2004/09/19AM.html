<p>I have a bit of a headache that I believe can be attributed to
using a pillow to support my neck while watching _Monsters Inc_ last
night.  I should have just gone to sleep when Hitomi did; she watched
almost none of the movie, and I've seen it before, but it kept being
funny so I watched it.</p>

<p>I ate a pizzaman that Hitomi's mom bought yesterday for Hitomi's
and my breakfast.  Best I understand is that when Hitomi sees her mom,
her mom is willing to buy food for her to help support Hitomi being
out of her mom's house.  Not sure if that's particularly accurate, but
it seems to be.</p>

<p>The girl across from me on the train is dressed in what they call
Lolita fashion.  There are many variants, and I can't really name all
the clothes items, but she's wearing all black:</p>

<p>1 inch platform shoes with 2 inch heels, thigh high stockings,
frilly petticoat skirt thing, frilly sleeveless top with stretchy
fabric on top, long sleek gloves that go to her mid-biceps.</p>
