<p>Except for hanging out with Hitomi last night, I've been reading
and trying and doing stuff to learn about GPS and GPX.  Here is
kindof a summary that I've learned so far:</p>


September 2004

<p>I've recently decided to ride my bicycle around Japan, southeast
Asia, and China. I think it would be cool to have my position tracked
in realtime, but I've found limited resources to support such an
endeavor in Asia.  Around the US and Europe there is a system
called <a href="http://www.google.com?q=define:APRS">APRS</a> that (to
the best of my knowledge so far) uses a system of radios and receivers
to broadcast location information.  (<a
href="http://www.aprsworld.com/">www.aprsworld.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.findu.com/">www.findu.com</a> can keep track of
that data, and present maps of where certain radios (vehicles, people,
animals) are located.  Perfect!)  But the system is not readily
available in China, and it's <a
href="http://www.crsa.org.cn/1_eng_visitor_certificate.html">difficult
for a visitor to get a license</a>.</p>

<p>The next best solution suggested was for me to collect my tracklog
data and post it delayed.</p>

<p>So far, after a few days of digging through the internet, I have
found the following possible solution:</p>

<pre>
Garmin Geko 201 (not yet purchased) from <a href="http://www.tvnav.com">tvnav.com</a>
data cables (not yet acquired) from <a href="http://www.pfranc.com">pfranc.com</a>
computer (my Macintosh G4 powerbook)
<a href="http://gpsbabel.sourceforge.net/">GPSbabel</a> to convert Garmin proprietary format into <a href="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp">GPX</a> format
<a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com">GPSVisualizer.com</a> to create and display maps based on my uploaded GPX data
</pre>

<p>Notable mentions during my searching: 
<a href="http://www.chimoosoft.com/gpsconnect.html">GPS Connect</a>
from Chimosoft.com, but it only imports waypoints, not tracklogs.</p>
