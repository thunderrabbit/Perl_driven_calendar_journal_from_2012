<p>Today I did a significant amount of research on GPS stuff and I
sorta came up with a possible path by which I can get my track online,
but, later in the day, I had problem getting the latter part to
actually work on my computer.  Maybe it's just a Mac thing, but I have
never heard of .svg files (by Adobe), which are some sort of
manipulateable image files that are produced by gpsvisualizer.com.</p>

<p>Today I basically learned there are two types of GPS data formats
that come from the GPS to a computer or some such: realtime and not
realtime.  I'm currently looking into the non-realtime version because
that's what I'll be allowed to do across China.  Once I get it
working, I may look into the realtime stuff for once I'm in Europe;
we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Uuhhmm, so I'm still at a bit of a blockade ((HAHAHAHA I just had a
memory of my idea of Homework Blockade, which I scheduled into my day
planner about 3 times a week (during my college days) and it was
supposed to mean I couldn't do anything until all my homework was
done.  AHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!))  about what type of software I can use on
my Mac and online to get scaleable maps drawn.  Hmm.</p>
