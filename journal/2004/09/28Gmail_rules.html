I have *got* to study, but I just noticed this:

I have some messages starred in gmail.
I click on the link to view starred messages.
I click some of the stars to turn the stars off.
I click on a message to view it.
I click on "go back to starred messages."

The messages without stars are still there.
The messages without stars are still there, but they have their stars turned off.

I click on Inbox and *then* back to starred messages and the
non-starred messages are gone.

gmail is awesome!  It knows when we're fuckin' around with the stars,
keep em all visible until we move off to something else.  Genius!
