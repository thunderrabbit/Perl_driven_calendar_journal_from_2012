<p>World of Where is a weird name, but a kinda cool software thing
that helped me learn the names of all the countries in South America
yesterday.  Even the little ones.  I haven't confirmed the accuracy
of the names with a "real" map, but it seems unlikely that they would
be wrong.</p>

<p>I can't use this software to learn the other countries unless I
have a registration code.  Also I found a bug in the software, which I
reproduced consistently and reported to the author.  In the same email
offered to correct the program's readme file (grammatical and internal
inconsistencies) in exchange for a regisration code.  He thanked me
for the bug report (and said he fixed it) but didn't say anything
about the grammar fix offer.</p>

<p>I might fix the grammar just to do the right thing.</p>
