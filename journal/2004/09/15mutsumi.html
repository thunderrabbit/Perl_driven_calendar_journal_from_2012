<p>I'm here to meet Mutsumi, who said she would be about 10 minutes
late.  But now it's 15 minutes.  But she's a good kid; she'll be here
soon or contact me.</p>

<p>Good to catch up with 睦!  She asked me if I had received the
postcard she sent from India, which I had, but hadn't really
remembered it. Am I a bad friend?  Can everyone else remember what all
their friends have done for them?  She brought me a cute carved
elephant tonight.  I hope I remember that she gave it to me!</p>

<p>睦 and I are trying to think of names for my bike.  Right now
we're focusing on Japanese names/words that have a good meaning in
Japanese and a good sound in English.</p>

<p>かむ ("kamu" = bite)
<br>さるいしゃ ("saruisha" = monkey doctor)
<br>がんバイク ("gambaik" =~ hard working bike)
<br>Gumbike (an attempt to spell it in English)
<br>Speedy</p>

<p>I should talk to Jen and Olivia; they nickname everyone.</p>

<p>I made it home by midnight after we left Jonathan's at 11pm and
then stopped by her apartment so she could loan me a sweatshirt.  It's
getting a bit chilly out in these parts!  Dumb cold weather.  I think
I'll ride to Jiyugaoka from now on.</p>

<p>On the way home, there was construction happening to block one of
the streets I used.  I was able to get by, and the dude even confirmed
I was on the street that I wanted to be on (I had a photocopy of a
portion of my wall map of Tokyo).</p>
