<p>nomonthlyfees.com sucks.</p>

<p>It took forever to get my account set up properly, and now as I'm
trying to edit code in the shell, it's SO SLOW.  I've confirmed that
it's not my connection to the internet; I can work on robnugen.com,
but I can't work on chatbotchats.com.  Fuck.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed.</p>
