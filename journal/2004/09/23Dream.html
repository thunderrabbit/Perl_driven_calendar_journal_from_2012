<p>Last night I woke up with a start from a scary dream that I was in
a room and the door closed and a spooky wind came and it was pitch
black.</p>

<p>Different dreams during the night:</p>

<p class=dream>Simon from my work was being ostracized because he's
Irish.  We were in a group and one guy fought another guy to the
death.  And then Simon had to fight to the death.  But instead, he
tried to talk his way out of it, and when that didn't work, he ran
away.  I wanted to help him, and I knew he was hiding in the library.
I found him there, sneaking around, always watching over his
shoulders, etc.  He had made friends with some of my adult YRUU
advisors who were in a meeting discussing the nest rally or something.
It was determined that Denise Atkerson would be the best person to
call; she always knew how to do things, and knew what was going on
behind the scenes.</p>

<p class=dream>The scene switched to Jesse and I trying to find a way
to make money, maybe if Simon were rich, he could have his attackers
killed.</p>

<p class=dream>I was riding my bike and I saw an error message at the
bottom of the screen, like, "tires destroyed," but I looked down at my
tires and they were fine.  I looked down at the tires on the guy next
to me and they were fine.  We both stopped, and talked about it.  I
told him what I had seen, and thought I must have been dreaming, but I
knew I wasn't.  I checked by jumping and came back down again, so I
wasn't dreaming then, either.  But then I did one other test or
something and determined that I had been dreaming, but was not
dreaming now.  "So we must have been dreaming; there are no TV
displays on our bicycles!" And we gave eachother five for such amazing
detective work, and I woke up.</p>
