<p>When I left Bell Wistaria, I left the internet access up for Dan to
use.  When he left I wanted to cancel it but the remaining roommates
said they would pay for it.  The price jumped after that; Yahoo's free
period expired or something and now they owe me 18,000 yen.  They
asked me to cancel the service, which I've done halfway today (I
canceled the NTT phone line; I don't have the number for YahooBB).
They'll pay 10,000 yen today and 8,000 yen after payday.  I'm thankful
to recover the money. (plus about 900 yen pain in the ass fee)</p>
