<p>Wow.  I just found on findu.com <a
href="http://www.aprsworld.com/">aprsworld.com</a> which seems to be
even more perfect that findu.com because the guy is currently working
on the code!  Steve at findU is about to retire, so he's not the best
person to ask about my adventure, I think.</p>

<p>This is cooooool!</p>

HI James

I live in Japan and am planning to ride my bike across China starting
in March 2005, and would like to be tracked. I looked for a FAQ on
your site, but didn't find one. Does your amazing code work in China?
I've got 500 US dollars allocated for anyone who can track me across
China. (The trip could take a couple years) 500 more dollars for the
hardware.

I'd like people who read my online journal
http://www.robnugen.com/journal to be able to click a link that shows
a zoomable map with a track of where I have been, defaulting from the
beginning of my trip.  Allowing the option to choose start and finish
time/date is great.

I know/believe China doesn't have street level maps, but I don't
really care about that. Later however, if such maps become available,
the coordinates can be superimposed on the new map for greater
zoomability.

Can your software do this already?  What hardware do I need?  I'm
looking for small power consumption hardware (AAA battery / solar) of
whatever I need.

I'm totally completely utterly new to this world of tracking, so I'm
looking for FAQ lists that you can recommend.

It appears that Steve Dimse is about to retire, but you seem to be
still working mightily on your tracking project.  I hope I can help
support you.

   Thanks!
   - Rob
