<p>Today I plan not to stay online all day.  I want to want to study
Japanese or Chinese.</p>

<p>Hitomi has started <a
href="http://setiathome2.ssl.berkeley.edu/fcgi-bin/fcgi?email=peko_hk55%40hotmail.com&cmd=user_stats_new">looking
for aliens</a> on seti@home.  Her computer is rarely on, but once I
told her about it, she was interested.</p>

<p>What's interesting to me is her stats when she's completed zero
workunits.  She's completed more workunits than more than 0
participants.  Do some participants have negative values in their
workunits completed field?</p>
