<p>About a week ago, on the last night Andrew worked at Gaba before
his month long vacation, I showed him my new bike. We went outside and
there was a man sitting at the picnic table next to the light to which
my bike was locked.  He spoke relatively good English and said he
admired my bike.  I told him about my planned trip and where I live
and stuff.  He said that he's lived in Jiyugaoka for many (50?)
years, and that this was his street.</p>

<p>I thanked him for looking after my bike.</p>

<p>Tonight, he was there again, and I was glad to see him when I came
to get my bike.  I asked his name.  "Kobayashi."</p>

<p>We chatted a bit in English and Japanese and when some of his
friends got off work (in the beauty salon that faces his picnic
table) they came out to smoke and chat.  He told them of my upcoming
adventure and they ooh and ahhed and I was like, [I don't know if I
can do it, but] in my best Japanese.  They were surprised when I said
I ride from Motosumiyoshi to Jiyugaoka in 30 minutes.  [This is
practice; Hokkaido is super far away.]</p>

<p>They agreed.</p>

<p>Kobayashi has lived in Jiyugaoka for a long time.  I can imagine
he chills by that table every night as a relaxation.  He looks old
and wise, and is missing several teeth.  His body is slim in a
healthy way.  He sits on the bench facing away from the table, with
his elbows back on the table for support.</p>
