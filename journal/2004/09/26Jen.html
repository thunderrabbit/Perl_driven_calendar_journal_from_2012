<p>Got to chat with Jen last night and this morning.  She was feeling
sad and I appreciated being able to listen.  I'm super thankful for
the time that I've spent in my <a href="http://www.mkp.org">men's
group</a>; it has incalculably helped me learn to listen and see
through a lot of the issues that we all have.</p>

<p>She stayed out at karaoke til 4am; she's sleeping on the local
train while I jumped over to the (limited) express.</p>
