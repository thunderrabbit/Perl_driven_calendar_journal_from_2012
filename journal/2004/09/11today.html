<p>Got lots of good information regarding tracking and stuff.  Two
emails I sent to Dude:</p>

Dude

I'm looking to buy <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/geko201/">http://www.garmin.com/products/geko201/</a> or
<a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/geko301/">http://www.garmin.com/products/geko301/</a> the difference being ($90 and)
compass, altimeter, and weather thing.

What do you think? Do you want/use an altimeter?

An altimeter would be cool, and I think I'll want a compass, and the
price difference is only 3-4 hours of work, so I'll get the 301.
Okay, thanks for your help!

Yo dawg

I've asked several people several questions about this, and the
answers are coming together. I still have my Handspring Visor, with 8
megs of memory on it. I won't likely fill that much memory with text
entries from my journal, so I can use that.  janette has found my
collapseable keyboard, so that is perfecto.

For realtime GPS, I've found some guys (<a href="http://www.findu.com">http://www.findu.com</a>
<a href="http://www.aprsworld.com">http://www.aprsworld.com</a>) who are well aware of realtime tracking. It
basically requires me driving with a radio *transmitter* that
broadcasts my signal/location and a network of digipeaters that tell
all their friends what all their other friends are saying until
everyone knows what everyone said!

BUT China doesn't allow just any schmo to broadcast radio. So I can't
do it in China.  I dunno about other countries, but because the
infrastructure isn't there to support it, I doubt I can do it in
realtime.

If I care, I can do it once (if) I get to Europe.

Just wantin' to let you know how the plans are going...

<p>I got an email from Charyl saying that she was without email access
for a bit, but she'll get on the ssh problem for chatbotchats.com and
I had big fun chatting with Masashi today during our second to last
lesson before he goes off to New Jersey for 6 months of training and
then Chicago for 18 months of living.</p>

<p>Got to chill with Miki after that, and she taught me some Japanese.
My goodness she is beautiful!  Part of it is that she is happy.  She
is happy with her life and she is comfortable with that.  I could
learn a lot from that.  I could, if I were ready and willing.</p>

<p>Chowed cereal with the gang downstairs while watching a soccer
match and OH!  And I found out from janette that she has found my
collapsible keyboard for my handspring visor!!  Whooohhooooooo!!!</p>

<p>Good things, I think.</p>
