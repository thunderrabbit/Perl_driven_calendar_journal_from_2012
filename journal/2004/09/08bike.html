<p>I went to look for a bike for my adventure. I found a shop that is
close to my house and seems to have what I want.  He's going to call
his supplier and see if he can supply some supplies including a supply
of my bike.</p>

<p>I want</p>

<ol>
<li><p>a bike strong enough to survive a ride down steps</p></li>
<li><p>20+ gears</p></li>
<li><p>a light that is run by wheel-driven dynamo</p></li>
<li><p>multi-grip handle bars for a variety of positions to hang on</p></li>
<li><p>place for saddlebags and handlebar bags and seat bag</p></li>
<li><p>Saddlebags, handlebar bags, seat bag</p></li>
<li><p>brakes, seat, and other things bike usually have.</p></li>
</ol>
