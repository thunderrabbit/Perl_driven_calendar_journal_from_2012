<p>Enormous bigtime fight with Hitomi last night.  I didn't stop lying
down, but I considered breaking things.  I didn't raise my voice, but
I considered kicking her out for good.</p>

<p>She had said insincerely, "go ahead and sleep," and then she woke
me up by bonking my knee. "I can't sleep."</p>

<p>She made many statements including how she didn't feel that I
talked to her enough.  Most of her statements were simply statements,
but I have a feeling that in Japanese culture, they would prompt more
of a response.  When I said, "Hitomi, I know you are angry.  I
acknowledge you," she was like, "and?"</p>

<p>And I was like, "and nothing.  I acknowledge you," which is what I
thought was what she ultimately wanted.</p>

<p>She didn't know the word, and I told her I didn't know it in
Japanese.  She rudely threw her translator to me.  (Note: she didn't
throw it at me, and I was still prone on the bed, but she threw it and
it landed at my hands, hitting my fingers.  She didn't say
anything.)</p>

<p>I knew it was her expensive translator; hers is denser than mine.
I had visions; had it been mine, I would have thrown it across the
room, shattering it into a million pieces. (or maybe 5) I was really
angry.</p>

<p>I quickly dove into my feelings, blessing them, thanking them.
Typed "acknowledge" on the screen and showed her.</p>

<p>She wasn't impressed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>In the end, we both feel asleep, although she spent her
anger-energy on removing all her stuff from my closet and drawers.  I
didn't try to stop her; I thought it was a constructive thing for her
to do.</p>

<p>In the morning, she apologized, and I was like, "it's cool, but
one more time, and you're out."</p>
