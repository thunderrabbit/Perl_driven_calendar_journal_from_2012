<p>More fighting last night, but it was shorter.  Hitomi was angry
that I invited a student to cancel a lesson so I could close it and
meet her outside the school.  She can save money, and I can get
something to eat.  Hitomi argued that teaching is my <em>job</em>, so
I shouldn't mix a lesson with hanging out.  I was like, <em>when we
have a lesson, we just talk, not using the books or anything.</em></p>

<p>Hitomi was like, "fine," and lay down to sleep, and I didn't want
to sleep next to her (and I wanted the attention) so I lay down on the
floor (which I know is one of her buttons; it's my room; if we're
going to sleep separately, I should get the bed).  She saw me and
reached out to tug my hand <em>come get into bed</em>, but I pulled
her fully out of the bed all the way to me and just held her.</p>

<p>I felt really sorry for having pulled her out of the bed, but I'm
sure it just surprised her more than hurt her.  I held/hugged her and
she hugged me back and we were rocking back and forth.  She was
crying and I said, "I'm sorry." two times.</p>

<p>She was more sorry than me; I'm not sure why, but she apologized
profusely and we went back to the bed and slept.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it turns out Hitomi is sad that I enjoy talking in
English to other people more than to her.  I told her even though
that's true, she must not give up trying to learn English.</p>
