<p>Good day at work today.  I was grouchy at a couple points, but
then I contrasted this work with teaching and I was like, "whoooooo!"
cause this is soo much easier.  Much better.</p>

<p>Asked the woman across the street her name and she gave her family
name, which I promptly forgot.  I wanted a first name like Mika or
Shira or something.</p>

<p>I studied for about 20 minutes today.  We were pretty busy, so I
didn't have much time to study.  We didn't really get a lunch break
today.</p>
