<p>My bike has cool lights.  Well, a cool light in front.</p>

<p>I picked up Hitomi from the train station, and she rode side saddle
on the back bracket thing that is rated for 25 kilograms, but it held
me, so I figured it could hold her.  I imagine it's for 25 kg and
heavy riding.</p>

<p>Briefly chatted with her and then rode to Toritsudaigaku, no
problem in about 35 minutes, including breaks to check my map a few
times.  It was cool when I arrived at Jiyugaoka - it appears that I
won't need to take the train to work anymore.  And I will probably
make it no problem to Shibuya for Japanese lesson.  Maybe 20 minutes
from here if I know where I need to turn.</p>
