<p>Well, pooh.</p>

<p>Mutsumi seems to not be here at Denny's.  I wonder if she's okay.
I will stay until 10pm and then roll out.</p>

<p class=date>11:35pm</p>

<p>Ah.  She was still at Gaba.   We had fun chatting about travel and
roller coasters and I showed her pictures from Hawaii (Feb 2003) and
my western state trip (Nov-Dec 2003)</p>

<p>We played the World of Where game for Asia and got 56% correct,
although we lost a few percent due to her not being used to my
computer's touchpad.</p>

<p>She said that she can't really afford to buy new points at Gaba
when hers expire in November.  And she said that she hasn't used the
book in 2 months and someone at Yokohama office said she had to use
the book.  I was shocked, but if that person was just trying to make
sales, it makes sense in a way.  I told her it was ridiculous; she was
paying for 1-on-1 lessons; she can do anything she pleases in the
lesson.</p>

<p>Mutsumi speaks quietly and deliberately.  She has her own slow
pace of speaking, and she maintains that speed, so it's not too
strange to listen.  She wants to study in New York, but isn't sure
she'll be able to afford it.</p>

<p>She's been to Canada two times, including Vancouver, Ottowa and
Niagra Falls.</p>

<p>She asked about the name of the roller coaster in Las Vegas; The
Stratosphere.</p>
