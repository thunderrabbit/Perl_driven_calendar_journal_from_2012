<p>Lesson with Akiko was cool, but we had trouble communicating in the
loud cafe.  Loud with 5 high school students yammering at table.
There was a cool earthquake during the lesson.  Lasted about 15
seconds at least.  She felt it before I did, which surprised me.</p>

<p>Difficult to explain the pronunciation differences between label
and level because of the noise level.  But we were talking about
political labels.</p>
