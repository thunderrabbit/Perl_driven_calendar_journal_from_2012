<p class=dream>There was a house with a porch that went around right
angles inside and outside corners</p>

<p class=dream>I was running along the porch and when the curve
allowed me to jump over the grass, I did so, thereby not having to go
around all the poles.  This allowed me to go rather faster than those
who I was racing, friends from YRUU.</p>

<p class=dream>Something else that I don't remember happened and then
another thing I don't remember and then I woke up.</p>
