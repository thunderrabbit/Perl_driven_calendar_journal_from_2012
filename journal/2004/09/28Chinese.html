<p>Chinese lesson was good; we sat on one of the benches at a computer
kiosk type thing "History of Kawasaki" in Japanese and English.  The
English versions, while grammatically accurate, are far shorter than
the Japanese versions.</p>

<p>I think I may have learned something; at one point the tones began to
actually feel reachable.  That was strange.  Well, they felt natural,
almost.</p>

<p>I'm really just working on pronunciation of four tones for each of
pa, po, pi, pu, ba, bo, bi, bu, be, ma, mo, mi, me, mu, fa, fo, fi, fu
etc.  She gave me a little bit of vocabulary.  I'll work on the kanji
now.</p>

<p>Riho has long two-tone hair; it appears that she's choosing to no
longer dye her black hair blondish-brown.  She speaks Japanese well,
and works hard to learn English.  So far she has read the first 20
pages of her son's reading book:</p>

<pre>
Good Morning!
Wake up.
Yes, Mommy.
Brush your teeth.
Yes Mom.
Wake your brother.
Okay.

I'm hungry.
What's for breakfast?
Can I eat?
Don't forget your tomatoes.
I'm full.

This is a book.
This isn't an eraser.

Is there a book?
Are there some pencils?
</pre>

<p>She teaches me Mandarin, and from what I can tell, her accent
includes the "ar" sound that Kat said sounds ugly.  (Having Kat's
approval is important in my mind, but she (Kat) never answered my
request to teach me Chinese, so oh well.)</p>

<p>Sometimes Riho spews instructional Chinese, or explanatory Chinese,
and it's just complete jibberish to me.  But it sounds like it could
possibly be fun to understand.</p>

<p>She has a son who is about 8 years old.</p>
