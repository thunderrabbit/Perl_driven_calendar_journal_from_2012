<p>Rode my bike to Kawasaki and it pretty much started raining during
my ride.  Also during the ride, I was surprised by how much my arms
and back were sweating.  I noted, however, once I arrived, my jacket
is not particularly waterproof; it was rain, not sweat.</p>

<p>Miki told me a typhoon was coming.  I guess it has arrived.  But
it's not too windy, so I think my room will be okay.  I'm pretty sure
I left the window slightly open.  I called Rene and he said he would
check.</p>

<p>When Miki learned that Dan's byebye party is tonight, she was
like, "if I were you, I would go," but she kinda said it wrong in a
cute way; I don't remember how exactly..  Uh.. Oh we ate ice cream
and chatted a bit and I taught her the word 'soaked.'</p>

<p>Afterward, I showed her my bicycle <! and we held hands on the way
to it> and then I rode to Tsunashima.</p>

<p>And it was pouring rain.  Pouring, drenching, good-job-Tokyo kind
of storm.  There was no thunder nor lightning; it was a pure typhoon,
not an awesome Houston Summer Storm.  I settled into enjoying the
ride; I could barely see, especially when blinded by oncoming
headlights, and I remained vigilent for any sudden discontinuities in
the sidewalk.  But the rain was not cold, so I just enjoyed the
ride.</p>

<p>I arrived safely; no unpredicted dismounts; nor unintended
impacts.</p>

<p>So now I'm here at DW's with Jen, Olivia, et al; Dan, Tetsuya and
Hitomi will be here soonishly.</p>
