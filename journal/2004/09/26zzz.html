<p>I'm tired.</p>

<p>Non-optimal situation with Hitomi.  She won't tell me how she's
feeling.  I want to use janette's quilt as the top quilt.  She wants
to use the thick quilt as the top quilt, but I was using it as the
bottom quilt because the cover for the futon mattress was not on the
futon mattress and I didn't want to use the futon without the mattress
nor the mattress without its cover.  The cover is not trivial to put
on, but Hitomi insisted on putting it on herself, matyring herself so
I could type journal entries.</p>

<p>Non optimal.</p>
