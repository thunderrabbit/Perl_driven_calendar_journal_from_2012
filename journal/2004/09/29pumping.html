<p>What do you call giving a ride to someone on a bicycle?  Pumping?
Dinking?  Doubling? We didn't get into the debate tonight, but I
carried 43 kg of Hitomi from Tsunashima to Motosumiyoshi.  It took 30
minutes.  Went up and down the hill at Hiyoshi without stopping and
without her getting off.  Awesome practice for my trip.</p>

<p>It was a bit nervewracking, but I tried to enjoy it.  I enjoyed it
more when it seemed like she was holding on carefully.  At times she
had her umbrella open to protect from itsy bitsy sprinkly, but that
was pretty much okay.</p>

<p>I just wanted her to stay safe.  Hitomi seemed to quite enjoy
it.</p>
