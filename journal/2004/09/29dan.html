<p>Lots of yammering tonight; mostly talked with a cat named Scott
from Texas.  He's Dan's old roommate.  I should have asked him to pay
for the internet service that the cat named Steve is going to pay me
for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Scott is from somewhere north of Arlington.  He went to A&amp;M
and has more of a Texan accent than I do, but he still hates Bush,
but he hasn't registered to vote overseas yet.</p>

<p>He was pretty outgoing and stuff tonight; he seems to like to drink
a lot.  He used the term "eft up" as in "I'm gonna get eft up
tonight," where "eft" is short for "fucked."</p>

<p>These are pics from this night (Dan's byebye party) and a couple
nights ago for Dan's welcome back to Tokyo party.</p>
