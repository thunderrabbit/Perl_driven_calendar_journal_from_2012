bought my bike today!!!  Actually, I haven't taken possession of my
new bike.  The brakes were Japanese style with the right brake
stopping the front wheel and the left brake stopping the rear wheel.
No.  Soon as I slam on the right brake and fly off my bike, I would be
like, "shoulda gotten that switched..."</p>

<p>So, I'm getting it switched.</p>

<p>He balked at first when I asked if he could switch it, but.. I
hadn't paid for the bike yet, so I gave him the cash for the purchase
of the bike and was like, "can ya switch it?" and he was like,
"yeah."</p>

<p>Bike cost 89,000 yen suggested retail; he gave me 8000 off that and
2000 on for the switch plus tax for a grand total of almost 88,000
yen.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I'm also getting it registered in case of theft (no charge), *and*
I'm going to buy some phat locks.  I have my killa dilla chain lock,
and I want two rings locks (one for each wheel) and a longer fat cable
lock to lock it to a something.</p>

<p>I will be more careful locking this bike than my last bike.</p>

<p>I need a name for this bike.</p>

<p>Maybe "Frisky" or "Fluffy."  Maybe "Molly" or "Mauly."</p>

<p>How about</p>
