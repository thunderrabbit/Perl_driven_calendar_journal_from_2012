<p class=date>3:43pm JST Thursday 16 September 2004</p>

<p>This morning I did mostly computer stuff, including toying around
with <a href="http://www.worldofworlds.net/">World Of Where</a>, the
unlock-code for which I paid for just today.  It's a cool program for
Macs.</p>

<p>After that, I was tempted to just sleep until my next obligation
(Chinese lesson at 5:30) but then I remembered that I wanted to buy a
patch kit for my bike.  I did that and relaxed a bit and now I'm about
to ride to Yoyogi, which could take awhile so I will leave
soon. Supposed to be there at 5:30.  Oh I said that.</p>

<p>I figured, No more excuses; just go.</p>

<p class=date>5:21pm</p>

<p>And go I went.   Left my room at 4:00.   Sat on my bike to go at 4:03.</p>

<p>At 4:26, I went by Jiyugaoka (Gaba work).</p>

<p>At 4:55, I went by Starbucks in Shinjuku (Japanese lesson).</p>

<p>At 5:13, I finished locking my bike to the fence here in Yoyogi.</p>

<p>At 5:21, I started writing this.</p>

<p>At 5:24, I finished writing this.</p>

<p class=date>8:23pm</p>

<p>Just made it back home.  I left Yoyogi at 6:47pm.</p>
