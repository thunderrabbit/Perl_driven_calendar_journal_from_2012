<p>Work was pretty good today; I was in a super pissy mood at first,
with people all in my way and walking slowly and walking without
paying attention to where they were walking, like a bunch of mindless
zombie robots.  And when I tried to give an extra yen or two to get
back a smaller number of bills for change, the woman was like, "oh,
this is too much money," and gave me all this change back.</p>

<p>I counted it super slowly and meanly.  "1."</p>

<p>"2."</p>

<p>"3."</p>

<p>"4."</p>

<p>"5."</p>

<p>Five!  Thank you very much.  Now I have five singles.  I could
have a single five, but now I have five singles; thanks for giving me
correct change so poorly!</p>

<p>How on earth could that make me angry?</p>

<p>I mulled it over; something about me feeling like I'm not living
my life efficiently.  Didn't get to the root cause.</p>

<p>Had a nap though, and felt better.</p>
