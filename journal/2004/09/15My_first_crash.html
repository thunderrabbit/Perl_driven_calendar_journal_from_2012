crashed once on the way home.</p>

<p>Ug, how embarassing.  It was a low speed crash; the bike is way
bigger than my mountain bike was, and I can't (yet) control it as
handily.  I tried going up a small lip of a driveway at a fine angle
and the tires didn't go up, but I was angled that direction and just
ate it sideways.  Skinned my knee pretty effectively, but not deep.
I took the picture when I arrived home.</p>

<p>Didn't take time to clean it before I went to teach Sanami's
lesson.</p>
