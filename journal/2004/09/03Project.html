<p>I got the first hints of losing steam on my project when I visited
hotornot.com to see how they do things.  They've logged 9 billion
ratings and have 13 or 30 million pictures online.  Damn.</p>

<p>I was like, "ugh; I can't do this [that]," when I turned back to my
handwritten sheets of paper of screen layout ideas.  I'm not sure how
to convert my ideas into a coherent project; there are some question
marks hindering the process and some technical aspects that I'm not
sure how to handle.  Like the way they handle their foo, fooo, foooo,
etc cookies.</p>

<p>If the site becomes wildly popular and stuff, I've got a fear that
I won't be able to handle user complaints.</p>

<p>One solution is to just say "fuck off," which is what I've
basically written for the faq.  Like the faq for mailinator.com.</p>

<p>That fear, plus the fear of being tied to something, plus the fear
of it not being good enough, plus the fear of *me* not being good
enough, are all playing into my desire to just blow it off.</p>

<p>But, come on, dawg; you can do it!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm thinking that if I start to code a little bit, I can enthuse
myself enough to keep going, and not get so bogged into the details
that I fuck up the progress.  Careful balance there.</p>

<p>I think during work today, I will lay out a coding game plan to get
different discrete parts working and then begin fitting them
together.</p>

<p>One trick is that I intend to use sford's userA code, which I don't
100% know how it works.  I mostly know, but I don't totally know.</p>

<p>Gotta go.  (Train doors will close me into the train soon.  Well,
in about 60 seconds.)</p>
