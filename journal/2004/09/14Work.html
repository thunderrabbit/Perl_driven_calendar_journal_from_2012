<p>Work was pretty cool today.  Had six lessons, 2/3rds of which were
with notably fun students.  Hiromi showed me her daily diary, and at
some random time during the lesson she showed me her new shoes and
picked her foot up into my hands and I was like, <em>woah</em> and
wondered if it was a bit of a come-on or just a friendly
shoe-showing...(!) <! I felt her leg up a bit anyway></p>

<p>Kyoko scheduled two lessons with me to finish out the day.  Fun
times.  She had a bit of trouble with my/your and at first I could
trick her and say, "is this my pen?" and she would parse the question
without changing literally and say "yes," wanting to mean it was her
pen, but meaning it was my pen.</p>

<p>(( I'm not clear how to simply describe what was happening in her
brain.  She repeated the 'sounds' that I had uttered in her mind, and
it all lined up when she converted the question "is this my pen?" into
a sentence "this is my pen." and answered "yes [this is my pen.]"  But
she didn't remember that the word "my" must have its meaning changed
when different people say it. ))</p>

<p>I said, "thank you," and took her pen each time she said it was
mine, and the reparsed the sentence and realized her mistake.  Once
she seemed to have the hang of it, I inquired if her suit jacket was
mine.  She never errored when I asked about her jacket.</p>

<p>I gave her pen back when she asked for it, and explained some
different levels of politeness:</p>

<pre>
May I borrow my pen?
May I have my pen back?
I want to use my pen.
Give me my pen.
</pre>

<p>and explained that the first one was too polite, but I had to
translate "too" and "polite."  I couldn't explain "too" quickly
without using Japanese, plus I couldn't remember the Japanese
translation, plus the bell had rung for the end of the lesson, so I
snagged my Japanese book and translated it using the grammar I had
seen, but apparently not learned well enough.</p>

<p>She's so cute.  (and not just because she didn't know "too" nor
"polite")</p>

<p>I was never able to get her jacket, though.</p>
