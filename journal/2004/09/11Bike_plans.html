<p>Have received an email from a man who lives in China who says it
would be quite dangerous for me to broadcast my location in realtime
because of the lockdown on radio communications in China.  He says
that even he, a Chinese citizen, can't get a radio broadcasting
license.  I might have that last part wrong because he seems to be a
HAM radio operator.  But I don't know where he lives; he could be
hamming outside China.  Anyway, he urged me to just take a GPS and
upload my list of previously traversed coordinates when I reach
internet cafes.</p>

<p>I have decided (had decided even before this email arrived) that I
want to go north in Japan first, to see Hokkaido during the summer. (I
wonder if I'll choose to see Hokkaido (by train) in the winter.)</p>

<p>And I have hypothosized that I can make a profit during my ride by
teaching English.  I know I can live on 1000 yen per day of food
(easily, if I maintain dilligence) and I can make 3000 yen per hour
teaching.  I imagine I can find one person per 3 days to pay for an
hour of English yammering.  My plan is to write a little sign on a
stand in Japanese: [I'm traveling by bicycle from Tokyo to Hokkaido;
donations accepted, and I can help you with your English.] or
something like that and bang: Money flows freely into my life.</p>
