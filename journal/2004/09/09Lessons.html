<p>Just had a lesson with Misaki here at Gateway 21.  I'm not sure
that she'll survive taking classes in English in Hawaii in three
weeks.  She's supposed to be there for 6 months.  I asked her what
classes she would take and she said "in English," which could be a
flub or could mean that she'll take classes in English, in which case
she is screwed unless she screws someone there.</p>

<p>Because she didn't stick to our original schedule, she doesn't have
enough time to finish 10 hours of lessons with me.  I told her that
I'll meet her for 2 hours next week and the week after, which will be
horrific for my brain, but acceptable for my wallet.  After that, we
will have had 8 hours of lessons (not 10, which she has already paid
Gateway 21 for; I assume they will keep the money).</p>

<p>Next (at 8:30) is my last lesson with Tsukasa.  Lessons with him
have been interesting.</p>

<p class=date>8:50pm</p>

<p>Wow; he's 20 minutes late so far.  I've been working on processing
the pictures from my trip to London and Paris with Bryn (in March
2002).</p>

<p class=date>9:55pm</p>

<p>Wow; he's 85 minutes late for our 90 minute lesson.  I think that
means he won't be here.</p>

<p>During this time I've continued processing the images from that
trip.  I think I know why I stopped before; I don't know the names of
most of these historical treasures and that's embarassing to me.  I
can't even identify the Notre Dam for certain.</p>

<p class=date>10:06pm</p>

<p>oops.  Last week was our last lesson together.  I hadn't updated my
calendar book from a long time ago.  Well; it's all good; I got to
chill and work on my website on a project that's two years old and
could be nearing completion now.</p>
