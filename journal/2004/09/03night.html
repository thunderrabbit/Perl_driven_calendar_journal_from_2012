<p>Hitomi and I met up with Jen, Olivia, Tetsuya, a couple other Nova
droids at the DW in Motosumiyoshi.  Morag and Shoko came a bit later
and Morag sat by me (yay!) and told me about these karate dudes
kicking through <em>baseball bats</em> with their <em>shins!!!</em>
What is up with that?  Crazy people! Wow!</p>

<p>I gotta get the next train.</p>
