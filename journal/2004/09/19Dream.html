<p>Today while walking to the station, I clearly heard a voice that
sounded like Shoko saying "Rob" but it came clearly from a house that
I've never been to before, nor have any reason to believe Shoko has
been to before.</p>

<p>At Kikuna station, a guy said, "HI" and "have a nice day" to me,
and I'm like, <em>why?</em>  So I checked to make sure I wasn't
dreaming.  I jumped, and came back to the ground
immediately.  <em>Okay, I'm not dreaming.</em>  I checked to make sure
I'm wearing shorts, two matching socks and shoes, T-shirt, backpack
(zipped closed), nothing strange stuck on my head...  Weird.  I don't
know who he was or why he identified me out of the crowd.</p>

<p>But it does remind me that I had a dream:</p>

<p class=dream>I was at Suzanne's house, her new beautiful reallllly
nice house with inlaid tile bathtub that was huge, with a mosaic of
some west Texas plain.  It was dirty with workers' muddy footprints,
so I took the opportunity to P and clean the mud at the same time.
But the opportunity didn't seem to relieve my need to P or clean the
tub.</p>
