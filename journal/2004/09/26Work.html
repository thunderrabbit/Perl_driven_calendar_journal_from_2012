<p>Today before work Jen and I confirmed that we can chill on the
local train to Yokohama and still make it in time (instead of changing
to the express train at Kikuna).</p>

<p>We found out the first name of the cute genki girl across the
street: Mikiko.  I was a bit shy to talk to her when I went to get my
lunch, but I said, "すごい元気。" [super genki]</p>

<p>Jen and I have decided we want to be friends with her and invite
her out to drinks in Tsunashima or Yokohama or Motosumiyoshi.  Next
time Jen and I go in together, I'll ask Mikiko where she lives and
tell her where we live.</p>

<p>どこに住んでますか。私たちは元住吉に住んでいます。</p>
