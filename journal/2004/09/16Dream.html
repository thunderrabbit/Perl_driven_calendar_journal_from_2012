<p>Lots of YRUUers</p>

<p class=dream>Anna Magwood, Annie B, Austin Roth, lots of Houston
local YRUUers, but the only one I remember in my dream was Meara, at
some kind of party, conference thing and I was just so happy to see
everyone.  Annie invited me to hang out with her friends who were
having a contest to see who could make their nose the most red. They
were like huge wrestler looking guys with no shirts, and one guy was
massaging blood vessels toward his nose and straining hard and when
he said "okay" a person across the table took a picture (so all the
pictures could be compared later).</p>

<p class=dream>or was supposed to take a picture, but had the camera
turned around backwardsly and missed it.  He didn't get mad about it;
sometimes these things happen.</p>

<p class=dream>I left Annie, but I didn't want to leave, and she was
like, "what's wrong?" and I was like, "I want to hang out with
you <em>all day</em>, but so do I want to hang out with everyone all
day!"  She said she understood and had the same feelings about her
friends.</p>

<p class=dream>I went over to the next table and they hadn't been
certain that I would come, but it was kindof a trick, cause they
didn't tell me that Anna was there!  They were playing with legos and
offered me a place to play as well.</p>

<p class=dream>I was with Erika (I think) from my ex-work in Houston
and she was telling me about her dog Lucky and then I wanted to show
her some program printouts from UH, but they were in a room with a
really small door.  Like a few inches tall and wide.  I backed away
from that door and found another door on the side of the room, that
was still small, but large enough for us to get through. Erika had
turned Japanese, for she was careful to follow procedure and sign her
name on the whiteboard (which was otherwise blank) to say she was
going to be in the room, but I didn't sign it because I never had in
the past.</p>

<p class=dream>Inside, I showed her printouts with ids like ST275 (my
old VAX account username at UH) and she was interested in the concept
of the history, but not in the details.  I told her to ask Maggie or
Molly about their numbers, but I couldn't remember their usernames,
and there didn't seem to be any point in asking them; the history
wouldn't become any more interesting, but the twins might be prompted
to tell Erika some fun UH stories.</p>
