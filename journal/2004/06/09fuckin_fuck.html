<p>My fucking gaijin friends can't keep a date!  "I forgot" whine
whine whine!  Don't fucking forget!  I keep my calendar in my pocket
and I fucking go where I say I will go.</p>

<p>My Japanese friends never forget or flake.  I can fucking make
plans with them one month out and we'll fucking <em>be there</em> on
time no problems.  Fuckin' hell.</p>

<p>I'm extremely thankful to my men's group for teaching me the value
of keeping my word and being on time.</p>

<p>Get a fucking calendar!</p>
