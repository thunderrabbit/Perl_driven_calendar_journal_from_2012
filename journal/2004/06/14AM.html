<p>Good morning.  It's noon.</p>

<p>Dan sent me</p>

<pre>
MATE! -
MATE - 1000 yen!
MATE - 32!

</pre>

<p>And I was like, "you keep sending me this, but what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means I'm in shock - S H O C K.  And I'm just having a bit of
a laugh."</p>

<p>"You're in shock?  Are you okay?  Should I call a doctor?"</p>

<p>"yeah mate, only a doctor can help me."</p>

<p>"Maybe a game of HSJ will help.  Hey - remember that time we
played in front of Subway?  I think Jen was there..."</p>

<p>He didn't reply back.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>
