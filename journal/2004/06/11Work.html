<p class=date>1:35pm JST Friday 11 June 2004</p>

<p>I called work to see what time is my first class, but for about 30
minutes the phone was busy.  So I called the area manager and inquired
about my first class.  3:15pm.  So I asked him to close my 2:30
lesson.  He said he okay.</p>

<p>I fixed lunch, ate a couple of gyouza (sp) (offered by Riki) and
headed in to work.  Ironically, I'll be on time for the 2:30pm lesson
(though it's been closed).  I called work (to see if they would answer
and) to see what time my last lesson is today.</p>

<p>My last lesson is at 10pm.  My first lesson is at 3:15.  But 2:30
is open; do I want to close it?</p>

<p>wtf?  2:30 is open?  What did that other cat mean?  Did he close my
lesson or not?  Whose lesson did he close?  There's no proof to say he
said he would close it, and I fear the onous (my first time to use
this word; I don't know if I like it) would be on me if I weren't
there and it got booked.  Fuck.</p>

<p>On subsequent inquiry, it seems that Tomoko didn't refresh the
window before reporting the lesson was still open.  Need some basic
database / web awareness here.</p>
