<p>Saw Morag in the train station; she looks beautiful; energetic,
happy, .. and she's taking karate lessons and loves it.  "It's the
best thing <em>ever</em>."  Money.</p>

<p>For an <em>instant</em>, when I saw her, I saw Manda.  Heart-stop
for a second.  Woah.</p>

<p>Morag is sick of guys (the guy she went on a date with last night
likes to watch TV as an activity.  He said remorsefully when she asked
if he would take her to Pachinko just once for the experience, "oh,
you like to <em>do</em> things."  Dude!  That's what life is
about!</p>

<p>So I'm hanging out with Hitomi a lot and she likes to *do* things;
to skydive and travel and allll sorts of wonderful stuff and janette
asks me what's so freaking-out-ish about settling down?</p>
