<p>Hung out with Hitomi today; we chowed at Jonathons in Kawasaki
where I gave her three quick lessons on astronomy (in honor of Venus'
solar transit today), two on our solar system: (1) [sun plus 9 planets
(+ 1 new one) in order (assuming the Neptune is closer to the sun than
Uranus (I always seem to get those two confused)) not including the
asteroid belt, but including the number of moons around the rocky
planets and estimated number of moons around Jupiter and Saturn, plus
a mention of Saturn's rings] (2) [the amount of time it takes the
sun's light to reach earth, which I had remembered (yesterday when I
told Hitomi this story) as 6.33 minutes but is 8.33 minutes (according
to our calculations today) (oops)] and then (3) [a lesson on our
closest solar neighbor Alpha Centauri (4 light years away) and then,
because in Okinawa she had seen the Milky Way arcing overhead, a
sketch of our galaxy and its diameter of 10,000 light years.  "That's
too long to wait."] </p>

<p>High five; she understands.</p>

<p>Saw a little girl eating a popsicle for a commercial being filmed
in Cinecitta.  So cute.  You go, little popsicle girl.</p>
