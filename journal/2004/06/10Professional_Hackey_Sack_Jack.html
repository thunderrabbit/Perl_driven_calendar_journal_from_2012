<p>Met Dan and Jen in Tsunashima today.  After I griped at them both
for having not kept their original plans with me, we enjoyed a great
lunch and great hackeysackey fun in front of Subway!  Jen and I had
1.5 sandwiches each; Dan ate his and we chatted about work and travel
and whatever else came to mind.  After lunch it was time for some
hackey sack fun.</p>

<p>Dan and I got our world record hackey sack count in his apartment
at Bell Wistaria.  18 kicks between us.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Today, three times, we got 17 kicks.  We definitely did better
outside than in the apartment.  We still had a median around 2 or 4
kicks, but we had a greater number of kicks in the teens than
usual.</p>

<p>Jen went inside to get another drink and reported that we had a fan
club inside; they were all commenting "すごい！" and "いいね。。"
which pretty much pumped up my spirits; in the back of my mind was the
idea that maybe we weren't welcome there; that maybe we were
disrupting the smooth Japanese chi.  But disrupting it for the benefit
of those around us is all good so I was like, "yay!" and we got a
little crazier in our attempts; Dan did some Dan Hutchins (tm) head
butt goal shots, and I (because the coast was basically clear) kicked
the sack as hard as I could, sending it about 60 feet away.  That grew
old after a few hard kicks, but was still fun to do; I hadn't done
that previously.  No room inside and way to crowded in Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>After that little stress relief, our average went up.  We banged 13
kicks then 17 (again) and then like 14; it was great!  Then we were
like, "I can feel it; this will be the big day," and our average went
back down to around average.</p>

<p>We had a couple of onlookers looking on, and we made way for people
to walk by whenever they did, and we just had fun fun fun kicking the
footbags around.  We used Jack and Jill somewhat alternately; I had
just found Jill sleeping in the pocket of the wool pants Tim had given
me when he left right around the time I left Tsunashima apartment;
like the end of February.  She said she had left her cellphone in my
other pants pocket so she couldn't call Jack and he was kinda upset
about that but he was glad to see her and we all made up and Dan and I
kicked them about with glee.  Great fun was had by all involved.</p>

<p>But *then* Dan and I had this feeling.  Like *this* was the big
one; like we were about to destroy the world record.  Dan had said,
"we're either going to destroy it, or were not going to beat it today,
you know what I mean?" and I knew what he meant.  At the same time we
were both like, "Jen," and encouraged her to watch.  "This is the big
one.  Right here."</p>

<p>And like a good parent watching her kids she obliged and I served
and we were counting each kick, "one, two, three, four."</p>

<p>"Okay, okay that was just practice, here it is," and he served,
"one, two, ... okay, this is it.  Those were just practice," but by
that time Jen had gone back to Dan's computer, surfing Yahoo mail or
porn or whatever it was.</p>

<p>Dan and I continued, and we got to 17 <em>again</em>, and then to
14, and then to 7, but <em>that</em> series included three great
recovery kicks.</p>

<p>Then, out of nowhere, "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one" and my
mind relaxed; during the series so far we had passed Jill back and
forth twice, and she was under control, "twenty-two, twenty-three,
twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two! MATE!  thirty-two!" and
we high fived and it was just like <em>bam</em> awesome.</p>

<p>"Okay, one more for good measure," and he served, "one, two,
three, four."</p>

<p>We rested; we had, as predicted, destroyed our world record, nearly
doubling it.  I was like, "mate, I don't know if there is enough room
on my whiteboard to write such a big number."</p>

align="left"></a>We were doing a few more kicks for fun and then
everything changed.  Some guy walked up like he was interested in
playing, so I served to him and he caught it, and tried to kick it.  I
was patient; self serves are not allowed, but I figured maybe he
didn't know. But then when he served it to us, he threw with both
hands.  Not very manly at all.  We would kick it a couple times and
then back to him and he would miss it.  I served it to him and he
caught it, and I was like, " 手なし" (hands none) and he didn't seem
to get it.  Dan showed him by example, and finally he got it and
kicked at the ball instead of catching it.  We tried to get a hack,
with all three of us kicking Jill before she hit the ground, but we
never quite got it.</p>

<p>The dude left, and Dan and I sat down.  Then he came back, and then
he left again, and came back again, and then left again.  I guess five
year olds don't have much to do these days but walk around.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But <em>then</em> this other guy walked up, and, as opposed to
being five years old, he was like fifty years old and told us "thank
you for good play."  We were like, "thank you" back to him and engaged
in a bit of a conversation.  He would laugh unexpectedly when we asked
him a question, but he always answered the question after that.  He
lives "over there" and he's a taxi driver, and he thought we played
rather well.  He offered to get us a drink and we declined politely;
Dan and Jen had to work, and I claimed similarly.  He persisted.
"Please, let me give you money."</p>

<p>He pulled out his cash and counted out <a
href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?Amount=3000&From=JPY&To=USD">three
thousand yen</a>.  One note for each of us.  He folded it up into
fourths and gave it to me.  I thanked him in the most thankful most
polite Japanese I know.  Holy moly; I was floored.  We were
floored.  We had just become professional hackeysackers, and Jen had
just become a professional hackeysack cheerleader.</p>
