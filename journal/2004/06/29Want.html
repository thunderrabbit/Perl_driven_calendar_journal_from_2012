<p>Jen's like, "well what do you want from Hitomi?"</p>

<p>I don't know what I want from her. I don't want anything from her.
I don't want anything from anybody.  I just want a little bit of money
from a million people, and I want just a little bit of love from a
million people and I want a few good friends with whom I can have
significant discussions.  The friends who last longer are the ones
that choose to last longer; I can decide who will still like me in the
long run.  Take Maggie and Molly for example.  They are twins.  I met
them at the same time.  At the same moment they both turned around
when I said, "Maggie and Molly!" while I was walking behind them with
Heather on our way back home after linear algebra.  I couldn't even
tell who was Maggie and who was Molly.  Now I can tell them apart.
Now I can say clearly that Maggie is a closer friend to me than Molly.
Molly is still a good friend.  So is Maggie.  Somehow, with Maggie I
have shared more secrets and spent more time.  Maybe because we had
more classes together.  We were comp sci and Molly ended up Math.</p>

<p>The point of that is I couldn't have predicted who would be my
friend.  The point of *that* is lost.  Something about
distinguishing  between different people.  I can tell Hitomi apart
from every (?) other person in the world, but do I want something
different from her?  Do I want something different from Maggie?  I
expect differently of Maggie; I expect her to be honest with me; I
expect her to continue being a hard worker at work; I expect her to
be happy to hear from me when I say HI (assuming she has time).  I
don't expect her to make time for me.</p>

<p>It's something about that.  It's something about making a priority
for a certain person.  I couldn't make a fucking priority of Wende.  I
told her, "YRUU is the most important thing to me right now."  Harsh.
But true.  At that moment it was true.  Right now, the most important
thing to me is not developing a relationship with a particular person
but in writing my books; in generating different sources of income
that will allow me to travel.  Priorities are in exploring the world,
having enough money to go back home for SWUUSI.  I would love to go
back for SWUUSI.  I would love to see Jason and friends in YA.  I
would love to play ultimate in YRUU.  I would love to kick it in Long
Beach with Ed telling me stories about crazy cartoon characters I've
never heard of.</p>

<p>I would love to play a decent game of Silent Football.</p>

<p>But do I want that from any one particular person?  Do I get upset
if Ed doesn't have time to tell me a story, or if I don't get to talk
to someone with whom I scheduled a phone call?  Not really.  Disrupted
expectations are part of life.  Deal with them and have another hand
dealt.  It's life.</p>

<p>So with Hitomi, what do I want?  I want to go to TDL with her; that
sounds like hella fun.  I would enjoy going to see Spiderman 2 with
her.  But I'd rather go with Maggie.  Maggie is a bigger fan, but
Maggie is in Houston of all places!  How she ended up there will
remain a mystery (discounting full ride scholarship to UH) and how I
ended up here in fucking TOKYO will continue to remain a mystery.  I'm
off topic.  So I don't *want* anything from Hitomi; just hang out chat
a little Japanese.</p>

<p>But when we hang out and due to certain parts of my brain that have
associated happy feelings with being in bed with an attractive woman,
I often end up in bed with her and lately it's been great, but is it
good for me long term?  Not really.  It's risky for me long term.  We
could end up with a bouncing baby that I darn well sure I'm not ready
to handle.  I want to be a millionaire before I have a kid.  And I
want to do it myself.  A little help is okay, but not to the point
where I have to say ____ did this more than I did.  It has to be my
project.</p>

<p>*I* have to do this.</p>
