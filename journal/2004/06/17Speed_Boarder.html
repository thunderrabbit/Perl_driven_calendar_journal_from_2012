<h1>Speed Boarder</h1>

<p>Speed Boarder is the small indoor coaster at Joypolis in Odaiba
(Southeast Tokyo), Japan.</p>

<p>Only one car per "train," and two riders per car.  The riders sit
side by side and face sideways throughout the ride.  Like riding a
skateboard.  It features some rotations to alternate which side of
the track riders are facing, and sends riders through a glass room
with a nice (but brief!) view of Tokyo Bay.</p>

<p>The first half of the track has the left-hand seat rider in the
lead, and most of the turns are 180 degree mousetrap calibre turns.
They really sling the riders forward into the soft restraints.</p>

<p>The second half of the track is in a rather darker room with lights
along the tracks for coolness.  The right-hand seat rider is first for
this portion of the track, which features the same neck slinging
turns.  This ride is not for the weak of back.</p>
