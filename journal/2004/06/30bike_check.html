<p>Hitomi is calling the police station to see what if anything has
happened with my bike.  She says if my bike has been picked up by the
cops for being illegally parked, the registration numbers are checked
against a local list of reported-stolen bikes, but it's only for the
local area.</p>

<p>I definitely appreciate her help, and I'm wondering about the
possibility of getting it back.</p>

<p>On the way to and back home from Musashi Nakahara, I passed a bike
pound and wondered if my bike was in there.  Oh; I already wrote
that.</p>

<p>I'm trying to find out now if I should go to the bike parking lot
to get my bike more quickly.</p>
