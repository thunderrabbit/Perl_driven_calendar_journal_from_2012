<p>Last night Hitomi showed me a P/B poster so I copied the
number and called them today.  Gave the woman my name, phone number
and address; told her I want to teach English on the 47th 
(よんじゅうなな not よんじゅうしち) P/B adventure.  I think
they'll send me an app.  I had sent two emails previously but hadn't
heard back from them.  I wonder if I'll receive 3 apps.</p>

<p>Calling P/B worked.  Got a call back from Alison who said the
peeps who I need to talk to will be back in town starting tomorrow.
She confirmed the correctness of the email address I had used already
and said I didn't need to send another email to that address.</p>

<p>She said the application process requires !) a resume, !( a letter
of intent, !* a lesson plan for a high level lesson, !& a lesson plan
for a low level lesson, !^ a non-teaching activity that I can bring
to the voyage.</p>

<p>Hmm; there's work to be done, you say?  Not just a free fun trip
around the world, eh?  The first pits of this bowl of cherries have
become visible.</p>

<p>I have my _More New Games_ book here in Japan.  I can adapt many of
them to non English speakers.. That will do nicely for my non-teaching
activity list.</p>

<p>For the lesson plans, I wonder if these are group lessons or
what.</p>

<p>Ohh - an idea for low level classes is basic English to describe
the P/B and the current journey.</p>
