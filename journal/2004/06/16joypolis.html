Odaiba, near her work.  It features a short side-by-side rollercoaster
thing called Speed Boarder, which I first saw on RCDB. It's short, but
cool and really throws one around the turns.  zing zing zing.  Fun
stuff.</p>

<p>I'lll try to get a picture. Now we are about to go skydiving.
(????)  I have no idea what it will be like. My dream is that it will
be one of those huge fans blowing upward, but I somehow doubt it will
be that cool.</p>

<p>It was definitely not that cool.  Just a video projected on the
wall in front of us, and then when we were lifted into the air (with
looping coaster type restraints) and tilted forward, we could see
video on the ground as well.  Fake wind blew upward, and we weren't
tilted all that far forward.  Just up and down motion to some fucked
up storyline like we were parachuting, but rising and falling and
being caught by a helicopter.  Whatever.</p>

<p>The halfpipe skateboard ride was worth two goes, but we still
couldn't figure out how to get it to spin spin spin.</p>

originally being envisioned as 10 planes on both coasts)</p>

<p>Um, the funniest thing at Joypolis was how the girls squealed with
fear(?) at the T3 haunted-house type thing.  It featured a couple of
fake robots shooting at us, and a guy in a suit pointing a scary
gun-arm at us, but mostly was led by the speed-Japanese-talking guy
who was like, <em>you have to run run run!</em> apparently (according
to Hitomi) and riled up the others in our group.  They were squealing
and running and I was like, "hahahaha" and not running.  Except when
dragged by Hitomi who was running, or being pushed by the crowd (8
people total).  The guy leading the group let me choose the disc to
use to save us from destruction, possibly because I was not scared, or
not understanding anything he said, or because I was gaijin (a
foreigner).  When the bad guy came running after us with his bad guy
gun, I pointed the disc back at him, "yahhhh!" knowing we had equally
effective weapons.  Mine may have been more effective from a distance;
I could throw it.</p>

<p>When I was given the chance to choose which slot to put the disc,
I was like, "T3 だから　さんばん" which everyone agreed was as good a
choice as any.  At least I think they agreed, or they were being
Japanese-polite and I had missed something in the guy's high speed
instructions.</p>

<p>Funniest thing was when we came to computers with prompts saying,
"enter password," and I typed "hai dozo" (please, go ahead) or (be my
guest) and when the guy was like, <em>so, guys; what's the
password?</em> they were all like, "T!" because that was apparently
something he told us (them) and Hitomi typed "t" on the keyboard, but
lo, the password didn't work, and the guy was like, <em>wtf?</em>
and <em>try again</em> but it still didn't work and oh-no a bad robot
came to kill us because the password didn't work; it was great.</p>

<p>The scariest attraction was the 3D sound thing, where we went into
a small room with scissors on the table and the sound effects started
in our headphones and then the lights went out and we had these scary
voices talking to one another in pretty cool 3D around us.  One
character was asked to get the scissors and the table started thumping
as the person looked for the scissors in the dark and they were
scissed (the past tense of the verb that means "to use scissors") in
our ears; it was funny.  The chairs moved without warning and that was
pretty spooky; fun stuff.  I wonder if it would have been scarier had
I been able to understand what they were saying.</p>

<p>Interesting was the computer video technology.  Large touch
screens with fish swimming; and if we touched the screens the fish
would react: a touch might produce a piece of food in the tank, or
make the fish change size or shape or colors, and occassionally it
drew a picture that floated around in the water, and sometimes it
made the fish dance.</p>

<p>Coolest thing was that they could put things into balloons; I have
a sense of how they did it, but I didn't get to see it actually
performed.</p>

thing we rode) because it was a pretty cool ride.</p>
