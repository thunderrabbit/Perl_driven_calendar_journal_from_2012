<p>Just finished work.  It was aight, um, I was again unimpressed by
Hiromi's lack of studying, but we tried again to pass the level up
test for lesson 3 and this time I wrote down all her answers, and
circled in green ink the correct ones and circled in red ink the
incorrect ones and then we went through the answers to try and make
some corrections stick in her head.  I don't know what will stick, but
we'll see.  I asked her to bring the pages back.  She didn't
understand so I asked her in Japanese.  She understood that way.
There's some sort of goodness in that.</p>

<p>The next sudent was also at the end of book 3 and even though he
had one lesson with me while Hiromi had had two lessons, I tried to
finish the book and rush him through the level up test in some sort of
attempt to prove that it is possible to do both... I know it's
possible.. In some sort of attempt to have a successful lesson.  or
something like that.</p>

<p>But in a way, I think the lesson with Hiromi was successful because
I got her to understand if she gives me a 5-5 online, I will send her
a postcard.</p>

<p>Junko looks like she's become a 5-5 giver.  That's awesome.</p>

<p>5-5s equal 1000 yen extra pay (per 5-5 lesson)</p>

<p>I read a bit about the history of Houston, cause today was the
second time the topic has come up  and I've come up empty brained.  I
dunno.  1836 founded by the Allen Brothers (captial B?) and lots of
problems and all that.  I knew these vaguely, but now I know-ish some
dates.   Oh, they bought 6000+ acres for $9000.  Fuckin wow.</p>
