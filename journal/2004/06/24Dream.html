<p class=dream>I got a new bike.  I was systematically checking all
its parts via an email janette had sent me to make sure it was all
intact.  Pedals, suspension, chain..  I was lying down underneath the
18 wheeler trailer in the driveway of my house on Methil to do this
check.  My little adopted brother and a huge herd of kids came home
and I was like, [I'm never going to learn all these names; I'll just
have him tell me who he likes most.]  I gave him high five (he was 8
years old, so it was a low five for me) and put my bike in the
garage.</p>

<p class=dream>I went inside and a man was dancing with a woman in the
living room, fulfilling one of his fantasies by pouring dishwashing
soap on her.  It was stinging her skin, and she was saying stop, but
he wasn't listening.  That was wack so I woke up.</p>
