<p>Pretty productive day so far today.  I downloaded Amadeus, a
shareware audio thing that allows editing and have made useful copies
of the cassette for Chinese.  Some of the more difficult sounds I
repeated on the recording, and changed the spacing of the sounds
(leaving less time after the English instruction, and more time after
the Chinese sounds (wow; they're just sounds to me still, not words or
phrases)) to better suit my needs.</p>

<p>Worked some more on getting ssh to tunnel a secure connection to my
pop3 box so I'm not sending my unencrypted password each time I check
mail, and produced an RSA key pair for encyrption. Cool stuff.</p>

<p>Didn't straight up *study*, but good effort toward studying.</p>

<p>Oh, I knew there was one more thing.  I got my golloyds account to
switch to my new bank account in the US.  On this payday in 3 days I
intend to ship money over, hopefully having enough to pay my 2003
taxes ($143) and the rest of my debt to janette. ($1234 (or so))</p>

<p>I want to attend a conference thing that my friend-by-proxy
Jennifer from KTRU told me about maybe a year ago Landmark Education,
I think it's called.  150,000 yen to attend.  Yikes.  But she says
it's well worth it.</p>

<p>I had a couple of awesome students and 3 non-studying students
today.  Fuck, I have to study and stop complaining about people who
don't study.</p>
