<p>Interesting: new information: it <em>was</em> Shoko.</p>

<p>I took a fat nap after eating breakfast, and then pondered the idea
of information being the same as noise.  What is the difference?</p>

<p>When does information matter?  Does compilied historical
information necessarily turn into technology?</p>

<p>I've noticed a distinction between digital information, and analog
information stored digitally.   My journal is that, it seems: analog
language stored digitally.</p>

<p>My hunch is that everything is information, but we humans for
various reasons choose to decide what information is important
information.  We do this because our brains are too small to grok all
information.</p>
