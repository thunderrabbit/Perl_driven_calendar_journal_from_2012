<p>My room is a mess.</p>

<p>Last night I read some Japanese comics before going to bed.
Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future.  Doraemon is a cat-shaped robot
born in 2112.  He can pull anything out of his magic pocket on his
stomach to allow for endless plot devices.</p>

<p>This book was giving to me by Atusko, my Nova student friend from
Tsunashima.  I wonder how she's doing with her foreign exchange
student.</p>

<p>This morning I put my futon away, listened to the pronunciation
part of my Chinese tape, and I plan to write some Japanese
sentences.</p>
