<p>Chowed Chinese food with Yuuko, Tomoko and Sumidasan.  Rocked over
to a sports shop to buy some hiking shoes for me to climb the Fooj
with Sumidasan in July.  They had to crack out some Columbia
Sportswear to get some big enough for me.</p>

<p>Now we're at Karaoke, where I found that the book doesn't list all
the songs available.  I typed in the 4 digit code for Eminem and found
"Hallie's Song" and "Business" were both available though unlisted.  I
performed "Business" <em>relatively</em> well considering I haven't
done it perfectly ever, and I haven't done it in Japan at all.</p>

<p>The girls are entertaining us well with all variety of Japanese
songs that I've never heard before.  Sumidasan chose "You are my
Sunshine" and one other that I know but can't remember now.  Good
stuff to hear him sing; I don't think he sang last time we went to
karaoke.</p>

<p>I need to learn a Japanese song sometime; I'm thinking of the Smap
song that I heard a million times when I first got here, but it's not
popular anymore.</p>
