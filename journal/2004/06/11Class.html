<p>Class was cool today; Ayana was there on time, which surprised me.
She was quite proud of her accomplishment and was in quite a good
mood. I chowed shrimp macaroni and cheese for breakfast while we
chatted about my having seen Troy.  I wanted to gush about how cool
Brad Pitt's character was in killing the tall bad guy, but Ayana
hadn't seen the movie yet wanted to so I said nothing except he was
cool.</p>
