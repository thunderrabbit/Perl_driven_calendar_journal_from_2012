<p>My last two students at work worked on page 3 of book 1.  Only
problem is one of the students is "officially" on page 15 of text 3.
he doesn't study, and I told him as best I could, that he needed to go
back to book 1.</p>

<p>I found a grammar that he could do, and asked him if it was
difficult.  He said it was, (although he could produce it).  I showed
him the grammar in book 1 on page 3 and we worked on that page some.
I was like, "you've got 50 points remaining," pointing to the 50 on
the computer screen (as opposed to the 210 used).</p>

<p>I suggested that if he continue with book 3, he won't learn
anything.  But if he goes back to book 1 and studies, he can use
those points more effectively.  We'll see what happens.</p>

<p>Simon is like, "he should ask for his money back," and I was like,
"what?  no way; he never studied.  That's not Gaba's fault."</p>
