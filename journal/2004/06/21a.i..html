<p>Watched A.I. with Hitomi.  She was falling asleep by the end, but
she says she enjoyed it.  The movie kept stopping (DVD player would
crash); the disc was scratched and the DVD player apparently couldn't
handle it.  It would stop in the same places, so we just fast
forwarded past them and started again.</p>

<p>Good movie.  I didn't cry this time (I definitely cried last
time), but I still enjoyed it.</p>
