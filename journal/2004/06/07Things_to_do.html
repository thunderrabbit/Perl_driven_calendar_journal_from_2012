<p>There seems to be a distinction between things I have to do every
day and things I have to do one time.</p>

<p>And some things I have to do every year.</p>

<p>Various things have various schedules.</p>

<p>Is there an innate difference between things we do one time and
things we do every day?</p>

<p>Is it an illusion; I only do each thing one time, but some things
seem similar enough that I call them the same thing...  Like, I'm
going to go eat "again" today, and I'm even going to eat the same
thing, rice and eggs. But.. not the same rice nor the same eggs as
last time.</p>

<p>Einstein is said to have tapped his foot twice and then asked his
students where he tapped his foot.  "Right there."</p>

<p>"No... way back there; the earth has rotated, revolved, been
dragged along in our galaxy.."  (that's my version of what he
said)</p>

<p>It's *not* the same place; it's all new.</p>

<p>But my language and brain says I'm going to eat rice again.  My
brain says I've only been to Yomiuriland one time.  I will probably go
again.  My brain says I did Recycling Day one time.  It will probably
*not* happen again.  Was one time enough?  Is Recycling Day different
than eating the specific grains of rice that I'm about to go eat?</p>
