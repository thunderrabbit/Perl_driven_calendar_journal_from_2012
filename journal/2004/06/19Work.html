<p>Oh dear.  I just found out that Mieko is within 2 months of my age.
She's an awesome student, and I've always liked her.  Now I like her
more.  oops.  fuck; gotta let it go.  Gotta find a bad point.</p>

<p>About to go to lunch with Jesse.  I slept during my first break.
Ate the bentos Hitomi made during my second.  Going to eat the rest of
the last bento during this break.</p>

<p>Been mildly passive aggressive toward my students who won't study,
take notes, nor whatever</p>

<p>Hackeysack with Jesse was cool because we were kicking well and two
Japanese guys joined us, and they could kick well and spoke English
well.  Wow.  They asked, "why are you so nice?"  which is either a
poorly worded question or an unfortunate question to have to ask.</p>

<p>We called the more talkative guy Wild Bill Kick.</p>

<p>Hmm.  My first lesson after the break was a no show.  Should have
been Fumie, a woman who knows assembly!</p>
