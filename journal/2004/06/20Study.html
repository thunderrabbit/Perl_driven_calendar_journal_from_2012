<p>Two days ago, Jessica loaned me the CDs for my ¤²¤ó¤­ Japanese book.
I asked Hitomi to buy some blank CDs so I could copy them.</p>

<p>Yesterday Roscoe loaned me a analog stereo cable to connect my tape
recorder to my computer so I can copy the Chinese tape onto my
computer.  I'd like to be able to listen to the recordings on repeat
while I'm sleepin'.</p>

<p>Too tired last night to do much studying, but Hitomi and I read my
Doraemon English/Japanese comic, helping each other with the
appropriate languages.</p>

<p>Today I brought all my books for studying, the tape recorder, my
computer... we'll see what I end up studying.  Usually I get at least
a few minutes of studying done when I have a late student.  My breaks
are the same as Jesse's so we usually play hackey sack instead of
study at those times.</p>
