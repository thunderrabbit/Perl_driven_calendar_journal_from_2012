<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>I just had a conversation with Hitomi, mostly in Japanese,
negotiating when/how we will met in Shinjuku.  She was like, <em>where
in Shinjuku will we meet?</em> and I was like, "actually," <em>we'll
be at Yoyogi station because there is a large bookstore there.  At
that bookstore I want to buy a new mandarin book.</em> and then we
coordinated the approximate time I'll call her and where I'll probably
be.  In Japanese.  Money.</p>
