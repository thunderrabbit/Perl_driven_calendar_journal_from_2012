<p>Maki and I are supposed to meet at 8pm at Musashi Nakahara
station. I'm outside the south exit of the staiton now, and have been
looking for bikes taht look like my bike.  Haven't seen any, but I
have seen one with disc brakes.  I did see a bike pound that I haven't
seen before; I'll check it tomorrow to see if my bike is there.</p>

<p>I'm not nervous about meeting Maki, like I was nervous meeting my
first student today. I don't know if that's primarily because she's my
second new student today, or if it's because she speaks better
English.  However, I think those are the main factors.</p>

<p>The lesson went well enough, but I don't know that we'll meet
again.  The times she's available are generally not the times I want
to teach and vice versa.  She'll call me or not later.</p>
