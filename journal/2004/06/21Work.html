<p>Fuckin' nightmare, dude.</p>

<p>I called work last night to be all what time is my first class and
the dude was like, "2:30" and I was like cool and I came in today and
my first class is at six motherfucking fifteen.</p>

<p>Did it change?  Was he an idiot?  Fuckin' hell I shoulda called
Akiko this morning; she never does me wrong.</p>

<p>Fuckit; I've got plenty of time to study.</p>

<p class=date>2:33pm</p>

<p>Bossguy adjusted my shit so I have my first lesson at 5:30, with
four in a row.  Originally I had 3 in a row starting at 6:15 and then
one at 10pm.  Now I'll finish at 8:30.  Okay; studytime.</p>

<p class=date>9:24pm</p>

<p>Ended up with a lesson at 4pm as well.</p>
