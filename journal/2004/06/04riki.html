<p>Last night I saw Riki on the train but he didn't see me.  I kicked
his shoe twice and I thought he looked around to see what was up but
he later told me he didn't notice.  I considered swiping his ticket
out of his pocket (it was sticking out, but people seemed to be
watching (Edgar Allen Poe "Telltale Heart")).  As we got off at
Motosumiyoshi, I looped my finger in his wallet chain.  A guy looked
down to see what I was up to.  Riki felt the tug when he tried to walk
and finally noticed me.</p>

<p>On the way home, when he went to get his bike, I ran ahead and then
walked normal speed so he would think it took him that long to go
unlock his bike.</p>

<p>At home, as he was getting ready to go out, he left his keys in his
door (as he usually does).  When I went to bed, I moved them to my
door (across the hall).  He never came and got them; this morning I
put them back in his door.  I don't know the end of this story
yet.</p>
