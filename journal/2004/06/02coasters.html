<p>There seem to be about 20 roller coasters in the greater Tokyo
area.  30 are listed in the <a href="http://www.rcdb.com">rcdb</a>,
but some are closed.</p>

<p>Most of them are in parks with 1 or 2 kiddie coasters.  I will ask
someone to help me check the websites of these parks to confirm which
ones have coasters, and how to get to the parks.</p>

<p>19 coasters in Osaka.</p>
