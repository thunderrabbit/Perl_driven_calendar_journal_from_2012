<p>Work was pretty decent today.  I learned that one of my students
who I really didn't like before are half decent if I just speak more
slowly.  I apparently am not too patient at times when I teach,
specifically at the times I taught them before.</p>

<p>Hitomi, who has been working on snapshots 3 for a long time (and by
working, I mean coming to my lessons, but not doing the
homework), <em>did</em> do homework this time and <em>passed</em> the
test for book 3.  Awesome.  I had to look carefully in my soul for
happy high fives to give her; my immediate reaction was to be like,
"finally, you passed the book, jeez," but I realize that she put forth
great effort and I <em>def</em>initely appreciate that effort and I
want her to continue to make such good efforts, so I gave her many
high fives and praised her homework thoroughly.</p>

<p>Had the super high level guy who brings in newspaper articles about
financials in Japan and the world.  He asks good challenging
questions.</p>

<p>Had Yuki Suzuki (awesome name) who is really trying hard.  Love
her.</p>

<p>Had Noriko, who, bless her, is getting better.  She's on page 4 of
the pre-first book.  She's working on language like, "Look!  There's
Kei.  He is sweet."  "You're right.  He is sweet."  "Who is Kei with?
Hei is cute."</p>

<p>Noriko is getting better.</p>
