Hey everybody,
Sorry this has taken a while..... the last week has been a very
interesting one to say the least!! Where to begin??

OK first i want to say- Turkey is a great country. Its not a bunch of
religous fanatics who frown when you wear a skirt above the knee. NOT
AT ALL!!! And Turkish people hate their reputation. Especially were I
am now its so modern. They watch cable TV, they sunbathe topless, they
love to party and drink etc etc. OK- got that? good!!

Well the place where I am now is called Bodrum. Its on the coast of
Turkey. Its mostly Turkish tourists, maybe I have heard 1 or 2 British
accents in the last week. Its a real surpise when people find I come
from Australia. All the houses here are square and white. The water is
beautiful bright blue and the hills surrounding this bay are kind of
dry, all covered in Olive trees.... very mediteranean.

Our house is lovely, its 3 floors- I have the botom one to
myself. There a pool just outside my door too. We live nextdoor to the
Grandparents..... they are really lovely. Well they are a really nice
family, besides having two of the most spoiled, undisiplined children
in the world!! Well this week so far I have been spat on in the face,
hit in the face, told he wanted to kill me, and beated by pool
toys.... apart from that they are pretty cute when they want to
be. But for this email ill just try to focus on the positive points!!!

Basically in the day I have been working from morning to night. I
mean, some working time is great. A couple of times we have gone to
this exclusive resort/beach club. Its set right on a deck over the
sea. Everbody has their own waiter and big cumfy matress to relax in
(except for the nanny thats being drowned in the pool!!). They have a
DJ playing chillout music and a bar in the middle of it all. Its a
pretty nice place that I would never have enough money to go to by
myself so thats been great going there.

Of course I have had no issues with the food. I think the grandmas
mission is to build me into a Sumo before I leave though!! There
plenty of sweaty men carving that spinning meat let me tell you!!
Everybodys really friendly and invite you into their restaurant/house
for some tea. I wanted to buy some Turkish delight the other day and
all I wanted was 2 pieces. But the guy filled the bag and then gave it
to me for free...... 'For my love'!!! Now..... that leads me to the
funniest part of Turkey..... the guys!!!

OK- the other night I was just sitting at the beach and a guy started
talking to me. So we chatted for a while and he said that his sister
and her friends was coming for the weekend and we should have a couple
of drinks. So I thought great, some kids to hang out with. Oh
yes.... sould have known. Last night I meet him and of course the
sister decided 'not to come out'. But that was ok, I was just happy to
relax and have a beer anyway. But after talking for about 10 minutes
he decided that I wanted to kiss him and gave it a good Aussie
go..... ummm, no thanks. So I wasnt ready to go home so I got rid of
him and found a nice little ledge to enjoy some Turkish Icecream
on..... next thing I know theres a boy next to me trying his hardest
with his limited English saying 'Lets go to the disco'. 1 minute later
theres another one on the other side..... I thought they were friends
but apparently not.... there was a competition going on! So to make
the most of this situation I thought id make it amusing for me. So I
started making them have competitions..... like saying the most
romantic thing they could think of to me!!! OH- it was GREAT. I
couldnt have wished for anything better!! Anyway, I decided that there
was a good couple of hours left thet I should use so I went to 'the
disco' with the second one and his friend. The first place we went to
was just your average club, but then we changed (Yes Aiko- thats
CHANGE!!) to a Turkish club. Well that was funny. I must say I felt
out of my leauge on the dancefloor and I spent a bit more time
sitting! The Turkish boys and girls have some cool belly-dancing
styles going on!! It was a really fun club and it was nice to be there
with some Turkish kids. At about 4 I finally managed to beat Umit off
with a stick and made it back home safely. If only those guys knew how
Japanese I have become when It comes to meeting people!! Turkey and
Japan are at two very different places when it comes to personal
space. Next time im taking a stun gun to keep them away.

Well I have skipped over some of the details here... but I dont feel
like sitting here talking about boring problems so I hope this email
provided something interesting about Turkey!

Hope you are all well and taking care. Keep in touch ok....
Love Olivia
