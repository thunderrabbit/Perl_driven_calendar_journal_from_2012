<p>Just watched Troy with Hitomi.  Good movie.  Yes, I definitely
want to be remembered for ages, but I'd rather not kill anybody to do
it.  I liked Achilles though; he was pretty much a badass to the
max.  Sucks about the heel though.</p>

<p>I was able to read some of the japanese subtitles and that was
cool.  I asked her about some new kanji: horse and big as one kanji
and horse and river as one kanji, but Hitomi couldn't explain them to
me in English.  I'll maybe remember to ask Ayana in the morning.</p>

<p>Ummmm, Hitomi brought custard shucream (puffs with custard inside)
and we forgot to eat them during the movie so we chowed them at the
end of the movie during the credits (during which there were no
outtakes!  argh.)  Yummy shucreams.</p>

<p>On the way to Hitomi's train station, the city of Kawasaki's
nightlife percolated all around us.  Girls chanting/singing behind us,
people drunkenly in stupors with friends about; three girls watching
the palm reader do a reading for their friend; a yamamba rabbit in an
oden tent; the takoyaki vendors closing up their carts for the night;
JeansMate (clothing store) open 24 hours.  (Why?)</p>

<p>When I dropped Hitomi off at the train station, some guy approached
her, and I was like, <em>I'll kill you</em> in my mind, though I
really probably wouldn't have.  Hitomi was startled, but reassured
herself and went on through the gate.  Good work.</p>

<p>Waved bye to her and put on my I'll-kill-you look while walking to
my train station.  Not that I think anyone would bother me in this
part of Tokyo, but just in case; my adrenalin is ready.  Not even the
"massagie massagie" girl offered me a massage.</p>

<p>Good lord the drunks are just disgusting tonight on this train.
Makes it fucked up for the rest of us.</p>
