<p>Fuckin' A; I had two empty lessons at the end of my day and then
someone filled my last lesson, so I couldn't go home as early.  But I
got to practice Chinese, so it was cool.</p>

<p>(the first sentence above was my feeling for about five minutes.  I
quickly flipped it to being happy about the ability to study while I
waited.  But I want it there to contrast with the rest of the
story.) </p>

<p>Student came; and did not fit student stereotypes well.  From the
errors she was making, she should be in Snaps 3 (if she does her
homework) or Snaps 2 if she doesn't.  But she was using Business
Objectives, a really high level book.   But she didn't use the book;
she might not have even brought the book; I don't know.  (I could
hear her in Andrew's lesson (prior to mine) and they were just
chatting.  I was like, "crud; that could mean she wants to get down
to work in my lesson" (but it didn't mean that))</p>

<p>ANY way.. I was like, "please ask me some questions," which is how
I gauge students' level and how fast to talk to them etc etc when I
first meet them.  She asked some okay questions; I can tell she has
learned a lot of English, but she has just forgotten the basic grammar
rules, but remembers the idea of the structures.</p>

<p>[[fuck I have to go soon]]</p>

<p>Okay okay okay um, she asked, "what sports do you play?" and I was
like, "I don't play sports in Japan, but in Texas, I used to play
Ult.." and I was writing down "Ultimate" because I like the word, and
I like promoting the sport, and (this is the important part) as I
wrote the letters U-l-t-i she was like, "Ultimate?"</p>

<p>"You know ultimate?????"  then I quickly rememebered when this has
happened in the past, they are thinking of ultimate fighting, a bane
of our human civilization.  "wait what ultimate are you thinking of?
ultimate fighting?"</p>

<p>"No, ultimate." She made a frisbee-throwing action.</p>

<p>I broke a cardinal rule; I hugged a student.  It was just a quick
"peck" of a hug, but OH MY GOD!!!  She knows ultimate!  In 15 months
of teaching English, no other Japanese student has known ultimate
frisbee, much less wanted to play.</p>
