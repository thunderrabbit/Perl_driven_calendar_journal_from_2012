<p>Tomorrow is payday, and I intend to send money home.  I further
intend to buy a CD case for 50 CDs and do a pretty thorough cleanup
on the pile of crapola in my room.  A lot of the crap is CDs that
quickly become strewn.</p>

<p>I also intend to make a budget for the month; I'm going to watch my
fundage more carefully; I will increase my wealth.</p>
