Annie B OKC: hey rob! its annie b
Rob Nugen: HI Annie B!
Annie B OKC: whats up!
Rob Nugen: Just decided to not study this morning and chattymcchat fora bit
Rob Nugen: I've been *studying* Japanese more than before.
Annie B OKC: excellent!
Annie B OKC: its alot easier to learn a language if you mess with it
             for a couple of hours everyday
Rob Nugen: I had been glossing over it and learning some, but now(past
             week ) I have been putting in some hours each day
Annie B OKC: im teaching italian this summer!
Rob Nugen: You're awesome!
Annie B OKC: thanks, so are you! way to study!
Annie B OKC: how is japan treating you?
Rob Nugen: Ummmmmmmmm
Rob Nugen: I'm getting antsy again
Rob Nugen: I don't know a good way to describe it besides that.
Annie B OKC: itchy feet?
Annie B OKC: antsy time to move or antsy feeling challenged by japan?
Rob Nugen: Well, the feeling underneath the description
Rob Nugen: antsy time to move
Rob Nugen: time to do something
Annie B OKC: i get that all the time
Rob Nugen: time to not have to go to work every day
Rob Nugen: time to have released this belief that I don't have
           enough wealth to do anything I want to do.
Annie B OKC: i say go with the antsy feeling, i always do
Annie B OKC: finish the things that youve started, close things,
             release things, hold on to things that are good and move on
Annie B OKC: thats what i do at least
Annie B OKC: 
Rob Nugen: These are wise words
Annie B OKC: unsolicited advice
Rob Nugen: No unsolicited
Rob Nugen: no = not
Annie B OKC: my friend ben, who just finished studying in paris, was just accepted to Bei Wei U in bejing
Rob Nugen: I learned how to teach the difference betwenn no and not yesterday.
Annie B OKC: we are blessed and cursed with similar itchy feet
Rob Nugen: Way to Bei, Ben!
Annie B OKC: hee hee
Rob Nugen: I've sorta started studying Chinese
Annie B OKC: thats awesome!
Annie B OKC: ben is an amazing person. he just moves around learning languages
Annie B OKC: he owns basically nothing but has such a wealth of experience it doesnt even matter
Rob Nugen: Yah; the grammar is easy; the kanji are not *difficult* in
           that I don't have to learn a new way to do things (just memorize a
           picture) but the speech and listening require a new way to do things
Annie B OKC: wow, im so proud of you rob!
Rob Nugen: Thank you, Annie
Annie B OKC: i have a fear of languages that dont use romanji
Rob Nugen: I feel the love.
9:35 AM
Rob Nugen: Oh mate, .. that's exactly why I had to choose an asian language
Rob Nugen: well, a non romanji language
Rob Nugen: It had to be a difficult language
Rob Nugen: It took me 6 months to learn the Japanese alphabet
Rob Nugen: and that was not studying hardcore
Rob Nugen: maybe an hour a day for 1 week and then an hour per week for some months
Annie B OKC: wow. thats amazing
Rob Nugen: дв
Annie B OKC: i know people that have been studying chinese for years and still dont know it all though
Rob Nugen: does that look like a cross with a loop?
Annie B OKC: nope, it looks like a comma
Rob Nugen: of course; you don't know all English yet
Annie B OKC: good call
Rob Nugen: comma was not my intended character, but on my end it looks like the first japanese alphabet character
Annie B OKC: im thinking about going into translation at some point in my life
Rob Nugen: It's a good business
Annie B OKC: ben and i have dreamed of opening a translation consulting business
Annie B OKC: but i cant see either of us settling in a place long enough
Rob Nugen: If done over the phone, you can do it on the beach.
Rob Nugen: dude! do it over the internet
Annie B OKC: good call!
Rob Nugen: Long as you keep the timezones correctly, the callers won't care where you are
Annie B OKC: well in december im on my way to paris/prague/the republic of georgia/puerto rico
Annie B OKC: then maybe grad school at UT
Rob Nugen: you're going all the way to Texas?
Annie B OKC: at which point ill decide between translation and education, at least for a moment
Annie B OKC: lol...all the way to texas
Rob Nugen: those are the same industries.. well the same brainwaves in ones mind.
Rob Nugen: you can easily do both
Annie B OKC: yes, but i cant get my masters in both at the same time
Rob Nugen: sigh
Annie B OKC: well, i could try, but it wouldnt be healthy for me i dont think
Rob Nugen: silly masters requirements
Annie B OKC: yeah, im not sure if i need my masters to feel better or to look better
Rob Nugen: I get that. You could be like Fred and just stay in school forever.
Annie B OKC: im not sure i can be in US for too much longer
Rob Nugen:  If you'll feel better, that's all you need.
Rob Nugen: yeah; rock out into Europe!
Annie B OKC: i kind of want to go visit some of my old hoods
Annie B OKC: but i think they are all in the midst of war or someother such violence
Rob Nugen: It's interesting when I realize that there are places here that I'll flat miss when I'm gone.
Rob Nugen: oh man.
Rob Nugen: that's heartwrenching
Annie B OKC: it is, i can hardly watch bbc news anymore
9:45 AM
Annie B OKC: tunis and morocco are doing alright i think
Rob Nugen: hold one sec.
Annie B OKC: kk
Rob Nugen: from <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/dailymojo/2004/06/06_514.html">http://www.motherjones.com/news/dailymojo/2004/06/06_514.html</a>

     On Sunday, the Los Angeles Times reported that, in a nearly
     unprecedented act in our country, 26 ex-military and senior
     diplomatic officials, "several appointed to key positions by
     Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, plan to
     issue a joint statement this week arguing that President George
     W. Bush has damaged America's national security and should be
     defeated in November." And retired officials almost invariably
     are speaking for larger constituencies within the government --
     all those potential leakers and mutterers -- who fear speaking
     out publicly themselves.

Rob Nugen: His name somehow jumped to mind when you mentioned heartwrenching world skirmishes
Annie B OKC: you know, i appreciate that people are recognizing that
             our country has, collectively, totally fucked the world, but, it seems
             almost too little to late
Annie B OKC: im so sad to be an american
Annie B OKC: most of the time
Rob Nugen: I know dude; it's a nightmare.
Rob Nugen: I'm mad at bush all the time here.
Rob Nugen: I support the peeps in US but not the govt
Annie B OKC: i give up on the whole situation. the second i can move to the moon, im there
Rob Nugen: Me too.
Annie B OKC: until then, micronesia might be nice
Rob Nugen: Hook it up; those islands have no resources that the US wants
Annie B OKC: exactly
Rob Nugen: you can live there safely for the rest of your life, I imagine
Rob Nugen: calling people for translation services
Annie B OKC: perfect!
Rob Nugen: cha-chan!
Annie B OKC: i think i feel even more pissed off, because i travel
             internationally so much. now every time i leave the country i have to
             be sorry for being an american
Annie B OKC: and i didnt even grow up here!
Rob Nugen: Yearg
Rob Nugen: Yeah; it's a pisser
Annie B OKC: ah well. well, i just wanted to say hey and that i am totally proud of you
Rob Nugen: 
Annie B OKC: i have to run and cook dinner. my poor roomie is super sick
Rob Nugen: Thank you, dear Annie
Rob Nugen: oops
Rob Nugen: do well.
Rob Nugen: Thanks for the love; I love you and support you!!!!
Annie B OKC: keep studying it...its totally worth it!
Rob Nugen: Yay!
Annie B OKC: i love you too!
Annie B OKC: bye
Rob Nugen: bye!
