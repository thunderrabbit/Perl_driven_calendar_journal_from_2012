<p>I'm on the train for work now.  Start at 7pm.  I wonder how many
lessons I'll have.   I'm going to start looking for local students
during the day to augment my income.</p>

<p>7pm student asked me what my 5 year goal was.  I was like, "to
speak 4 languages."</p>

<p>She asked what my 10 year goal was, and I was like, "....." and
then I was like <em>fuckit</em> "in 10 years I'll be a
millionaire."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>How interesting that I forgot to give her the sheet of paper upon
which I wrote my goal.</p>

<p>Gotta start seeing less of Hitomi and more of Jimmy.
Not <em>more</em> of Jimmy, but Jimmy more <em>often</em>.</p>
