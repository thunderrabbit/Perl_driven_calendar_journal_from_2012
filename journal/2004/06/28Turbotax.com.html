<p>The dudes at Turbotax.com are so proud of their ability to process
US tax returns that they assume only people with US addresses will
use their service.  (What?  That rant makes no sense.)</p>

<p>Try this: they have all the tax information about how to pay taxes
while overseas, but they don't allow people to pay for their service
with an overseas credit card.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be so bad if they took other than credit cards, but
they don't.  No auto bank drafts, no paypal, no nothin' (except
state-side credit cards).</p>

<p>And their CSR is closed at night, so I have to wait until my night
to call them and figure out another way to pay them.  Bummer.</p>
