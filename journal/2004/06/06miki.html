<p>Miki tapped on the back of my leg as I stood up on a wall to see
what the fuss was about.  I never could see anything worthy of
shutting down the street for 10 minutes, but that seems to be exactly
what happened.</p>

<p>Miki and I found the venue before doors opened, so we chowed at a
cafe and looked at some guitars and stuff in a nearby music shop.
Such a foreign world to me: musical instruments.</p>

<p>I fell asleep (sitting on a stool) during the first performer, and
then I watched and rather enjoyed Shoko's performance, though I must
say it appeared that she was not super comfortable on stage; I wonder
what her emotional state was like.. not for any particular reason
except she didn't look super relaxed.</p>

<p>Her singing was good though, all in English, which surprised me,
but yeah.  I lip synced (Madonna's ?) "Fever" while Shoko sang.  It
was great.</p>

<p>The headliner was some loud woman that reminded me of a 1980s
country-rock crossover artist.  I pretty much flat did not enjoy it
one bit; plus she was loud, so we headed out after the first few
songs.  Hugged Shoko, "I came to see *you*, not her," and left.</p>

<p>Wandered around Shibuya a bit (Miki doesn't get out that way very
often) and saw three yamamba girls.  Saw more than three girls (plus a
way-larger-than-life-size poster) of a new Japanese style for girls. I
don't have a name for it, but it epitomizes cute/bizarre:</p>

<p>Headwear: pigtails or white chantilly french maid looking hat (or
both).  Dress = white with tiny flower speckle pattern frilly dress
that reminds me of a doll dress.  legs: long stockings (white or tiny
flowers) and shoes: white flats, white heels, or BLACK PLATFORM
shoes.</p>

<p>Anyone know the name for this style?</p>

<p>Said bye to her at the split for yamanote / tokyu lines, and
headed home.</p>

<p>Figured out a work-around for using the name Thunder Rabbit for
profit without stepping on other trademarks.  Only use Thunder as his
name and classify him as Rabbit for his species.  Just never say, "HI,
I'm Thunder Rabbit."</p>
