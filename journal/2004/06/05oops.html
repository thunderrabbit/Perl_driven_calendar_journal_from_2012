<p>Oops. I was supposed to do laundry tonight or in the morning.</p>

<p class=date>4:17am</p>

<p>Okay, I've started my laundry and have taken a shower.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Tonight after work, the gang (Jackie, Tom, Dean, Shoko, Richard, Jo
(Jo left early)) from around here went to karaoke and taunted me for
not going.  "Oh, Rob, you're so <em>boring</em>," dramatized Tom.</p>

<p>So I went with them; it was great fun and quite ...
counter-sleep-inducing.</p>

<p>I left a bit after 3, and Tom showed me to the door, but on the
way threw (hard) a plastic cup onto the floor, "see?  they don't
break!!" as it bounced (unbroken) about 3 feet into the air and
landed on a shelf.</p>

<p>"Tom!  You can't do that!"</p>

<p>"It didn't break now did it?"</p>

<p>I walked him back to the room and relayed the story.  Craziness.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Called Josephine on my way back home to have someone to share the
overall story with.  Nice to talk to her and hear her version of her
high school graduation situation.</p>

<p>I got to my room after talking to her about 30 minutes and
remembered I was supposed to do laundry, which would take another 30
minutes.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p class=date>4:51am JST Sunday 6 June 2004</p>

<p>Okay; I'm ready for bed now.  Laundry is hanging to dry; I'm
set.</p>

<p>Alarm set for 9am.</p>
