<p>12 lessons at work today.  I was a bit tired by the end, not being
as forgiving or generous or whatever it is that I normally am during
lessons.  But, the dude obviously hadn't been studying.  Man; I'm so
fickle and unforgiving now that I've started studying.</p>

<p>I enjoyed chatting with a few chatty students today; Junko passed
her LUT with pretty much no problem.  She wanted to review, so I was
like, "aight," and as soon as she answered the first question (with a
grammar yet beyond that which was requested), I knew she would finish
the review and pass the test in the same lesson.  Money.</p>

<p>Jesse and I played hackeysack during our 5:30 break after we got
non-caffeine genki drinks from the woman giving them away across the
street.  They worked, or the placebo effect was great; Jesse and I
were doing some mad kicks and awesome hackey sackey moves that we
hadn't been able to do before.</p>

<p>There was a scooter nearby labeled SCOOPY, which is either a brand
name or model name that I've seen on other scooters (or this one
scooter is stalking me) and the sack landed over near the scooter and
I was like, "hey scooter, that was to you," and Jesse said something
else and I was like, "don't be scoopid," but it was funny and not mean
sounding like it sounds in this story.  Jesse laughed more than I
thought was appropriate for the joke; it wasn't *that* funny, but it
certainly wasn't mean.  Anyway; it was funny.</p>

<p>I wrote 8 postcards to different students today.  And I got two
5-5s in the past couple of days.  That's awesome for me; I had been
lagging way behind; I got zero for the last paycheck, but I think they
got cancelled because I had a couple of 2-2s.  Oops.  But it's set so
I won't have those students again.</p>
