HI Dad

Thank you for having taught me how to use basic building tools.  Today
I went downstairs to find my apartment manager trying to put together
a bookcase.  He was having some problems with doing it; I could see
that his technique could be easily optimized.

You taught me how to use basic physics to make the job easier.  How to
use a screwdriver quickly; the importance of supporting the surface into
which the screw is being screwed.  He was thankful for my help, and I
am thankful to you.

I always enjoyed watching and helping you build things.  Now I have
been able to help others.

    With Love
    - Rob
