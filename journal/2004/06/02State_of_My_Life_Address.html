<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

Since my last update, I had a ridiculously painful cramp in my lower
back, went to the chiropractor two days in a row for massage,
accupuncture and two types of heat therapy.  But don't worry; my back
is mostly perfect now.

This evening I made plans with two of my friends to climb Mt Fuji next
month.  We're going to make a three day adventure of it: up on the
afternoon of July 12th, down on July 13th, and then bask in an onsen
in Izu overnight in a bed and breakfast.  There are four official
trails up the mountain.  We're choosing the most difficult one (just
to say we did it, and) because it's the least crowded.  We'll go down
a different trail (which therefore requires a trek halfway around the
crater) so it will be like we climbed *over* Mt Fuji.  Should be great
fun.

I have done a bit of research and have found there may be as many as
30 roller coasters in the greater Tokyo area.  It seems that some of
the parks no longer exist, so maybe there are only 20-few coasters,
but there are still plenty that I've not seen.  Including some bigger
ones.

I'm scheduled to go with my friend Jen who will photograph some of the
coasters at Yumiuriland on June 10th.  And on that same day, Dan (my
awesome ex-roommate) and I will go bunjee jumping!!

Speaking of my awesome ex-roommate, Dan sent me a link to pb and I'm
interested in joining their 47th Global Voyage (October - January
2005).  It should be an amazing adventure!

Just last week I began learning Mandarin.  I learned [are you well?],
[I am well.], [he], [she], and [thank you].  This includes reading and
writing the seven kanji for these words and phrases.  Tomorrow is my
second lesson.

In Japanese, I'm far from fluent, but I can exchange basic
biographical information, make plans to meet people and describe my
daily activities.  Awesome.

I hope you're doing great.

  With Love
