<p>Helping Yasuko with her speech.  It's harder than fuck and I really
feel for her.  I wrote it, and while I don't feel any guilt about the
speech itself, I do feel empathy for her; I know it's a difficult
process to cram a speech in a different language into my head, so I
assume it's the same for her.</p>

<p>We're kickin' it at Denny's now, about to leave.  I gave her
notecards that I hadn't really used in 11 months (actually the green
ones that janette gave me when I first got here).  I kept the ones I
had used and gave Yasuko the rest.  Pay it Forward.  Plus Maggie's
logic; I'm not using it, so I might as well give it to someone who
can benefit from it.</p>
