<p>Wow.  It seems that internet access is available at more than one
(many?) points along the Rinkai line.  I'm at a set of three
computers (that require 100 yen per ten minutes of use, but) next to
which I can get an internet signal at no charge.</p>

<p>This makes me think it will soon (as these free access points
become more common) be necessary to implement the secure pop3 access
that I was reading about before.  I wonder how to verify that it's
working.</p>

<p>But right now I need to get off the fucking computer and study!</p>
