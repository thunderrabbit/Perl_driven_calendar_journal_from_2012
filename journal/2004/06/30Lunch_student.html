<p>In 15 minutes, I'm supposed to meet a private student for the first
time.  She doesn't speak English well, and I don't actually know her
name nor what she looks like, but, here I am at <em>McDonald's</em>
(*) (!) waiting for her.</p>

<p>(*) This is the second time I've been to McDonald's in Japan to
actually eat anything besides a vanilla shake.  The first time was to
meet a student for the first time.  He bought be a chicken sandwich
and subsequently called me after having chosen someone else to be his
girlfriend's teacher.</p>

<p>(!) According to an article (which could be fake, but likely isn't
due to the possibility of being sued for slander) in one of the
business textbooks at Gaba, three new McDonald's restaurants are
opened <em>each day</em></p>

<p>It went fine.  I was a bit nervous before meeting her, but remained
generally relaxed in the stomach.  When she originally called me, she
was like, "I have a kid" or "can you teach my kid?"  and I was like,
"okay."</p>

<p>I didn't know which she had said, but I was ready for the
possibility.  Every mom and kid that arrived made me like, <em>??  Is
she the one?</em>  Until finally I got continued eye contact from a
woman and I knew she was the one.</p>

<p>Walked to her house while merging Japanese with English with mom
and daughter.  Found out the daughter's name is Hanami.  Found out her
toy stuffed cat's name is Nekosan (Mr Cat), a good name for a cat.</p>

<p>On the way to their house, mom told me she has another child; a few
month old son.  Grandma is around, and I wondered about appropriate
behavior when meeting her.  I wondered more about what materials we
might need to buy.  I chose not to suggest that we buy books or other
materials after the lesson.</p>

<p>We arrived in their house and I just hung out in the living room
playing with Hanami.  I asked her name again and found out
it's <em>Sanami</em>.  She cracked out her crayons and a pad of paper.
I was telling her colors and she was coloring and I tried some of the
Nova-style teaching because she had just yesterday finished a Nova
kids class (but it didn't work too well for her so I aborted
that).</p>

<p>She had trouble with "red" and I taught her some new colors; light
blue, brown, peach.  I was like, "do you have any books?"  and mom
came into the living room and hooked us up with some books.  four
different books of different varieties of difficulty and style of
writing.  Some used Japanese and English translations, some were only
English very easy level and one was higher level.</p>

<p>We scheduled 6 more classes over the next two months.  Awesome.</p>
