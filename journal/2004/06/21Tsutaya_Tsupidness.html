<p>Went to Tsutaya (Japanese Blockbuster, but I don't think it's the
same company) to rent A.I. to watch with Hitomi.</p>

<p>Presented my card and she was like, "wanwanwanwan," and I had no
idea what she was saying, but Hitomi did.  The card had expired.</p>

<p>Okay, I can understand them wanting me to pay more money each year
for membership.  I can understand them wanting to keep their database
up to date.  I can understand them wanting to replace my old card
with their "new-improved-look" card.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>I do not appreciate having to fill out another application form.</p>

<p>My information should be on computer.  They should be like, "is
your info the same?" and if I say no then they change it.  If I say
yes then they leave me the fuck alone.</p>

<p>Now, I grant that my information *has* changed.  But I don't want
to have to fucking fill out another form!  Who keeps these forms and
pets them and waters them and gives a shit about them?  Put the info
on computer and be done with it!</p>
