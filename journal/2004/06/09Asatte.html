<p>In Japanese, 明後日（あさって）(asatte) means the day after
tomorrow.  Miki and I are at the theater now to watch the Day After
Tomorrow, tickets for which I bought yesterday. We jut ate okonomiyaki
at Kawasaki BE (name of building) on the 8th floor in the
cook-it-yerself okonomiyaki shop.  I saw a toned-down yamamba woman
there; and then 3 others who were even more toned down; I wonder if
it's common for them to chow okonomiyaki in the morning.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'm going to see Troy with Hitomi (after going to
Yomiuriland with Dan (to go bunjee jumping!!)).</p>
