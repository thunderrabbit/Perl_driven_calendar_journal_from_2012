<p>Lunch with Hitomi was nice by the bay.  Bright sun; families with
kids and couples and businessmen enjoyed the weater.  Kids swam in the
bay, boats boated around.  We ate bentos from SunKus and chatted
brokenly in English and Japanese.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>We'll hang out tonight after our respective jobs finish.  I was
willing to loan my key to my room, but basically took back the offer
because I want to be there when she sees the Winnie the Pooh sandals I
bought for her to walk around the house (in the past she's been
slomping around in my huge sandals).  I don't know if the sandals are
too big, but if they are, I wanna be able to tell her to not feel
obligated to wear them; we can exchange them.  But I couldn't give her
my key, tell her to not notice the sandals, (and if she did notice, to
not assume she had to accept them if they're too big,) and not tell
her I got her sandals.</p>
