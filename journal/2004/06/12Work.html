<p>Hung out with Mariko during lunch; she had just gotten back from
Brisbane for a month.  She has the cutest ever freckles.  Like they
were designed to be cute.</p>

<p>Jesse and I played hackey sack; it was fun; especially while on the
way to the parking lot that we found, there was a dog sitting
patiently inside a store..  The dog looked so *real* it was just
amazing (and it was real) because it was like a siberian husky with
bright blue piercing eyes and perky ears.  Funny that we could shift
our weight from leg to leg and s/he would watch us go back and
forth.</p>
