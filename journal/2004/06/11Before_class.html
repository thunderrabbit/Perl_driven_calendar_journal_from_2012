<p>On my way to Motosumiyoshi station, a guy was like, "HI" to me in
the street like he knows me but it turns out he was propositioning me
for sex.  He started with, "what train station is that?" pointing back
toward Motosumiyoshi though he was coming *from* that direction.
Should have been the first tip, plus he was on a bicycle, second tip
(lost people don't have bikes).  Fuck I was mad that he lied to me to
get my attention.  I was close to missing the train because of
him.</p>

<p>But, because the train was 2 minutes late, I didn't miss it.  It
was arriving just as I got into the station; had it not been late, I
woulda missed it and I woulda wanted to kill that guy.</p>

<p>Why all this talk about killing people?  What's gotten into my
brainwaves these days?</p>

<p>I was two minutes late to class, which would normally not be a
problem because Ayana is always late.</p>
