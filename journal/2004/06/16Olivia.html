Hello everybody,

Well finally I have got a job that I am interested in!

As most of you know I was so ready to pack up and come back to
Japan- and I also got a job offer at a kids school in
Yokohama (yes Jen- Yokohama 'new town'!) starting as soon as I
could get there with visa sponsorship this morning...... 1 day
too late! Because- im to LAS VEGAS!!!! a ha ha ha!! No- Im really
going to Turkey!!! Ok- heres the deal. Its a nanny job. I will be
working for a family of 4. The father is the Director of a
cosmetic company, the mother is a super busy housewife (!!), the
son is 5 and the daughter is 3. They live most of the year in
Istanbul, but we will be spending the next 3 months of summer at
their holiday home in Bodrum. Bodrum is on the coast of Turkey,
near Greece, its a big resort/marina town. They have a couple who
live with them too, the lady does the cooking and cleaning and
the man fixes the gardens. So that leaves me to look after the
kids with the hope of teaching them english too (1st word Ill
teach them: 'suntanning').

Well I hope its a nice job. The man has been lovely so far. Im
sure it will be a great experience anyway because I have always
wanted to go to Turkey so its a great oppertunity for me. And in
the last year and a half I havent had much beach action so Im
looking forward to sitting on a beach and swimming in their pool
for the next 3 months. I think I leave for Istanbul on Thursday
or Friday. Actually I went looking at airfares today, and then
the man called and asked when I wanted to go, so I think he is
organising the flight..... no complaints from me!

Im sure there will be some crazy culture shock. Apparently
Turkish is really difficult to learn and they speak very
fast...ahh!! Oh well- im so used to getting my point across in
mime I should have no problems. I wonder if they know what i mean
if I cross my arms in front of me???

Besides the job news, London has been OK still. Last weekend I
met up with some friends from Adelaide (Tash and Dom, and Jamie
for those of you who know them). Jamies girlfriend cooked a much
needed big dinner, and then after a few drinks we went out to a
bar that was kind of cool. Actually there was one character that
had me in hysterics all night.... thank god for drunk old women!!
That Sunday Tash and I house hunted. Well that was quite an
adventure. A cheap place was our mission so that lead us to the
pooerer parts of Brixton- we decided we didnt think it was the
safest option living there! But as it turns out shes moving to a
friends and Im going- worked out great that we didnt find
anything anyway.

I must admit Im going to be a little sad to say goodbye to my
hostel. The guys who run it are Polish. They have nothing to do
but sit around the hostel and go a little crazy. But they are
good entertainment value and always a good laugh. And I fluent in
Polish (Polish swear words that is). The Brazilian girl I am
sharing my room with- Tasi- has been there since I moved in .
Shes looking for nanny work too so we have spent a little time
together and made good friends..... travelling's always about
goodbyes hey!

Thanks for all your advice, support and lovely emails. The last 3
weeks have been really hard and I would have jumped off the Big
Ben had it not been for my great friends and family... THANKYOU
ALL!!!

Take it easy!
Love Olivia
