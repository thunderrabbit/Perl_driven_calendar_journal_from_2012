<p>I've had four awesome students today!  Even though I'm working on
only 3.5ish hours of sleep (Tom was so loud (and drunk) when he came
back.  I came out in my underwear, "Tom, I have to be at work in 4
hours."</p>

<p>"Oh no; I've seen Rob's underwears.") I'm really genki and
pumped.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first two students were Junko (same woman for two
lessons), who looks up words in <em>English</em> unlike most students
and who really really tries to learn the stuff; awesome.</p>

<p>Next student *also* looks up words in English (I assure you it's a
rarity) and we had a great chatola.</p>

<p>Next student is super beginner level, but really genki and really
tries and really just.. wow.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Whooohoo! Junko gave me a 5-5!</p>

<p>My last student was Yuki.  First time to meet her and she chewed
through a pile of conjugations past, present, future, present
continuous, past perfect...  and seemed to understand them all.  She's
seen them all before, but presented in a pile, relating each one to
the others seemed to help.</p>
