<p>Tired.  supposed to be in Shibuya in 7.5 hours.  Been fucking
around with my site; got google adwords going, but they don't seem to
be serving ads for my site yet.  That's because they haven't crawled
it yet, it seems.  I don't know if/when that will happen.  I don't
know if I will perpetually have no ads because I'm always changing my
URL (each day) or what.</p>
