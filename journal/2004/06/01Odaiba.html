<p>Went to Odaiba with Hitomi.  At a free internet point in Tokyo
Teleport station but train is here now.</p>

<p class=date>1:56pm</p>

<p>I probably woulda had time to upload the above, but I didn't know
how long the train planned to wait.  Near 30 seconds, it seems.</p>

<p>In Odaiba, we chowed cheese pizza and then chocolate banana pizza
for dessert.  We decided we'll visit Joyopolis sometime; it looks like
a pretty fun place to go.</p>

<p>After she went to work (2 minutes late), I walked around the area
and found a pretty cool image 'board' thing..  It's called "between
the lines" and uses multicolored leds to make images appear to move
across the screen.  But the leds are arranged in thin vertical lines
quite far apart:</p>

<pre>
|         |         |         |         |         |         |
|         |         |         |         |         |         |
|         |         |         |         |         |         |
|         |         |         |         |         |         |
</pre>

<p>but the images were still rather easy to perceive.  I was
impressed.</p>

<p>By the nature of the setup, it can only make objects appear to move
horizontally across the screen.  It can't do vertical motion (except
raindrops) and can't do static images (except vertical lines).</p>

<p>On the way back to Tokyo Teleport (sounds really futuristic, but
it's just a big train station (save that it has free internet access)
in Odaiba), I tried to shake the massive semi-suspension bridge.  The
bridge has a single vertical tower thing and then big cables reaching
down to the center of the bed (?) of the bridge.  Under the longest of
these cables I lodged my body and pushed up with my shoulder.  I
couldn't see the cable move, but I *think* I could feel the wave pulse
after it went up to the top and back.  This effect may have been due
to a great effort of strength or great wishful thinking on my part.  I
wasn't able to get the entire bridge to perceptibly move.</p>
