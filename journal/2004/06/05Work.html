<p>Pissed today at work because a student who had chosen two of my
lessons today was suprised to find one of the lessons had been smurfed
away from her.  If the fuckin' client choices are so important that
"they can't be changed" (and I came in (for one (1) lesson) when I was
supposed to be *off* because someone fucked up my requested schedule
(for April (or May (?))) but a client requested my lesson) but then
suddenly today the chosen lesson disappears from the student?  That is
Fucked Up.</p>
