<p>Quite productive today.  Spent 2 or 3 hours working on Chinese;
copying the cassette to my computer and creating 41 individual .mp3
files that I now have in iTunes.  I made a CD of them and it's all
good.  Except that for some reason the CD player I have doesn't want
to play the CD well.  It plays it a bit and then craps out.  But I can
listen to them on computer.</p>

<p>Hitomi helped me bigtime with my Japanese homework.  I have CDs for
the Japanese book and they help me big big bigtime on Japanese.  Damn;
I wish I had gone through with the CDs before.  I think my retention
would be *way* higher.  I'm going to go back through the book with
these CDs and do everything.  I'm now on the *last* chapter and (had I
been using them, would be) on the last half of the last CD... and
today is the first day I used the CDs.</p>

<p>Before I use the second book, I'm going to buy the CDs for it.</p>

<p>Hitomi is going through her English textbook and workbook.
Awesome.</p>
