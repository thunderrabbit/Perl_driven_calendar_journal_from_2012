<p>Hanging out with Hitomi a lot does two major things: helps me have
time to speak Japanese; helps me forget about writing in my
journal.</p>

<p>Today at work I had a great cool new student named Rumi (I think)
who was awesome because she did something really novel.  <em>She took
notes!</em> yeah duh that's a no brainer but by far far far most of
the students do not take notes; man teaching these man to man kiddos
reallllly drives home the necessity of studying at home.  You fuckin'
gotta study.  I'm becoming more obnoxious about telling them; no slack
from booth 17; you have got to study or you won't pass this book.  No
coddling.</p>

<p>I also had Hiroyuki today.  He's got an awesome grandfather voice;
soothing like Morpheus when he first met Neo.  He's great because he
only defines things in English; he occassionally brings in Beatles'
lyrics to study natural English.  Today he asked me if I preferred to
say "incidentally," or "by the way," when changing the topic of
conversation.</p>

<p>I was like, "I just say 'oh,' and then change the subject," but
when I thought about it more, I realized I don't change subjects very
often, so I don't really have opportunity to use any topic changing
devices.</p>

<p>He goes, "I agree with how you are feeling," (or actually something
more obtuse than that) and I changed it to, "I know what you
mean."</p>

<p>What he meant, more precisely, was that he didn't talk much in
Japanese.  He explained, "I am a native speaker of Japanese; I don't
need to practice speaking.  But when I have an opportunity to speak
English, I speak as much as I can."</p>

<p>Wow.  I know it intellectually, but he.. I don't know- he's just
like as much of a father figure as a student can be.  Today on the way
home, I talked with Junko as much as I could manage in Japanese.  It
was more than I would have previously.</p>

<p>The feeling was like, <em>it's more important to practice than to
be correct</em> combined with <em>people will be more impressed with
my effort than unimpressed with my errors.</em></p>

<p>In the past, it's really been a challenge for me to get over the
fear of what other people will think about me for things I do.</p>
