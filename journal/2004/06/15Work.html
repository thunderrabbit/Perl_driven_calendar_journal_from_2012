on the herd of horses on my bookshelf.</p>

<p>"What their name?"</p>

<p>I wrote her sentence as, "What ___ their name   ?" and she
couldn't correct it.</p>

<p>I asked and wrote a new sentence, "How many horses are there?"</p>

<p>She counted in Japanese and then gave me the answer.</p>

<p>"Can you make a sentence?"</p>

<p>"Thirteen horse ... there."  '...' indicates her pause, not what
I wrote.</p>

<p>"Good Japanese grammar."  I rearranged the sentence on paper.</p>

<p>"There ___ 13 horse__"</p>

<p>"Are."</p>

<p>"Excellent."</p>

<p>"There are 13 horse..es."</p>

<p>"Faster."</p>

<p>"There are 13 horses."</p>

<p>"Okay good;" I pointed to her first question.</p>

<p>"Are?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"What are their name..z."</p>

<p>"Okay, please ask me."</p>

<p>"What are their names?"</p>

<p>"Their names are Joe, Julie, Juniper, Julius, Jasper, Jericho,
George, Jeff, James, Jorge, Janette, Janet and Jane."  Fuckin' hell
how did I not think of janette sooner?</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"No." rising tone to indicate the preposterousness of the
possibility.</p>

<p>I changed the last one to Junko because that was her name, and
gave her a yellow horse (one of five yellow horses).</p>

<p>Last lesson was with a cat (not a horse, mind you) named Takuyuki,
who is super laid back; almost beyond my preference, but definitely
cool.</p>
