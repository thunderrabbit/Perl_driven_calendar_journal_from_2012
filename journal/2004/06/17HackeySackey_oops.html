<p>Jen and I joined Dan in Tsunashima for some Hackey Sack Jack.  I
ended up with Jesse's footbag last week when he and I finished playing
for the day, and he encouraged me to make sure it had fun in Tunashima
(Tuna Island).  We named Jesse's sack Jim.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jim didn't get much kick time; we lost it on top of
a sign.  We talked to the guard near the building, but he didn't seem
too interested in helping us; I don't think he was impressed with our
play time.</p>

<p>We still had Jack and Jill though, so it was no problem.  I sent
Jesse an email asking where he got his footbag (and if he had it
insured (haha)) so I can buy him another if we don't get his off the
sign.  No reply from Jesse as yet.</p>

<p>Dan got the world's world's world record with forty-eight kicks,
but (!), he didn't get it back to me before a man walked by and said,
"oh great," which broke Dan's concentration <em>two kicks shy
of <b>fifty</b></em> which requires us to not tally this astonishing
feat of footwork as the offical world record, but as an anomally in
the Tuna Island Hackey Sackey Wacky History.</p>

<p>Update on Jesse's footbag: he called me and I told him it was fine;
he must not have gotten my email; I'm not sure what to do now..</p>
