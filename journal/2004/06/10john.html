<p>"All my life I've been waiting to use the word melancholy.  Just
got that out of the way."</p>

<p>John borrowed 200 yen for me to get a beer.  I know he has a

supporting it.</p>

<p>He said he was melancholy because his divorce is about to become
final.  She's moving to Brazil or some such.</p>
