<p>A.I. is on TV now downstairs.  I stopped by to watch for a bit on
my way to bring the laundry upstairs.</p>

<p>Hitomi is helping by hanging it. (!--)</p>

<!--

<p>can I just say for a minute that I'm really beginning to like
(and be afraid about) having Hitomi's domestic help around here?  At
the same time I'm like, "what do you want to do?" but don't really
get an answer</p>

<p>This makes me think about marriage, and at the same time scares the
crapola out of me and makes me want to run run run aaaahhhhhh far
away; all such interesting emotions stemming from a little apparently
selfless help around the house.</p>

<p>And so meticulous!  I was just like, [hang] [hang] [hang] [done].
But all the wrinkles are being removed; this freaks me out. ]]</p>

<p>It's like there's still Sally running around in California and
Hitomi is great but shorter than I want in a partner (but still pretty
muscley) though she has done some cool shit that I've never done
(climbed the pyramids and gone scuba diving and sky diving).  Awesome
stuff.</p>

<p>So I'm torn; Sally has still got this like, "reserved position" in
my mind; like I'll set aside all others for her, but I don't really
100% know her; she's been my friend for several years, but we've never
lived in the same city for subsantial hangout time.  Sex is awesome
with her and play is awesome with her; and living with her for a week
or two was awesome, but forever?  I dunno.  I want to know, but I
don't know yet.</p>
