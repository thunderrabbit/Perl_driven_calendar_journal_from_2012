<p>Some things in Japan are technologically cooler than things in the
US.  One: phones.  Two: ATMs.  The ATMs are more expensive than in the
US (we get charged fees more often here) but the ATMs kick ass.</p>

<p>First thing:  ATMs in Japan will <em>update your bank book</em>.
No more "where did all my money go?"  All the transactions to/from
your account are printed in your bank book.  Just open the book to
the latest page and it will print all the transactions since the last
time you put in the book.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the ATMs <em>turn the page</em> when they run
out of lines on the current page.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Second thing: ATMs in Japan accept cash deposits <em>and they count
the cash</em> that's deposited.  Throw in the cash, it counts it and
says, "14000 yen counted.  Is this correct?" and if you push yes then
bang it smurfs the money and it's done.  If you push no, then I assume
a bank person comes and ya count the money again and put it in.  I
dunno.</p>

<p>Third thing:  ATMs in Japan accept and dispense <em>coins</em>.
Just today I deposited 4050 yen worth of coins mostly in 50, 10, 5
and 1 yen coins.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>There was one detail; I put the coins into the wrong slot.  Poured
them down into the cash acceptance slot and not the coin acceptance
slot.  Fuck.  Felt pretty embarassed, but the bank employee was like,
"¤¤¤¤¤¨" (don't worry) and took the money out from the back and
brought it back to the front and did the deposit for me.</p>

<p>What happened was when I pushed the button that said [coin], the
coin slot didn't open, so I assumed maybe it only dispensed coins.
Wrong.  She pushed the coin button for like 1/2 second (instead of
just tapping it like I had) and the coin deposit slot opened.  Silly
me.</p>
