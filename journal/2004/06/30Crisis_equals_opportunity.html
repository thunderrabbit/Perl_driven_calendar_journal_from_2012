Rob Nugen: my friend is having a crisis
Casey Jones: how so?
Rob Nugen: crisis = opportunity in Chinese
Rob Nugen: Um.. several things happening all at once, each of which need specific attention
Casey Jones: ahh
Rob Nugen: I can list the several things;... but what would have been
           better is if I could have recorded her tirade, which was
           not done in a frantic crazy manner, but just a bit fast,
           and just so much stuff..
Casey Jones: hahah
Rob Nugen: I need to zoom; I'm meeting a private student for the first time in a couple hours.
Casey Jones: later man
Rob Nugen: I have just woken up (it's 1pm) (woke up at noon)
Rob Nugen: and need to take a shower so I can smell like a fresh flower instead of like a rally.
Casey Jones: haha
Rob Nugen: Hugs to you!
Casey Jones: Have a great day
Rob Nugen: too. bye!
