<p>At work yesterday, something was triggering in my head each time I
wrote the date 14 June 2004 on the note papers I wrote for the
students.  (Also, due to slight pain in my wrist, I didn't write notes
for students who obviously weren't doing homework, nor taking notes
themselves.)</p>

<p>After work, I received an email from Masashi:</p>

Dear Rob-san

Happy your Memorial Birthday!

Did you enjoy today? I hope you did well.

<p>Holy cow I had forgotten it was my 12,500th day.  Well, I won't
forget 13,000.  That will be on, let's see.. 27 October 2005.</p>
