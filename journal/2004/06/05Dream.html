<p>Dream 1</p>

<p class=dream>Riki noticed the keys and had taken off the other keys
from the ring and left the one key in my doorknob, so he could
pretend he noticed them in the first place, or something</p>

<p>Dream 2</p>

<p class=dream>There were giraffes sitting in the apartment, and I was
petting them.  Because they were kneeling, I could see them eye to
eye.  I was petting one and my mom and Jon had just gotten back from
vacation, and had gotten some gifts.  Ma gave me her gift for Jon
asked me to give it to him, and when he asked me to give a gift to
her, I slipped hers into his pocket.  He was a giraffe, so I just
slipped it into his pocket.  Then I gave the third gift to their
youngest daughter who I didn't really know, but who hugged me and was
happy to have the gift.</p>

<p>Dream 3</p>

<p class=dream>I was chilling with Wende, and gave her a kiss on the
cheek when she said something nice about me.  She asked if I should
be doing that and I was like, "no."  Her fiance called her, driving
the point home.</p>

<p>Dream 4</p>

<p class=dream>I was maintaining two apartments.  One cost 580
dollars, and was not really being used.  I also lived in the spare
room in the Stuebing's apartment place (my old boss).  It was
Christmas Eve and I hadn't gotten anything for them, but I knew they
would have gotten things for me.  I figured the best thing I could
get them was to move out of their space.  I composed a letter in my
mind that I would write to them.</p>

<p class=dream>I was also living in a dorm room type space, and my
space was really messy and a new kid was moving in.  When he first
walked in, he rolled his eyes back in his head to make a strange first
impression.  I thought <em>I'm too old to be here</em> and <em>why am
I the one who is living in the extra space?  I should get a proper
room.</em></p>

<p>I woke up in my own room in Japan.</p>
