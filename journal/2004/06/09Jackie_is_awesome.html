Someone has probably already mentioned this, but Uranus *does* come before
Neptune. 

The recitation of the order of the planets was one of the first things I
ever memorized, after the alphabet and numbers. I can rattle them off like a
mo. 

Now. It's Neptune, right, not Uranus that has the funky orbit? Because
at times, Pluto is not the farthest from sun (minus the wacky extra
planet), but Neptune is. At least, I'm assuming that its Neptune,
because that's the next farthest from the sun, and I don't think the
third farthest would have such a wacky orbit that it would outdistance
two planets. Or I would remember that it outdistanced two and not
one. So yes. I've just proved my own point that Neptune is the second
(third - I must tell you I still sorta think that other planet isn't
really a planet, just too big of a rock to be called a meteor)
farthest from the sun.

Oh Jackie!

Wow!!  Thank you!  I very rarely get corrections on my journal; so no,
I had not heard this from anybody else.  See, I have the wires crossed
in my mind; I "learned" it by trying to remember if "your anus" is
farthest away or second farthest away.  For members of the general
population, I can say, "I don't want your anus anywhere near me," and
so I remembered it as farthest away.  I think I thought of the idea of
the mneumonic before I determined if it was accurate or not.  Damn.

Okay, in the acronym MVEMJSUNP, there is "SUN" (I hate putting the
period inside quotes). Maybe that will let me remember.

Thank you for being such a cool astronomically aware person.  You are
awesome.  :-)

I have to zoom (I'm going to watch "The Day After Tomorrow") A few
days ago I said in Japanese, "Just now, I thought tomorrow I will
watch Day After Tomorrow" The epitome of my ability to make puns in
Japanese.

In Japanese the name of this movie is pronounced "Za Day Afta Tomoro-"
which has 'no meaning' in Japanese.  For fun I say "asatte," which
means the day after tomorrow, when I mention this movie in Japanese.
(It's cool they have a word for day after tomorrow.)

Okay I have to go!  Quit being so cool that you'll understand
everything my brain is thinking so that I want to keep talking to you!

Actually don't quit that.  I love your brain and the you that goes with it.

	Hugs
	- Rob!!!!!

Hahaa I love that line.

Yes, OH wait!! Fuck I have to go, BUT

PLUTO is the one with the eccentric orbit.  The gas giants are stable
as shit.  Neptune rotates at a funky angle, (or is it Uranus?)  but
their orbits are near circular.  Pluto, the captured planet, has the
nutty orbit.

	See you!!
