<p>Yesterday work was pretty good; I had 6 lessons in a row and banged
them out with pretty much no problem.  Four of the students I had
never previously met.  I had the super laid back cool cat again; he
reminds me of someone from back home, but I don't remember who.  Maybe
Allen, the owner of Fly High Little Bunny crossed with Wende's friend
Stacey's ex-boyfriend who went to raves a lot.  Sean, I think.</p>

<p>After work, Hitomi came to Motosumiyoshi to meet me; she brought
dinner, sashimi, salad and something else I'm not sure what to call.
Super delicious; and so much food that I have enough for lunch
today.</p>

<p>Basically zonked out after that; super tired.</p>
