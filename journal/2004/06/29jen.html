<p>Talked to Jen tonight after work.  (Work = 7 lessons, some cool
students)</p>

<p>Oh wait, I talked to <em>¿ÎÈþ</em> after work for 48 minutes and 38
seconds.  She told me she had read my journal entry, and I was like,
"oh fuck; sorry I wanted to <em>tell</em> you and not have you read
it," but so we talked about it and I was like (in poor Japanese) "I
like you a lot and therefore I don't do my Japanese homework or write
my books."  I just want to be friends.</p>

<p>So, we talked a lot about what was what and in the end she said
something really heartwrenching for me.  "In the future, I want to be
friends, but for now good night."</p>

<p>My heart jumped; I didn't want it to be the end.  I wanted to
prolong the connection.</p>

<p>Jen confirms what I knew in my heart; Hitomi has retained her power
and dignity by making that statement.  I'm glad Hitomi said that.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I'm sad.</p>
