<p>And finally, this bit of a mystery:</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/around_town/kawasaki/escalator.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/around_town/kawasaki/thumbs/escalator.jpg"></a></p>

<p>First, figure out everything you can about this picture.</p>

<p>If one is Jen, one would discern a list like the following:</p>

<p><ol>
<li><p>There's a person on an escalator</p></li>
<li><p>The person is standing on the escalator</p></li>
<li><p>The person is approaching the end of the escalator
<br>(which could explain why their right foot seems to be about to take a
step.)</p></li>
</ol></p>

<p>To be continued.</p>
