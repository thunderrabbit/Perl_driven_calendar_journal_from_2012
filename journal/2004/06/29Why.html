<p>So why do I want these things?  Why do I want anything?  I seem to
enjoy some things more than others.  I don't want to live in Iraq
cause it doesn't sound like fun; it seems dangerous.  I don't want to
have kids cause it sounds like hard work.  I don't want to do
anything that sounds a lot like work.</p>

<p>I do trust that I can find some way to make a living doing things
that I enjoy doing.  I've come to believe that I can make money
writing books. How about I work on a book instead of rant?</p>

<p>Maybe this *is* the book.</p>
