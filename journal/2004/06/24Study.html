<p>Today I have straight up studied.  And now, thanks to Jen, I have
a <em>table</em> in my room.  There was on in her room when she moved
in, and she didn't want it, so she offered it to me. It's perfect for
studying.</p>

<p>Everyone is complaining about the heat except me.  And I'm less
than complaining; I'm *loving*  it.</p>

<p>I'm at my new table, with my newly enhanced (*) wireless internet
connection on, and it's allll good.</p>

<p>(*) The wireless hub was moved closer to my room.</p>

<p>Every time John opens his door, I can smell the amazing stench of
cigarettes.  So gross.  I..feel sorry for him.</p>

<p>"HI John; how are you?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask."</p>
