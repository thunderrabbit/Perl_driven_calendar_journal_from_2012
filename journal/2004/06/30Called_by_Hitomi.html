<p>Hitomi called me at noon and asked if she could get her stuff.</p>

<p>I'm happy about her calling.  I was happy to hear from her.  I hope
we can switch to friends mode.</p>

<p>Jen came to my room at 12:30.  She came in and I was like, "she
called me."</p>

<p>"Really?  She called me too, about 6am."</p>

<p><em>What??  Why did Hitomi call you at 6am, and how did she even
get your phone number?</em> </p>

<p>Jen, it turns out, was talking about Olivia.</p>

<p>Olivia, hating how badly she was being treated by the kids she was
nannying, left in the middle of the night and is coming back to
Japan.</p>

<p>wow.</p>
