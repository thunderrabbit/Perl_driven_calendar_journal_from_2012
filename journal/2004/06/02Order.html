<p>I just read <a
href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0610.html?m=1">Kurzweil's
Law (aka "the law of accelerating returns")</a>.  As I read some of
the comments, I heard the front door to the building open and close
and a woman come in totally crying.  She seemed to be alone, and in
insatiable sadness.  (I went out to see if it was Shoko, and found
that it's Jo, who I don't know all that well, so I chose not to knock
on her door to offer help.  I'd be more disruptive than helpful, I'm
sure (which brings up an interesting point that my small brain is
barely able to keep track of))</p>

<p>So back in my room, thinking about chaos and disruptive
technologies and now a woman crying.  She's in her own bit of chaos
right now; will she emerge 'on the other side' with a bit more order
in her life?  Even as I type, I can hear that she's stopped crying and
has gone toward the restroom, presumably to wash her face, to recover
from the chaos of sadness.</p>

<p>I like the line about "noise is unpredictable.  information is
too."</p>

<p>I want to apply this to learning languages, when noise slowly
becomes predictable and turns into information.   Does that mean
noise and information are the same?  That we just don't know the
language of noise?  Probably.</p>

<p>I take the the first comment on the page as some guy all, "hey man
you can't mean that machines will replace humans."</p>

<p>I think the intent is not that machines will replace humans, but
that machines <em>could</em> replace humans.  But more specifically
he's not talking about machines replacing humans; he's talking about
evolution happening more quickly in machines than it does in
humans.</p>

<p>I can take the idea backwards a step (or two?) and oh yes here we
go: big bang and ya got a lot of hydrogen everywhere.  (Take it back
three steps and something doesn't work right with the time dimension;
matter coalescing into protons and atoms happened more quickly than
step 2, star formation).  Via gravity (Mr Hamm said he read a tome
titled "GRAVITY" that was <em>this thick</em>, indicated with
outstretched fingers.  "And after I read it, I realized that the
author also had no idea what gravity really is."), hydrogen slowly
coalesced into communities.  All the hydrogen atoms were
like, <em>hey, look at us!  we're making <b>networks</b> of hydrogen;
we're more advanced than that silly disperced hydrogen that has
nowhere to go and nothing to do..</em></p>

<p>The communities of hydrogen were happily communing until they
started to shove too close together, <em>hey man, get off me!</em>
and <b>bang</b> chaos, helium was formed, and before the hydrogen
community knew it, a star had been born.  This was a new technology
of actually creating new types of matter just by smashing old matter
together (via that mysterious gravity).</p>

<p>Stars were like, <em>wow, we're <b>cool</b></em> (though they
actually meant they were hot) and they made all kinds of elements.
Smashing hydrogen into helium and boron and carbon and iron etc until
the star got too dense for its own good and the gravity overpowered
the solar output and <em>kaslam</em>, the star collapsed
until <em>kablowie</em>, chaos in the form of a nova, or in January, a
supernova.  (and I don't even like American football)</p>

<p>The star blew itself and its elements across its back yard and all
those elements were like, <em>aw man, <b>now</b> what are we going to
do?</em> because it seemed like the end of the world.</p>

<p>But actually it was the beginning of a new world, something called
a planet, many of which group together in their own little communities
around stars, all revolving according to the magic of gravity.
Planets would spin around going, <em>ha ha, look at us!  We're too
smart (small) to nova ourselves to bits like you silly stars.</em>
And the planets spun around keeping themselves evenly warm (except for
Venus, who has her own thing going on), until something started
cooking down in the oceans or the crust (according to some research I
read recently) and <em>bang</em>cells were formed.</p>

<p>That's where Kurzweil's article picks up the story.  Hydrogen
formation was quick, but star formation took billions of years.
Planet formation millions of years, and cell formation not quite as
long.</p>

<p>Back to the point: Will machines replace humans?  I don't know.
Did planets replace stars?  No.  Will life replace planets?  No; life
just lives on them.  Will life learn how to live without planets?
Possibly.  Does this mean planets won't be necessary for life?  Maybe.
Will it mean planets won't exist?  Not likely.</p>

<p>Will machines replace humans?  I still don't know.  Will machines
be able to 'live' (reproduce themselves) without humans (forget
humans); without biology? it looks like it.</p>

<p>The point of the article is not whether subsequent things will
replace other things, but that the speed of evolution increases
exponentially because it (evolution) uses the more advanced techniques
produced by one process to create the next processes.</p>

<pre>
Evolution applies positive feedback in that the more capable  methods
resulting from one stage of evolutionary progress are used to create
the next stage.  Each epoch of evolution has progressed more rapidly
by building on the products of the previous stage.
</pre>

<p>Evolution quit working with just the nuclear process of making atoms
to the physical process of making cells.  Then to the biological
process of making life.</p>

<p>Back to my feeble brain and body.  It's taken me an hour to write
all this.  A sentient computer could write this in a fraction of a
second.  But Kurzweil's law implies the computer won't even have to
write this; it will just know it and use these ideas to make cooler
things still, and evolution will go on.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>One more brainwave: need a distinction between "processes within a
framework" and "processes across frameworks (within a larger
framework)" and "evolution across frameworks" and "evolution within a
framework"</p>
