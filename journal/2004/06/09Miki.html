<p>Miki and I hung out after watching Day After Tomorrow.  Man my
timing sucks; my train is here.</p>

<p>Oh good I got a seat.</p>

<p>Day After Tomorrrow was pretty good; I dunno if I'd watch it twice,
but yeah, good story.  I'd just like to point out for the record that
there is evidence of the Atlanticcurrent slowing down.  The idea
presented in the movie is real.  I don't know aobut -151 degrees in
several seconds, but several degrees per year has been predicted as
quite possible.  The US Government has started researching the
possibility of such a .. wait, they have been researching what to do
if that scenario happens.. the assumption being that huge climate
shifts will cause crops to fail and resxtructure the world economy;
the economy would/could collapse and so forth.  I doubt I'll put a
link to the paper , but there is a 100+ page pdf floating around that
is the result of the research and suggested steps to take before it
happens.</p>

<p>Miki is cool because she chatted with a little kid that befriended
us at Muza while we were sitting on the curvy wall in front of the
white squirrel tail and butterfly shaped statues.  I was too shy
about my non-Japanese knowing self to say much of anything; I've
really clammed up a lot while living here.  Not that I talked all
that much when I diddn't live here.</p>

<p>She was like, "where's your mom" and "take care" and "how old are
you/"  All things that seem likely a 5 year old would want to talk
about.  I just don't seem to think of these things..</p>
