<p>Saw Dan off and Jen and I went to Hiyoshi for Starbucks
frappucinos and to mail her letter.  We chatted about the amazingness
of the day and about her moving into my building (*my* building) in 2
days.  Talked about Gaba and relationships with students.  Talked
about how we both hate the get-to-know-ya chitchat of getting to know
people; we want to get to the real stuff first.</p>

<p>Mental hugs to her as she headed out for work.</p>

<p>Oh, earlier, at Subway, Jen said, "Heck, I'll eat it; I think I've
got worms."  That is hilarious.  'specially if she hasn't got
worms.</p>
