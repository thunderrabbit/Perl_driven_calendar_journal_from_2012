<p>After work, I found Hitomi waiting outside for me; that was nice.
We went to a local takoyaki place (even closer than the one Jesse and
I went to a couple weeks ago) and met her friends ゆか、　ひとみ、and
とみー。 Hitomi and Hitomi were like perapera penguins talking 100
miles per hour, and Yuka and Tomi were much slower speakers.  Tomi
spoke almost as little as I did.  When they pointed out that Yuka
spoke more slowly, I became conscious of the different speeds of their
speech.  I could begin to measure the syllables per second (not count,
but get-a-gist-for) for each of them.  That was pretty cool; Japanese
suddenly became another level easier to understand.</p>

<p>The flat screen TV featured a wack "drama" that ended with a man
shooting either himself or a woman dressed in white on a cliff
overlooking a beach (they didn't show the actual shooting, and I
wasn't paying attention (possibly I wouldn't have known had I been
paying attention) to the show anyway) and then a nature show on
rabbits that look like big mice with big ears or big squirrels with
big ears or little rabbits with small round ears.  Cute.</p>
