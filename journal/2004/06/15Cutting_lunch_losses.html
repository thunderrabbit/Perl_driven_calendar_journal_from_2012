<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>"Get over it," is, of course, the correct answer.</p>

<p>I was super happy when one of my students said, "get over it," to
me when I was talking about the agony of finding nothing but horses
in the Calpis boxes.</p>

<p>Today's agony is having neglected to start the rice cooker before
I went to buy eggs and spinach.  The rice could have been cooking
while I was walking..  Arg.  I guess I'm not an expert chef yet.</p>

<p class=date>11:08am</p>

<p>I meditated on the situation; tried to grok it.</p>

<p>I wrote a note and put it on the rice cooker, "I cooked this rice,
but I have to leave before it finishes.  はいどぞう Enjoy free
rice."</p>

<p>I decided it was more important to stick to my committment of
meeting Hitomi for lunch (on time) than to cook rice; I  can just pay
for lunch there.</p>

<p>On the way walking to the train station { and unless the
train-route-finder miscalculated how quickly I can find the train in
Oyama station, I'll be on time to meet Hitomi } I decided that my
brain enjoys optimizing things, but is not always the expert optimizer
because some things are more important to optimze than others.  I
realize this discussion is an attempt to quantify or actually describe
imprecisely through words the workings of an organic blob in my head,
trying to explain illogical processes with logic, but but, brain
overload; brain cannot logic brains own self into logicality.</p>

<p>Reboot; try again:</p>

<p>My brain wants to optimize things.  But it uses a set of rules
that is incomplete..  or maybe a set of rules that don't seem to
result in what is optimal.. oh!  I know what it might be; my right
brain using math and rigorous logic comes up with a different
solution than my left brain.</p>

<p>But that is just a rule I've heard and stored away (somewhere) and
can use it to reconcile my own frustration at things not having
turned out the way I originally planned.  That's what this is all
about.  (hahaha; the brain has once again come up with a solution
that it thinks is even simpler; explains the theory  of the universe
with one simple solution.)</p>

<p>Damn; instead of writing all this crap; I should have been
studying Chinese.</p>

<p class=date>1:09pm</p>

<p>haha! This time in Tokyo Teleport, the station with free internet
access, I remained seated (and connected) long enough to get my
journal entries uploaded while the train waited for its moment to
leave.  I got on the train just a few seconds before the doors
closed.</p>
