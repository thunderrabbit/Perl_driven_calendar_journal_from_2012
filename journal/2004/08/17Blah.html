<p>Last night I was grumpy and took it out on Hitomi.  Not like
drastically mean to her, but I was a big whiney baby and not really
willing to take the time to talk about it slowly in English.  I was
like, "I just feel like poo because I don't know what I want and I'm
in this thing with you but I don't think it can last forever and I
can't even really say why, but it's just the same thing that I've done
before with Wende and to a lesser extent with janette and possibly
soon to a lesser extent with you."</p>

<p>I can't see myself in a relationship where I can't express those
types of feelings and not be understood.  Do I just cancel everything
now?  Strive to learn/teach the other language so we can be
understood?  What about janetteSallyMadeline (in connection, aesthetic
and pronunciation order)?  What about my bicycle trip around the
world?</p>

<p>I'm thinking I'll stay here until the 48th PB cruise. If
I'm not on it, I'll ride my bicycle to Texas, by way of Europe.  But
why Texas?  I have no love for Texas, except for some of its
people.</p>

<p>Hey, yeah, now that I think about it more, it's awesome, because
I'll be able to see Ryan in New York (if he's still there) my family,
Elizabeth and Tammy in Virgina, maybe other peeps in other places.</p>
