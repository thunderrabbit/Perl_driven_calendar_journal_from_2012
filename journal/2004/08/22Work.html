<p>Wow.  Roscoe just showed me one of his kung-fu (?) moves and
accidentally knocked my wrist into a wooden frame.  Ouch.</p>

<p>Pretty cool move though.</p>

<p>Work has been alright; no disasters so far, but I'm definitely
looking forward to my new job on weekends.  12 lessons in a row is
too much for me.</p>

<p>Current student seems to have forgotten the lesson.</p>

<p>just found that <a

anchorage tenki</a> gives exactly one match in google.  Awright.</p>
