Dude to rob                                  2:08am (10 minutes ago)

you are in luck.  I have a friend who rode his bike from Houston to
Denali in Alaska, then climbed Denali (considered harder than Everest
by some), then rode his bike home.

the next year, he rode his bike from Houston to Tierra Del Fuego (Tip
of South America) and climbed Aconcagua along the way.  He took a
cruise back on that one.

His name is __________  and he is also a computer guru.  total *nix
expert.  cool guy, very inteligent.  his email is  _____@______.____

This may be very good for him to help you plan.  he may need something
to inspire him right now.  last year, as soon as he got back from
South America, ____ something bad happened to him __

Lastly, BE FREAKIN CAREFUL treveling by bicycle through the middle
east.  In 1996, a guy named Goran Kropp rode his bike from Sweeden to
Mt Everest and then climbed Everest.  He wrote a booke about his
journey, which I read.  here's the book at amazon:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156331830X

anyway, the guy was almost killed like 8 times in the middle east.  he
said that without a doubt, the most dangerous part of the whole trip
was being assaulted several times in the middle east.  He had
hundreds, if not thousands, of people hurl rocks at him.  he had a
baseball bat broken over his head and says that the only thing that
saved him was his bike helmet.  its hard to beleive, but the people
just attacke dthe guy just because he was white/caucasian.  Gran Kropp
is also mentioned in other books about the 1996 climbing season on
everest (because thats the year all those people died); all the other
books seem to say great things about the guy and paint him as a very
quiet and unassuming man, so its very unlikely that he was being an
asshole when he was attacked.

anyway, be careful dog.

ps: I leave today for another attempt at running the 221 mile John
Muir Trail.  we bailed out two years ago at mile 177.  This year we
have much better chances, as we have both been training hard.  I have
run 8 ultra-marathons this year, two of which have been 50 milers.
talk to you when i get back.

peace,
dude
