<p>Need to add this to yesterday's entry.</p>

<p>Dan shaved my head with the clippers, or was in the process of
shaving it and some was long and some was short and it looked like a
nightmare.  Then he cracked out his razor and was like, "would you
like me to raze it?"  and I was like "sure!"</p>

<p>He started shaving a few streaks of flat baldness and then I was
like,</p>

<p>"wait, you're not <em>shaving</em> it, are you?"</p>

<p>HAhahahahhahahaahahah!</p>

<p>Dan said, for a moment, he was petrified.  Bang.</p>
