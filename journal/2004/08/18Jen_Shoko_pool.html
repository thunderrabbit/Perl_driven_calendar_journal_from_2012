<p>Shoko called up to my room this morning, thankfully getting me off
my computer.  Damn I'm such a nerd on this thing; it's an addiction of
sorts, though I judge it's not all bad; just need some moderation.</p>

<p>Jen joined us, and I chatted with her in English about OM and her
being my new boss (haha) and stuff like that.  Also talked to her
about her friend who goes bicycling long distances. Cool.</p>

<p>For the first couple of laps, I was with Shoko; Jen was on her
ketai sending text messages to someone.  This time in the pool the
novelty of <em>swimming</em> had worn off, but it was still quite
cool and enjoyable.  Shoko paddled around the ring-river on the
inflatable Pooh ball, and I floated along beside her.</p>

<p>When she joined us, Jen grabbed my leg from behind in a sneak
attack type manuever, but I wasn't startled, knowing that she was "out
there" in the pool area.</p>

<p>We stayed for an hour, half of which Shoko spent working on her
tan.  On the way out, I looked for 100 yen coins left in the lockers,
but found none.</p>
