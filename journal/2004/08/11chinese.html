<p>I'm headed to Chinese lesson now; I haven't studied, haven't a
desire to hole-punch any books; I might quit.  Argh.</p>

<p>Haha the pic of Sally and Jennifer just showed up when they were
doing karaoke with bananas after Jennifer's party. I'm really glad we
went to San Fran; it was a fun fun fun trip!  Yay for quiet
couches!</p>

<p>Okay: I know what I need to do for Chinese learnin'.  Figure out
how to pronounce this shit.  I can't commit it to long term memory
without correct pronunciation.</p>

<p class=date>7:01pm</p>

<p>That was certainly helpful!  I can now pronounce zh, ch, sh, and r,
none of which are similar to how we would pronounce the same letters
in English.  They are all very similar in sound, actually.  Wow!</p>

<p>Okay, more studying. (I'm on the train in Shibuya station (I'm
going to miss Shibuya station when I leave Tokyo) to head home.)</p>
