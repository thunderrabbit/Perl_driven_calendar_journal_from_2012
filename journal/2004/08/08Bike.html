<p>I just had a flashback about my bike.  Not really sure what
triggered it, but during a lesson with Naotoshi, I recalled pushing my
bike up a hill through trees and crazy stickers and undergrowth up
near Oberlin University where I went to hang out with Abbey
Tennis.</p>

<p>Abbey was in class at the time, and I just went for a ride along
their trails and ended up going past a golf course and then to an
overpass railroad tressel.  I decided it would be cool to ride my
bike across the tressel.</p>

<p>It felt like a good challenge, and maybe a little bit breaking the
rules because riding bikes on railroad tracks just isn't the safest
thing to do.  But, considering there were trees growing between the
rails, I figured these tracks would be on a list of Top 100 Safest
Railroad Tracks To Ride Bikes On.</p>

<p>And maybe I was trespassing because I was certainly on railroad
track property, but maybe it had been reclaimed by the government as
public property, but .. in any case, it was a good challenge.   I
could barely climb up the hill without using my hands to grab trees,
so it was pretty fuckin' hard to get my bike up there.  Had to pull
branches out of the frame and spokes and turn the handlebars sideways
and the wheel the other sideways and lift up and down and all around
and got the bike up.</p>

<p>Onto the railroad tracks I emerged from the trees and tried to ride
on the tracks.  It took a bit to get started, and I'm sure I had to
drop to a way low gear (this was 1.5 years ago, mind you, do I've
forgotten some details) but finally I got the satisfying
thumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthump style of riding on the ties.
Awesome.</p>

<p>There was something cool with the edge of the tressel, like the
ground had slumped next to the concrete support column, so the ties
were being held up by the rails, well above the dirt.  Kinda scary to
ride across that part.</p>

<p>I completed my journey back and forth across the tressel, having
examined the aging process and trying to memorize the date stamped in
the concrete and wondering how long they thought the tressel might
last, and if they are still alive and about my moment within the long
history of the tressel, that now had trees growing between the rails
on either side.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So; I had a flashback to that moment, and I emerged feeling really
sad that someone has stolen my bike.</p>
