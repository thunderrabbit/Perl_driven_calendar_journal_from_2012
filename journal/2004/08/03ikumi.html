<p>Met Ikumi tonight; she moved in today.  Rene (a superstar of my
journal tonight) fixed her light.  I hung her light after Rene fixed
it, but he fixed it.  I could have fixed it, I'm sure, but I had
never previously messed with these types of lights, and I don't have
replacement parts for them.</p>

<p>Oh, Ikumi is a website designer.  I don't know what sites she's
designed, but I'd like to talk to her sometime about it.</p>
