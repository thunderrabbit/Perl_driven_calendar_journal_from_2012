<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type=A>
<li><p>I live in Millenium House in Kizuki-gion cho, near
Motosumiyoshi station.</p></li>

<li><p>Shoko is sleeping on my bed because she wasn't able to sleep
last night after having guy problems.</p></li>

<li><p>Construction guys are digging holes to pour the foundation for
a five story building across the street.</p></li>

<li><p>I have confirmed that I'll be able to work for Ian next month.
Awesome blossom.</p></li>

<li><p>My roller coaster book hasn't done anything interesting lately.
As in I haven't done anything interesting toward writing the book.  I
wonder if it will ever be developed.</p></li>

<li><p>I work at Gaba near full-time, and have a few private students,
and a couple students through Gateway 21.</p></li>

<li><p>There is a wooden table and chair, and short glass table in my
room.  And the folding futon thing that I bought with Yuuko's car-help
when I moved in.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is still my Powerbook G4 667 with 512Megs ram and
30 gig hard drive.</p></li>

<li><p>It's still under warranty, so I'm not likely to get a new one
(until the warranty runs out in June 2005, and the computer breaks
again.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm back to a stage of not hating Japan.  I seem to have
reached a crossroads of sorts: My life will change in September.  Then
it might change bigtime in October.</p>

<ol type=i>
<li><p>I will begin working for Ian on weekends in September, making
more money than at Gaba.</p></li>

<li><p>I will possibly be on P-B in October, beginning an around
the world cruise/adventure.</p></li>

<li><p>If I'm not accepted for P-B, I'll consider riding my bike
from here to Osaka (as test for riding farther.  Across Europe or
Eurasia or just ride back to Texas.)</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>It's pretty warm here in Tokyo these days.  Sweat as soon as we
step out of the shower room.  People quietly melt on train
platforms.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't used my air conditioner this season.</p></li>

<li><p>For P-B, I've turned in my application, met super-genki
Audrey, and am awaiting their response to see if I get to ride.  My
application didn't confirm to their specifications because I didn't
receive the specifications when I first got the application
information.  Super-genki Audrey said it's all cool and will vouch for
me.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't yet told anyone at Gaba that I won't be working
there on weekend days.  I'm considering, naw - I've just decided: I
will work at Gaba on weekend evenings, and if I oh wait a minute.. I
was thinking about working from 7pm to close, thinking close was
10:40pm on the weekends, but it's not.  I could work three classes on
the weekends from 6:15 to 8:30, but.. fuckit I won't do it.  I'll just
get off early and get private students if anything.</p></li>

<li><p>Okay, so I've just decided that I will not work weekends at
Gaba in September, and I still haven't told them yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Last month I got fifteen 5-5 evaluations, which should equal
around 15,000 yen extra for me.  (15,000 yen = 6 hours private student
work)</p></li>

<li><p>I have no pets</p></li>

<li><p>I officially have no girlfriend, but have been hanging out a
lot with that girl who wishes to remain nameless in my
journal.</p></li>

<li><p>On occasion, I have felt old.  But I have been careful to
maintain proper posture while walking, and I carry my heavy back pack
for exercise, and I use stairs for more exercise.</p></li>

<li><p>I have climbed Mt Fuji (July 12 - 13), but I have not finished
my Mt Fuji journal entries.</p></li>

<li><p>I have lived in Tokyo for 17 months.  In Japan I have visited
Hiroshima, Kyoto, Nara, Nikko, and Kamakura.  Still want to see Osaka
(and the cool theme park there) and other places.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not been to any other countries in Asia.</p></li>

<li><p>I have visited Melbourne and Sydney Australia, Monte Verde and
Quepos Costa Rica,  London England, Paris France, a Texas-Mexico
border town, and when I was pretty much too little for it to count,
Ottawa (I think) Canada.</p></li>

<li><p>I've ridden Space Mountain at Disney Land (Tokyo, not LA nor
Disney World Florida) and it was weak.  Sigh.</p></li>

<li><p>Jen from Perth, Cute Shoko, Loud Jackie, Quiet Jo, Richard the
Kiwi, Rikitake, Dave with a sportscar, Jon and Kaori, Colin the
Absent, and new girl Ikumi live in my building.  Oh and Gus.  And
Roger.</p></li>

<li><p>My journal is not RSSed.</p></li>
