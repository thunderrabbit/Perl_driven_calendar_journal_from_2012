<p>Funny that I call this entry work, but I don't really consider
Gateway 21 my job.  I taught 6.5 hours tonight, and my head is
slightly achey.  I'm not sure of a quick fix. </p>

<p>Had a breakthrough with my second student, which is good, though
seems kinda unfortunate that this was our last (of two) lessons
together.  I basically got her to start writing shit down instead of
me just writing everything and she got the grammars for "how long have
you ____," and "how much longer will you ____," and the respective
answers.</p>

<p>Third student and I had a decent conversation, though it was
apparent we were both tired.  Frequent pauses while we think; similar
styles.</p>

<p>Ah; I'm suddenly reminded I want to email Kaori back.</p>

<p>done.</p>

<p>I am on the train now, back toward home from Shinjuku; actually
back home from Shibuya.  Oh I had a good revelation today that may
help my Japanese study.  Don't worry about grammar and kanji at the
same time.  When I'm writing grammar, just fuckin write hiragana
unless the kanji is right there in my pen.  but don't look up kanji
while I'm doing grammar. It just slows me down, gets me off track and
shit.  That was an indirect suggestion from my 3rd student whose name
I still can't remember Tsukasa; that's it (I remembered) who said, "I
think learning kanji is not so important."</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>First student was cool; our first time to meet, and I had to be
careful to not stare at her cleavage.  I don't really remember what
we talked about.  Oops.</p>
