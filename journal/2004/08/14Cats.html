<p>Three cats crept into my room last night.  I keep the door open
because it's lovely warm at night and I like to let the breeze breeze
through.  (Sometimes there is no breeze)</p>

<p>Hitomi heard the cats pitterpatter into the room and woke up
startled.  "さんびき!" (I heard nothing but them scampering out the
door like scaredy-cats)</p>

<p>Huge shivery shivers as my astral body jumped back into the
physical.  I had been zonkered asleep.</p>
