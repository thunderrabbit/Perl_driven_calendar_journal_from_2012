<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Long fuckin' day at work today.  12 students.  3 were fun.</p>

<p>When Miwa asked me, "if you became Prime Minister of Japan, what
would you do?"</p>

<p>I gave it some serious thought.  Would I reduce taxes?  Would I
enforce laws to clean up Japan?  Hmmm.. What would I <em>actually</em>
do if I actually became the actual Prime Minster of Japan?  If *I*
became Junichiro Koizumi like right now.  Bang.  What would I do?</p>

<p>"I would run around in circles yelling, 'たいへん！'"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>I calculated Mieko's birthday (Friday) given her birthdate, and loaned her
my pink Calpis horse for her flight to Chicago during which her boss
will be critiquing her flight attending skillz.</p>

<p>I calculated Sawako's birthday (Friday?) given her birthdate, and
taught her how to do the calculations herself.</p>
