<p>Wow.  Work was troublesome today; well, I had trouble staying
awake in some of my lessons.</p>

<p>One lesson that kept me awake was a woman's description of
older-man younger-women (plural) relationships.  The Japanese culture
supports this type of relationship and it hits all my buttons.  Women
are so oppressed in this culture it's just nutso.</p>

<p>Basically she said that an older man can have as many "secret"
girlfriends as he can afford, even though he already has a wife.  His
wife won't ask if he has girlfriends because she doesn't actually want
to divorce him because she'd get peanuts for a settlement (1,000,000
yen) and she, being over 30, can't get remarried.</p>

<p>Classically, women over 30 are unable to get married because no
man will have her.</p>

<p>At least there is one partially saving point: young women can have
as many older manfriends as they want.</p>

<p>Nightmare.</p>

<p>I had to teach my student this word, after my reaction.</p>
