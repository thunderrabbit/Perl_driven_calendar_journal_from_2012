<p>Work was pretty alright tonight.  I'm heading to Magnet's house
tonight cause he's about to kick it outside Japan style later this
month.  We hadn't hung out in a while and I'm always up for a free
dinner.</p>

<p>Even though I chowed a lot today; there was a ton of food left
over from the party last night, which was apparently fun, but not
incredibly so.  My last student was cool, which I'm thankful for
considering I had asked to have my last lesson closed (different
concepts of "last" here) I think she got some good information about
asking what animals eat and what animals are.  I taught her"I think
so it eats" but to lose the so.  And something else I'm sure.</p>

<p>I performed the doomsday algorithm a few times today 4 out of 4
times successfully for years in 1960-1970 range.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Make that 5 out of 5 now.</p>
