<p>Wow.....</p>

<p>Tom is leaving Japan for London.  How... unexpected (at least for
me)...  After we had so much fun on his bike last night.</p>

<p>I met ¤ä¤¨ tonight, the woman with whom Tom was being affectionate
last week or two weeks ago.  I was glad when I learned that he had not
gotten that close to Kuli in one day of hanging out; Kuli != Yae.</p>

<p>(but sometimes Cool = Yay)</p>

<p>I sat in his room a bit while he packed.  Mostly I was just kinda
sitting in the same room as Yae, but sometimes I was helpful in
packing.</p>
