<p>Lesson with Tsukasa at Gateway 21 was pretty good today.  We
started off talking about his trip to his parents but then there was
an earthquake and we started talking about volcanoes to lava lamps to
modifying lava lamps (*) to glass sphere thermometers to "accurate" vs
"precise" to standard system (inches, feet, miles) to google which can
translate between measurements.</p>

<p>I hope he enjoyed it as much as I.</p>

<p>(*) When talking about lava lamps, I wondered about ways to have
two colors of wax bubbling around, but not mixing.  I doubted that
would be easy and then thought about having plastic balls in the
mix.   If they were the same density as water the wax could flob them
around, and even better, if they changed density during temperature
changes to float up and down on their own, that would be awesome.
And *then* I thought we should combine that technology with color
changing plastic technology so they would change colors as they
change temperatures and density.  Wow.</p>
