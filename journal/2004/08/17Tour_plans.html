<p>Okay, I would like to have a record of my exact path via bike.  So
I imagine if I get a GPS thing and have some company record my
location every hour, that would be sufficient.  Probably every day
would be sufficient, but it's only like, what, 8 bytes of data per
check so it would be cool to have that data and ultimately draw a red
line on a map with dates at the big cities.  Just like in the
movies.</p>

<p>Conceivably, I could take lots of pictures and video with my
digital camera, and put the date on them (and maybe even encoded in
the data visibly on the image) and then have pictures per location
available.  That would be pretty cool.</p>

<p>Need batteries; I have wondered before about a bicycle powered
battery charger.</p>
