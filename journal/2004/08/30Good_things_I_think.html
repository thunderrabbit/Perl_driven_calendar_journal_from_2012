<p>Today at work, of note:</p>

<p>(What is "of note" supposed to mean?)</p>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I had a new student today and she was cool.  It was our first
time to meet and I was hesitant to give her my contact information.
At the very end, I dropped some hints like I wanted to so I could get
a sense of her interest in such an exchange.  She didn't really
respond, and at the very end, I was like, "I think you're cool."  She
goes, "you noticed just now?  It's too late."</p>

<p>Awesome snap back to reality for me.  I'm glad I didn't violate my
first meeting rule.</p></li>

<li><p>I got a call from e-Promotions; I am invited to an audition
(it's for modeling, not speaking (I think) so is it an AUDition?) to
see if they want me to pose for some car stereo company.  Nice.  If I
get the job, it will be 150,000 yen for 2 days work.  New
bike.</p></li>
