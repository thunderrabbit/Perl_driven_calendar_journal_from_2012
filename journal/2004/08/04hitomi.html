<p>Met Hitomi in Tsunashima station.  Treated her to foodage from
Lawsons, which we ate out by the river.  It was nice chillin' with
her.</p>

<p>Some high school girls got quite annoying as they brought
firecrackers including some 40 meter vertical launchers and some roman
candles.  They were annoying cause they would shriek
with <em>each</em> ball that shot out of the tube.  Okay, the first
one, I can understand.  But not each fucking one.  It was like, [foom]
[shriek!].  [foom] [shriek!].  [foom] [shriek!].  [foom] [shriek!].
[foom] [shriek!].  [foom] [shriek!].  Alright, missy, get a grip.</p>

<p>But then it got worse as they were overtly being <em>idiots</em>
and shooting the balls where <em>other bystanders were standing</em>.
Come fucking on; have they got a single brain cell working?</p>

<p>I noticed my prejudice and my anger and tried really hard to see
their side..  best I could get is that they were just in their own
little world, where no one else existed.  Which is really how Japanese
society is built.  So they are just being the way their society made
them.  But come on, society; get smart.</p>

<p>When one of the girls <em>threw a spent tube</em> into the river,
I didn't know what to do.  Yelling at her in English didn't seem like
the answer, so I did nothing.  Fuckin' hell.</p>
