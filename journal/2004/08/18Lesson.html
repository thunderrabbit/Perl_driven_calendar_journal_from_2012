<p>Lesson with Akiko was cool; she brought a paper and I helped her
with a lot of vocabulary.  I wrote more this time than last time, but
not too much; both sides of one sheet.  She translated a phone message
that I received during the lesson.  As I suspected (after a little
consideration) it was the store where I was able to buy a binder for
my Genki I book (and get it hole-punched); they had received the
second binder for my Genki II book, which I went and picked up after
the lesson and had hole-punched.</p>

<p>Met briefly with Akiko after the lesson and hole-punching
festivities; she had scoped the used bike shop down the street and
reported they receive a few mountain bikes per week, or per month but
right now they had none.  Thanks to her research, it seems that I
won't further pursue buying a bike from that shop.</p>

<p>During the lesson I defined words like "reclusive, declaration,
dismantling," and others I don't remember.  These were in an article
about China "appealing" North Korea to engage in talks to dismantle
their nuclear weapons program.</p>

<p>This, while Bush is having nuclear "bunker busters" developed.
Nightmare.</p>
