<p>While several people were downstairs watching Michael Moore taunt
people on The Awful Truth (?), a cicada came to visit the lights in
the room.  Rene happened to be there, which was good, cause we
white/westernized folk weren't about to capture it and get it
outside.</p>

<p>(( actually, when it first came into the room, it just sat on the
floor next to the open door through which it had come.  I was
prepared to nudge it with my sandaled foot back out the door, but it
flew into the room before I got too close.  I'm glad it flew before I
was close; I woulda freaked. ))</p>

<p>Rene swatted at it a few times and then <em>caught</em> it in his
hand.  We simultaneously winced, ooooed, and clappped.  He calmly
pretended to throw it toward a couple of the more wincey people (which
didn't include me, though I was definitely in the I'm-not-catching-it
list) before he tossed it outside.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
