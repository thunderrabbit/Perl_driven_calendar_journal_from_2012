<p>My teacher called in sick for Japanese lesson today so I didn't go
and instead signed up for match.com and created some google adwords.</p>

<p>In unrelated issues, I'm getting 200k+ files bounced after I
forwarded email to gmail; I'm not sure what happened exactly, but I
reported it to my email server guys.</p>

<p>Gotta get off the computer today.  Now.</p>

<p>Lessons at Gaba at 4pm.</p>
