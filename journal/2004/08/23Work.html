<p>Work was pretty rockin' today; I'm off early by giving one of my
lessons to Louise and I'm on the way home now.  Very high percentage
of awesome lessons today and I'm really happy about that.  Last lesson
was with Eiko whose Everyday field said NO CHIT CHAT; CHALLENGE! and I
was like, "yeah buddy" and was zing zing zing in the book after
confirming with her that she wanted to use the book and her furrowed
brow but ability to answer 90% of the questions correctly let me know
we were in the right ballpark for challenges.  Awesome.  I relaxed a
little at the end and we chatted about movies and stuff and I gave her
the Metropolis Magazine from the lobby and overall I think it went
well.  Nice.</p>

<p>First two students were new to me, or second and third were,
anyway, we had good lessons as well though I don't remember about
what.  Umm.  good day.</p>

<p>Going to bounce by my house for a second to get my overnight stuff
and meet Hitomi out in Kawasaki (I say "out" as if Kawasaki is further
from the Tokyo, but it's closer to Tokyo than my house) where, of all
things, we will spend the night at her friends's house.</p>

<p>Should be fun.  Should get to speak some Japanese.</p>

<p>Oh, and I found out the name of the place where I want to hike
early next month.  Miakejima.</p>
