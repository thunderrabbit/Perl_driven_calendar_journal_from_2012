<p class=date>8:38pm JST Tuesday 3 August 2004</p>

<p>Work has been slow today.  I got a student at 2:30, and have had
two students since then.  I've been able to study some Japanese, but
haven't really been in the mood for bigtime studying, so I've read
news and slept.</p>

<p>I've got a no-show right now.</p>

<p>One of my students wants to volunteer in Sudan.  Wow.</p>

<p>I wrote to Jen's uncle today offering my computer skills, and have
had to resist spending/wasting time looking for a free internet
access point so I can get my email (using ssh) because I don't allow
lycos to know my site password anymore.</p>

<p>Something is going to change soon.  Either working for Jen's uncle,
working on P-B, or riding my bike somewhere far away.</p>

<p>Option three requires buying a bike.</p>

<p>I saw a fly bike yesterday; it was a mountain bike, branded
Panasonic.  The model name was cooooooooooool and I was like, "I want
that bike just because the model name is so cool," but I can't
rememember the model name. That's how cool it was.</p>

<p>Searching online for the model name brings me to learn there are
GPS devices for bicycles now.  Awesome.  I'm gonna get that shit for
my next bike.  Though it seems the prices are like $650 for the
device, more than my original bike.</p>

<p>I would nearly pay that much to have my bike back, so I might pay
it to have a GPS device to track my bike.</p>

<p>Hmm. Still can't find the model name.  Can't seem to find a list
of models of panasonic branded bicycles.</p>

<p>Anyone willing to donate a SmartMedia card or two?</p>

<p>How about an Olympus DS-2000 digital recorder?</p>
