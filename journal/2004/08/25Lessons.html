<p>Lesson with Sanami happened today.  Vacations plus her mom
forgetting meant we haven't met in a few weeks.</p>

<p>After the lesson I rocked out to the next place and as I was 30
seconds away, with 1 minute until lesson, she called and
cancelled.</p>

<p>Blah.</p>

<p>Deposited 100,000 yen in my savings account (just over 200,000
now) and I'm about to pay rent and then go look at bikes.  Awrigh.</p>
