<p>Yay.  I brought my camera.</p>

<p>On the train now with 80,000 yen in my pocket that is slated for
food and fun and misc during the upcoming month.</p>

<p>But I'm on my way to a bike shop in Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>There's a part of my brain that is so excited about getting a bike
that, given the right conditions, could prompt me to buy a bike today.
Eeee.</p>

<p>I trust that what's best for my biking in the long term will
continue its manifestation.</p>

<p class=date>5:03pm</p>

<p>I seemed to be in the right area, but I didn't seem to find the
bike shop Riki told me about.  I walked indirectly from Jiyugaoka to
Toritsugaidagaku.</p>

<p>Now I'm on the train to Naka-meguro where I intend to find the
bike shop Hitomi told me about.</p>

<p class=date>5:47pm</p>

<p>Arrived in Nakameguro, headed out toward where I thought the shop
was, and quickly determined that the simple map in my head was
insufficient for me to find the bike shop.  I knew there was a river
involved, so I found the river and walked along it in the direction
my brain indicated.  After a while of walking, I decided that the
shop must not be directly alongside the river.  However, there were
many apartments alongside the river, so I figured I would be able to
smurf some free internet bandwidth for a moment.  Walked along the
river with my computer open, watching with iStumbler, a shareware
(freeware?) thing that snoops for internet signals.</p>

<p>Found a few weak ones before I was able to find a strong one that
didn't require a password.  It didn't take really long; woulda been
faster to start looking for an internet signal before I just set
out.  But anyway, I acquired a map and it was all good.</p>

<p>I walked a block to the street on which the bike shop was located
and determined that I had walked well past the shop.  Walked back
toward the station; the shop was three traffic lights from the
station, and traffic lights were pretty frequent.</p>

<p>Aha.  After a while, bang I found the shop.  I recognized the front
of the shop from their picture online. It was smaller than I
expected.</p>

<p>Also, it was closed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I checked my phone (time and date) about a hundred times to verify
I had arrived within</p>

Mon - Sat 11:00 - 19:00
Sun 11:00 - 17:00

<p>I tried to read the other signs and the note that had been taped
outside the door.  I was hopeless with the kanji, of which there was
plenty.</p>

<p>It took me some minutes of deciphering and searching before I found
"every Wendnesdays close."</p>

<p>They can't spell it, but they can take it off.</p>
