Dear Robert Dale,

Thank you for applying for the position of language teacher onboard
the 47th voyage of PB.  We are sorry to say that due to the
high amount of applications, we were unable to offer and interview all
candidates.

We do ask that you consider applying for a future voyage as we hold
three around the world cruises a year.
