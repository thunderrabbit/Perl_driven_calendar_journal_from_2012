<p>I'm a bit late for my e-Promotions thing, but I called and he said
it was no problem.  I hope I won't be a bit late for Gaba.  They won't
say "no problem."</p>

<p class=date>5:26pm</p>

<p>Jane scooped me up at Sunkus outside of the station (after calling
me after I was waiting for a bit, not sure what to do (call or not)
and noting there were more agencies than just mine in this whole
operation) and downstairs in this agency I met a funny guy who had to
leave before he could have his pics taken and then they got started
soon thereafter and photographed some well dressed Japanese men and
some casually dressed gaijin.  Well, 2 gaijin, including me.  Jane has
been hovering about and says I'm going to go to an interview type
thing in the other room in a moment.</p>

<p>Whoo!</p>

<p>When the guy took my pictures he was like, "first, smile face."</p>

<p>I smiled making sure to squint the eyes a bit and not just smile
with my mouth.  Then he was like, "second, serious face."</p>

<p>Bang, poker face.</p>

<p class=date>10:06pm</p>

<p>Did the interview; my interview took less time than the guy before
me, but I won't let that dissuade me from thinking that I got the job.
We were asked to swing a golf putter, and after I putted, I followed
the ball with my eyes and did a silent cheer when it sank.</p>

<p>There was a putter, but there was no ball.</p>
