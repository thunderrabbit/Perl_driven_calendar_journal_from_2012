<p>Shoko and Jen and I hung out outside all day today.  Singing,
dancing, playing silent football, drinking, telling stories... big
fun.  We were joined after a while by Riki, then Nas, and for a
moment, Jeff.  Bigtime fun in the sun, with barefoot walks to the
conveni, dancing for the workers across the street, me dancing on
video for Jen..  It's a long big video, but I may put it on my site,
if Jen and I coordinate computers.</p>

<p>Oh, I climbed a branchless tree (stumps for branches in a Japanese
control-nature style) and Jen got pics or maybe a video of that.  Fun
stuff.</p>

<p>Shoko worked hard to tan, and I slathered on SPF 50 sunscreen,
plus wore a white shirt and my gilligan hat.  Jen tried to tan her
legs and protect her arms.  They both wore towels on their heads to
protect their brains from the sun.</p>

<p>Awesome fun.</p>
