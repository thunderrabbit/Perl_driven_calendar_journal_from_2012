<p>Quickly, um, I am on the train (and on time) to be at work in 13
minutes.</p>

<p>I just finished applying for an international card at my bank.
Cost 1050 yen to apply and apparently 525 yen for each subsequent
year, and 210 yen + 3% for withdrawals.  A ton cheaper than sending
cash by Lloyd's.</p>

<p>But, fuckin' fuck; they replaced my domestic Japan-atm card, so I
can't send a card to janette and keep a card here, allowing me to do
cash stuff here and let her smurf cash out of my account and into my
US account.</p>

<p>Ah well.  The universe provides what I need; apparently I don't
need that other card right now.</p>
