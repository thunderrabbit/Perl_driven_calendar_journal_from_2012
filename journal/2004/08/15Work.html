<p>Partially okay with work today. I'm not 100% fuck sending postcards
because even though I don't like the controls being put on me by work,
I do like some of my students.  Like Mari.  And she gave me feedback,
so I am <em>allowed</em> to give her a postcard.</p>

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback
for my lesson.  I appreciate the time you take to
choose my lessons and to provide feedback.

<p>And the printing looks a lot like a typewriter, too.</p>

<p>Work has been pretty good so far.  Had a level up test with 90%
correct in only 25 minutes.  Awesome.  Played 20 questions with a
student who didn't know the concept of the game.  The next student
did know.  She got the answer in 6 questions.  Wow.</p>

<p>We didn't play infinity questions, but I told her the concept.</p>

<p>Done with work.  I get off work early tomorrow, which is rather
surprising, but not so surprising that I didn't jump at the chance to
close some lessons.</p>

<p>During my 3rd and 2nd to last lessons (with Hiromi), she told me
about her adventures with marriage, which are dramatically different
than would realistically have ever happened in the US.  Like three
different reasons the situation would never happen.  Wow.  It was
interesting for me to note how my upbringing tended to put her in the
category of Crazy and not just Pushed About By Japanese Culture.</p>
