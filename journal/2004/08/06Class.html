<p>Class today was pretty good.  After one of my students was like,
"fuck kanji" (a bit more eloquently than that), I wrote a lot of stuff
not worrying if I knew the kanji or not.  Just wrote the hiragana.
Unless I knew the kanji without slowing down.</p>

<p>I still want to learn kanji, but not at the same time that I
practice grammar.</p>
