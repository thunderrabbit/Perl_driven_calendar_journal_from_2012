<p>From my mate Dan, who's galavanting around China!!!  I like the
"buzzing, heaving" description of the train station.  Um, oh I have
an hint of an idea in my mind to incorporate this into my journal
somehow like per day, or well, I'm too tired to describe it, and way
too tired to do it, so fuck it.  But here's his entry.</p>

The Beginning.
Monday 16th August 2004

Well Here I am, Its 2pm and I'm waiting for my Nozomi
Shinkasen to Osaka, very excited. Rex and I have
purchased beer and sushi for our journey; actually we
have already drunk our beers and will need to buy more
BUT thats OK, we have time, money and lots of energy.
*I HOPE* I can keep the journal up during my travels,
I know its gonna be a fantastic experience and want to
remember it.
For now.... Peace
D.

Its 6.50pm, We are now at Osaka port. We have just
been looking for a place to cancel our phone's,
anyway, we couldn't find anywhere but Rex has just
gone off and called me to say we are in luck. Good
job. Its nice to be by the sea again and I'm very
excited about the 2 day voyage to China. So the plan
for tonight? Well we intend to find a cheap izakaiya
so we can hang out for the night eating, drinking and
making a 'sort of' plan for our journey. We may hit
the dock early and try and grab a few hours sleep, not
sure yet.

The Slow Boat to China.
Tuesday 17th August 2004

We have been on the boat for around 8 hours now but
getting on it was a long time coming, I can tell you!.
 We found our izakaiya and yes it was cheap. Actually
the place we went to is a large chain in Japan, and
although I don't know the exact japanese name, Jen has
always called it 'The Dirty Wog', so that name has
kind of stuck. As I said, we found the place and
stayed for over 8 hours- eating soooo much food and
getting through 2 bottles of this Korean spirit called
'Green'. It was a great night. Rex and I met a nice
couple and had our photo taken with them, we have
noticed how nice people in Osaka are- despite the huge
rivalry they are *SUPPOSED* to have with Tokyo!
We walked around the dock and eventually found the
place we were to leave from 8 hours later- those 8
hours were to be the longest in my life. I came out
with a classic 'we're lucky it isn't raining', and
yeah, you guessed it. Anyway I took this opportunity
to take a natural shower, by this I mean I ran out in
the rain in just my shorts and had a good wash, I
think in hindsight I should have taken my shorts off
for that very natural shower.
At 6.30 they let us in the building but we just
waited, waited and waited. I think both Rex and I were
feeling slightly hung over as well as very tired.
Eventually around 11 ish they let us onto the ferry.
Rex was shown to his western bunk, me to my asian
style. This style basically consists of 15 mats on the
floor to sleep on. It didn't look comfortable. I
actually had a 40 min nap, but the excited boys in my
room couldn't keep their excitement to themselves . I
decided to walk up onto the deck via Rex's room to see
if he was awake, he was. I notice two empty bunks in
his room so we decided to claim one. We then headed to
the restaurant and noticed the food is absolute shite.
Nasty cold Chinese food, but we had to eat,
unfortunately our lunch was disturbed by some old
geezer throwing up. I didn't look, I walked straight
out. Sick? No thank you.
So after I had a 5 hour sleep, a shower and a pot
noodle, I now find myself in the Mahjong room stealing
electricity off the boat to charge my laptop.
I'm very pleased I have my computer now (and my
international adaptors!) but I'm very confused about
this journal stuff. I mean, what do I write?
Everything? Will that be boring? I think I'll email
Rob (www.robnugen.com), the king of journal writing,
as soon as I get to Shanghai.
BTW I couldn't cancel my mobile cos we are in Kansai
area, long story. But it did mean I was able to send
out some last minute emails and make some short calls
to various cool people.
Tonight we played cribbage in the cards room, I think
Rex is getting better. Good laugh though- playing
cards in a smokey room, on a boat in the middle of the
China Sea, sipping cold cheap beer.

The Weather.
Wednesday 18th August 2004

I think the smooth exit from Japan was due to us
sailing on in-shore waters. This morning it was
*ROUGH*, I managed to get a good nights sleep and woke
around 7 am, Rex and I decided to grab some breakfast
but again the food was shite, but it was free. I took
a quick shower and went back to sleep, I felt
terrible.
Rex woke me at 12 ish and we headed for a salad lunch
after which we watched Lock Stock on my mac in the
cards room. After the movie we visited the ship's
cafe, we were the only customers in the place but we
took the opportunity to ask the girl behind the bar
many questions about China. She didn't speak the best
English but had a go. Rex and I thought she was lovely
so we managed to get a picture of her.
I'm a little surprised about the rainy weather, I
suppose I imagined hot sunshine and blue skies! Never
mind. I'm just sucking up this experience.
Meeting Rex in 30 mins, we got a good tip off the bar
worker. After we asked her why the food was so cold,
she recommended we arrive at 5.30 when it opens as the
food would be 'very hot'. We shall see. She also told
us the weather will be at its worst around 8.30
tonight, great!
We arrived at 5.30 to, yes, delicious HOT food!!!
(well not *THAT* delicious but hot nonetheless).
Around 8.30 - Big (ish) storm!

The City- Shanghai.
Thursday 19th and Friday 20th August 2004

Well Shanghai is a funny place. Very dirty, like
Bangkok but the people are loud and rather aggressive.
Don't think I like the place that much. But it's kind
of cool being in China and it certainly is an eye
opener. On Thursday we checked in at the Metropole
Hotel, very close to the centre of Shanghai. The hotel
was very nice, and it used to be the old Grand Hotel
of Shanghai, it's design was supposed to be old
British style but it didn't really look like it! It
was recommended in the Lonely Planet guide book under
the 'mid-range' section of accommodation. The book did
warn us that Shanghai is such a fast developing place,
and that some information might be out-of-date. We
can't find the Tourist information place that it told
us about. Anyway Shanghai has really given us what we
wanted and we feel as though we have 'done the place',
so tonight (Friday) we are taking a 14 hour train
journey to Beijing! Should be a great experience, we
purchased the tickets for 500 Yuen and have a 'soft
sleeper'. If I be honest I'm not 100% sure about China
but It'll be nice to see Beijing and visit the Great
Wall of China. I'll be looking forward to heading off
to Hong Kong soon.
Now I'm waiting in the China Bank because Rex has just
been screwed by an ATM machine. He put in 1200 Yuen
and the bastard (the ATM Machine that is) only gave
1000. I think money becomes more important when you're
traveling on a budget! But to be honest $25 is a fair
amount and I'd be doing exactly the same back home. We
are getting it sorted, Rex made a phone call and now
we are waiting in the bank, perhaps for 30 minutes or
so. I'm not sure if such a problem would be sorted out
in Japan this easy.
So now I'm on the night train, Yes- the train! This is
why I got this sexy sexy computer! I'm writing this
entry on the night train from Shanghai to Beijing. Not
much has happened since the bank incident, and as it
happens, Rex didn't get his cash back, well he has a
few numbers and shit but nothing concrete. I told him
to pay me back 100 (he owed me 200 from the train
ticket) so we could split the cost of the ATM cock-up.
I know I didn't have to, and I don't want a medal for
it, but I figured we are traveling together and I
suppose we have to stick together- A problem shared is
a problem halved. So as I was saying- I'm on the train
now. The train is really nice, especially for China.
We have the famous 'top bunks' again, but this time on
a train. When we arrived at the station we were
directed to the 'soft seat waiting room' where Rex
decided to get a couple of potent chinese sake drinks-
oh my god, they were awful! The pork jerky made it
taste a little better but then we decided to get a
mixer to make it go down a little easier- Rex got some
oolong tea and it was a much nicer! The best thing
about the train station was the place we were waiting.
We had a high position overlooking the whole station
area and it was incredible, and a little sad, to see
the people waiting for the cheap seats. Some had
babies and they were sleeping on old newspapers- I
think they had been there for some time. At one point
a few cops walked around the station, continuously
blowing whistles, telling people to move. It really
hit me, I could almost see the communist brutality of
it all. I mentioned to Rex that nothing like that
would ever happen, or indeed be allowed to happen, in
England, America or Japan!
Still- we drank, ate and waited for our 'soft
sleeper'.

The Con 'Artist'.
Saturday 21st August 2004.

Well today we explored Beijing, and I quite like the
place. We arrived at the buzzing, heaving train
station at 7.15 am. Rex and I were pretty tired and
hungry but we trekked on looking for food and a bed
for the night. We eventually found a youth hostel, and
although it was little grubby, it was cheap!! So,
after a shower in the prison style bathroom, we headed
into the centre of Beijing. The city is big, dirty and
cheap- but hey- thats my image of most of China so
far. After an hour or so, after seeing a beautiful
wedding, Rex met a girl called 'Alice' who spoke very
good english. She told us that she studied English at
a University in the city, nothing unusual, and we got
talking to her for about 45 minutes or so. We didn't
have anywhere in particular to go to, so we just
strolled around taking in the city, ÊAlice in tow.
Anyway when we arrived back in the shopping district
and Alice invited us to see an 'Art Exhibition' that
her university was holding, we thought OK- sounds
good. The exhibition was really nice with some great
pictures and Alice seemed to know an awful lot about
them. *THEN*- Sale time!!!! Alice now began telling us
that the pictures were for sale and we should choose
our favorite one and buy it! We told her, in the
nicest possible way, that we weren't interested. She
then started giving us a sob story, telling us the
sale of pictures helps students pay for their
scholarship! Oh- and its money the government can't
take from them! We were a little pissed off, I mean,
we assumed she was a nice girl who was proud of her
city and wanted to practice her english- wrong. We
left the 'Exhibition' and talked about what had just
happened. Sometimes, after one falls for such scams,
one feels a little stupid, silly and kind of ashamed;
yet Rex and I weren't. We both agreed it was an
interesting experience and gave us a story to tell. I
felt a little sad for girls like Alice, who have great
personalities and decent communicative skills, yet
only have one motive. It really didn't help improve my
somewhat negative image of Chinese people. As it
happens, we headed to a market area for bite to eat
where saw very similar pictures for sale, and probably
much cheaper! It later occurred to us that 'an art
exhibition visit' was the biggest scam in Beijing. So
many people (mostly cute young girls) approached us
with 'Hello', we were like 'no thank you!', actually
one guy came up to us in the evening and said 'Do you
like Chinese art?', I said 'No, but thank you for
starting the conversation like that!'
We then spent the afternoon in search of Tianamen
square, this was the place were that kid stood
in-front of a tank years ago, waving a flag, I suppose
it was an anti-communist thing. We also met a girl
here, well I say met, she approached us with the usual
'Hello', Rex said 'what are you selling, what's your
game?', which at the time I thought was a little
harsh, but I'm glad he did- she was up to no good. We
kind of interrogated her about her major- she could
only really tell us that she studied, and I quote-
'Computers- like IT', she said she came to the square
to practice English. Maybe she was genuine but I
suppose we didn't want to take any risks, we lost her
and tried to find our way back to the youth hostel but
Beijing in a big old city! We figured that we had
enough cash and we should take a cab, and I'm glad we
did because it was a bloody long way. I did the usual
thing I do whenever I get into a taxi, no- not asking
the guy what time he finishes nor if it was busy (he
wouldn't of understood anyway), but I spent the whole
journey nervously looking at the meter, hoping I
wasn't being screwed or if I had enough money. The
fare came to 11 Chinese , thats about 1.25J, $1.25
or 0.70p, for an 8 minute journey! It made Rex and I
laugh!
In the evening we decided to head out for some beer
and Peking Duck, It really was a must considering we
were in the city thats famous for it! It was very good
and much cheaper than I've ever paid in England. After
a beer and duck supper we headed to a bar for a few
more drinks where once again we were screwed over by
the dirty, cheating Chinese, We paid 30 for some
drinks and after giving her 100, she gave me 50 back-
you do the math.
A long day- in a city that has some shifty fellows.
But I like Beijing, I really do- its a fascinating
contrast of commercialism and communism, rich and
(very) poor, old and new. It really is one of those
places you have to visit to believe.
