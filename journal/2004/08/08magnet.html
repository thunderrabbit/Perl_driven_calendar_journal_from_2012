<p>Watch a footbag video of dudes doing incredible stuff with
footbags. Really incredible skillz.  Made me, Dan, and Jesse look like
HSW (wusses) in comparison.</p>

<p>Watched cartoon network until I fell asleep deeply until
morning.</p>

<p>Jimmy showed me some sketches of <a
href="http://www.thunderrabbit.com/">Thunder Rabbit</a> and Scout
Seven that he made after reading Eclipse.  Cool stuff.  I have never
previously seen a drawn interpretation of TR and Scout.</p>

<p>I studied a bit of Japanese this morning (reading my √œµÂ-±ß√Ë
book) and now I'm on the train home.  Gotta be at work in four
hours.</p>
