Rob Nugen: yeah
Madeline: and whether that's possible
Madeline: yeah.
Madeline: yeah
Rob Nugen: It's not possible
Madeline: i know
Madeline: i could just kick myself
Rob Nugen: cause if you run away to find yourself, it just takes time for yourself to catch up with where you are.
Madeline: lol
Madeline: ya think?
Rob Nugen: your self is all like, "hey wait for me!"
Rob Nugen: yeah!
Madeline: I think of running away as meditation
Madeline: heh hehe
Madeline: running away is a clear space
Madeline: where nothing "is"
Rob Nugen: Cause as soon as we're in a new area, we see all these new things that distract us from seeing ourselfses
Madeline: it's the space in between
Madeline: i'm obssessed
Madeline: i know, i love it!
Madeline: that's why i was like, hey, japan!

Madeline: ah
Madeline: what are your measurements again?
Rob Nugen: You have pictures, right?
Madeline: yes, somewhere...
Madeline: buried
Rob Nugen: "she had to use both hands to wrap around his huge throbbing member."
Madeline: ah, yes! now i remember!
Madeline: you remember my pussy?
Rob Nugen: Definitely
Rob Nugen: I enjoyed licking it for hours
Madeline: how many girls have you fucked
Madeline: mmmm
<!-- Rob Nugen: And then masking it with those huge gumballs. Remember?
Madeline: masking?
Rob Nugen: Yeah cause I had to go home to Wende that night we were at my job. I told her some lie about some shit and we did it and then ate gumballs to cover up the sex flavor all over my face.
Madeline: Ah! Yes, I remember!
Madeline: Woo -->
Madeline: So, are you glad you left Wende?
Rob Nugen: Yeah overall I am glad.
Rob Nugen: I wrote about that a littlebit today.
Madeline: why is that
Madeline: did you just not love her?
Madeline: or love but not "in love"
2:10 PM
Rob Nugen: Number T in my list:
Rob Nugen: t. I broke up with Wende several months before our wedding date. I still haven't really forgiven myself for that. When I visited her during my 6,000 mile adventure west of Dallas, I recognized a few things that had forced me to realize I couldn't be with her forever. I had to drill into my head there are things that won't allow this to work because I knew I wouldn't remember them later. I just remember the awesomeness of Wende's character and what a great person she is.
Madeline: yeah, that's how i am with the boyfriend
Rob Nugen: So I don't remember what it was, but there were just things I couldn't get over.
Madeline: i keep remembering how awesome he is.
Madeline: actually, there was nothing "wrong" with our relationship
Rob Nugen: But with you, my new hot lover, who I can't fucking believe I didn't get to kiss when you had braces, I'll never get tired of.
Madeline: haha
Madeline: of course
Rob Nugen: So why did you break up with him?
Madeline: i've known you for like 3 or 4 years
Madeline: well
Rob Nugen: do you want to talk about it (The Boyfriend)
Rob Nugen: ?
Madeline: everything was awesome
Madeline: (yes)
Rob Nugen: go
Madeline: but some sort of stupid voice inside just kept saying "break up with him break up with him break up with him"
Rob Nugen: yeah?
Madeline: at first, he wasn't the type of person i wanted to date (not the looks I usu. go for)
Madeline: so I just told myself I'd break up with him in a month or so
Madeline: then i fell in love with him
Madeline: and he is so caring and i've never been taken care of so amazingly by someone, loved so amazingly and deeply
Madeline: i don't know.
Madeline: i don't know if I'm "in" love, is what i told myself
Madeline: I love him so much
Madeline: and i'm really regretting it
Madeline: sometimes i'll be fine
Madeline: and then sometimes it's the pits of despair
Madeline: so much crying
Madeline: so much body racking tears
Madeline: .
Rob Nugen: I know those tears.
2:15 PM
Madeline: yeah?
Rob Nugen: My body wracking tears
Rob Nugen: why in the hell do I have these questions floating around in my head and why can't I just settle and be normal like normal people and just get married?
Madeline: yeah.
Rob Nugen: I've had 2 chances to get married and have given them both up for different reasons.
Rob Nugen: I might have a 3rd chance right now, but I won't do it because there's you frolicking around out there and there's Sally frolicking around out there and there's probably even *another* woman that I might have the hots for someday!
Madeline: o man! so many choices!
Rob Nugen: What's a guy to do?
Madeline: yeah. so many fucking choices.
Madeline: fuck
Rob Nugen: fuck!
Madeline: do you think you've ever been in love?
Rob Nugen: Fuckity fucking fucky mc fuck fuck!
Rob Nugen: our society doesn't know what love is.
Rob Nugen: So I don't know what love is.
Rob Nugen: So, i dont' know.
Madeline: which society knows?
Madeline: how come other ppl can do it?
Rob Nugen: I think the Greeks knew more than we.
Madeline: let's fuck each other in the butt. yeah.
Rob Nugen: they had different words for different names.
Madeline: (gross generalzation.........
Rob Nugen: for different types of love
Madeline: like what
Madeline: do tell
Rob Nugen: I dunno., Eros, Amor, Love, sex, country, brother, mom, dad, babysitter, baby sister
2:20 PM
Madeline: hot
Rob Nugen: "trying to find out about the structure of the language and also aspects of the culture."
Rob Nugen: (that's from a summary of a thesis)
Madeline: nice
Rob Nugen: the idea being that language affects the way peoples' braiins work.
Madeline: your thesis
Madeline: ah
Madeline: well
Rob Nugen: if we don't have words that talk about different types of love, how can we understand them?
Madeline: maybe that's why youre trying to learn so many different languages
Madeline: you want to find the true meaning of love
Rob Nugen: Haha maybe so.
Rob Nugen: I'm looking for a different article I read
Rob Nugen: to support my theory that says English speakers don't understand love because the language doesn't support that understanding
Rob Nugen: BUT!!!!
Rob Nugen: What's more important that talking about what we don't know is talking about what we do:
Rob Nugen: I read about LOVE in the book The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck??
Rob Nugen: and he gave a really good definition
Madeline: do tel
Madeline: l
Rob Nugen: suggesting that we fall in love easily; it's effortless to fall in love
Rob Nugen: and it feels like it will last forever
Rob Nugen: because our ego boundaries with this other person drop, and our egos suddenly feel expanded.
Rob Nugen: the feeling of expansion makes us feel that we've touched the universe and its infiniteness
Rob Nugen: We think, whooohoo! I've found true love this is it mufuka! get out of my way!
Rob Nugen: BUT
Madeline: but
Rob Nugen: at some point, after we spend long enough with the person, we recognize that the other person is not, in fact, the universe, and that we do, in fact, still have our own egos, and the other person, does, in fact, still have their own distinct ego
Rob Nugen: At this point we have a choice.
Rob Nugen: We can choose to stay with the person, to begin to actively love them
Rob Nugen: or we can choose to find another to fall in love with.
Rob Nugen: to actually *love* some one takes effort.
Madeline: and start the cycle all over again?
Rob Nugen: we have that option.
Rob Nugen: to actually love someone takes effort
Madeline: man, i thought i was putting forth effort.
Madeline: man.
Rob Nugen: he defines love as putting forth effort to help someone else's or our own spiritual being
Madeline: wow
Rob Nugen: like actively thinking of what will help that person, and what will help ourselves and taking steps to help make those things happen
Rob Nugen: My summary of his definition is not exactly what he wrote, but the idea is right.
Madeline: man, this is fucking me up
Madeline: or should i say...
Rob Nugen: in a good way or bad way?
Madeline: i am letting myself be fucked up by this
Madeline: both
Rob Nugen: Ah thank you.
Rob Nugen: good to take responsibility for your own reactions to something.
Madeline: it's definitely letting me see it in a new light
Rob Nugen: awesome
2:30 PM
Madeline: maybe i didn't let myself be mature enough to love him
Madeline: but is that "in love" with him
Madeline: how do you account for that voice that i kept hearing?
Rob Nugen: http://www.google.com/search?q=m.%20scott%20peck%20definition%20of%20love
Madeline: breakupbreakup
Rob Nugen: I don't know about the voice, but
Rob Nugen: but
Rob Nugen: but
Rob Nugen: I have the belief that we are guided by our angels
Rob Nugen: our angels' voices are the quiet small voices that are never angry, always loving, always patient
Rob Nugen: our ego has a megaphone; our brain has tons of messages embedded by our surroundings.
Rob Nugen: our angels give us guidance, but sometimes it's hard to hear
Rob Nugen: eeks
Madeline: i wish those voices would tell me what to do now.
Rob Nugen: sorry to state that it's hard to hear our angels; I wish to easily hear my angels at all times.
Rob Nugen: yes, exactly what you say
Madeline: the voices got plenty louder, and then i broke up with im and they disa-fuckin-peared
Rob Nugen: you want to hear what to do right now.
Madeline: yeah, and now where did the voice go?
Madeline: where the fuck?
Madeline: what the fuck.
Madeline: check out my blog
Rob Nugen: Okay, so here you are, without a boyfriend, and without an internal guide.
Madeline: you'll get a taste of my pain.
Madeline: yeah.
Madeline: do go on rabbitangel
Rob Nugen: I read it.
Rob Nugen: Nice writing.
Rob Nugen: Very...
Rob Nugen: accurate
Madeline: dramatic?
Madeline: yeah
Madeline: accurate
Rob Nugen: not damatic
Rob Nugen: well not overly dramatic
Rob Nugen: it's perfect. it's what you feel.
Madeline: i try to listen and translate what it really feels like
Madeline: from body to word
Rob Nugen: I believe we are here on earth in order to experience things, and above all to experience our emotions.
Madeline: well, that's happening all the fuckin time now
Rob Nugen: I believe this because if I stuff an emotion, it will wait until I experience it.
Rob Nugen: in all its perfect glory, it will wait until I experience it.
Madeline: you know what's embarrassing? crying in front of a potential roommate in his house because he asks you why you're moving out from your last place
Rob Nugen: even if I forget what the emotion was about, the feeling is still there.
Madeline: that's true, it will wait and glory glory jump out of you
Rob Nugen: ha. wow.
Madeline: yeah
Madeline: weird
Madeline: i only let 2 tears fall though
Madeline: decided that was not a good time to break down
Rob Nugen: So here you are, with these experiences with you.
Madeline: chin up push through
Madeline: yup
Rob Nugen: Well right now, you can break down.
Madeline: still living in OUR apartment
Madeline: he's not here
Rob Nugen: if you're in a safe place, break down.
Madeline: yeah well...
Madeline: i better sleep instead.
Madeline: i have a job i hate in the morning
Rob Nugen: cry your beautiful eyes out; there is another side to your pain.
Madeline: thanks, lovely.
Madeline: yr lovely.
Madeline: 
Rob Nugen: sometimes we are trapped in a barn, and have to descend to dig our way out
Rob Nugen: to the sunlight
Rob Nugen: you can do it.
Madeline: that's a kiss
Rob Nugen: I feel it.
Madeline: thanks baby
Madeline: you rock
Rob Nugen: I love you too.
Rob Nugen: you rock
Rob Nugen: good night
Madeline: i just feel like there is a rubberband and i want to snap back to him
2:40 PM
Madeline: rrr
Rob Nugen: bless that feeling
Rob Nugen: thank that emotion for what it gives you
Madeline: rar!
Madeline: thats not fuckin easy
Madeline: fffffffff
Rob Nugen: pour love over that feeling and thank the feeling for what it offers you
Madeline: all righty then
Rob Nugen: gifts and gifts are being offered. bless them and thank them
Madeline: i'm gonna go pee on myself
Madeline: much love to you
Madeline: later, bebs!
Rob Nugen: see you sooon
Madeline has gone offline.
