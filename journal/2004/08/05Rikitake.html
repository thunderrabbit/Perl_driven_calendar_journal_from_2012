<p>"We're going to Yokohama, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"You want to go this way, then?"</p>

<p>Oops. Without thinking I had headed up the steps toward the tracks
for Shibuya, not Yokohama.</p>

<p>Beautiful.</p>

<p>Riki rocked in there and got them registered for the new data
stream programs and now they're evaluating the different programs
available to snag the data.  Ian has gone to lunch with Wendy and Paul
is helping Riki (Paul who knows the current system, and Riki who knows
Japanese) and I am on the train to meet my 3 year old student Sanami
at 2pm.</p>

<p>Everything is cool.</p>

<p>The coolest thing is that I didn't know how long it would take at
Ian's.  I considered calling and canceling or adjusting the time for
the lesson with Sanami, but never actually did it, and everything
worked out with awesome timing.</p>

<p>Oh, and I'll work there on weekends in September.  And maybe
during the week in August.</p>
