<p>Just had Erika, who I've had once or twice before. Pretty long time
ago.  She obviously was flirting with me saying I look strong and
telling me I could get a wife in Japan.</p>

<p>I felt all the sensations in my body, none of which were in my
crotch, but just tingly ideas over my body.  Like what would it be
like to kiss her?  Could I kiss her here?  What about just a bite on
the neck?  How would it feel?  How would she taste?  I was vaguely
able to turn off the banter with, "how would it turn out in the
end?"</p>

<p>Man.</p>

<p>That was hard.</p>

<p>Lesson before that was a challenge for me to help this guy with a
book 2 level of grammar understand book 4 structures and vocabulary.
I focused on book 4 vocabulary and book 2 grammars: "Who heard the
explosion?" "Neighbors heard the explosion."</p>

<p>I went through several different sentences like that, and I
basically refused to write them down and handed over the pen and paper
to him.  He refused (unintentionally, I'm sure) to write "the" before
"explosion" but I figured correcting that wouldn't be helpful
overall.</p>

<p>Had a pretty good lesson with Mari, the student to whom I wrote
the weak postcard yesterday.  We practiced rejoinders, and she has
gotten better at them than she was yesterday or two days ago when I
saw her before.</p>

<p>Cool Tatsuya finished his book and bought book 6.  He did quite
well on the level up test - 96% correct, and I graded pretty
strictly.</p>
