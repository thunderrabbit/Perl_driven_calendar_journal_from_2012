<p>Katsuki has this trick of blowing snot out his nose so it sticks
to his upper lip or nose or wherever.  Gross.  But funny in a five
year old way.</p>

<p>We played a well designed board game (during which he would count
the correct number of spaces, but start from a space that would result
in him landing in an optimal space) and Calvinball baseball and then
vaguely normal soccer and then did an electronic book thing that made
me quickly realize how people could use them as electronic
instruments.</p>

<p>Katsuki asked if I would come back sometime soon and I said yes,
though no definite plans were made.  While we had been playing soccer,
I remembered big gushing tears on my little 5 or 7 year old
first-cousin-once-removed Cody's face (my cousin Bridgette's son) as I
said "bye" to him after we played during the hang out time after
Granddad's (he called him Very Granddad (Very = Great)) funeral.
Bridgette assured him I would see him again sometime, but that time
has so far not come.  It's been at least 10 years I'm sure.</p>

<p>Not so far gone are the tears on Barbie's daughter's face (fuckin'
hell I can't think of her name) as I left Virginia nearly 2 years
ago.  She was 5 at the time.  Maybe she'll forgive the time if I come
back during my bicycle adventure around the world.</p>
