<p>Wow; did I really not write anything today?</p>

<p>This morning I had a dream that I caught a frisbee and I whipped my
arm out and smacked the bed.  Fortunately, Hitomi was already awake
and up.  She was like, "どしたの?" (wtf?) and I was like, "I caught a
frisbee."</p>

<p>Work was pretty cool; I had 7 lessons.  Last two lessons were with
Kyoko who has a really pretty smile.  We practiced prepositions like,
"it is in the book on the computer on the table in rooom 17 in Gaba in
Jiyugaoka in Tokyo in Japan next to China."  It took her a while to
grok it, but she did after a few practice decipherings.</p>

<p>Been messing around with gmail tonight after reading a disturbing
trend of kids being mean to each other via chat and text
messages...  I just never thought of it, but apparently it's nothing
new (as old as text messaging)</p>

<p>Saw a pretty cool new toy, that I decided I wouldn't want to buy
unless I could buy like 10 sets: <a

<p>Oh, class today was pretty good; I had done homework, which was
good, but I was a bit tired after being up (until 2am) with Hitomi.</p>
