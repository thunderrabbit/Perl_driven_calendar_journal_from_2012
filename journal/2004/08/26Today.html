<p class=date>4:50pm JST Thursday 26 August 2004</p>

<p>Today I did the following (and more):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Had a really vivid dream that I didn't write down nor
remember.</p></li>

<li><p>Listened to Paul talk about the computer stuff.  I imagined
writing what he was saying and realized I would need to
use <em>lots</em> of parenthesis to keep track of all the asides.  He
reminds me of the way Kristen talks, but he stays generally on topic
and has lots of quick asides.  (She goes miles off topic with huge
elaborate stories that somehow all link together.)</p></li>

<li><p>Sent 100,000 yen on its way home.  Should end up with, I'm
hoping, 900 dollars once it arrives in my account at home.  I had to
get help from the bank security guy, but from now on I'll be able to
do it myself.  (Before today, I had never really studied the kanji
next to all the buttons, but I tried it a few times myself before I
resorted to asking for help.)</p></li>

<li><p>Watched a bit of a movie featuring a rather attractive woman
who I'm sure is famous, but I just don't know who she is.  The movie
had some other people too, who are equally unfamous to me.</p></li>

<li><p>Chose not to visit the bike shop in Nakameguro.  (I may visit
them on my way home after Japanese lesson tomorrow.)</p></li>

<li><p>Got a hug from Shoko who was elated when she found herself one
step closer to getting the email of some guy she likes.</p></li>

<li><p>Watched the guys across the street work on the building.  They
had poured the concrete foundation yesterday and were removing the
wooden frame from the foundation today.  The foundation they poured is
not a flat surface, but a grid kinda.  And in the middle of each
square there is a lump of dirt remaining.  It's like they carved a
grid of ditches into the dirt and poured a grid shaped wall within the
ditches.  I imagine the dirt will come out soon, and that it was left
there just to make it easier to navigate the grid.  (They can walk
across the dirt instead of follow the grid.)</p></li>

<li><p>Put a bit of thought into Jesse's new internet money-making
idea.  It sounds pretty cool.  Possibly do-able; well, definitely
do-able; we just need the traffic.</p></li>

<li><p>Wrote this entry while on the train going to Shinjuku</p></li>

<li><p>Upon arrival in Shinjuku, received a text message from my first
Gateway 21 student asking to cancel our lesson today (45 minutes
before the lesson was to start; argh.)</p></li>

<li><p>Decided to use the time to study.</p></li>

<li><p>Was spotted by Saori, one of my ex-Gaba students.  We briefly
updated each other on our lives and exchanged connective data.  Nice
to see her again.</p></li>
