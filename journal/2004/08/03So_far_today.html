<p>Ummmm...  Oh I had a dream this morning that included allowing
myself to relax and just enjoy life.  My mom was there, all dressed
nicely and couldn't enjoy the river with us at that time.  All about
choices.</p>

<p>Talked to Jen who said her weekend job gave her a raise.
Awesome.</p>

<p>I wrote to Ian offering my computer slash runner services in
September.  I basically gave him free choice over everything in
September.  October 21 - January 31 goes to P-B, if I get that
job, but he can have September.</p>

<p>I studied Japanese a bit; learned some new vocabulary:</p>

<p>たいよう　太陽
<br>すいせい　水星
<br>きんせい　金星
<br>ちきゅう　地球
<br>かせい　　火星
<br>もくせい　木星
<br>どせい　　土星</p>

<p>That's all I remember now.  That is the sun and first six planets
in order.  Now, rest assured, I don't know all the vocabulary that
most people who know *this* vocabulary know.</p>
