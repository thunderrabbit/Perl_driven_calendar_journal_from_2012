<p>Just went to the bike shop with Hitomi (during an extended remix
lunch break during the day today) and the range of bike prices that
I'm looking at is 160,000 - 200,000 yen (including all the upgrades
(seat, saddlebags, etc) Hmm.</p>

<p>5800 yen for a lock.</p>

<p>After talking with Andrew about bike options, I don't think I want
to get one of the cyclocross bikes (the above mentioned price).
Cause when I went back and asked the guy if I could ride the bike
down stairs he was like, "no."</p>

<p>I like to ride my bike down stairs.  If, while I'm tooling around
Tokyo, I can't ride down stairs, I don't want to ride.  I would
destroy the bike.  Andrew says, "well, you have no choice, mate;
you've got to get a mountain bike."  Or a hybrid.</p>
