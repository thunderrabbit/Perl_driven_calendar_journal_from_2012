<p class=dream>Fred and I had some bags that we needed to hide.  We
were in a building that was normally very quiet, but now was quite
occupied.  When I used to hide things in this building, there were
very few people around, so I was able to explore the area carefully
and figure out how to get into the most remote and obnoxiously
difficult area to get to, where my stuff wouldn't be found by anyone
else.</p>

<p class=dream>There were escalators where there had been a hallway,
and there were people crawling all about the building; it was a YRUU
rally, but no one was greeting me.  I could basically walk around and
be ignored.  I had a bit of trouble remembering just where my secret
location had been because of the reconstruction, and when I found it,
Dream Keeper and Night Mage had made the room adjacent into their
bedroom.  And someone was awake in the bedroom, so I couldn't use
that room to get into my secret room.</p>

<p class=dream>I remembered the last time I had been in this building,
there had been a horse track, or a street for horses, and that area
was now a large front lawn for a modern office building facade.</p>

<p class=dream>Fred headed quickly down that hall because he thought
that would lead to a new secret area and he wanted to go down the
escalators into a new open area below, and I wanted to go up and
explore.  We parted ways and I woke up.</p>
