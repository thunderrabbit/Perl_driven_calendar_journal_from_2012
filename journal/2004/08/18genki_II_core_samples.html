<p>During the lesson, the binder place called, so I headed out there
after the lesson.  I talked to two people with my best Japanese trying
to explain that I want to borrow their hole punch.  I don't know a
word that means borrow, but I know "give," as in "give me a hole
punch" but I didn't think that was the right tactic to use.</p>


<p>I was a bit worried for a bit that my plan of punching the book
here (and my two workbooks) was simply not going to happen.  I was at
a complete loss for how to explain what I wanted to do.  Fortunately,
an employee who could speak pretty natural English showed up and got
me hooked up pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I sat at their little desk and punched Genki II and the pages of my
two workbooks.  Awesome.  Cleaned up all the holes, many stacks of
which were compressed together like layers of rock in a core
sample.</p>

<p>On my way out of the store, I showed these to the woman who had
translated for me, and she was duly impressed, but not impressed
enough to keep them in her personal box of knick knacks, nor even
impressed enough to take a picture for her scrapbook.</p>

<p>I'm not even that impressed; the miniature paper core samples have
been discarded into the depths of my bag, to be cleaned out when the
time is right.</p>
