<p>Haha I told Jen to tell Dan that I can't make it to his final and
last bye-bye party tonight because I have big plans to climb Mt
Mofaka tomorrow.  Hahahaha.</p>

<p>(( She thought I was serious, and she was sad. ))</p>

<p class=date>10:46pm</p>

<p>Dan has been here 1 year tomorrow.  We wonder when it was that I
broke 10 spokes on my borrowed bike.  A year ago today?</p>

<p class=message>hello everyone..this is jen...im sitting next to rob
so i want to say hello...so hello!</p>

<p>Hahahahaahah</p>

<p>This morning, at 5am, in Shibuya, on a local train, headed for
Tsunashima, Dan sat down.</p>

<p>At 7:20am, in Naka Meguro, on a Limited Express, headed toward
Shibuya, Dan woke up.</p>

<p class=date>10:58pm</p>

<p>We're kickin' it at the Dirty W in Tsunashima.  I'm sad to see Dan
go, but I'm priviledged to hang out with him without a huge posse of
people; just Jen, Tetsu, me and Hitomi are here.  And Dan is not crazy
zany drunk (*), so that's good.</p>

<p>(*) Jen invites me to write "yet" at this point, as she has hung
out with him many more times than I have.</p>

<p class=date>11:57pm</p>

<p>We didn't stay all night; Jen had to go to Dan's and pick up some
stuff including my clippers (!) and, ultimately, Bluey (@).</p>

<p>(!) Dan offhandedly said that I could have his clippers, which is
awesome cause today I was wishing that I had asked him for them, and
had assumed that he had promised them to someone else.  When Jen
mentioned that she was going to Dan's house tonight to get some stuff,
Dan said she could get the clippers, too.  Then, when Jen was like,
"what else am I getting?"  Dan and I both said, "my clippers."</p>

<p>High five.</p>

<p>(@) Bluey is Dan's trusty friend and companion (and some say life
partner) and two wheeled human powered transportation vehicle.</p>
