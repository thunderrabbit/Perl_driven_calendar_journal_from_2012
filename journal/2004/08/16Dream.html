<p class=dream>Maggie had learned to ride a motorcycle, and made a
greeting-card video of her on the motorcycle.  She had a video camera
on the bike looking up at her as she rode and talked to me.  She kept
looking at the camera more than the road and I was really worried that
she might wreck (she was riding really fast), but I reminded myself
that because she had already sent the video, she must have survived
actually making the video.</p>

<p class=dream>Then she was actually talking to me in realtime, saying
she had been in touch with John, who had told her that he really
admired what I was doing.  I was like, "why?" and she said that he
said I've got two women who will blow me at anytime.  I was like, "??"
because he didn't say anything about my having gone to Japan, nor
gotten a new job/apartment situation here or any of that.</p>

<p class=dream>I asked Maggie if she was one of the girls, and she was
not ashamed to be like, "yeah; I just haven't told you," and began to
show her technique, but not on me or actually anyone.  We were in my
dad's house in Magnolia and in the master bathroom where there were
google adwords ads placed in the bottom of the sink so when I was
brushing my teeth I would read them.  I wondered about how I could get
my ads into that mix; they were ads with much more copy than just
three lines.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed someone was sorting laundry in the laundry
hamper, which is big enough for two kids to play hide and seek in, and
I nudged Maggie with my leg to have her stop honing her skill.  She
didn't stop at first so I nearly pushed her over with my foot/leg and
she was like, "д└дь?" (who [is it]?) and I didn't say anything cause I
didn't want to be too obvious about covering something up and also, I
didn't know who it was.  The person emerged, and I was glad to see it
was a new roommate, a new English teacher who had moved in.  He was
like, "hi" and made no mention of anything out of the ordinary, and
just asked if we knew of any good travel agents in the area.  Maggie
was like, "no" and feigned surprise like she had never heard there
were any travel agents in the area and went so far as to write down
the name of the agent the guy had mentioned.</p>

<p>Something else happened and I woke up.</p>
