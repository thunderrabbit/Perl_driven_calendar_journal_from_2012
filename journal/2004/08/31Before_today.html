<p class=date>11:43am JST Tuesday 31 August 2004</p>

<p>Today I have been on the computer and wondering what it is that I
need to do right now to help me get to where I want to be.  Do I need
to write a list of goals as janette suggested most recently?   Do I
need to start writing to companies that might sponsor my bicycle
adventure?  Do I need to write specifications for the map project
that I want for my bicycle adventure?</p>

<p>I noted there's a difference between doing something for the
experience and doing something for the fame.  Primarily, I want to do
the bike tour for the experience.  I think that's cooler and more
altruistic (although I don't really know what that word means) than
doing it for the fame.  So that means I shouldn't get stuck on calling
a bunch of companies to see who will sponsor me and what TV crew will
come with me etc.  And then I wondered if that's just fear of the
unknown keeping me from making those phone calls and emails.</p>

<p>I think the best way for me would be to just do my adventure and
use my site as an advertising point and if someone wants to send a
crew out, then that's fine.</p>

<p>So what do I do *right* *now*?  Sleep?  Buy a bike?  Study
Japanese?  Study Chinese?  Write a plan for my trip?  Take a shower?
Plan my wardrobe for the interview tonight?  (not *there's* a
something I don't say very often)... what?</p>

<p>I wondered about calling Char, my spiritually connected friend.
Maybe I could visit a palm reader in Jiyugaoka.  Maybe send copies of
my palms to Richard Unger and say, "where am I and what am I
doing?"</p>

<p>All of those seemed more challenging than optimal.  I remembered
that I have runes right here.  I spilled them from the bag onto my
bed, massaged them in a pile then picked them all up: "<em>what is the
best thing for me to read right now?</em>"</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Thurisaz</b></p>

<p>... <em>Thurisaz</em> represents the frontier between Heaven and
the mundane. Arriving here is a recognition of your readiness to
contact the numinous, the Divine, to illuminate your experience so
that its meaning shines through its form.</p>

<p>... Now is not a time to make decisions...</p>

<p>Visualize yourself standing before a gateway on a hilltop.  Your
entire life lies out behind you and below.  Before you step through
the gateway, pause and review the past... - everything it took to
bring you here.  Observe it all, bless it all, release it all.  For it
is in letting go of the past that you reclaim your power.</p>

<p>(From <b>The BOOK of RUNES</b> by Ralph H. Blum)</p>

<h1>Things I have done</h1>

<p>In order of recall:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>I started writing a diary in April 1987, after having decided I
didn't want to forget the details of a cool week long camping trip I
had been on.  I don't remember all the details, but they are all
recorded, and I remember more of the details than I would have
otherwise.  I might not remember that trip at all.</p></li>

<li><p>I started writing my journal online in 1996 I think.</p></li>

<li><p>I drove my car 11,000 miles around the US before I came to
Japan.  I decided it would be a good thing to see my own country
before I see Japan.  I saw several states.  I met many people.  I
regret having kissed a woman in Oklahoma and I regret not having more
fully kissed a woman in Ohio.</p></li>

<li><p>Sally taught me not to regret anything.  But I still do.</p></li>

<li><p>I had great fun seeing part of my family in Virginia.  I felt
I was on a time schedule and didn't see more of my family.  I'm kinda
sad about that.  (different than regret?)</p></li>

<li><p>Several times I didn't know where to stop to sleep.  I slept on
a concrete picnic table in a rest stop in Arkansas.  I slept in my car
hidden behind some bushes (I hoped) in New Mexico on the way up the
hill to Carlsbad Caverns.  I didn't think I was allowed to be there
overnight and didn't know if I would get in trouble or not.</p></li>

<li><p>I watched the end of Ice Age on a wide screen TV at Walmart at
3am.</p></li>

<li><p>I remember Kristen telling me that she engaged someone in a
relationship and instead of being caught up in the relationship, she
thought to herself, "so, this is what it's like to be in this type of
relationship."  When it was time for her to quit; she quit.</p></li>

<li><p>I put together Recycling Day in 1993 at University of Houston.
For a long time, it was the coolest thing I thought I had ever
done.</p></li>

<li><p>I was on the front page of The Daily Cougar (UH newspaper) the
Friday before Spring Break one year.  I was photographed while
catching a frisbee under my feet.  The picture looked awesome, and I
was really happy to have some copies of it.  I still do
somewhere.</p></li>

<li><p>Marcel and I acted in a commercial for Recycling Day.  We posed
as Hans and Frans and it was really fun and funny and cool.  During
the shooting, when the camera crew had some problems, we were referred
to as "talent" in the phrase, "talent can chill."</p></li>

<li><p>I hit my brother for the last time after I hit him in the
middle of the back and knocked him down.  I remember being horrified
at that moment like, "God, what have I done?" or more like, "what have
I been doing [hitting him all these times]?" and I knew I would never
hit him again.</p>

<p>We were near the water faucet by the air conditioner at one end of
the back porch.  I don't remember what we were fighting about, but
I've got hints in my mind that we were fighting about how to properly
fill Jedi's water dish.  (God, how ridiculous.)  I was mad at him and
just slugged him in the back and he went splat onto the
ground.</p>

<p>I wasn't afraid at that moment that I had permanently hurt him,
but I knew it was wrong.  I never hit him again.</p></li>

<li><p>I spent 3 or 4 years in YRUU as a youth and 4 or 5 years in
YRUU as an advisor.  I used to dream about YRUU every night while I
was an advisor.  Always doing different things with the youth; often
in school with them at Rice University or some random UU-only
shcool.</p></li>

<li><p>During the mass wedding at Plano Rally, Bryn and I hugged for
about 15 minutes, crying as we rejoiced in the fun times we had shared
over the years.</p>

<p>I haven't talked to her in months, but I've heard she went to
SWUUSI this past July.</p></li>

<li><p>I cried at the end of closing circle at my last YRUU SWUUSI.
Wende was there for me.  So were Bryn and Sean.</p></li>

<li><p>I owned a house with Wende.  $229,900 was our purchase price.
It was a bit more than we could easily afford, but the house was *so*
nice.  We knew we would have it the day we looked at it.</p>

<p>I was barefoot and in shorts the day we looked at it.</p></li>

<li><p>I walked around barefoot for 5 or 7 years in Houston.  During
college I switched from shod to free, and I loved it.  Before I
accepted a position at Scholars' Community, I made sure I'd be able to
work barefoot.</p></li>

<li><p>I played frisbee every Saturday night with a ragtag group of
people that came to be The Saturday Night Specials.  The group has
transmogrified, but they are still ragtag, and they still play, but
not on Saturday nights.  Now they are the Penultimates.</p></li>

<li><p>I spent 6 months living with janette in Dallas.  I could have
dated married her forever save my concern about our age
difference.</p></li>

<li><p>I broke up with Wende several months before our wedding date.
I still haven't really forgiven myself for that.  When I visited her
during my 6,000 mile adventure west of Dallas, I recognized a few
things that had forced me to realize I couldn't be with her forever.
I had to drill into my head <em>there are <b>things</b> that won't
allow this to work</em> because I knew I wouldn't remember them
later.  I just remember the awesomeness of Wende's character and
what a great person she is.</p></li>

<li><p>I have received Wende's wedding invitation for Wende's marriage
to Peter, who, ironically, has the same name as one of her cats.  I
have chosen not to go, "because I can't face her family," which is all
but true; I really couldn't face myself for having broken up with her.
I have considered writing a letter to them in explanation and apology
and blessing and release.</p></li>

<li><p>I have had my palm read by a man named Richard Unger.  He is
based in California (San Francisco I think) and has an amazing
ability.  I won't describe the details here, but he told me that I am
supposed to do something for the world.  And I believed him.</p></li>

<li><p>My friend Rebecca, a professional psychic (with whom I've lost
touch after she sold her store, The Indigo Angel), after hearing my
head cracking skating story, told me that while I was unconcious, my
angels told me what it is I'm supposed to do this lifetime.  And when
I'm ready, I can go into meditation and ask them again.</p>

<p>I got the impression that it was a cool something that I'm
supposed to do.</p></li>

<li><p>My friend Char, who, while speaking to me, would look up over
my head (at my crown chakra?) and come up with amazingly insightful
ideas, told me, after I told her that I wanted to do astral projection
and I wanted to do it *now*, that I would be able to do astral
projection and that astral projection would just be the *start* of it
all, but that I first needed to learn patience.</p></li>

<li><p>I met a man in a Post Office who had a great deal of trouble
trying to buy some stamps.  His hands were shaking and I was like,
"wow; I could help him," and I offered to help him.  He said, "no
thank you; I need to learn how to do this myself."</p>

<p>God bless that moment as he shared with me that he had had a
stroke and that he was relearning how to do all the things that he
had been able to previously do.</p>

<p>But one thing that got me most of all: he said that God had
previously tried to teach him patience, and the man never learned.
Now, after having a stroke, he was, finally and absolutely, learning
patience.</p></li>

<li><p>Wende and I joined Fred and his then girlfriend in a surprise
visit to Fred at his school.  It was great.  The girlfriend was in on
it (forgot her name) and she told me where Fred's next class was.  I
arrived in class, sat in the back.  It was a test day.  Maybe the
final.  A guy asked me if I had studied.  I marvelled at how it could
be that he didn't know it was my first time in the class.</p>

<p>Fred arrived and went to the front.  I don't know at what point he
saw me, but when he did, he was surprised and happy.</p></li>

<li><p>I went to The Monroe Institute in Virginia in 199-something to
learn how to do astral projection.  I don't know that I did that, but
I definitely experienced a lot of cool things there, one of which was
meeting Joe McMoneagle.  He said, after I told him that I wanted to
take a long road trip around the US, "just start to plan it."</p></li>

<li><p>In 1985 or 1986 my parents took Fred and I to Australia, and
it was really fun.  It's one of the first entries in my online
journal, and realistically is the first journal entry I ever wrote,
at my mom's request.</p>

<p>I'm really glad she encouraged me to write it.</p></li>

<li><p>I've gone to SLAA meetings in Houston and wavered at times,
wondering if it is a problem for me or not.  I wonder if it's like "am
I dreaming?"  If I really wonder if I'm dreaming, I can be assured
that I am dreaming. </p></li>

<li><p>I have shaved my head.   More than once.</p></li>

<li><p>I have given away my car.</p></li>

<li><p>I have abandoned a cat named Spencer in a far away
neighborhood.</p></li>

<li><p>I have entrusted my cat named Spot to my friend Jennifer in a
different far away neighborhood.</p></li>

<li><p>I have bummed around through $10,000 in savings while "trying
to start my website design company" though I had no idea what I was
doing.  My work ethic seems to not last long enough to start a
company.  But I did meet Dude through that experience, and that made
it all worth it.</p></li>

<li><p>I have crept around my own house and van looking for clues to figure
out who I am.  This was an idea in a book that might be called,
<em>Shaving the inside of your skull</em>.  That was back in the days
I was still driving Mr Van.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been a DJ at KTRU.  I was <em>*so* *nervous*</em> when
I applied.  But I got the job and it was *great*.</p></li>

<li><p>I have sung songs on commercial radio station KRBE during Sam
Malone's morning show.  For these I received free tickets to the IMAX
and free tickets to <b>U2</b>.</p></li>

<li><p>I have called radio stations and been on the air so much that
I'm not nervous about talking to DJs on the air.  The idea of being on
TV still makes me nervous though.</p></li>

<li><p>I used to be super afraid of roller coasters, and now I love
them.  I used that transition to help myself get over my fear of
learning to drive.</p></li>

<li><p>Bryn asked me if I'd like to join her in London and Paris.  I
jumped at the chance and otherwise made little or no preparations for
the trip.  I didn't buy a guide book for London or Paris; I didn't
buy a map; I didn't buy the plane tickets.  I paid for mine, but
didn't make the purchase.  (I think I paid for mine.)</p>

<p>During our adventure, I tagged along with Bryn who had done all
the arranging for everything.  She pretty much got mad at me for not
having done any pre planning.  I accepted what she said and told her
that I was pretty much happy doing anything, and I had suspected I
would want to go the same places she would want to go to.</p></li>

<li><p>Kathryn invited me to go to Costa Rica with her.  I didn't do
any of the planning, and I was a bit hesitant to convert all my
travelers checks into cash.  It was my first trip abroad as an adult.
She kinda got mad at me for not being prepared, and I took the brunt
of what she said and felt really bad about it.  We haven't really
talked since then, although we have forgiven one another via
email.</p></li>

<li><p>I invited janette to come to Japan.  I made all the travel
arrangements during our adventure in Japan, including airline,
shinkansen, and hotel reservations in two different cities.  I knew
what cool things to see in neighboring cities.</p>

<p>She made none of the plans, and had no idea what city we were
even flying to until we arrived at the board gates.   She had no idea
we were going to ride on the shinkansen until we arrived at the
shinkansen station and had lunch outside.</p>

<p>I don't remember who handled money, but I think it wasn't her.</p>

<p>She loved the trip and so did I.</p></li>

<li><p>I impregnated a woman (let's call her Rochelle) and blew off
her claims that she might be pregnant.  Finally I drove her to the
clinic and spent the day with her and paid for the abortion.  When we
arrived back at her house I said, "I feel like I wasted my whole day,"
because there were other things I had wanted to do.  Later, after she
despised the idea of ever seeing/thinking out/hearing from me again, I
explained to her that what I meant was more like, "that sucked; and I
would have preferred to have done anything but that today."</p>

<p>Never talked to her again.</p></li>

<li><p>I impregnated a woman (let's call her Mary) and didn't blow
off her claims that she might be pregnant.  But I did say I would
support her in getting an abortion if that's what she wanted.  And if
that's not what she wanted, I would support the birth, though that
wasn't what my #1 choice would be.</p>

<p>After she hated me and loathed me and everything else, she
miscarried.  That wasn't my plan, but I guess the baby wasn't God's
plan.  I felt relieved and ultimately she forgave me and apologized
to me.  I haven't been able to talk to her since.</p></li>

<li><p>I decided at one point to combine two things I liked into one
awesome job.  I decided to lead youth group tours around the world.
I called a company that did about 20 different homestay programs to
different countries over a 2 week period each summer.  I thought that
was the thing for me to do.</p>

<p>I called them and they were like, "how much in-country experience
do you have?" and I was like, "I've been to Australia for two
weeks."</p>

<p>So I decided to live in Japan, knowing that many other doors would
open before me, but that I had no idea what they might be.  At this
point I've gone so far down that hallway of doors that I hardly
remember wanting that job.</p></li>

<li><p>I used to skate in downtown Houston.  One night, which I
happen to remember was Thanksgiving Eve, I saw some skaters who
looked more like adults than teen agers, but were acting more like
teenagers than adults.</p>

<p>One guy was on his back, with his hands and skates up in the air.
He was yelling "roach!  Roach!!  roach!" and I was
like, <em>wtf?</em> and skated up to say HI.</p>

<p>It's through that meeting that I found my men's group.  And SLAA 12
step recovery.  And Kim Sawyer.</p></li>

<li><p>I saw an ad for a job that had crazy hours (4am to 4pm) for a
week.  I called them and got the job; working for the film crew for
Good Morning America during the Republican Convention in Houston
around early-mid 1990's.  That was fun.  And only once did I have to
work until 4pm; the other days I got off around 1pm.</p></li>

<li><p>I cried as soon as janette went out of my view at DFW on 26
March 2003.  That's the day I left for Japan.  I arrived maybe 20
hours and 2 calendar days later.  I haven't been back to the US since
that time.</p></li>

<li><p>janette and I went to Hawaii in February 2003.  She did most of
the planning for the trip, but she was never upset at me for that.  We
had a great time and I swam near some great waterfalls.  On the
airplane, during the flight back, I doubted myself for not having
tried to swim underneath the falls.  I had to trust that I had made
the right decision at the time I was there.  But I'd like to go back
and try again.</p>

<p>I wondered about ways to live in Hawaii.  At the same time I felt
bad for the natives on the island and didn't want to be just another
mainlander coming to the island.</p></li>

<li><p>At my men's group weekend training, I was blessed to have my
dad there as a leader.  On that weekend, I realized that I was
physically as big as he is.  It came as a surprise to me.</p>

<p>"Wow.  My hands are as big as yours!"</p></li>

<li><p>I watched my dad work in the basement of our house in
Columbia, Missouri.  He built a chair for me on the workbench so I
could watch him and he could keep an eye on me.  I learned a lot of
stuff from my dad about making things.  I'm really thankful to him
for his help.</p></li>

<li><p>During my early years through my teenage years, I lost a lot of
my dad's tools (wrenches, screw drivers, etc etc).  He complained, but
he never got unnecessarily angry at me.</p></li>

<li><p>I rode my bike behind my dad around the big block on which we
lived.  I followed his every motion.  If he served, I swerved.  I
explained in my own way that he was #1 and whatever he did, I thought
I should do.</p>

<p>He explained gently that he wasn't perfect, and that my plan
wasn't necessarily optimal.</p>

<p>That came as a bit of a shock to me.  <em>My dad's
not <b>perfect?</b></em></p></li>

<li><p>Before that time, I imagine, he used to carry me on his
shoulders when we walked around the block. One day he told me that he
couldn't do it anymore, or that this (that) was the last time.  That
also came as a bit of a shock, but I think I handled it
gracefully.</p></li>

<li><p>I used to hate Fred for copying me.</p>

<p>Mom tried to explain that imitation is the highest form of
flattery, but I wasn't having it.</p></li>

<li><p>Dave Osborne and I used to hang out together in the hallway
during lunch and make up stories and BS about stuff and whatever, and
try to tell people things about the candy machine so that we could
make money or something.  I don't remember what all, and that hardly
even makes sense, but we used to spend every lunch hour there.  That
was in 8th grade, the year we met.</p></li>

<li><p>When he gave me his phone number, which ended in 1414, I
thought he was lying; who could possibly have a phone number that
cool?</p></li>

</ol>

<p>More probably not to come.</p>
