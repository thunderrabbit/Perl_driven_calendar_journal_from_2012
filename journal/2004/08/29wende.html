<p>I wrote two emails to Wende tonight:</p>

<p>One: (subject "A Wedding")</p>

HI Bear

I received your wedding invitation a few days ago.

I chose not to read it until today. (I had to take a couple of days
to get used to the idea.)

I really like the invitation. It's a remarkable balance between
traditional and cool.

I am really happy that Peter is cool enough to have such invitations.

I hope the festivities of your day are filled with joy and sunshine.

    With Love
    - Rob

<p>Two: (subject "me too")</p>

I hope to get married too, someday.  I'm just not ready yet.

Thank you for understanding.

     With Love
