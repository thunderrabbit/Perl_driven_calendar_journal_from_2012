<p>Big fun at Hitomi's friend Ikue's house.  After a lovely meal with
her five year old son Katsuki bounding about the living room with
Olympics on TV, I joined him for games of hammer throwing (*) (in the
hallway (from the dining room to his room)) and then baseball (**) in
the upstairs bedroom (trampling the beds (futons on the floor) in the
process).</p>

<p>Rules were Calvinball style and it was great fun.</p>

<p>(*) using rolled then crushed sheets of paper for hammers</p>

<p>(**) using a crumpled hammer as the ball and a paper fan as the bat</p>

<p>Tons of Japanese.  Five year old style.</p>

<p>Now it's time for a shower and hot bath and then bedtime.</p>

<p>Funny.  I was fishing for a plastic squid, crab, octopus, and two
fish with a plastic fishing rod and hook in the bathtub while Hitomi
was washing her hair.  Katsuki came in to say Hitomi's cell phone
rang.  I offered him the octopus, but he wasn't hungry.  Hitomi asked
him if it was okay that he came in, and he was like, yeah.</p>

<p>haha exactly two hours.  Yammer yammer yammer with Hitomi and Ikue
at the kitchen table after a small cup of ice cream each.  They are
great friends since high school and are すごいペラペラ日本語 (sugoi
pera pera nihongo) (really good at Japanese).  I could sorta kinda 70%
understand their topics of conversation, and understood like 20% of
their chatter.</p>

<p>Fun fun fun.</p>
