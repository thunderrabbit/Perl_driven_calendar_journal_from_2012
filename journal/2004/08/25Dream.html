<p class=dream>I was friends with Hannibal Lecter, who I couldn't
actually distinguish from Anthony Hopkins, and we were in a maze like
set of rooms.  He was planning on killing someone and I wasn't in on
it, but I knew it would happen, and I didn't know that it wouldn't be
me, but I presumed it wouldn't.  Meara Sullivan came to the window
randomly and she was like, "HI," not recognizing him, but recognizing
me, but not letting on that we knew each other, and I could tell that
Hannibal was sizing her up for dinner, and then I was like, "Meara, do
you know Hannibal?  He's my friend."  and patted him on the head.
Hannibal, with his wide eyes focused on me was like, "blahblablah"
basically that I had spoiled his chance at dinner, and I was like,
"fuck; I'm not sure if you're not going to dine on me." but he
softened a bit and didn't kill me.</p>

<p>Good thing, too, cause I wouldn't have been able to have the next
dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Andrew and I walked around to the back and saw some
people coming up from a hiking trip.  Moms and daughters in some kind
of scout troop thing.  There was a scary voodoo woman in a trailer
that we didn't want to go visit, and we didn't want to get too close
to warn them and she called to the women, "hey come into my trailer"
and several of them were like, "waa" and scampered away cause the
woman seemed weird and desperate, but then some of them walked through
her trailer just out of random choice or curiosity and when she went
back to her trailer, she ushered them back inside and quickly put a
spell on each of them that made them shut their mouth and close their
eyes and some of them spilled out the back of the trailer and she
caught some of them in her spell and then </p>

<p class=dream>BUhLAMMMMM</p>

<p class=dream>and the trailer just flat exploded (or the movie cut to
an explosion, it was hard to tell from the plot) and Andrew and I were
like fuck and hurried away as quickly as possible.  We didn't say
anything back at the gymnasium type area that we had been in and where
everyone was gathered, but I decided to challenge myself to see if I
could climb up this pole and make it along the cable all the way
around the room back to this point, just using my arms and not my feet
to climb, and keeping in time with the music on the radio.  It was
really hard, especially considering the poles were not stable, so I
had to account for that imbalance and keep myself balanced at the top
even though I was making them top heavy.  I had this sense that I
could do anything and I used that ability to succeed even though I
didn't know if I could have other wise.  There was a contest announced
by Marvin the DJ when I was nearly halfway around that was basically
the same thing that I had already started, so other people began to
consider climbing the poles, and a woman (I think Laura (ouch I forgot
her last name.  tall Laura from YRUU)) wanted to climb the pole I was
on now, and said something to Steve to see if she should try and ask
me to get off or wait or what, and I just didn't worry about her and
zoomed up the pole and rolled it along to the next pole and then slid
the pole back over to where she was, calling her attention to be ready
and get to climb her chosen pole.</p>

<p class=dream>I was almost all the way back around when I saw a
message on the whitebaord asking if anyone had seen two peole (one
with large eyes) who were last seen on the camping trip.  I was like,
[gulp] and realized I needed to tell someone what I had seen.</p>

<p class=dream>I don't remember who I was telling, cross between Steve
and Johnny, and before I could formulate the sentence I was woken
up.</p>
