<p>Hitomi and I are going to see <b>I, Robot</b> tonight.  I hope it's
cool and gives me stuff to think about.</p>

<p>Make that <b>King Arthur</b>.  I hope it's cool and gives me stuff
to think about. (pppbb yeah right.)</p>

<p>Okay; it wasn't completely without intellectual requirements; I
didn't understand all of Arthur's decisions.. like why he ordered the
just-released people back into the dungeon at the bishop's house.
And why Merlin wanted to help him.  And how Merlin's archers were so
precise in their arching.</p>

<p>I liked the scariness of them trying to cross the frozen river, and
I liked the underwater filming in those scenes, but I don't understand
why stuff would be falling from the ice.  How would heavier than water
globs be trapped under the ice, ready to sink when the ice was
shaken?</p>

<p>Good movie; I liked Guinevere.</p>
