<p>Blah.</p>

<p>Blech.</p>

<p>Barf.</p>

<p>I don't want to study.</p>

<p>I have cracked my book open 3 times.</p>

<p>No energy for studying.</p>

<p>Don't know why.</p>

<p>Can think of several things that will help my studies; things I
should do first.  But... it's all just a charade; I don't want to
study.</p>

<p>And I'm such a proponent of studying when I talk to my students.
I get mad at students who don't study.</p>
