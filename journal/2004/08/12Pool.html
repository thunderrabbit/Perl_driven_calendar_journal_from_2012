<p class=note>(written 2 days after pool day)</p>

<p>So we met after I had been to OM to get a bit of computer training.
A lot of it went over my head, but I have the basics.  Interesting to
see how vague and non-demanding some personalities can be.</p>

<p>I arrived at the pool station at 1pm, got some foodage and chowed
and slept, using the beachball as a pillow.  Oh- this was interesting:
I tried to inflate the ball without actively blowing in the nozzle
thing.  Just by pinching the nozzle open and pulling the ball into a
spherical shape, I was able to get it about 1/3 full.  It was trickier
than I thought; I seemed to just reach a limit at that point.</p>

<p>I resorted to the old school technique of applying lung powered air
pressure and inflated it to pillow calibre pressure.</p>

<p>Hitomi arrived and we had big fun at the pool.  Just floated
around the river-ring sometimes with her on the ball, and sometimes
me on the ball with her on my back or whatever funny combinations
came up, including her driving me as a floating car around the pool.
We were so giggly and silly fun!  Several times we toppled, and each
of those times I just pinched my nose or expelled air in a
water-intake-blocking fashion and sank to the bottom with my eyes
closed.  Next time I go with her, I won't wear my glasses.</p>

<p>We stayed for 2 hours, each hour of which should have cost 300 yen
for each of us.  In the locker room, there are lockers that cost 100
yen to lock.  The 100 yen is returned when the locker is unlocked;
they are just for security, not for profit.  The fact that the 100 yen
is returned is not clearly labeled (that I could read), and I found
three 100 yen coins abandoned in the coin return slot of various
lockers.  No way to track this money nor return it to its owner, so my
second hour was free for me.</p>

<p>(Or was it a reimbursement on the first hour, for which I had
already paid?)</p>
