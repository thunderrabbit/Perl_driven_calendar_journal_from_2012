<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Akiko is an awesome student for me.  I'm not sexually attracted to
her, she is proactive, and she knows Motosumiyoshi area really well
and invited me to ask any questions about the area.</p>

<p>In the long run, the second two are the most important awesome
things.</p>

<p>Oh, and her English is generally high level.  She gets caught up at
times, but pretty good overall, and she likes to write the harder
sentences instead of having me write them.</p>

<p>Dude, a heavily bearded guy sat down on the seat across from me and
I think he kinda freaked out the woman who was going to sit down.  She
chose to sit down, but I think it gave her a start.</p>

<p>I'm on a quest to get my ¤²¤ó¤­ I Japanese book hole punched so I
can intersperse notebook paper with the pages of the book in a big
binder-like thing.  That's the technique Junko used, and I think it
will help me get my next kick-start on studying.</p>
