HI Jeff

I have two questions:

1) Do you know of a PDA with collapsable keyboard that supports unix?
I write in my online journal daily, (*) and I'm planning to go on a
pretty long trip next year. I prefer to write my journal entries using
the text editor emacs, which runs well on unix.  I can just use my
PalmOS PDA and add html by hand though, so this is not a high priority
question.   BUT, it sets me up for my next question.

2) Do you know of a GPS system by which I can be tracked and have my
location published online?  This is the opposite question of "how do I
keep my spouse from knowing where I am?"  but I think it would be cool
for my readers to know the answer to "where's Rob???"  Ah - he's in the
middle of China!!   My vision is to have an image of a world map with a
little red line on it like in the movies.  The line would change really
slowly (!) in realtime.

3) oops another question: if this kind of GPS map system doesn't yet
exist, do you know anyone who could write it?  A clickable world map
with my little red line on it would be fantastic.

(*) I'm proud to say my journal (http://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl) 
has been around since before blogging was cool.

(!) The change would be slow because I plan to ride my bike across
China and Europe. (I'm living in Tokyo now)

        Thanks in advance for your thoughts!
        - Rob
