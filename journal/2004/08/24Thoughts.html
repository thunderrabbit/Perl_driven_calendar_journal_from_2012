<p>I must reflect on my feelings last night when I thought about the
possibility of going to <em>Hitomi's friend's house</em>, a place that
could be filled with dread and impeccable manners and customs and
rules, and, apparently <b>a five year old</b>..  I was nervous.  All
the way up to actually meeting Ikue.  But Hitomi was really reassuring
and was like, "it's all good" and I relaxed.</p>

<p>So this brings me to believe that possibly, I keep myself from
doing lots of things that would be fun, out of fear of the unknown.
This begs my mind to wonder about drinking (but not smoking) and what
that whole thing is like.</p>

<p>But slightly less than that, spending money to go do things and go
places even though "I'm tired" and "I have to go to work
tomorrow,".. some of these events could really be mind blowingly
wowwowowow.</p>

<p>I want to get my bike soon; that will hopefully get me off my booty
and outside in the sun (except for darn ol' winter)... I kinda sorta
want to <em>do</em> more things, and I want to <em>meet</em> more
people.  Why am I loathe to meet people?  Meeting people and doing
things gives me more stories and adventures to relay, more experiences
to have experienced and more connections etc etc etc.</p>

<p>I'm afraid; why am I afraid?  (etc)</p>
