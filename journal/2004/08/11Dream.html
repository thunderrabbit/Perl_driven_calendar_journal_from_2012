<p class=dream>Sean Murray was working in a testing department at
NASA.  He showed me an experiment that he was working on: a type of
metal that when heated, produced more apparent heat by focusing the
heat in one area.  He tossed the material into the trash bin when he
was finished and asked if I could help him count a bunch of money
(checks that had been sent to NASA).  I was like "yeah" but I had to
go.</p>

<p class=dream>I was back in Decker Prairie area, but it had been many
years, so that the entire layout of the city was unrecognizable.  My
bicycle was falling apart bit by bit so I turned to the first business
that I could find and busted in there all "Hey can you fix this for
me?" and it turned out the owner was from a different native culture
but spoke Japanese and he fired some fireworks into the air to get the
answer, which was "no."</p>

<p class=dream>(He changed genders and) she sat me down, explaining that I had
come into the shop uncouthfully and suggested that I be more tactful
in my dealings with other people.</p>

<p class=dream>It turned into a counseling session of sort, or therapy
for me by telling her about my day, which apparently was really bad,
for I started crying just thinking about it.  Knowing I was near a
Japanese culture, I stuffed my emotion and stopped crying, and tried
to tell the story, but something else was happening with people moving
around so I got sidetracked.</p>
