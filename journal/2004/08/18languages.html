<p>On my way home from making mini core samples, I saw an interesting
English T-shirt, then suddenly noticed the woman wearing it was
speaking Spanish.  I only recognized "por la" in the middle of some
sentence that could have been about stock market prices or the latest
broadway musical or her son's pet rabbit.</p>

<p>I only mention this because a moment ago, here in Roppongi Hills,
after telling Hitomi in my wack Japanese about my day, a few people
walked by and I recognized they were *not* speaking Japanese.  I
immediately decided they were speaking Chinese, but that could easily
be incorrect.  Even were it correct, I don't know what dialect.  But
it flat was not Japanese.</p>

<p>I enjoy knowing different languages.  To that end, I should study a
bit.</p>
