<p>Um, hung out with Hitomi last night and did a bit of tweaking on my
match.com ads on google. Talked to Jesse yesterday about this
technique for making $$ online; I'm really a neophyte; I have no idea
what is the best way or if it's an untenable goal or what.  Wow, such
big vocabulary for me.</p>

<p>I told him the line, "fail as fast as you can," which implies we
will gain wisdom as we learn from each failure.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>Um.  oh there's some fucked up mail loop happening between gmail
and my email server.  I'm not sure who is at "fault" but I haven't yet
been able to get it solved.  'sall good though.</p>

<p>I want to write a bit more about my pool day with Hitomi.</p>
