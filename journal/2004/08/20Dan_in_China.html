Hello everybody!
How are you all?
For anyone who doesn't know I've left Japan and I'm
starting a little tour of SE Asia. Starting in China,
then Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia and finishing in
Thailand. One last stop in Tokyo (love it) then back
to England where I hope my Mum and Dad will be meeting
me with Cheese and Pickle sandwiches! I'm traveling
with a great friend I met in Japan, Rex.
Well I'm in China now. The home of Chairman Mao,
shouting people and dirty Internet cafes that have
faded keyboards. (and windows 98!!).The ferry over
here was quite fun, the china sea can get very rough
and after 2 days on the boat we did hit a few patchy
waters. *BUT* I wasn't sick! I had a top bunk and
mostly slept like a log, until the second morning when
I was woken by men throwing up in the toilet- oh man
the sound, it was echoing around our deck.
Shanghai is an interesting place, very dirty and
cheap. We stayed at a nice hotel last night but I
think we'll have to go a bit cheaper now. We managed
to see lots of the place yesterday so I think we are
heading off to Beijing on an all night train. We
didn't plan to go that far north but we figured it'll
be worth it. It has a lot to do and we'll be able to
see the Great Wall.
Well I'll best be off, this email has taken me 40 mins
as I'm guessing where the letters are on the keyboard!
Hope everyone is happy, I'm aware China are doing well
at the Olympics... the TV stations are state
controlled. We'll get 'em on track and field.
Keep it real people,
Peace
Dan
