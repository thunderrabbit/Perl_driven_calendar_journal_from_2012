<p>I forgot to mention one thing about last night: Jen repeatedly
prompted me to do my "great monkey noise," my imitation howler monkey.
I was really embarassed and shy to think about doing it, but "c'mon;
it's Dan's last night," pushed me over the edge. That plus the concern
that I might regret not having had the experience of screaming like a
howler monkey in an izakiah in Tokyo.</p>
