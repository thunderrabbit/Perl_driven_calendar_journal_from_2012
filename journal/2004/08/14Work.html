<p>First lesson was no lesson; I had nothing booked and forgot to look
last night and close that shit up.  Second lesson = first student was
a let down.  That's a pun because we were talking about word pairs
that end with down.  I had to slow down my speaking speed so he could
understand.  I won't look down on him, but man.  Speed up.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>Jesse, my friend, after being told he is now an Instructor Quality
Leader, has to tell me all the things the management is upset about
my techniques of teaching and stuff.  That sucks.</p>

<p>Just now he had to tell me I'm sending out too many postcards,
which wastes lots of stamps and (and I can understand this one:) might
come across as too forward or too irritating if I send too many.</p>

<p>SO, I have come to a solution.</p>

<p>Fuck sending postcards.</p>
