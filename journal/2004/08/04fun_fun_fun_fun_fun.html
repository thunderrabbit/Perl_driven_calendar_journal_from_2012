<p>The pool was great fun today!  Just as we arrived at the ticket
gate, Dan called Jen, so he joined us after our first hour in the
pool.</p>

<p>During the first hour, we hung out in the ring river pool.  I
clapped underwater for Jen, and we tested to see how far around the
pool the clapping could be heard.  Then Jen and I raced each other
against the current, and she won, so I'm tempted to think she had an
advantage, but it's difficult to be sure.  (We raced at different
times, with quite inaccurate time measuring technique: go upstream
while the timer floats one lap around the pool.)</p>

<p>Shoko mostly just floated around the pool.</p>

<p>We hopped out to grab some expensive food up on the roof of the
building as Dan was arriving.  The rotting food/garbage smell was
quite gross by the trashcans on the roof; sucks for the person asked
to clean that.  Yeek.</p>

<p>Shoko conked out on the benches on the roof while Dan, Jen and I
played around talking and eating corn dogs (the call them "American
Dogs") and ice cream.</p>

<p>We left her there (she had only gotten an hour of sleep the night
before, so we figured any sleep would be better than swimming) when we
went back down to swim, and she joined us after we had done a couple
laps.</p>

<p>Dan was anxious to get a beach ball, and was even willing to borrow
an apparently unused ball that could have been anyones... I wasn't
willing to bat it around with them.</p>

<p>I wanted to play games like see who can hold breath underwater the
longest, and who could withstand the torrent goooshing out of the
vents to make the river ring run.</p>

<p>ummm. I'm too tired to finish this entry at this rate.</p>

<p>Shoko was a bit cold and I hugged her once and enjoyed her hands on
my shoulders while she floated behind me.  I wanted to piggyback her,
but that didn't happen.</p>

<p>Jen asked me later if I would shag Shoko, and I was like, "no,
because she smokes."</p>

<p>Dan and Jen stayed in the pool while I walked Shoko out and then
sought a beach ball, which I found close to the pool (after walking
far from the pool in search mode).  I bought a super cool ball with
Winnie the Pooh and Piglet drawn on the outside and little styrofoam
balls on the inside that react wonderfully to static!  It was surreal
to see the styrofoam balls so <em>dry</em> inside the ball as we
bounced it around.</p>

<p>In one game, we nearly got <em>fifty</em> hits before Dan missed it
after 49.  We still acted really pleased with big high fives and
stuff.  Jen was a bit nervous at our reaction (considering the
simplicity of the game (take turns swatting the ball as it floated on
the water) and considering Dan, being awesomely hilarious,
intentionally missed the ball after 49 hits) but went along as best
she could.</p>

<p>Dan and I met back at his house and he shaved my head.</p>

<p>That was a bit of a trick cause his shaver only runs on the
rechargeable batteries, and they were flat.  Plugged it in, waited
five minutes, shaved 1 minute.  Plug, wait, shave.</p>

<p>I was late to see Hitomi, so it wasn't exactly fun to wait, and
our phones kept cutting out when I was trying to tell her how to get
from the station to Dan's apartment.</p>

<p>Shaved my head with a razor for good measure (or no measure) and
high fives and out.</p>
