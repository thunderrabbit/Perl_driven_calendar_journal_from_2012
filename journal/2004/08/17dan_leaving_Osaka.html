<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Dan just called me.</p>

<p>"Mate.  I'm on a ship.  I've just left Osaka and I'm headed out to
sea.  It's mad."</p>

<p>And by mad he means it's just amazing to think about.  The ship he
is on is not actually angry about anything at all.</p>

<p>I couldn't talk to him very long because I'm at work and the wind
noise was really loud so I couldn't hear him very well.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to call you to say Hello and say Goodbye and to
thank you for being such a good friend in Japan."</p>

<p>I feel really honored to be Dan's friend.</p>
