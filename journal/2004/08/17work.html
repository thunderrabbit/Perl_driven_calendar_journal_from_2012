<p>Was just informed by Ezra that I got a really poor lesson
evaluation from a student last Friday.  She used a word that he said
was very strong and translated it to "worst."  I looked in my records
and see that I judged her to have very little initiation, which is
difficult for me to work with in a student who is in book 7.  (our
highest level book in the series)</p>

<p>I'm not allowed to teach her anymore, which is good and sad.</p>

<p>I wonder if all the bonus points (money) I've accumulated over this
month will be withdrawn.  That would be quite a small savings for Gaba
and quite a huge personal blow to me.</p>
