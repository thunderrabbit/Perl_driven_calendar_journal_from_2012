<p>Ahh; I forgot!</p>

<p>Tonight I stopped by the kebab guy on Bremendori (dori=street)
which is the main street that crosses my train line at my train
station.  I stopped partially out of compassion; he's there every
night, and seems to have only a few customers.  I was also a bit
hungry, so I figured I could afford 500 yen to give his kebabs a
shot.</p>

<p>Randomly, Tom arrived behind me; he was riding by on his bicycle
and offered to give me a ride home on the back.</p>

<p>It was scary and fun, like flying home in a rickety old airplane
that could barely stay off the ground (and off the edge of the
streets).  We were lucky at the two streets we had to cross; no
traffic came to put an end to our antics.</p>

<p>I realized my stomach muscles were completely taut, trying to keep
my body balanced so we wouldn't crash and die.</p>

<p>"Oh Rob, don't you trust me?"</p>

<p>"Oh Tom, of course I trust you; I just want to stay firm behind
you here."</p>

<p>Sometimes we talk like we're old lovers.</p>

<p>We arrived at our street, where I dismounted cause the
kerthumpyhump to get up onto our street would have been a bit much for
his low-air-pressure tires and our shakey disposition.</p>

<p>Michael, who also works at Gaba, was just at the same point after
walking from the station; he had taken an earlier train.  For no
particular reason other than Michael's apparent tendency for making
wild claims that usually(?) have little to do with reality, I
announced that Tom had given me a ride home from Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>Beautiful Kuli walked in while we were outside talking (Michael
lives in the next building).  She is tall and looks like a swimmer.
Incredible.</p>
