<p>The only thing I don't like about gmail is that it's web based, so
I can't do email right now on the train.  But everything else is
awesome.</p>

<p>Actually I did send them some feedback: I think clicking the orange
message bar that appears after I do something should mean undo. This
should work for everything that isn't sending email nor permanently
deleting email.</p>
