<p>Well, I have to give Tokyo weather props for being cool (*), but I
have to give it a growl for getting cold.</p>

<p>This morning, at 5am, through my window I heard a
huge <em>rush</em> of an oncoming wall of rain.  I'm not sure how to
spell such a sound, but it was like,
"rrrrrrRRRRRRR<em>RRRRR<b>RRRRRRRRAR</b></em>" as it ran toward my
open window.  It would have been cool to see, but it was dark, and we
were sleeping, so Hitomi jumped up to close the window.</p>

<p>[ssshuup] (sound of window closing)</p>

<p>[RAR] (sound of rain pelting heavily)</p>

<p>"Wow."  (that was a close call)</p>

<p>(*) cool in the "wow that was cool!" way, not in the "hey it's
getting cold" way.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But now it's *cold*!!  Argh! I was loving loving loving the 35 C
degree weather!</p>
