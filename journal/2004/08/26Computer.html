<p>Talked to Paul today about taking over his computer job.  Looked
at his code and the other code and got a sense of the network that
they have.  He's working on rewriting code to print in a completely
different format, but I don't know if I'll be able to take that over
or not.  I'll talk to OM about it.</p>
