<p>Briefly, cause I want to go to bed:</p>

<p>Today was the day my Saturday schedule for some reason had a huge
gap in it so I closed the lessons (yesterday) and invited Hitomi to
meet me and go to Nakameguro to scope the bikes at the bike place.</p>

<p>She did so, and I really appreciate her time.</p>

<p>We hung out in Denny's for a bit after that and didn't study, but
I read the bike catalogues at what I might want to buy.</p>

<p>Went back to Jiyugaoka and tried to find internet access at
McDonald's where they advertise they have free broadband wireless
access, but either (1) it requires a password and the staff member
didn't know the password, or (2) the password-requiring signal was not
McDonald's and the McDonald's signal was elsewhere, non-existant, etc
and the staff member didn't know.  Hitomi tried to find out but it was
not to happen.</p>

<p>Found the bike shop and when I was like, "I want to ride from here
to France," they laughed.  I was like, <em>fuck off</em> and nearly
walked straight back out, which I would have done had Hitomi not been
there, but I knew she wouldn't walk out like that and I didn't think
I could quickly explain how that laughter meant they had no idea it
is possible and much less any idea what bike could do it and much
less do they have such a bike.</p>

<p>But it was more than that.  That laugh pissed me off because it
mirrors my own fears that I won't be able to do it, or that I'll just
give up on this idea.  Yet another *Big Idea* left to rot.</p>

<p>Not yet not yet; I'm still on this one.</p>

<p>Today is *also* the day Shoko asked me to take some pics of her to
send to a guy she has the hots for.  Or something.  The pics were
fully clothed, polite, etc.</p>

<p>Today is *also* the day I got Wende's wedding announcement.
Throat lump.  Nearly cried to see her name next to some other guy's
name.  That could have been me.  I gave that up to be here.</p>

<p>Now I *have* to ride across China and Europe.  To make it worth
breaking up with Wende.</p>
