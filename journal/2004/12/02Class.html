<p>Woke up just in time for Chinese/English exchange.  This will be
the last time we meet until 13 January 2005.</p>

<p>I'm on my way now to meet Daniel in Daikanyama at a cafe near a
gallery where he will be in a show in January!!  I'm really happy for
him to have so synchronistically got that hookup hooked up.</p>
