<p>Interesting that I call Motosumiyoshi home and only upon second
thought think about Texas (Dallas, then Houston) and stuff.</p>

<p>Daniel took about one million pictures while we were on the ropeway
and hanging cable car.  He filled his 1Gig memory card in the process.
So he switched to his other 1Gig card.  We arrived too late to take
the boat over the lake, so we headed back by bus to Odawara station.
Slept in the back a lot of the way.  Daniel had never taken the
shinkansen before, so we are on that now to go back. Awesome.</p>

<p>This is the shinkansen ride during which, upon looking for the
toilet, I found one locked, then found the next one (, a urinal only
(with a window looking in on it (to see the empty urinal or some guy's
back))) available.  On the way back to my seat, I figured out how to
open the other door.  It hadn't been locked; there are [OPEN] and
[CLOSE] buttons that had blended in with the wall so I didn't see them
before.  I pushed [OPEN] for fun, and there was a woman inside.  Damn.
I pushed [CLOSE], but it wouldn't close as fast as I wanted it to (and
I'm sure it took much longer than <em>she</em> wanted it to.)
Nightmare.  I guess she hadn't locked it from the inside.  The lock
must have blended in.</p>

<p>The shinkansen is faster that the Tokaido line.</p>

<p>Way faster.</p>
