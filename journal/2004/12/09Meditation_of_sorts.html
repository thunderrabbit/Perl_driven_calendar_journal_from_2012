<p>Nothing seemed interesting during my attempt at meditation.  I sat
in my chair, slumped in my chair, leaned back in my chair, used
janette's blanket to prop up my head in my chair, balanced in the
chair, stared at the blinking light on the heater, tried to discern
the temperature LED on the heater, lay on my bed, slept, woke up, used
my alarm's snooze at five minute intervals to keep me alert, stared at
the ceiling, stared at my eyelids, and wondered if I should buy the
CDs from Monroe Institute or not.  This was over a period of 1.75
hours.</p>

<p>Awright.</p>

<p>I wonder how much the amount of sugar I've consumed today affected
my experience.</p>
