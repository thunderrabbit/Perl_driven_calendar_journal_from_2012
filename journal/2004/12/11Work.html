<p>Got a call from Hitomi while I was at work; she had just gotten
packed up and was leaving.  I went out on the balcony to take the
phone call (but I missed it) and I saw her crossing the street.  I
quietly yelled her name but she didn't hear me.  She had turned the
corner by the time she called me back and I told her I saw her 1
minute previously, but she didn't backtrack her steps as I
expected.</p>

<p>Jen helped me take quintarks, which was nice, and we balanced up at
the end.  I showed her Dave Barry's "How to Make a Board" essay, and
it was generally nice to have her back in town.</p>
