<p>Been jammin' to Eminem's _Encore_ on my new CD player that I bought
to check out the Gateway CDs.  It's interesting to detach myself even
more fully from the society in which I'm walking.  It's not like I'm
ever really connected, given that I really can't understand anyone
around me.  The headphones just clinch the deal: I'm not listening to
you.  Or you.</p>

<p>Maybe.  Right now the headphones are on my head, but the music is
off.  Weird.</p>
