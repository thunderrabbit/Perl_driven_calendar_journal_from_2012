<p>Not awesome.  Well, the invitation was awesome, but the reality
just wasn't good for me.  Katrina seems to enjoy being specifically
annoying.  She stood in the street as a truck was trying to go by.
The truck driver honked at her and she continued to stand there,
looking blankly at the angry driver.</p>

<p>In the karaoke place, while we were waiting, she stood in the
middle of the already-small-enough area for people to walk, as people
were trying to walk and having to politely squeeze by her.</p>

<p>I was like, "why are you so mean?"</p>

<p>She goes, "why are you so passive?"</p>

<p>I didn't have a good answer that couldn't easily be answered back
in the same copycat manner, so I said nothing.</p>

<p>Not much later, Katrina goes, "Rob looks like he wants to hit
someone; but he won't; he would never hit anyone; he just
internalizes it.  I find it very interesting."</p>

<p>I said, "I'm glad you're so interested."</p>

<p>I checked inside, and yep, she was right.  I wanted to punch her
fucking lights out, and yes, I was internalizing it.  Time to go.</p>

<p>I gave Jen a hug and said, "this is not working for me," and
left.</p>

<p>Watched Discovery Channel's program on The Valley of Kings in
Egypt.  The girls arrived home just as it was ending.  As I left the
room, I noticed there is beer or something spilled on the table in the
TV room, soaking the newspaper.  I am pretty sure it wasn't there when
I came in.  I wonder who spilled, and I wonder who will clean it up.</p>

<p>I wonder why I am so passive.</p>

<p>Jen texted me to see if I was okay, and when she got home, she told
me she didn't notice what was happening between Katrina and I as it
was happening.</p>
