<p>Caesar (sp) from Spain and Erik (sp) from Norway have just arrived
in Millenium House in the past 24 - 48 hours.  They seem to be rooming
together.  This morning Marta (born in Argentina, but considers
herself) from Spain and her boyfriend(?) Hikaru were over to see
Caesar and Erik.  Marta and Caesar were chattering at light speed in
Spanish and English for a while.  Caesar was like, "oh, can everyone
here understand Spanish?" and switched to English.  Erik told us about
his 9 hour stay in customs getting boxes of stuff sent over.
Sunglasses, hats, keychains.. all kinds of cheapy crap that one could
buy (and in this case, sell) at a sporting event.</p>

<p>Their high-end genkiness eclipsed even Jen.  (but would have
matched Carla.)</p>

<p>They vanished off to get coffee, after repacking but leaving the
boxes in the common room.</p>
