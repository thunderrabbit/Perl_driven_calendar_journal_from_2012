<p>Watched some Pride fighting on TV.  I don't really see what people
see in it.  Combination wrestling, boxing, kickboxing, etc -
depending on the sport the different fighters are from.  Dean and his
girlfriend Shoko like it.</p>

<p>When they left, Noriko and I watched the end of Charlie's Angels 2,
and then some other random crap until she found Lenny Kravitz at some
Tokyo rock festival recorded in the summer.  I can't be bothered to
stay up for New Years.  It's not the same without loved ones.</p>
