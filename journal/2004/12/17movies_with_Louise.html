<p>At Louise' house to watch a movie: "Maverick"</p>

<p class=date>12:44am</p>

<p>Maverick was cute, but not.... Outstanding incredible.  Funny
ending, though.</p>

<p>Watching _Matrix Revolutions_ now.  Louise has never seen it.</p>

<p class=date>2:52am</p>

<p>Nice.  After the movie, Louise was all, "I'm really confused.
I'll have to see the second one again."</p>

<p>"It won't help," I assured her.</p>
