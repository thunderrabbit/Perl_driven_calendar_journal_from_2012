<p class=dream>Jackie and others at the house were on health food
kicks, and we all seemed to live in one big room.  Jackie had a home
hair salon trick of having a woman put her head in the oven briefly to
both singe and dry her hair. She encouraged me to make a compress out
of a super sharp crystal by grinding up corn, in which this chemical
was present, and adding tea leaves (which looked like dried seaweed
flakes) and something else for flavoring.  I was pressing corn with a
fork near the sink and she was adding things to it as they came to her
mind.  We were starting our own little cottage industry, and I
thought, hey, what mineral is this chemical?  We'll just grow it in
water and not have to buy it at the store! Lower our costs by a
longshot.  And then my alarm went off.</p>
