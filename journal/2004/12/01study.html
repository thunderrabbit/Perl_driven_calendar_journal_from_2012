<p>Studied with Hitomi last night at Saizeria.  It's definitely less
expensive than Jonathon's.  I wrote a page about Hakone with Daniel,
first really detailed with high level grammar, and then really broad
with easier grammar.  We rode Mimibike there and back.  On the way
back, Hitomi went over the pedestrian bridge over the tracks before I
did.  I was really surprised to not find her waiting for me at the
bottom. She had run run run way ahead in some random burst of
energy.  I was like, "holy shit!" and sped after her.  She turned a
corner before I did, and when I arrived she had her leg and thumb out
like, "hey baby, ya gotta ride for me?"  It was funny.  I was really
happy to see her doing some random stuff.</p>
