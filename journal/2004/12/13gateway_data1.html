<p class=date>1:26am</p>

<p>I fell asleep a couple of different times, definitely near the
end.  I noticed near the beginning I didn't really seem able to hear
the secondary oscillations.  Also, my right heel felt pain, due to a
rather large callous and my feet being pointing right up.  I tilted
my right knee out to get the pressure off my right heel.  During the
vocalization part of the exercise, I heard high pitched squeaking in
the right ear, even though I turned the noise cancelation off in my
headphones (due to them causing a noticeable hiss with noise
cancelation on).</p>
