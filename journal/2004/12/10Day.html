<p>Um.. yesterday = Japanese lesson, sleep, work (got Makiko's address
so I can send her postcards from Osaka and Hokkaido), and met Hitomi
in Yokohama to hang out in Hinodecho before I had to go to work the
next morning.</p>

<p>Funniest was me in the shower and her bailing out piping hot water
from the bathtub onto my feet with a basin thing.</p>
