<p>It's just an overall depressed feeling that I seem to be feeling
tonight; today I wanted to cover it by sexing Satoko or Hitomi or
going out with Richard et. al. or listening to Eminem in my headphones
at full volume.</p>

<p>I relented and let Hitomi come over tonight even though I knew I
really needed to cry and sleep.  While waiting for her, I was in the
living room hanging out with peeps down there and wanting that to
continue forever, but I couldn't go while waiting for Hitomi, so I
felt really conflicted; I had told her yes, and therefore had to tell
them no, but it was a bit worse feeling cause I thought they were
just going to somewhere in Motosumiyoshi (but it turns out they went
to somewhere far away, where I couldn't have gone anyway (and
realistically worked tomorrow)) and I had just missed the chance by a
couple of minutes because by the time I realized what was happening
in my head, <em>hey, actually, I *do* want to go with them</em>, they
had already gone.</p>

<p>Caesar wanted to go with them, too, and he doesn't have to work
tomorrow, so I'm sure that stungified too, when he found out that
they had forgotten to wait for him.</p>

<p>God it's just such petty shit; what is underneath all this?  Do I
just reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly miss home?</p>

<p>I typed all those l's individually. One l-key press per l.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I was really proud of myself for kicking Satoko out before I
started kissing her, and then bang I let Hitomi come over.  What an
idiot I seem to be.</p>
