<p>Nice one.  Temperature is at 17 C now.  I stayed awake during the
entire exercise, and I felt my hands a bit vibrational when I
visualized them extending to my heater.  They felt warm during Focus
12 again, so I thought of the idea of moving them toward slash into
the heater.</p>

<p>I didn't feel them move but a twitch, really.</p>

<p>My brain was wide wide awake and my body was as close to sleeping
as it's ever been when my brain was so awake.  My breathing was sleep
breathing as far as I know, and for brief moments, I dreamt.</p>
