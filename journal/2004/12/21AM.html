<p>Last night I went to bed, but didn't fall asleep for like 10
minutes (usually it takes me about 1 or 2 or 3 minutes to be asleep)
so I figured I wasn't too tired to listen to a Gateway exercise, but
I chose not to write a datapoint for it.  The result: I was wide
awake for the whole thing. Irritatingly wide awake. Okay, except for
part of it, but mostly bang awake.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I ate 100 grams of chocolate given to me by Jen
for lending her Bourne Identity an hour or so before I tried to
sleep.</p>

<p>I've woken up with an incredibly stiff left shoulder and neck.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Hitomi and I are going to Osaka for two days.  Today I'm
going to do laundry and clean my room.</p>
