<p>Basically fell asleep for the end of that one.  I seem more able
to zip between Focus 1 and Focus 10, though.</p>

<p>During the middle of the exercise, I felt an uncomfortable angst in
my legs; they wanted to *move*, like they were full of energy that had
to be released.  It's the same feeling that my mom called "growing
pains," and which I associate with having exercised a lot during the
day.</p>

<p>I think next time I'll move to the next CD, or maybe do Discover 4
again (Recharge and Release, I think).</p>
