<p>Went to Immigrant Cafe, a club near Omote Sando.  Interesting to
find myself in an area I had been before, but had come from a
different direction (walking from Shibuya station instead of from
Omote Sando station).</p>

<p>We got lost on the way there, so Katrina called her friend
Christian (who was performing at the club (and who we were coming to
see)) who said he would stand out on the corner to find us.  As we
backtracked to the corner, we found we were at the club (it's right on
the corner), and we saw him a bit farther up.  Katrina was like, "hey
Christian! [thanks for waiting]" and I was like,
"it's <em>over <b>here</b></em>!  come this way!" as if we had found
it and he was lost.  Jen gave me more credit for that one than I
expected, but her appreciation was certainly appreciated.</p>

<p>The club was quiet and a bit quirky, but not funky.  Erik from
Norway and India was there for a few minutes and told us about 10
times that though he was leaving, it wasn't because of the cost or the
company.  We got charged for his having sat with us anyway, but oh
well.</p>

<p>When I tilted my foot from toes down to heel down, my foot slipped
on the dust-cover covering the loveseat on which I was sitting,
causing me to kick the table, displacing Katrina's beer mostly onto
the floor and a little on my sock.  The talk tattooed dark curly
haired waiter was there at the time, so he got a mop and they got
Katrina a new beer.  Nice.</p>

<p>After we chowed a drank a bit there, and Katrina got to talk to
Christian, we headed out for a club in Roppongi.</p>

<p>Got past the 50 shops with 500 guys out front inviting us in slash
hanging out with those who were inviting us in, and got to Hobgoblin,
a club where Katrina knew a woman who was having/hosting/attending a
magazine release party.  (She had said, "oh, there's a launch
tonight," and I was like, "a [rocket] launch [that I don't know
about]???"  Um, no, a magazine launch.)  Once we arrived, I knew I'd
rather be nearly anywhere else; the smoke / noise / chitchat was going
to drive me insane.  Especially the smoke.  I was like, "Jen, I hate
this place; as soon as you're ready to go, I'm ready."  My sinuses
were getting ready to kick into gear when the girls were like, "you
should leave," seeing how miserable my nose was.</p>

<p>I left, headed home, bought a sugary cream filled chocolate
croissant thing.  And a liter of orange juice (, for less than half
the price of the small-ish glass I had gotten at the club).</p>
