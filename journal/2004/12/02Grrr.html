<p>Someone wrote that if one writes about one's actual life, the
story will be primarily a list of failings.</p>

<p>Today, after explaining to Daniel that trying to fight the
heartless beauracracy of Japan would result in nothing except a hatred
for the beauracracy of Japan, I hit the beauracracy of Japan, but only
for 190 yen worth of shit.</p>

<p>I went into the Yamanote line at Shibuya, dropped Daniel off at
Shinagawa, and came back to Shibuya.  My card, not having exited the
system in Shinagawa, was not happy to come back to Shibuya.  The guy
was like, "where did you go?" and I was like, "I didn't leave the
system."  "Yeah, but it took you 50 minutes; where did you go?"</p>

<p>I should have told him Narita, but he wouldn't have got that I was
trying to stab him in the eye with my hatred of having been caught.  I
should have said Ebisu, to save 30 yen.  But I told the truth.
Shinagawa.  I went to fucking Shinagawa but I didn't exit the
system.</p>

<p>Okay, granted, I got the benefit of going to Shinagawa.  The
system did its duty, and I got my money's worth.</p>

<p>But I wanted to have beaten the system.  I wanted to have had a
free ride.  I took out 4000 yen and said, "dozo," and he took one of
the thousands and gave me change.</p>

<p>Then I was like, "I want my fucking money back for the suica
card. I fucking hate Japan."</p>

<p>He didn't understand.  I kept my card, with zero yen credit on
it.  I hate Japan</p>

<p>'s beauracracies.</p>

<p class=date>4:25pm</p>

<p>Soon thereafter, it happened again.</p>

<p>I had plenty of time, so I went to Shibuya (make that Jiyugaoka)
to Gaba to turn in my 

to show them my passport to prove that Gaba has sponsored my visa.
They were like, "oh, we can't copy it; you'll have to go tothe
convenience store to copy it."  What a piece of shit.  They tried to
put it through the fax machine to copy it, but that wasn't
working. </p>

<p>Fuckin' hell; I mean, comon.  Gaba sponsored my visa.  We do I
need to show them that I'm allowed to work in Japan?  Fuck I gotta
stop typing about it before I kill sombebody.</p>

<p>So, stupidly, cause i was mad, I bought a train ticket *back* to
Shibuya to go hang out and I threw Daniel's Hong Kong 2 dollar coin
in the machine.  It killed the machine, and they were not able to get
the coin out for about 20 minutes.  They said they'll have to
get it out later and call me.  Good deal.  Little 2 dollar moneky
wrench in the Japanese system.  Hardly effective to do anything good,
but at least I was *noticed*.  Is that what it's all about?  I want
to be noticed?</p>
