<p class=date>12:36am JST Tuesday 7 December 2004</p>

<p>This morning I slept a lot.  Meditated some (until I fell asleep),
wrote a letter to Chez, mailed it, bought some groceries, cooked,
ate, read Bill Bryson's book on the universe, shaved, went to work,
read</p>

<p class=date>3:38am</p>

<p>from the Journal of Near Death Experiences, set up a study time
with Hitomi, and soon thereafter got an offer from Louise to watch a
DVD at her place after work.</p>

<p>"D'oh!" thought the part of me that would like to think I still
have a chance with her.</p>

<p>Finished work, rode Mimibike to Saizeria, met Hitomi, studied a
bit, rode home with Hitomi, wrote the first paragraph of this entry,
read a few chapters of Bill Bryson's book, took a shower and wrote the
rest of this entry.</p>
