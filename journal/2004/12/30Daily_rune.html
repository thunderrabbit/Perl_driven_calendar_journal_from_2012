<p>This is my rune for today:  Gebo, partnership.  Do not fall into a
relationship.  Remember to let the winds of Heaven dance between you.</p>

<p>Despite the rune's guidance above, I called Louise to see if I
should come over, and before I recognized what I was doing, it was too
late to hang up; her phone rang; caller ID had been sent; I couldn't
take back the phone call.</p>

<p>Ah, I didn't think to say "oh I'm sorry I called the wrong
person..."</p>

<p>The phonecall went,.. poorly, I judge, and I wasn't in my power,
but dancing around desperation.</p>

<p>Hung up; meditated a bit; went home by way of the grocery where I
bought some foodage for the next couple days.</p>
