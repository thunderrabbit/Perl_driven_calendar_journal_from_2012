<p>The issue is Louise's party.  Shall I go?</p>

<p>I chose Jera, which applies to any endeavour to which I am
committed.  I should remember, however, that no quick results can be
expected.</p>

<p>Jera has no reverse, so can't be easily asked to answer a yes/no
question, so I asked again, "is it in my best.."</p>

<p>"Is it in the best interest for everyone involved for me to go to
the party?"</p>

<p>I chose Othila-reversed.  Consider not only what will benefit you,
but what will benefit others.  remember: we do without doing and
everything gets done.</p>

<p>Don't go.</p>
