<p>Alternately miserable and fine during the night.  My head pounded
for a few moments when I stood up, but had relaxed by the time I got
back from the restroom.  I have no plans today but to clean my room as
feels appropriate.  I found my runes, and decided to do a reading.
"The issue is my health," and pulled one out, then three others.</p>
