<p>I fell asleep near the end of the exercise, but woke slash became
conscious at the beginning of the next one.  I chose to continue
listening slash sleeping.</p>

<p>Near the end of one of the exercises, Monroe's voice woke me, maybe
saying something about "float" and I found myself in a dream situation
able to fly, but I wasn't like superman all fast, but just floating,
and then I felt myself slowly reconnecting with my body.  Nice: my
first conscious OBE since about 10 years ago.  I couldn't tell if I
was going out or coming into my body at first, but then I felt myself
well grounded and in and a little bit vibrational.  But the
vibrations, again, were different than 10 years ago.  These were much
more subtle.</p>

<p>I slept and dreamt after the exercises.</p>

<p class=dream>In a school type situation, where I was new to the
area, but it turns out it was a prison.  I was in a wrong area with
some others, out in the rocky vallied terrain where some trains would
occassionally rush.  The people who had been in the prison longer were
more comfortable with the trains, not nervous about being squashed or
seen like I was.</p>

<p>I hypothosize now that maybe they didn't mind dying; the prison may
have been boring; they could use the train to get out permanently.</p>

<p class=dream>I was on top of a train with a woman, kinda holding
her, and I said, "things are about to change around here; I came with
some really good people who will make a difference," she seemed happy
to hear that, and, possibly, believed me.</p>

<p class=dream>The trains drove into a building with small French
doors for the trains to go through.  The trains were small, so we had
to duck to get into the building, where there were lots of ladders and
things to climb, and a general store (closed) and post office window
(also closed).  We were there at night and on of my new friends was
standing right on the track as I was climbing up a ladder, and I could
see a train was coming.  I told my friend, but they didn't move, so I
was like, "so get off the track!" and they moved, but not like, [oh
man, thanks for telling me] but just moved as the train came.  This
train was smaller than the freight train that had come through; it was
no wider than the track.  The train saw my friend standing there, and
with a growly face put its arms out and tried to stop itself from
going out of the room, bracing against the doorframe, but its momentum
was too great, and my friend was like, "bah" and kicked at the train's
arms and it flew on through the door.  Apparently being seen by a
train (of that size/shape/character) wasn't important.  I wondered why
they weren't concerned about the train reporting the sighting; maybe
it would forget as soon as it left the area.</p>
