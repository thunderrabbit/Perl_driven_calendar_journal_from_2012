<p>Last night Cesar from Span asked me what I'd be doing tomorrow.  I
said, without hesitation, "I'm going to be Santa Claus!"</p>

<p>He goes, "you can't just say that; you must prepare a person for
such a thing before you say something like that."</p>

<p>Hahaha.</p>

<p>So today I'm going to be Santa Claus at Jen's kindergarten class
that she got to teach when Dan left, who got the job from Lubo last
year when he was Santa for 1 day and then quit cause it was too far
away.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm bad Santa because I got on the express train I thought, but
this is a local train!  I don't know how that happened!</p>

<p>It appears that either I misread the platform number (1 versus 2 or
3) or the trains were not on time.  Or I misread the time 8:42am, as
opposed to all the other times it could be in a day.</p>

<p>I've been practicing my Eminem Santa rap:</p>

<pre>
Hey little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
and I don't mean rap as in a new case
of child molestation accusates!
Ho Ho Ho!  Merry Christmas!
</pre>

<p>Thanks, Em; I'm stealing your shit.</p>

<p>Woohoo! Santa made it on time!</p>

<p>Santa even has a moment to eat some breakfast!</p>
