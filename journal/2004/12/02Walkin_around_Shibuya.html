<p>I made it back to Shibuya after my 300 yen wasted trip and went to
a electricity museum (or so it was described to me) which turned out
to be a big advertisement for TEPCO, Tokyo Electrical Power Company.
what a blatant attempt to be a museum.  Man, my brain is tired and my
sentences are stupid.</p>

<p>I got a brochure for the thing and then a less professional
brochure for the 7th floor, and it was riddled with typos and
terrible English.  I corrected some of them and wondered about
getting hired for a English coorrection contract, but that didn't
seem to be very forthcoming, so I just rocked out.</p>

<p>Went to Tower Records (sorry, Ben) and bought Eminem's _Encore_ CD
after listening to most of the songs on the display copy.</p>

<p>Man I'm tired.</p>

<p>I'm here at Starbucks in Shibuya until Takako (Tomoko?)'s lesson,
which, in 24 minutes, starts, finishes.</p>

<p>Best worst English ever.</p>
