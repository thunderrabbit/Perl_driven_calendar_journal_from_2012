<p>Awesome.  Just spent nearly three hours studying Japanese.  I
think that is the longest I have concentrated on Japanese for nearly
a single span.  Spent the huge bulk of the time writing in Japanese
the same story I had written in English about running.</p>

<p>At some points, we were both in tears of laughter due to the story
and my poor Japanese writing skills and the funniness of the
moments.</p>

<p>I'm tired now or I would make *this* funnier.</p>

<p>We rode Mimibike home, me peddling and straddling Hitomi's lap.</p>
