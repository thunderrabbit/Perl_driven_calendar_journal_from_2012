<p class=date>5:37am JST Sunday 12 December 2004</p>

<p>On the train home with Ikumi now; we went to Ageha last night and
danced and all that.</p>

<p>I am tired.</p>

<p>Ikumi is awesome.  So genuine and cool (and cute!!).  She assures
me that she is disorganized, though.  Ah well.</p>

<p>She was in Shimokitazawa when I left for Ageha; I decided I didn't
want to wait until midnight when she thought she'd be ready to go.  I
am glad that I chose to take care of myself; if I had waited for her,
I would have been impatient and upset with myself.</p>

<p>I'm really glad I made that decision.</p>

<p>Ikumi called me from Shibuya; she was looking for the bus stop and
I wasn't able to describe it precisely.</p>

<p>Oh!  I met Olivia on the train on the way to Shibuya and she
showed me where the bus stop was for Ageha.  I ended up sitting next
to a woman who was sitting alone in two seats, but with two friends
in front of her and two friends behind her, and she talked to all
four of them a lot during the trip.</p>

<p>I could understand about 50% of their vocabulary, and sorta piece
together a lot of what they were saying (which didn't amount to much
(unless I'm sorely mistaken), but stuff like, "oh, it's cold!" and
"wow Tokyo tower is pretty!" and some other stuff about stuff and
things.</p>

<p>Ikumi had a different experience on the way there (and on the way
to the bus stop; the first 12 (TWELVE) people she tried to ask for
directions to the bus stop were like, "I dunnno, but you should just
come out drinking with us!")</p>

<p>I definitely appreciate her determination.  :-)</p>

<p>At the bus stop (at 1:20am) she got a boarding ticket that said
2:30am.  "Really?" she asked, and the guy was like, "yah, but if
you're lucky, you'll be able to get on the 2:00 bus."</p>

<p>However, since she is really lucky, she got the *last* seat on the
1:30am bus.  "Is anyone riding alone??"</p>

<p>(That's a question that I loved hearing at Astroworld back in
1987.)</p>

<p>A bit of a fiasco when I went outside to meet her; I was like, "いっ
てきていいですか。" to the woman, and she said, "帰ります？" and I was
like, "はい" cause I thought that meant "you wanna come back in?" (but
actually it only means "going back to yer house" so she sent me out
the exit with no proof that I had been there (except the ringing in my
ears).</p>

<p>Yay big hug from Ikumi and fast (excellent Japanese) talkin' on her
part to get me back in.  I had no concern that they would seriously
keep me out for real, but she was a bit concerned at one point.</p>

<p>We got in (just as I realized I actually did have some sort of
proof (a key from one of the lockers inside) (not to mention all the
people who must have seen me inside (I had been the first one in the
big dance area that opened at 12am))) and she got a drink before we
rocked into the big dance room, where it was great for dancing, but
not great for talking.</p>

<p>Ummmmmmmm  she took a break, and we lost each other for a bit, but
then came back and we chowed in the heated outdoor food tent and then
looked into getting tickets for the 5am bus (still an hour away).</p>

<p>Full.</p>

<p>I was too tired to really dance by that time, so we just chilled
on the chairs next to the big dance floor and chatted a bit about
random meetings and web design jobs and stuff.</p>

<p>The time came for the trains to roll and we rolled out,
intentionally this time, and are nearly home now.</p>

<p>Fun fun fun fun night.  Yay!</p>

<p>When I was alone in the big dance room, before the spotlights were
dancing around, I jumped between them, I played air drums on them, I
pounded on the air illuminated by them.</p>
