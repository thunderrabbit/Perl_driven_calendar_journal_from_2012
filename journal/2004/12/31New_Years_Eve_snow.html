<p>During the lesson, little bitty flurries of snow began to snow.
They waned and then waxed when it was time for Ayana to go.  I stayed;
I didn't want to go out in the snow (unless there was a ton of snow),
and it was a good chance for me to study.  I re-wrote a page and wrote
a new page about the day, during which time I took a bunch of pictures
of the surroundings getting progressively snowier.</p>

<p>For all the pictures below, the last four digits of the filenames
are the 24-hour timestamp from when they were taken.</p>

<p>Took a few pictures from the pedestrian bridge between Shibuya station and my Starbucks.</p>

<p>Took some around Shibuya Hachiko area.  Saw some women in
ridiculous high heels and fishnet stockings.  No yamamba.</p>

<p>On the way home, I was in the front of the train and got several
pics.</p>

<p>Ran out of space on my camera upon arrival at Musashikosugi, but
by then the snow had turned to rain and the whole mess turned to
slush on the ground.  If this shit freezes tonight, I imagine we'll
have a messy day tomorrow.</p>
