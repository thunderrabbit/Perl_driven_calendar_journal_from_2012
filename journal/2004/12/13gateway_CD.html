<p>I'm about to get ready for bed and use my new CD walkman and noise
cancellation headphones to listen to my first Gateway CD/tape in about
5 years. (probably longer, but I'm really not sure how long it's
been)</p>

<p>My idea is to listen to the CDs, noting the time of day, and all
the other pertinant variables that I might want to know after however
many odd years of data collection, and then write some amazing
document about my experiences.</p>

<p>One thing that I've considered as an item is which nostrils I can
breathe through easily.  My sinuses seems to be clogged everyday,
sometimes changing with the hour which side is clear.  But very often,
it's exactly one side xor the other.</p>

<p>Okay, tooth brushing time, in case I flat fall asleep.</p>
