<p class=dream>I was supposed to meet Tammy at an airport one night,
but I had no way to get in touch with her.  I just had a generic train
ticket, but had no way of knowing where she woudl be.  I wandered
around a huge terminal five stories spacious and at least as wide as
that height suggested with little patches of people all around the
perimeter at various ticket counters and things.  I wondered about
ways to use my ticket to pedict where Tammy would be or to contact
her in some way, but I could think f nothing, so I was just stuck
with brute force looking for her, not even systematic searching.</p>

<p class=dream>I went outside to the parking lot and looked for her
truck, but I only found stacks of new 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005
pickup trucks and trailers, all shiney and clean, all different sizes
and colors.  Maggie was with me, since she has a sense and a genius
about these things.  We chatted and gossipped a lot, but didn't find
Tammy before I woke up.</p>
