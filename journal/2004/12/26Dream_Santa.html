<p class=dream>I went downstairs to the hottub pool area, got
undressed and went in.  I was surprised to see women in the tub; it
was the men's side I had entered.  I knew I was allowed to be there
naked; always had in the past.  I jumped into the pool and the
lifeguard came up to me on the side of the pool, asking me why I had
jumped in so quickly.  "Well," I confided, looking around to see who
else could hear, "I was getting a bit of an erection, so I jumped into
the hot water to make it shrink."  I explained to her that there are
times that men get erections for no apparent reason.  That had been
one of those times.</p>

<p class=dream>I was talking to the UPS guy who balked at helping me
report a damaged package and got a little silly during package
dilivery; he sat on the floor and layered himself in my laundry, like
throwing a shirt on as a hat and wrapping pants around his shoulders.
He finally produced the documents I had to fill out to report a
damaged package.</p>

<p class=dream>I went to see Santa and I brought him a couple things;
a big plastic candy cane and a ring of lights around a sytrofoam ring
and something else, and I acted like a little kid as I gave them to
him, and he broke character a couple of times, not to mention a woman
dressed as Santa with a moustache had come out earlier and then Santa
with red hair slicked under his white hair came out and we were joking
arond a bit and when it came time for me to tell him what I wanted, I
was afraid I might cry cause I would say I wanted to figure out what
is messed up in my life; and I wanted to understand myself, but before
I got a chance to see what would happen, he was getting a phone call,
and starting his car which was vibrating and showing all kinds of
crazy trajectories and vectors and images of stuff and it turns out he
was Santa, or he had the power of Santa to fly in a Cadillac, and he
was just about to go when my alarm wnent off.</p>
