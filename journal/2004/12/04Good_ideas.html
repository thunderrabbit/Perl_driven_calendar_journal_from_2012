<p>Andrew, who works two booths from me at Gaba, loaned me Bill
Bryson's <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em>, as detailed a
description of the universe as laymen would likely willingly read,
written in laymens' terms.</p>

<p>The book talks of great men and great failures and great
discoveries.  Since I'd like to make such a great contribution to the
world, I've decided to write a little ditty about some of the great
ideas I've had, to encourage more ideas to come.</p>

<p>in order of recall:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A system to keep from wasting things.  I have a stack of
rubberbands here that I don't need.  I'm moving and will throw them
away, or give them to the first person who comes by and says, "hey
man, can I have those rubberbands?"</p>

<p>For economical reasons, items that are more valuable more
frequently would be more worthy of advertising, but wouldn't it be
cool to reduce the advertising price to near zero?  (the internet
does that) If we can reduce to transportation price to zero, then we
have a winner.</p>

<p>Fred recently told me about an email list in Austin (freecycle),
which is exactly my idea, but in a local area.  Dammit!  That was the
key that I didn't think of, by localizing the advertising, the
transportation is effectively reduced to zero.</p>

<p>close.</p>
</li>

<li><p>chatbotchats.com, where, like hotornot.com, things are
observed and rated.  I bought the domain, but it's hosted by a crappy
slow ISP which took forever to set it up properly, and even then they
don't have unix' <em>screen</em> command available.  So I lost
interest in the project.</p>

<p>Oh, it was supposed to allow people to upload funny conversations
they've had with chat-bots, the most famous of which is probably
SmarterChild.  I surmised there will be more chatbots coming from
different companies with different agendas and styles of speech.  It
could be fun to read the hilarious results.</p>

<p>Domain for sale: chatbotchats.com $100.  The idea that goes with
it: $10,000.</p></li>

<li><p>An optical mouse with a trackball on top for
scrolling.</p></li>

<li><p>A way to connect people with different skillsets to people with
projects that need certain skillsets.  monster.com: good job.</p></li>

<li><p>how about a book on world economies?  I might call it _The
value of the dollar and how it got to be that way_</p>

<p>Or _The value of money and how it got to be that way_</p></li>

</ol>

<p>I have recently decided that my big thing should be something that
computers cannot conceivably do in our lifetime.  (*) Or getting
computers to do something that computers cannot conceivably do.  Like
experiencing emotions or astral projection; something decidedly real
but not physical.</p>

<p>(*) not things like realtime translation, realtime movie
generation, nanobiotics, or manual labor.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh - these are the answers I give to what I would do if I had 10
million dollars, and 100 zillion jillion gilligan frillion
kershmillion dollars, respectively:</p>

<ol start="6">
<li><p>Hire a hoard of genealogists to carefully document my family
tree as far back as possible while being pretty darn certain of
accuracy.</p>

<p>With equal accuracy, trace the descendants of all those people
until we get to those who are living today.</p>

<p>Send all of these people a letter explaining how they are related
to me, a $10,000 credit card and directions to the BIGGEST FAMILY
REUNION EVER.</p>

<p>The hope is that lots of people who hate each other will find out
that they are cousins and quit fighting.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Build a house on the moon with an indoor swimming pool.</p>

<p>Dive in and watch the splash 1/6 the speed as on earth.
Awesome.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other interesting thoughts:</p>

<p>I predicted that bills (cashmoney) would be individually tagged
before I read about it online.</p>

<p>More interestingly (to me), I predicted that there would be a
lawsuit involving cameras in rented residences.  The owner will say
s/he has a right to monitor the health of the house, and the resident
will say s/he has a right to privacy.  This lawsuit occurred not quite
like I expected: a car rental company used GPS to determine that the
driver had been speeding.  They charged him and he sued them.  Or
something.  Same idea though: ownership vs privacy.</p>

<p>I have thought for a while that I want to keep expanding my
skillsets.  It started with learning to ride a unicycle.  Then
studying Spanish, ASL, and French (though I didn't get very far with
those).  Now learning Japanese (I'm better with that).</p>

<p>Next?  Dunno.  Maybe study the science of sleep.</p>

<p>No, really.</p>
