<p>I survived work today.  Didn't kill anyone as I predicted I
might.  The first 6 students (including one double lesson) were
between good and great, and the last one is a student who chooses my
lessons more often than I would choose his lessons.</p>

<p>What karma is there?</p>

<p>"Gosh, she is beautiful" Mai told me about a place where I can make
molten glass objects for 3000 yen for a four hour lesson or something
like that.  Sounds pretty cool!  And by cool, I mean *HOT*!  1200
degrees, she said, and I assume that's C.</p>
