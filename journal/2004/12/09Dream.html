<p class=dream>Fred and I were over a streambed, in a small bit of
woods in Japan.  To our left was a field with grass and we were just
in the edge of the trees on some type of wide grating over a creek.
I found a cache of pachinko balls of different sizes down in the mud,
but i couldnt' reach them.  Fred, having smaller and apparently
longer arms was able to reach them.  We worked together; he collected
them and I held them as they came up.  No concern about either of us
hoarding them unfairly.  He came up with some coins as well, and I
thought to myself that I would give him all the coins and split the
pachinko balls with him.  Cause I hadn't seen the coins at all, just
the pachinko balls, so if not for Fred, I woudln't have known they
were there.</p>

<p class=dream>Then he pulled up a super old and good conition coin,
that I thought was printed in 1918, a ten yen coin.  I wanted to keep
*that* coin, but still intended to give him all the rest.  I made a
rule, "I'll get the coins of numismatic value, and give Fred the
rest."  That seemed fair to me, given there were far more coins that
were numismatically less valuable than their face value.</p>

<p class=dream>Some guy came to hang out in the area, so we quit
collecting, and actually decided it was a good time to leave.  Fred
said something about a bus, and I walked out toward the field.  There
was a guy from the previous part of my dream up there, and he said,
"Fred just got on a bus."</p>

<p class=dream>"Really??"  I was astonished (and a bit envious);
there was a bus stop/station underground connected to the creek!
The guy was like, "you have a package [back at the house]," and I was
like, "thank you."</p>

<p class=dream>I go, "I have to *run* back [to catch Fred]," and the
guy understood.  I started to run, but my hoodie was intractably
caught on a nub of a tree branch; I tried to just yank free, but it
was like, [no] and I relaxed, moved back an inch, got free, then
began to run and I woke up.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is a package for me downstairs.</p>
