<p>During out working through the problems, I tried to put words on
thoughts of weird things happening in my head.  I was tired and
couldn't tell if they were nonsensical dream-ish whisps of ideas or
actually something interesting, or just lack of Japanese vocabulary
slash cultural awareness that made things look weird.</p>

<p>hopeful idea that I'll be able to pin down the weirdness and emote
some genius calibre statement.</p>
