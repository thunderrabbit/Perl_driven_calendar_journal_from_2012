<p>I just selected Jera again.</p>

<p>A Rune of beneficial outcomes, <em>Jera</em> applies to any
activity or endeavor to which you are commmitted.  Be aware, however,
that no quick results can be expected.  A span of time is usually
involved; hence the key words "One Year," symbolizing a full cycle
before the reaping, the harvest or deliverance.</p>

<p>You have prepared the ground and planted the seed.  Now you must
cultivate with care.  To those whose labor has a long season, a long
coming to term, <em>Jera</em> offers encouragement of success.  Know
that the outcome is in the keeping of Providence and continue to
persevere.</p>
