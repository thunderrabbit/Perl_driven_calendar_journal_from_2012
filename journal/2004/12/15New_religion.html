<p>Just spent a couple hours downstairs yammering with Erik from
Norway and India, Richard, Jen and Tets, Katrina, and briefly Shoko
and Ruri (sp) who retreated to Shoko's room to practice their music.
Mostly Erik dominated the conversation; he just pours out all these
stories and topic changes like crazy monkeys jumping around the room,
talking about his stories of traveling, politics, prostitutes, corrupt
police, organized crime, flowers, computer viruses, internet
bandwidth, Christians, Muslims, Hugh Hefner, and starting a new
religion around Katrina.</p>

<p>Katrina wouldn't pose for a picture of me worshipping at her
feet.</p>
