Someone hacked a library that allows the use of your gmail account as
a filesystem.

Woah.

That's pretty fly.  I'm not going to install it; i have 7 gigs
available on my computer for less work than it would take me to get a
bit less than 1 meg via googleFS.  Still cool, though.

?  less than 1MB?  I assumed you would get the full 1GB (-overhead).

Oh, I meant gig.

But I can still get more gigs on my machine more easily...
However......  it would be nice to have a backup system that worked.
Currently mine does *not*.

<p>As a big sidenote, the first email from Fred includes an excellent
example of why I try not to use "your" when I'm not referring to the
person to whom I'm directly speaking.  In this case, Fred <em>was</em>
referring to me, but I thought the guy Fred was talking about was able
to use *my* gmail filesystem.</p>

<p>Normally Fred has exquisite grammar, with perfect spelling &amp;
punctuation.  His vocabulary definitely surpasses mine.  (He used the
word "levity" yesterday without an apparent second thought, and I had
to look it up.)  But in this case, I would write "Someone hacked a
library that allows people to use their gmail account as a
filesystem."</p>

<p>and if I was being really picky, "Someone hacked a library that
allows an individual to use his or her own gmail account as a
filesystem."</p>

<p>The only reason it made a difference is that I thought the guy
could hack into random cats' gmail space as his *own* filesystem (,
and then released the code).  Nightmare.</p>
