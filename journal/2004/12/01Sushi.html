<p>Daniel and I went to kaiten sushi after we arrived back in
Motosumiyoshi.  The train was carrying plates around the bar, but the
plates were not carrying sushi.  I was like, "no no,put the plate over
there" so it would be like kaiten sushi, instead of him just handing
me the plate.  He had to tell the guys in the back not to toss the
sushi.  Some crazy foreigner wants his sushi to ride the train.
Funny.</p>
