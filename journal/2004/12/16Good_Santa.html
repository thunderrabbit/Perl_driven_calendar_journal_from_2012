<p>That was the most funnest job Santa has ever had!!</p>

<p>Went in as Rob, strange but fun friend of Jen's; met the principal
and some of the teachers, and hid out in the principal's office while
all of the kids were led from their classrooms into the auditorium.</p>

<p>To the magical photocopier room, where presto-change-o I became
Santa Claus, with a kimono style towel folded and tied to my front to
make a paunch and red felt pants and red felt jacket with real big
white fuzzy buttons and ridiculously fake bear and eyebrows
double-side taped to my face.</p>

<p>To the back of the stage where Jen and I commented about how well
the parents sang and how crazily they acted on the way out, passing
Santa and just going a bit crazy with waving and nearly flipping
their lids to see Santa.  Jen was like, "wha??? it's just some guy in
a suit," and I was like, "don't bring me down, baby; just be genki,
like Santa!"</p>

<p>To the actual back stage I went and when it was my time to come
onstage, I went on and pretended I couldn't find the stage at first,
getting lost at the piano, then focusing on the curtains,
pat-pat-patting them looking for the stage, and then arriving at the
other end of the stage, and then confusedly turning toward the
kids..  "ah!  there you are!" oh what comedic brilliance is not
required to entertain myself entertaining 3, 4 and 5 year olds.</p>

<p>I really had fun giving out presents, and I was taken by how much
time the parents had taken to wrap like 400 gifts of various sizes,
all perfectly counted and perfectly wrapped.  I just sat there as
staff gave me presents to give to the little kids who came up in
lines, one at a time with no more pseaking than arigato or thank
you, <em>except</em> at the very end, some of the girls started to
tell me their names.  Miki and some other.  While they were coming
up, I alternated between babbling rapping and  and commenting on the
kids' behavior and  whether genki or shy; it was a ton of fun!!</p>

<p>I wanted to get pics of the transformation from Rob into fat,
white bearded Santa, but these pics will have to do.</p>

<p>After the show, I trooped through the hallways, waving into all the
classrooms and peering in through some of the windows; really living
up the opportunity to be crazy genki Santa.  I'm Santa!  I can do
anything!</p>

<p>I was blessed with 10,000 yen for all my effortless antics, and
even got a piece of cake and cup of tea as a bonus.  __And__ got a
bit of Christmas Spirit.</p>
