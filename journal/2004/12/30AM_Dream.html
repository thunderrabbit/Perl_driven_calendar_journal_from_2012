<p class=dream>Olivia was dancing around singing, "I'm a taaaxi, I'm a
taaaxi, I'm a taxi taxi taxi!" while playing castanets</p>

<p class=dream>I was wanting to travel somewhere new, like to New
York.  I wanted to do my 11,000 mile drive again; I wondered if
people would let me visit them again, or if I had overstayed my
welcome in all cases.  My dad told me something I didn't want to hear
(*) about how I was living my life.</p>

<p>(*) which I don't remember (cause I didn't want to hear it?)</p>
