Hi Dad!

Just checking in from Japan

1)  In my quest to do something big in/for the world, I have decided
to begin exploring astral/4th dimension / OBE / NDE / fractal
realities etc.  I've been envious when reading about people who
discovered things in new sciences, just because the people were around
when the science was new.   This seems like a new science to me.   I'm
gonna name something a nugen.

I therefore came upon IANDS website and recognized the face of the
journal as something that you have subscribed to.   Cool.

2)  Because of silliness with my paypal.com account, I changed my
credit card mailing address to your house.   MBNA.   I'll keep track
of it online; don't worry about them.

3)  This reminds me that recently you asked me about an IRS payment I
hadn't made.  I said I would paypal you some money, and I never did.
I have money in my paypal account now.  What was the amount, and to
what email address can I send you money?

4)  I forgot number 4.

I'm planning to ride my bicycle from Tokyo to the northern part of the
north island of Japan, to a city called Wakkanai, which is a really
funny name.   It's an even funnier name in Japanese, because
"Wakannai" means "I don't know" and "Wakkanai" is the name given to
that city.

So when I tell people "Jitensha de Tokyo kara Wakkanai ikimasu" they
usually think I mean "I'm going to ride my bicycle from Tokyo to I
don't know."   If the person knows the name of the city, and I
pronounce the word very accurately, then they understand the first
time.  Usually I just name the island (Hokkaido), not the city.

My bicycle is named TJ Bike, where TJ stands for Taihen Jyanai, which
loosely translates to Ain't No Problem, implying there's no mountain I
can't climb.

5)  I remembered 4.   I want to bring a GPS with me on my bicycle
trip.  I ordered a GPS from the least expensive (and most recommended)
supplier I've been able to find in the US.  The prices are well higher
here in Tokyo.   If the guy won't ship to my address in Japan, can I
have him ship the GPS to you, and then have you ship it to me?  I'll
paypal you the money.

6)  I heard from Cordie a few weeks ago and excitedly wrote her back
the next day.  Haven't heard back from her.   I think I am online more
often than she is.

   Hugs and Love and I hope you're well.
