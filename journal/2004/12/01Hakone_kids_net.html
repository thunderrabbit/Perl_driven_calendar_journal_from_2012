<p>Well, I'll tell ya, pilgrim, I  had plenty of tumbles and nary a
scratch while flipping and climbing around in the huge kids net
hammock, but I strained my back getting up from the main attraction
of My Sky Chair.</p>

<p>The net thing is like a manifestation of the best hammock in the
world, with holes to climb through to the next level, but offset to
keep a fall from being tragic.  Daniel and I had the run (and climb
and tumble) of the place for quite a while, getting videos of us
tumbling, and all kinds of silliness.  I ran out of memorycard space
before being able to record while holding the camera and tumbling,
which probably would be pretty entertaining, but it's hard to
tell.</p>

<p>I determined I would be <em>so strong</em> if I lived in/on such a
climbtastic hammock; it was just energizingly fun to tumble around.
There are little bed sized hammocks from which one could not fall at
night; man it would be tooootally great!</p>
