<p class=date>9:08am JST Tuesday 14 December 2004</p>

<p class=dream>I was in China, inline skating in a park, whee at 9am,
other skaters would come and skate somewhere around the city.  I had
been to Oak Forest Automotive to get my bicycle wheel fixed, which
they apparently did, but then when I checked it, I saw that they had
carelessly burned a hole in the rim and through some of the spokes
with a quick blast of a cutting torch.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed this only after I had taken the wheel (it was
a spare that I had in my backpack) and gone skating around.  Once it
came time to ride TJ Bike again (with his two wheels intact), I
noticed the third wheel had the cutting torch burn in it.  So I knew I
had to go back to their shop, but I wasn't sure how I'd be able to
prove the accident happened there.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw a guy on a park bench that was also skating, and
I went over to talk to him, but I woke up before we could talk.</p>
