<p>I lost my shit when Hitomi said my Japanese speaking skills are
shit because I've been speaking so much English in Japan.  I fucking
know and I fucking feel like I've wasted 2 fucking years in this
fucking country I fucking hate; thank you for rubbing it in my
face.</p>

<p>I flipped my plastic chest of drawers over in a nice 360, spraying
shit everywhere.  Somehow, magically, thankfully, my glasses weren't
broken, my CD player wasn't broken, my headphones weren't broken, the
DVD I rented today wasn't broken, and the pushpins didn't come out of
their box even though it was already broken.</p>

<p>その後日本語で話した。よかった。</p>
