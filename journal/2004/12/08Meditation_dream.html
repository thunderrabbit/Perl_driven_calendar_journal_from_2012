<p>I started meditating while sitting upright, and probably lasted 20
minutes before I lay back on my bed and fell asleep.  During my
upright portion, I tried various ways to relax, basically looking for
an upright position that I can just relax all parts of me and stay.  I
tried auralizing (visualizing with the ears, my word may or may not be
a word) Robert Monroe's voice telling each part of my body to relax. I
didn't get very far with that, basically to my ankles (starting from
my toes).  I tried watching the stream in my brain, not focusing on
the thoughts.  I tried simple awareness of my breathing, without
controlling my breaths.</p>

<p>I lay down, with the theory that I could do all this and be
relaxed, and I fell asleep dreamt</p>

<p class=dream>I was with Jimmy in a bathtub; we were just talking,
but to outside observers, it probably appeared that we were having
sex, so we became to be in Mr Van, in the back, with no one steering,
but driving along highways in Houston.  Daniel said something, but I
was like, "I'll steer" and then he was like, "no" and I said, "okay,
you go to the driver's seat, and I'll steer just using my mind," and
when he got there, I was like, "okay, now turn right!" as sortof a
joke, that I had steered using my mind to use my voice to tell him to
steer.</p>

<p class=dream>We ended up in a dead end, but with an opening, into
which we went and found a guard dog.  A mere puppy, actually, sleeping
behind bars that were spaced widely enough for him to walk right
through.  (This dog looked a lot like (Molly and Will's) Scout.)  He
woke up, a bit dazed from sleeping, and came to say HI, and then
remembered he was a guard dog, and thoroughly chomped down on my arm.
He was hanging there, relentlessly biting down, and I swung him back
and forth a bit to test his tenacity.  He stayed, and I tired of the
game, so I squeezed the back of his jaw, forcing him to open his
mouth.  He stopped trying to bite me, and I left, looking back to find
him snuggling down in the suitcase I had left full of my clothes.  I
surmised he was happy to have something warm to sleep in, instead of
on the concrete floor.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up, and began to write down my dream, but I
couldn't tell how long it had been since I had lay down, so I realized
there was something wrong.  Ah, I was still sleeping.</p>

<p>I lay there a bit, recalling my dream, then heard Richard's voice
downstairs, saying "where's Rob?" (I thought), but when I went down,
there was no Richard, and no one said, "Richard was looking for you,"
but I saw Jen's room door open (!)  Jen's back already!</p>

<p>So I went down to her room, and wondered why they were watching
Japanese TV, and then I found it was Roger's room next to Jen's, with
his door opened fully covering her door.</p>
