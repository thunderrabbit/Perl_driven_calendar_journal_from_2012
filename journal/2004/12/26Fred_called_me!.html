<p>Fred called me!  I was in the middle of throngs of animals at the
quintark station, all reading to themselves, paying no attention to
the world around them.  I explained to Fred how quintarks work, and he
was like, "wow."</p>

<p>I'm happy that my phone maintained connection while I was in the
building.  Fred told me about a flag having done the moonwalk so he
froze his face and hands off while riding his bike back from getting
Bill's present.  When we get rich, we're going to make a bicycle that
does the moonwalk.  I thought of that idea, but didn't tell Fred; I'm
sure he'll approve, though.</p>

<p>I'll call him back in a few hours when I get off work.</p>
