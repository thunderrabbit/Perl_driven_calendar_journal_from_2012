<p>Woke up around 10am and basically had to go immediately to my
Japanese lesson in Shibuya.  Got there right at 11am (with pizzaman
for breakfast and hot cocoa for drinkage) and listened to Ogura Kei a
bit on my CD player.</p>

<p>For the entire 1.5 hours, I worked to tell Ayana the story about
going to Universal Studios Japan and Expoland and then me-an-Hitomi's
breakup story.  I was feeling a bit sad after that, but was okay
enough to show Ayana the stuff I had written in Japanese during the 2
weeks.</p>
