<p>I thought it was 500 yen for the first hour and 200 yen per 30
minutes thereafter.  Then I thought it was 500 yen to go in and 200
yen for every 30 minutes in the pool.  But then Hitomi informed me we
had been there for 2.4 hours, not 1.4</p>

<p>Definitely big fun going to the indoor pool with Hitomi.  They have
a water slide (only 1 person at a time, though) and a flowing looped
pool and several heated pools, two different saunas (50 and 60 degrees
C) a mist room, which I had never previously experienced, and other
things that were cool but forgotten.</p>

<p>In the looped pool, I worked hard to successfully sit up on my
floats that I wrapped my legs around.  The trick was to use nothing
but water for leverage, and not let go of the floats with my legs.  I
had the Winnie The Pooh pool ball (that I bought when Jen and Dan and
I went to the outdoor pool at Miyorenji during the summer (thank you,
Shoko for showing us the pool!!)) and pushed it down in the water in
an attempt to push myself up.  I was able to do it while facing up a
couple of times, but not consistently.  It was too difficult for me
to accurate (and forcefully enough) push backwards enough to get the
ball underneath my back..  But I found that I could push the ball
down like an overzealous outrigger and push myself face down, then
easily push the ball down below me (in front of me) and push myself
up that way.  After a few tries I could do that manuever easily.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a trick to get four paddleboards under me so I
could float effortlessly on my back.  I was able to do it, but I
lost control of the Winnie the Pool Ball in the process.</p>

<p>When we arrived in the area with the waterslide, we wanted to do
that first, but there were so few people in the pool area as a whole
that the slide was off (no water gooshing down) so they had to be
summoned to turn it on.  They wouldn't let us go down with the ball,
so I threw it over the ledge to the slide-dumping pool before we went
down.  Hitomi slid first and I had to wait forever before it was
deemed safe for me to go down.  They should have a waiver for big
kids so we have the run of the place.</p>

<p>When I tried to breathe underwater using air expelled from my
trunks as nourishing oxygen, I was yelled at by one of the pool staff.
(Don't put your head underwater.)  Bah; c'mon; just because there's no
one else here doesn't mean you need to pick on me!</p>

<p>When Hitomi and I got into the pool without using the stairs, we
were summarily yelled at; [excuse me; please use the stairs!]  Ah
geez; we'll be fine.  We're not babies. </p>

<p>We relaxed for a while on some massaging jet chair type things;
Hitomi sitting back on me but bouyed by the fluids below. (air and
water; get my mind out of the gutter!)  I enjoyed relaxing in that
space.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed walking on the rocky bottom pool (heated), but not
the chilled rocky bottom pool.  Um.. oh the funniest thing I did was
make ghetto goggles using Winnie the Pool Ball: with most of the air
evacuated, I mashed it against my face to keep water from getting on
my eyes.  But, just as bad or worse, the ball itself wanted to touch
my eyes.  Just before I perfected a technique (or rather came across a
solution) the guy was like, [wah wah wah don't put your head
underwater...] Egad! I got ghetto goggles, G!  Chill out!</p>

<p>The mist room approximated my perfect environment.  Warm and
soaking sopping wet.  It was a bit too wet to comfortably lie face up
on the bench in there, so I partially deflated Winnie the Pool Ball to
cover my face so I could bask in the warm splashiness.</p>
