<p>On occassion, I need to run quickly.  Or, I choose to run quickly.
Earlier today, I chose to run quickly, and somehow I got over my
normal run speed into a superrun speed, that I can't/don't always
slash rarely reach.  It's kindof a fun fast feeling like, <em>wow; I
didn't know I could run this fast!</em></p>

<p>When I go to the quintark exchange area, almost invariably, the
sidewalk is blocked, so without even considering the sidewalk as an
option, I go to the street, between the curb and traffic.  In this
case, even that part of the street was clogged with parked cars and
people, so I went between the first and second lanes, and, because I
had limited time, I ran.</p>

<p>Not as fast as Superman, but definitely as fast as Spiderman
(running, not swinging), I ran between the lanes, with cars on each
side of me going through the light.  I was in superrun mode, and I
realized it would all be wasted energy unless I could pass the car
directly on my left.  So, I challenged myself to <em>pass</em> the car
on my left and cut in front of it...</p>

<p>and I got to an even higher super high burst of speed for several
strides and passed the car.  Yes!!</p>

<p>Triumphant, I veered in front of the car, back toward the curb. At
that moment, my legs decided they were done.</p>

<p>My legs put on the brakes before the message reached my brain:
"Hello, brain.  This is the legs; we're going to stop now."</p>

<p>While my brain was busy reading the delayed message from my legs,
it got an emergency broadcast: "BRAIN, WE ARE FALLING," followed by
the details "specifically, we are falling forward, and rumor has it
that the eyes say we are falling forward over concrete in the middle
of traffic.  Sincerely, the inner ears."</p>

<p>"ps: if we can be of any further assistance, don't hesitate to
ask."</p>

<p>My brain picked up the hotline to my legs.  It used a video chat
mode to get the point across more quickly.  "Legs, have a look at
these photos please.  They are an artist's rendition of the immediate
future."  The photos came through, more like sketches in animated
.gifs with three frames:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>my hands turned to hamburger meat on the street with really
badly bruised wrists</p></li>

<li><p>my nose and teeth bloodied, some loosened, some possibly
knocked out</p></li>

<li><p>rips in my jeans and skinned knees</p></li>
</ol>

<p>"These photos," my brain explained, "are part of just one possible
future.  There are other possible futures that include no blood.  The
choice is up to you."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I noticed I was tipping forward with my legs running
well behind me.  I wondered what was going on <em>and</em> what was
going to happen.</p>

<p>My legs analyzed the photos, then replied to my brain, "as you can
clearly see, <b>we</b> are wearing pants; the skinned knees won't be
all that bad, we don't care."</p>

<p>My brain, with a hint of exasperation, sent one more photo:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>my body, on the street, with breathing facilities disrupted,
and a car driving over it</p></li>
</ul>

<p>with a note written across it, "we're all in the together" with
"this" misspelled because my brain didn't have time to proofread
it.</p>

<p>My legs looked at the last photo, looked at each other, looked back
at the photo, shrugged, and were like, "hokay, we'll catch up."</p>

<p>They each pulled out a small bottle of energy drink and drank it.
Refreshed and with a renewed outlook on life, they gave that extra bit
of effort and caught up with my body.</p>

<p>I found myself back upright, with all my balance regained.  I was
like, <em>shew; that was close, thanks body, for pulling
together,</em> and <em>wow; we ran supafast!</em></p>

<p>My legs were like, "<b>we</b> ran fast; you guys were up there
worrying about stuff.  We had everything under control."</p>

<p>Um, yeah legs; okay.  Well, thanks for running so quickly, then.</p>
