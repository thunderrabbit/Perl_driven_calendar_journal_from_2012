<p>"The issue is my health (headache)"</p>

<p>The first rune that came out is Dagaz (Breakthrough).  Good news,
I think.  I take it to mean I will get through this.</p>

<p>Then Perth (Initiation), Wunjo-reversed (Joy-reversed),
Raido-reversed (Journey-reversed).</p>

<p>I've got something new to do, it ain't gonna be fun, and I gotta
chill here for a while.</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>
