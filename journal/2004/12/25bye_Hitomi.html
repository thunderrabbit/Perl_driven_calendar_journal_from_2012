<p>Hitomi waited for me all day, stewing and chiding herself for her
behavior.  She apologized profusely, but I refused to give her a
second chance to be more than a friend.  I was like, "if we can be
friends and have no problems, then maybe we can do more," and "don't
call me; I'll call you."</p>

<p>I cried as I left her to clean her stuff out.</p>

<p>Chatted with Olivia, Jen, Aiko, Tetsuya while watching a crap Wild
River movie with one of the Bacon brothers killing people and trying
to get down the river.</p>
