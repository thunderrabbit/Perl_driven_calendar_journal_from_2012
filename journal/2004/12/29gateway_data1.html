<p>I stayed for both tracks on the CD.  My heater turned off just as I
was at the Focus 10 point on the first track.  I could smell the gas
fragrance that happens when it turns on or off.  I am certain this was
'real' because the heater had been on for a while, I heard it beeping
its warning that it would turn off soon, and it was off when I
finished.</p>

<p>There were times during the first CD that I was feeling
vibrationally, or slight downward motion.  Most times I was just
relaxed, or at most, lucid dreaming.  At one point I was definitely
like "woah this is it" (sans exclamation point), but even that was too
excited and stopped the experience.  Once I heard my nose snore which
woke my mind up though my mind hadn't been too far gone at that
moment.</p>

<p>A couple of times I was nearly in lucid dreams, but not of flying
calibre.  Just like I was seeing dream images but knowing I was
dreaming.</p>

<p>During the second track, I mostly fell asleep completely</p>
