<p>Wow.</p>

<p>OM had a bit of a party after work on the last working day of the
year: cheese and crackers and champagne and after Jen left, OM
continued to tell me the story of how he got started with quintarks
and then I offered my little story of how I'm looking for what I want
to do when I grow up, and I told him how I'm interested in doing field
research in out-of-body experiences.  I didn't actually say "field
research," but I like the term as applied to this field of study.</p>

<p>He told me he used to study under a swami in India, Swami-G (sp)
"who must be 80 by now and could be dead, but let's look him up
(online) and give them a call."</p>

<p>So we looked them up and found <a
href="http://www.vedanta-edu.org">www.vedanta-edu.org</a>, and OM
called and Swami-G's daughter came on the phone and she remembered Ian
though they haven't spoken in 10 years!  She chatted with me a bit on
the phone and asked me to send her an email describing myself and blah
blah blah and we'll see if I could maybe rock out there to study with
them!</p>

<p>Ooooooooooooo.   Wow.</p>

<p>And I mean that in the non-sarcastic way.</p>

<p>I've always wanted to study under a swami, the way the guy who
wrote Way of the Peaceful Warrior studied under Socrates and the way
Ram Daas studied under some guy who took a huge hit of acid and said,
"it's okay, but nothing compared to meditation."</p>

<p>Now I know a guy who knows a swami.  Who is 80 and still kickin'
it.</p>

Hello!

I spoke with you earlier today; I was too excited to remember what you
asked me to write, but let's see what comes out:

I'm Rob Nugen, from Houston, Texas, where I lived for most of my
growing up and adult life.  In September 1994, I had a traumatic head
injury which left me unconscious for 8 or 12 hours during which time
(my friends told me) the doctor told them I might not survive, might
stay in a coma, might have amnesia, might never walk again.  I left
the hospital after 4 days, with no amnesia, able to walk, and a
distinct feeling that a complete recovery must mean I am destined to
do something else in my life.

After that, my professional psychic friend said that while I was
unconscious, my angels told me what I was supposed to do with my life.
I don't consciously remember that.  When I'm ready, she said, I can
go into meditation and ask them what they said.  Apparently, I haven't
been ready.

After that time I synchronistically met a man who is a professional
palm reader.  He said our palms describe where we are in our lives
now, and our fingerprints tell what we are supposed to do in our
lives.   For everyone at the palm reading party he said things like,
"you're supposed to be a good mother; you're supposed to be a
psychologist; you're supposed to learn how to protect your emotions;
etc," except me.

To me he said, "you're supposed to do something for the world."   When
I heard that, I began to cry; I already knew in my heart it was true.

In 1996 I went to The Monroe Institute
(http://www.monroeinstitute.org) for a week program after I became
interested in out-of-body experiences.  I was anxious for such an
experience, and I told a friend of mine.  She is a woman who watches
my crown chakra while speaking to me.  She seems to see things other
people cannot.  She said, "later, you'll find that out-of-body
experiences are simple and just the beginning.  But for now,
patience."

Sigh.

From 2000 to 2002, I was engaged to be married.  We owned a house in
Houston.  A life existed for me, but I became afraid to commit.  I
broke up with my fiance.  We sold the house.  she moved to California
and has since gotten married.  I drove 11,000 miles around the US.
The trip was long, fun and difficult, but when I finished, I thought,
"I should have ridden my bicycle."

I moved to Tokyo, Japan in March 2003.   I have been in Tokyo since that time.

In March or April 2005, I plan to ride my bicycle from Tokyo 500
kilometers to Hokkaido, the north island of Japan.  I am not committed
to anyone but myself to do this ride, which is why I said I am
completely free after March.

To follow my heart-plan, I should ride my bicycle a long way, but it
doesn't have to be to Hokkaido; I'm not tied to that destination.  I
could ride toward India.

When I hear or come up with "good ideas," I often fall in love with
them very quickly and and want to dive in immediately.  Sometimes I
give up just as quickly.   Sometimes I don't.  If I'm still excited
after I've ridden my bicycle somewhere, I'll come visit you guys.

If you have any questions or anything, let me know.

     Peace
     - Rob
