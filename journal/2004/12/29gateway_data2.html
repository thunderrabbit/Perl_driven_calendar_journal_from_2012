<p>Well.  Interesting.  Given Monroe's speech and reading "don't have
preconceived ideas about what this will be like," I think I noticed
different things that I would possibly have ignored.</p>

<p>When we moved from Focus 10 to Focus 12, my brain felt like it was
bending, like the left hemisphere was stretching out of my head.
Also, my hands and forearms felt really lovely warm.  These feelings
did not completey go away as we went back to Focus 10.  I fell alseep
near the end of the track.</p>
