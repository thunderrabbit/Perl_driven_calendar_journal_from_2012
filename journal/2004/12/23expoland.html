<p>Big fun at Expoland.  It's got one nice 60 second suspended
coaster called Orochi that we rode three or four times.  I got a
video from the front seat.  It's not online yet.</p>

<p>They have a long coaster that pretends to be a racer, but is
actually one single long track that crosses one time; so it's like we
ride both sides of the racer in one turn.</p>

<p>It's called Daidarasaurus, and according to <a
href="http://www.rcdb.com">rcdb</a>, it used to be a racer, but was
converted to one long coaster.</p>

<p>They've got a coaster that's in the running for two prizes</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Most inversions per unit length in a circuit coaster: turn,
chain-lift, turn, loop, turn, double-corkscrew, turn,
station.</p></li>

<li><p>Silliest name: Space Salamander</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Only Space Salamander allowed me to ride while wearing my
glasses.</p>

<p>We rode it 2 or 3 times.</p>

<p>I have the most pictures of it because it's right below the giant
ferris wheel in the park.</p>

must be an original; it had basically no sides, and the weirdest, most
difficult to get into harness thing.  Instead of an over-shoulders
harness, it has two butterfly type things through which we put our
arms, and then fold-down bar behind which we have to stand, and then a
bicycle seat to sit on.  It took me a while to understand what they
were trying to get me to do when I was getting on the ride.</p>

<p>It was dark when we rode it, and I wasn't allowed to wear my
glasses, and it was really cold, so... it wasn't all that great.</p>
