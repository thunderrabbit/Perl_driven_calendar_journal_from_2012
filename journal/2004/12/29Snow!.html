<p>It snowed today in Tokyo!  I flopped around in bed for a long time
not wanting to get up cause it was so cold, but finally nature called
me and was like, "hey man, get up," and I was like, "I wanna shave my
head first," so I shaved my head over the sink and I kept seeing
things falling outside, but I didn't have my glasses on so I didn't
notice it was *snow*!</p>

<p>Shaved, peed, ran outside a bit, but not for long; the snow was
cold!</p>

<p>Super big clumps of tiny flakes, but Jackie said they had been
even bigger earlier in the day.</p>

<p>I took my three new shirts to the cleaners to get the creases out
and have done a couple loads of laundry today, plus made and ate some
Roboyaki.</p>

<p>Mostly just kickin' it inside due to the snow.</p>
