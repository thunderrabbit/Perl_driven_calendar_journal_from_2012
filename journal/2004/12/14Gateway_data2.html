<p>Fell asleep during that, but made it longer.  Just before he
introduced Focus 10, I could have sworn someone knocked on my door.
I woke up (I had been sleeping), and said, "yeah," like <em>I am in
here; what do you want?</em>, but never heard a response.  If someone
didn't knock on my door, wow.</p>

<p>I had a dream about ultimate frisbee, and tried to catch a disc at
one point.  That reminded me that I had a big body spasm during my
previous Focus 10 thing today.</p>
