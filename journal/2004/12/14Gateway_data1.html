<p>Remained awake for most of it, but then found that I had fallen
asleep when he was saying wake up; I don't really remember the last
portion of the exercise.  The construction noise outside made me
wonder if I would be successful or not.</p>

<p>Ah - I just remembered this: About 5 or 8 minutes into the
exercise, I felt/imagined/dreamt that I was moving my arm.  The
sensation didn't have any vibrational quality that I've associated
with OBE, but a sensation was there.  I can possibly write it off as a
dream feeling.  It was very brief.</p>
