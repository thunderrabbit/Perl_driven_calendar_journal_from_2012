<p>Quotes by me:</p>

<pre>It takes longer to live a biography than to read one.</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>It's easier to read a biography than to live one.</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>The choice of college is both arbitrary and will affect the rest
of your life.</pre>

<p>I am reminded of this one specifically and my quotes in general
because I was pondering a generalization of it: "nothing matters, but
everything makes a difference." or "nothing matters, except to change
the entire future."</p>

<p>Because I was standing in the shower thinking about the nature of
reality after reading a usenet comment: "there is no objective
reality; observation always affects the observed," and trying to
rectify that idea and my assertion that the shampoo bottle I was
holding was made of a material (that we call plastic) and had
coloration patterns on it (that we call letters) and the patterns
were not changing.</p>

<p>Even if we argue that they are changing, ever so slowly
deteriorating, is that deterioration caused or affected by me looking
at the bottle?  If yes, why and how?  Religion and Science Wondertwin
Powers, Activate!</p>
