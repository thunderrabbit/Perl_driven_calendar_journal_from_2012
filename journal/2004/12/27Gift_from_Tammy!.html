<p>Cool; I got a something from Tammy!  I've not seen her in years,
but we got in email contact recently and she said she had a little
something to send me.  The customs label says "comic book" for the
contents.  That seem really strange because Tammy knows I don't read
comic books, *and* she always gets me thoughtful gifts.  I wonder
what it could be!</p>

<p>It's a comic book!</p>

<p>Written in Tammy's beautiful script:</p>

Rob, 

   I have something that should make you laugh until your sides hurt.
Meet Lenore!  She's a cute little dead girl with an attitude similar
to my poodle Lorax.  I hope you like the comic.  I thought of you the
first time I read it.  I know people change a lot over the years but I
am hopeful that you still enjoy a bit of unconventional humor!

    Enjoy!

                                          Warm Wishes
                                          Tammy
</pre>
