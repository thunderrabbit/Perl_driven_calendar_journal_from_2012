<p>Saw Daniel off to the Narita Express platform in Shinagawa.  We
didn't really have time to eat, but it's happier overall because
he'll get to the airport in plenty of time to get his bag from one of
the terminals, and to get his flight at one of the terminals.</p>

I drank the most delicious cup of hot cocoa in the world today.  Or,
at least it was apparently the most delicious; it was 600 yen.  Not
even Starbucks is that expensive for one twice as big.  Cripes.

<p>I'm really happy for Daniel's 80% chance of being in the gallery
in January.  He chatted with them again today to help  firm up
details.  Good deal for him, hopefully; he may be able to begin a
blossoming art career around the world.</p>
