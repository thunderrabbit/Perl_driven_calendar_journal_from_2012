<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<ol type=I>
<li><p>Daniel has just left Tokyo after 4 days of hanging out here
during his layover from Hongkong.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still happy about having climbed through the monkey net
thing at the outdoor museum in Hakone.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to turn in a copy of my passport to work.  I don't
understand why.. They are sponsoring my visa, so they should know if
I'm elligible for work.  I guess it's a double check, or a wack
system.</p></li>

<li><p>I was really impressed that Daniel got into an art show, or
started the making of getting into an art show here in Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer battery is still stupid and will die soon, though
it says 83%.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Motosumiyoshi, Tokyo, Japan.  Have been in Japan
since March 2003.  Livin' in Motosumiyoshi since March 2004.  Plan to
leave in March 2005.</p></li>

<li><p>Plan to ride my bicycle (TJ Bike) to Hokkaido, following the
hanami up the island.</p></li>

<li><p>I've realized recently that I need to start doing cool shit in
Tokyo; I've done jack nothin' almost since I started feeling settled
in this obscurely unsettling place.</p></li>

<li><p>I bought my first CD in Japan today:  Eminem's _Encore_.</p></li>

</ol>
