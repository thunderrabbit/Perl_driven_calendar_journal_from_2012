<p class=dream>Hitomi, actually I think it was Wende, reminded me that
we were leaving town before the movie was due, but we would be back
after the movie was due, so I should be careful to remember to turn it
in on time.  I told her I would remember and set out to write a list of
things to do before leaving town.</p>

<p class=dream>I found a sheet of paper I could use; on one side it
had lists of genealogy names beginning with names related to me, and
then names related to them, so the first name on each list was a
family name I had heard of in my family, and the names after that were
names in their families, and though most of the names were unique,
there were some repeats, and some names like, "Coe" that I knew from
other places (high school).</p>

<p class=dream>I had written the names down with Jon Whitten-lege one
day, and now it seemed I didn't need the list, so I was going to use
the other side of the piece of paper to write my list of things to do
before leaving town.</p>

<p class=dream>1: take the movie back
<br>2: feed</p>

<p class=dream>and I was going to write "the cat" when I suddenly
remembered I had forgotten to feed the fish, and I had been continuing
to forget to feed the fish for a long long time, long enough that the
fish, I feared, could be dead.</p>

<p class=dream>We were in our house on Methil, and I was near the
windows facing the back yard.  I ran over to the fireplace area to the
fishtanks, and I found the fish were eating food already.</p>

<p class=dream>flakes of food had recently been put in all three or
four tanks, and the fish (angel fish) were eating happily and
hungrily.  I watched one fish chowing and noticed stacks of bills
(cash) in the fish tank, and little cutouts of an image of Death in
the bottom of the tank.  The stacks of bills were newly minted, and on
the edge of each stack was a image painted such that each bill would
have a different fraction of the painting on its edge.  This was a
security measure and a way to make stacks of bills more beautiful and
numismatically valuable.</p>

<p class=dream>and these stack s of bills were in the fish tank.  All
3 or four fish tanks had them.</p>

<p class=dream>Weird.</p>

<p class=dream>I went over to Ma and I was like, "hey Ma, there are
stacks of bills in the fish tanks.  what's up with that?"</p>

<p class=dream>And she said that since we were living in Japan, they
(Ma and dad) had tried to learn some of the local customs, one of
which was to put stacks of cash in fish tanks.  This helped keep the
water clean, for one thing, and represented wealth in the family.</p>

<p class=dream>The little figure of Death in the bottom of the pool
represented life (fish) living with death, (Death) in a grand cycle,
and the fish not geting freaked out about it is to remind us not to
freak out; death happens, so chill.</p>

<p class=dream>Ma assured us there were many many such customs, and
they had tried to research some.  She told us that Japanese culture
has been around for a long time and it became corrupt when it
encountered South American cultures,</p>

<p class=dream>and I was transported to a scene in South America in
Colombia where some bad guys had taken to paying off the mafia by
taking out mafia payment insurance with other mafias, and it was just
beoming a viscious cycle.  I didn't know who was good nor bad, and
this one guy who I thought was on my team after I had seen him as the
protagonist for this little bit of the movie as he was snooping across
the wooden floor of the traditional Japanese cabin

<p>oops</p>

<p class=date>4:58am</p></p>

<p>I took a long time to think of a better word than "cabin" and now
I'm falling asleep again.</p>

<p>Emiem lyrics going through my head "what if he pictured it as a
female's butt"</p>

<p>okay, back to the dream,</p>

<p class=dream>The good guy walked from right to left across the
screen from a quiet empty room to a more happenin' room and someone
was watching him from the sidelines; either a stalker or a bodyguard,
and then that guy was gone and a different good/bad guy turned out to
be a bad guy with a grudge against me, and I was defensless in this
world and I hoped the other guy would come in at just the right
moment, but the bad guy threw an icepick at me and it hit me in the
side, he snottily pointed out directly in the middle of his target
(me) and I was like "grr" and I woke up.</p>
