<p>I heard everything he said that time.  I dreamt during parts of
it, but my brain basically remained consciously active during the
entire exercise.  I felt vibrations two different times: one was due
to construction outside, an asphalt flattener.  The other seemed to
be my legs vibrating within my otherwise still body.  Just vibration,
not excursion.</p>

<p>I'm going to do the next exercise now.</p>
