<p>Was tempted to set up the gmailFS, which would require installing
other things first, which could require a lot of time, but first set
up the completion code Fred sent me (to allow tab to only complete
directory names when doing a cd command) in my .login file, but first
figure out the name of my .login file for tcsh.</p>

<p>I knew that each of these could lead to enough tangents that I'd
not get to meditation today, and lose the routine after 1 day.</p>
