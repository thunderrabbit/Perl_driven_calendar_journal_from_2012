<p>Louise just called me and said she had to disallow me from bringing
a friend to the party at Louise's house tomorrow.  At first I was
like, "grr" at Louise, but no matter; I understand the position she's
in (it's not her party, per se, it's just at her house).  I
misunderstood the type of party it was when I got the invitation.</p>

<p>I told her that I therefore would not make it a priority to go to
the party.</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven't heard from Satoko about whether she still wants
to meet me (go to the party)..  it would be ironic if she showed up
tomorrow (she has directions) but had to be uninvited.  Ah well.</p>

<p>I talked to Satoko; we are going to meet at Kosugi and then rent a
movie and watch it in my room.  This is a big chance for me to just
be friends friends friends.</p>
