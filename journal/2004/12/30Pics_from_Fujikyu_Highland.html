<p>These pics were taken in Feb 2004 when janette and I went to
Fujikyu Highland.</p>

<p>This is Dodonpa.</p>

<p>This is Mt Fuji visible behind the park.  Dodonpa and the ferris
wheel can be seen.  The big-splash boat ride is in front of Dodonpa.
The three-wing building in the foreground is the old haunted house at
Fujikyu Highland.  Before that, it was apparently a hospital.  This
picture was taken from Double Loop's chain lift.</p>
