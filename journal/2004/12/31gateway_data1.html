<p>I fell asleep through basically both of them.  I had the volume
turned down all the way to the lowest not-off setting.  I think I'll
try it louder from now on.</p>

<p>How is it that the CDs are still going?  It seems like a really
long time for a CD to be on.</p>

<p class=date>8:01pm</p>

<p>The CD just ended.  8:01 - 6:49 = 1:12.   Okay, that's not too
long for a CD.</p>
