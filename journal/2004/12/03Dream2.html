<p class=dream>Watching this dream for the second time, I came into
it like in the middle of a movie I had seen before.  I was at the
point where the kid from A.I. reveals that he has taken the guy's
cigarettes away to help him stop smoking, but the guy is about to die
so the kid is about to give him one when the bad guy drives into the
building with a fuel tanker truck, and drives right by a road sign
that says, "DJ SILVER AVE" so we know he's the bad guy who had been
identified as DJ Silver in the movie, and the building explodes in
slow motion as the kid and the guy try to get out of the way.  They
survive somehow cause it's a movie.</p>
