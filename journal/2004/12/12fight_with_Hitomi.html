<p>We've worked through it, but earlier (8pm-ish), Hitomi and I had a
disagreement of sorts.  Basically seems to be resulting from cultural
differences; she has been encouraged to keep her emotions private, and
I am encouraging her to tell me what's going on inside.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, (and in part, ironically, because I have not been
trained to keep my emotions restrained,) I ripped one of my good
shirts (the blue Lead with a circle making it look like <b>C</b>Lead
shirt from e-Loyalty, given to me by the cute-voiced Kristen while I
worked at FSD) in an embarassing outrage after I thought Hitomi wasn't
listening to my reasoning, but just repeating her previous
statements.</p>

<p>I am sure that in 10 years, the above will be meaningless to me,
so I'll spell it out <em>briefly</em>.</p>

<p>I was tired when I arrived home (despite having slept while at
work and on the train on the way back).</p>

<p>I had told Hitomi I would make plans with her for our trip to
Hokkaido.</p>

<p>Despite my tiredness, I still wanted to honor my plan.</p>

<p>Hitomi, seeing that I was tired, was like, "please sleep."</p>

<p>I was like, "no; I said I would plan with you; let's do it."</p>

<p>We planned, and I was like, thank you and (going too far for my
own sleepy-good) offered to take her to dinner as thanks.  (She had
said she was hungry a couple times during our planning.)</p>

<p>She was like, "please sleep."</p>

<p>I was like, <em>I am offering to take you to dinner, "please sleep"
is not an answer to that.</em></p>

<p>It looked like I was not going to be awake much longer, so I was
brushing my teeth and realized that we were each not taking good care
of ourselves.  I needed to sleep and she needed to eat.</p>

<p>I came back, and was like, "how about I sleep and you go eat?"</p>

<p>When she said, "please sleep," in the same manner as previously, I
lost it.  I ripped off my shirt in my own little Hulk imitation and,
because the cuffs were buttoned, used my foot to pull it free of both
wrists, then, being in a good position to rend it in two (even though
part of my brain was like, <em>hey man, this is a nice shirt; don't
mess it up,</em>) I tried to rip a sleeve entirely off, but just
ended up hurting my left middle finger.</p>

<p>I was like, "you have to get out now; I'm going to kill you; I
hate you," and she was like, [how can I help? what's wrong?] for she
was surprised by my outburst.</p>

<p>I was like, "get out," and she realized *that* is how she could
help, and she was in the process of leaving and I started to cry for
my finger and shirt.  She thought I had started crying because she was
leaving, when actually I had started crying because her leaving gave
me the space I wanted to cry.  So Hitomi came back again, [what's
wrong? how can I help?]</p>

<p>Through gasping sobs I could only say, "you have to get out," cause
I couldn't explain that I was only crying and upset more because she
was here trying to help me when I could only see that as codependency
arg arg arg arg</p>

<p>She left; I cried; I slept; she came back with food; we slept; we
woke up; talked it all out.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>How interesting to note that she had bought a shirt for me today
*before* my outburst.</p>
