<p>I'm not as tired as I've ever been, but I can tell that I shouldn't
let Hitomi stay in my room tonight; I won't be very amicable (if
that's the right word to describe what I won't be) and I just need to
take care of myself.</p>

<p>We met after my work and studied at Saizeria, and then rode
Mimibike to my place.  As I was falling asleep at Saizeria, I was
like, "is it okay if you don't sleep at my house tonight?"  Wow; how
polite can one be?</p>

<p>She was a bit sad I think, but okay overall.  Right *now* is the
critical moment; I'm typing and about to go to sleep; she is waiting
for me to do something, it seems.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>She asked if she could stay and talk for just 10 more minutes.  I
responded very sleepily to everything, and she left after a couple
minutes.</p>

<p>I cried after she left.  Not all of me wanted her to go.</p>
