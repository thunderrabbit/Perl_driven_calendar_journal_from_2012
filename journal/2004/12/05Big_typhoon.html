<p>Japan is boring and only numbers its typhoons instead of names
them.  This is typhoon 29, I think.</p>

<p>There's a big typhoon going on outside; it's really neat because
there's lots (and lots) of wind yet very little rain.  Just a slight
drizzle.  But the *best* thing is how <em>warm</em> it is!  yay warm
weather!</p>

<p>I know it could be the beginning of the end of the world via
climate change, but I love warm weather.</p>

<p>I'm surprised more people aren't awake; the house shakes during the
gusts and it's definitely noisy.  weather.com says it's 19 degrees C,
and will slowly drop to 16 by 6pm (67F - 61F), and reports the wind is
32 mph (but doesn't report the speed of the gusts).</p>

<p>It's warm enough to ride my bike to work!  Except that I don't want
to get that wet (it's only drizzling, but I would be soaked by the
time I got there), especially considering I (also) don't know how to
ride to OM.</p>
