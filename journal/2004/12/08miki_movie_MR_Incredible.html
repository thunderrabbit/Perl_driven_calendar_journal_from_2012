<p>Saw MR Incredible with Miki today.  Before we bought tickets, she
reminded me that I could get 500 yen off the ticket price by going to
a ticket shop near the theater.  That's enough savings to pay for a
snack and drink (if I buy them at the convenience store (which I
did)).  While we walked to the ticket-shop, she held my arm; I was
quite happy for that.</p>

<p>I was also happy to hold her hand during the movie.  It seems that
when I haven't seen Miki in a longer time, she is more affectionate
when I see her.</p>

<p>The movie was good; with some quite funny parts.  Not as funny as
Finding Nemo, and I pretty much didn't like the bouncing lamb story
as a Pixar short before the movie, but it was cute.</p>

<p>After the movie she took me to the game center, where we were able
to turn in our tickets for 30 tokens (10 for my ticket and 20 for her
ticket).  There were some video games available, but we tossed them
all into a token-eating lottery type thing, where the slowly
oscillating pusher stacks coins more than pushes them.  She kept
mock-accusing me of having played this game before since I was "doing
so well," and I was like, [yeah, I come and play for seven hours every
day.] and she goes, [really??]  [No, not really.]  Of course the
machine is rigged for the appearance that one is doing well.  We would
get about 90% of our coins back over time, and as we kept playing,
slowly ran out.  I could *easily* see how people get addicted to those
games.  We didn't buy any more tokens.</p>

<p>But we did buy Okonomiyaki at Kawasaki BE.  I was able to read the
menu much more effectively than when we first went last year, but
still not enough to realistically know what most items were.  Just
enough to find a mix and a drink that I would like.</p>

<p>We talked about her upcoming trip to North Carolina for the
holidays (three weeks is awesomely long for Japanese), but how she
won't be able to take a vacation next year.  Wow.</p>

<p>It became time to go, and I walked her to her bicycle, on the way
to which she showed me a cheap sweets store, where I bought some
candy and chocolate type stuff for 10 to 50 percent less than I've
seen it in convenience stores. Awesome.</p>

<p>I really wanted to kiss her as we parted ways, but a hug had to
suffice.</p>
