<p>I'm just in a crap mood, possibly due to dealing with having no
Hitomi trying to come over and like me.  Katrina and Jen are just
watching movies and drinking all day; I can't stand too much of their
banter at a time.</p>

<p>Satoko cancelled; I cancelled Louise-party; wah wah poor me.</p>

<p>Stupid Japan.  How is it that I've been here for nearly 2 years?
I should just fucking leave tonight.  I'm sick of this place.  I just
need to cry and cry.</p>
