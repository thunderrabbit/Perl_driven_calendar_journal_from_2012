<p class=date>7:51am JST Friday 3 December 2004</p>

<p class=dream>Jen was in a restaurant, eating and doing homework.  I
needed to ask her a question and I went up there to ask.  I was naked,
so I walked behind an ottoman so she wouldn't be flashed.</p>

<p class=dream>A conflict occurred when I got to her table; the woman
was shooing Jen out cause she had been there so long without buying
anything, and they had a long line.  I started barking at the woman
like, "we're living here this month and you want us to just quit
eating in your restaurant; you want to lose two customers just like
that?" and I grabbed the plate of food Jen still had left, and
grabbed one more plate for good measure and followed Jen downstairs.
I figured I could get a free meal with the second plate (like they
wouldn't recognize me).</p>
