<p>The trains are jacked up on Tokyu Toyoko line this morning.  -
they are not runnig on time.  They are running, though; so I guess
they're not "jacked up" so much as "not running on time" or "like
London trains"</p>

<p>I'm tired this morning after having been awake to watch the storm
for a bit.  I got 1 sleep cycle plus a bit of a nap last night.</p>
