<p>Met Hitomi in Yokohama, chowed a bit of expensive ice cream at
AM/PM and asked her if she wanted to hang out with me and watch a
movie and stuff.  She asked me if I had a lesson with Akiko
tonight.</p>

<p>Holy cats, batman!  I forgot about my lesson with Akiko!</p>

<p>I told Hitomi I wanted to give her 1000 yen, which was true and a
good opportunity for me to practice that grammar.</p>

<p>We took the train to Motosumiyoshi, then Mimibike to Saizeria
(Hitomi on the seat with her legs on the top tube or the down tube and
me pedaling and straddling her legs) where I studied for a bit and
then left Hitomi to study during my lesson with Akiko.  I am amazed by
how different Japanese custom is for showing emotion or reaction to a
story.  I was like, "Daniel and I saw models (a ship, airplane and
tank) coated in milk chocolate" and she was like "yes."</p>

<p>Mate, this is not an everyday experience. Say wow.</p>
