<p class=date>11:17pm JST Friday 24 December 2004</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that Hitomi will try to spend the night over
here tonight.  I will actually be surprised if she doesn't show up,
despite my clearly telling her "no; you can't sleep here tonight."</p>

<p>If she tries to sway me, that will be big trouble for our
relationship.</p>

<p class=date>11:29pm</p>

<p>Sleeptime now.</p>

<p class=date>12:28am</p>

<p>I didn't expect that.  She came in, woke me up, turned on the
light, dropped off something, and flew back out.</p>

<p>Aww; she printed the application for Pb for me.</p>

<p class=date>12:30am</p>

<p>oh god.  She came back.</p>

<p class=date>1:00am</p>

<p>I know from experience that we can have miserable conversation for
hours, with me trying to explain why I need my space, and she asking
me why I need my space and wondering if I don't like her or what is
the deal.</p>

<p>So I just almost didn't respond at all.  She asked me if I was
still mad, and I was like, "no; I'm sad."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Cause I told you that you cannot come tonight, but you still came
over."</p>

<p>"Okay, byebye.  But I don't know if I can get the train home."</p>

<p>I didn't respond.  She didn't make it out the door, came back and
flopped down on the bed (partially squashing me).</p>

<p>I realized that being squashed like this for too long would just
destroy my lower back, so I squirmed out from under her and feigned
sleep on the side of the bed.</p>

<p>No sleep, no talking.  In my mind, I worked on forgiveness.  I
forgave her for coming over; I forgave myself for feeling victimized
for letting this relationship happen. She stirred, and then left about
3-5 minutes before I decided to write this down.</p>

<p>There's no way she can take the train back home tonight.  They stop
running around 1am.  She'll have to either take a taxi, call someone
else, freeze her ass off outside, sleep down in the living room, stay
in a hotel, sleep in an unused room in this building, or come back
here.  Wow; that's a lot of options.</p>

<p class=date>1:12am</p>

<p>Okay.  She hasn't come back; it seems she's gone for the night.
I'm going to try and sleep again.</p>

<p class=date>1:21am</p>

<p>In my mind, there appears a desire to go downstairs and see if she
is okay.</p>

<p>I worked through from "the desire is so strong to go talk to
someone, that I can hardly stand it," to the above by forgiving
myself for judging myself as needy.</p>

<p>I wanted to go downstairs, but I stopped myself, imprisoning
myself in my room for fear of not being able to control going
downstairs.</p>

<p>I discerned what was happening there, left my room, checked to see
if she left the building (she didn't / hasn't; her in-house slippers
are not in the cubbyhole), and peed.  Came back, locked my door, wrote
this.</p>

<p>Going to sleep now.  Internal personal growth is happening.</p>

<p class=date>2:05am</p>

<p>She is definitely fired.  She came back, cried profusely at the
foot of my bed as I ran a mantra of "I forgive myself for judging
myself as unable to sleep," through my mind.  I gave her a blanket.
She flopped onto the bed crying and shaking me near violently wanting
to talk.  I couldn't understand what she was saying, but once I asked
her why she came; she violently got up, put covers on me in a
passiveaggressive display of forced-affection, turned on the heater
(which I had set to turn on at 7am) and just left the room.  This is
so bizarre, and so un-sleep-encouraging.</p>

<p class=date>7:42am</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>I didn't get a full night's sleep, but I got a gift, if I c (*)</p>

<p class=date>9:23am</p>

<p>(*) my computer battery died at that point.  My computer battery sucks.</p>

<p>Also at that point, Hitomi demanded to know why I hadn't said
anything to her.</p>

<p>It's cause I was fucking pissed to have been kept up so long, when
I had planned to take care of myself.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>
<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Between 2am and 7:42am, she spent an hour or so on top of me,
reflecting all my worst parts back to me.</p>

<p>I was going to write this here, but for the irony, I'm going to
make a new entry.</p>
