<p class=date>7:42am JST Saturday 25 December 2004</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>I didn't get a full night's sleep, but I got a gift, if I c (*)</p>

<p class=date>9:23am</p>

<p>(*) my computer battery died at that point.  My computer battery
sucks.</p>

<p>Also at that point, Hitomi demanded to know why I hadn't said
anything to her.</p>

<p>It's cause I was fucking pissed to have been kept up so long, when
I had planned to take care of myself.</p>

<p>Between 2am and 7:42am, she spent an hour or so on top of me,
allowing the bright light to pierce my left eye, reflecting all my
worst parts back to me:</p>

<p>((( While at Universal Studios Japan, I shared with Hitomi one of
my skeletons: the base driving force in my life, the rule that guides
every decision: I seek affirmation from women.  I want to be mommy's
good boy.  I want to be loved. )))</p>

<p>"You like many women, don't you?  You'll never change, will you?"</p>

<p>And then with mock affection, caressing my cheeks, "you're a good
boy, aren't you?  いい子　いい子、ね"</p>

<p>"_____ said she knows you have a girlfriend, but she likes you,
right?"</p>

<p>Very interesting that Hitomi could know that.  _____ sent me a
text message; did Hitomi read my messages?  I asked her how she
knew.  She said she guessed it; she's not an idiot.  Do I think she's
an idiot? etc.</p>

<p>That whole mess lasted about an hour, until she was (her arms were)
finally too tired to hold herself up and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Four hours later, my alarm went off.  I wasn't happy to have gotten
so little sleep.  I didn't talk to her, and that's when she grabbed
the waistline of my pants when I sat on the futon to put my socks on.
I couldn't get up and I demanded to know wtf she wanted.</p>

<p>"話したい" [I want to talk.]</p>

<p>I checked my clock.  Five minutes until 8am.  I'm leaving at 8am.</p>

<p>I was like, "I'm fucking pissed at the way you presented your
information last night.  I'm thankful overall to know how you feel,
but I specifically came home last night to sleep and take care of
myself.  You came in here, you <b>unlocked my door</b> and came in
here."</p>

<p>It became 8am, and I left.  I was like, "you can fucking stay here
and do whatever the fuck you want, apparently.  Destroy the place if
you want; I don't care."</p>

<p>I stormed out; went downstairs; unlocked my bike; went back upstairs.</p>

<p>"I forgot my bag."</p>
