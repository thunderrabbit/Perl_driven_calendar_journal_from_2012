<p>Big fun at Universal Studios in Osaka, but even more fun at
Hitomi's friend Naomi's house looking at pictures from P&B's
Millenium Voyage when they met.  I was like, "ah forget P&B if
they didn't hire me," but, there is an awesome picture of Naomi
cradling a <em>dolphin</em>, under its own free will.  I'm totally
going to apply again for the February adventure.</p>

<p>Mariko joined us; she brought white chocolate, bless her heart,
and increased the funness level even more.  Tomorrow Hitomi and I
will get to hang out with Mariko at Expoland.  Whooo!</p>
