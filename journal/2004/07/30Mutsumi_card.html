<p>I wrote a card to Mutsumi after she evaluated my lesson before her
adventure in India.</p>

Mutsumi!  30 July 2004
I had great fun in our lesson!  Don't get
lost in India!  I always enjoy teaching
your lessons and I want to
address some of the questions
you asked me about offered and
gave.  Next time remind
me and we'll clear it up.
    See you!  - Rob!
