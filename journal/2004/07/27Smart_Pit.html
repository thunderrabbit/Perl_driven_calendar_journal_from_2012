<p>Okay, this was pretty cool.  I need to pay a bill.  I grab a
SmartPit card from any one of 6 types of convenience stores.  I call
the people to whom I owe money and give them the card number.  They
smurf my account with them to that card number and then they "tell the
card" how much I owe.  I take the card to the register and pay the
bill, receiving a receipt including the name of the company I paid and
the services I paid for. (and the amount)</p>

<p>The bill I paid was for the NTT phone line that connects Yahoo!BB
service to Dan's apartment.  The phone was disconnected cause I hadn't
paid the bill in two months.</p>
