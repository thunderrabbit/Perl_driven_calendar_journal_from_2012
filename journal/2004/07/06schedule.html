<p>During work today /トモ sent me an email and the short version of
the story is that though I had told her I'd meet her on Wednesday
(tomorrow), I didn't write it in my schedule book, and subsequently
scheduled myself to meet Yasuko tomorrow at the same time.</p>

<p>Called /トモ and やすこ and got everything sorted out; やすこ will
likely meet me at the restaurant where I'm meeting /トモ and pick up
the cassette tape there.  I don't know (where the restaurant is, nor)
where she works, so I don't know if she'll want to come (that far) out
or not.</p>

<p>We will see.</p>

<p>Mutsumi and I coordinated where we will meet on Saturday for
Ultimate, and scoped some roller coaster sites cause we both like
high adrenaline activities.  Awesome.  She told me about some parks
around Tokyo I hadn't previously heard of.  Sweet!</p>
