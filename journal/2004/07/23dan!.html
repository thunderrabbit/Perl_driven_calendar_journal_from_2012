<p>Dan loved his train card!</p>

<p>I set it up really well, and don't have time to write it all now,
but suffice to say he liked it lots.</p>

<p>We were sitting on some sideways facing steps in Jiyugaoka,
between the Gaba building and the next over building and I was like,
"these are the runnerups; you can just fling them over your head
without a care."   After he went through them, I was like, "okay; are
you ready?" and had him put away all the other cards lest he
accidentally fling the others in the air.  Then I showed him the next
stack, at the bottom of which were some fake best cards.  Like a golf
card and a milk card.</p>

<p>He was like, "mate...  I like them; I really do; um.  I'll keep
them right here..."</p>

<p>And I was like, "I'm just fuckin' with you.  For real.  Honestly.
The next stack of cards has your card in it."</p>

<p>He goes, "I'm shaking; it's like I'm nervous; what if I don't like
it?" and stuff, and then he started going through the stack and at the
last minute he was like, "I can't look!" and he put the card on the
ground and covered it up with his coke can.</p>

<p>Finally, we were like, "okay; this is it; I gotta be in my seat at
work in 18 minutes.." and then he scoped it.  And he loved it.</p>
