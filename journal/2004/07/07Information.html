<p>I have often stated that information should be free.  It's my
belief, partially fueled by the suggestion in _Conversations With God_
(though I have subsequently come to disapprove of the overall
organizations' attempts to promote and boast for itself), that if more
people knew the truth about more things, the world would be a better
place to live.</p>

<p>That idea didn't last very long.</p>

<p>Not even long enough to explain that my idea was to file a bunch
of FOIA requests and post the results.</p>
