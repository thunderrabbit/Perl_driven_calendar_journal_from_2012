<p class=date>3:36am JST Monday 12 July 2004</p>

<p>I went to bed (with earplugs) around 8:30pm last night.  I woke up
at 2am for a moment (I had guessed it was my normal 4 hour wake up,
but maybe it got thrown off because I went to bed so early), and back
to sleep easily.  I feel pretty well rested now, and will be even
moreso when my alarm goes off at 5am.</p>

<p>But, right now, nature calls.</p>

<p class=date>4:45am</p>

<p>Never got back to <em>sleep</em> per se (interesting
italicization), but just lay in bed under janette's warm quilt with
visions of RSS implementations in my mind.  Wondering what stories I
would publish that way, and what db setup would be best suited for it,
and how to tell the db that two particular files are linked
(chronologically (e.g. two state of my life addresses) or plotfully
(chapters of one story)).  Also wondered about taking pictures on Mt
Fuji and underwater at Wailua Falls.  I've heard that we can't just
put a plastic bag around a camera to make it waterproof because the
water pressure would squoosh the soft plastic into the camera until it
could no longer function.  I wondered about attaching a hose from a
scuba setup to the soft-plastic-encased camera so that we could use a
soft plastic bag, but I figured I should learn more about scuba before
adding hoses to the setup, plus if the soft plastic bag failed, that
would be a fairly detrimental leak in the system.  But we could just
add a ball-valve at the base of the extra hose that would stop the
leak from leaking.  Then, thinking about cameras, I realized I hadn't
charged my camera's battery.  Woke up, plugged it in, wrote this.</p>

<p>It's 4:58am now. 2 minutes until wake up.</p>

<p>In one hour, I'm leaving to go climb Mt Fuji for the first time in
my life (and stay overnight on the summit in what I've heard will be
freezing temperatures).  I guess I should start packing.</p>

<p class=date>5:15am</p>

<p>Wearing/carrying:</p>

<ul>
<li>hat</li>
<li>cargo pants</li>
<li>sunscreen
<li>recording devices (camera, tape recorder)
<li>long sleeved shirt over t-shirt
<li>socks
<li>hiking boots
</ul>

<p>(to be) packed / to be purchased from the convenience store:</p>

<ul>
<li>thermal underwear
<li>computer
<li>janette's quilt
<li>Morag's purple rain coat
<li>water
<li>protein
<li>toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, mouth guard)
</ul>

<p>supplied by Hitomi and her mom:</p>

<li>Nova kleenex
<li>M&amp;M's
</ul>

<p class=date>5:34am</p>

<p>Hmm. I wonder if I can get all this in the bag.  Water seems to be
problematic yet essential to carry.</p>

<p class=date>7:00am</p>

<p>In an email, silly Tomoko called herself "meddlesome," even though
she's done all the coordination for this trip, from sorting out what
restaurants to meet at for planning, to sending out updated schedules
on leaving due to the amount of time it will take to reach the top,
because she forgot to tell me the name of the station where we're
supposed to meet today at 7am.  (ps: last night, I confirmed the
correct station is Shinjuku, which is where I am now.)</p>

<p class=date>7:01am</p>

<p>I just sent an email to Hitomi accidentally, "please never think
you are meddlesome; you have been a great help!"</p>

<p class=date>on the train</p>

<p>Sumidasan says, "according to the weather, the summit maximum will
be 7 degrees, minimum -3 degrees."</p>

<p class=date>9:00am</p>

<p>Have just arrived in Gotemba and when the dude said, "don't forget
your stuff on the train," for the first time, I understood the line.
Wow.</p>

<p class=date>9:08am JST Monday 12 July 2004</p>

<p>In the taxi from Gotemba station to Gotemba trail.  33 km to the
mountain?</p>

<p>I've recorded a couple of points on my tape recorder.  In a taxi
now after riding the Odakyu / JR lines on one train (the fastest way,
according to Sumidasan) to Gotemba.  He is yammering with the taxi
driver now.  Miyuki and I are chowing onigiri in the back of the taxi.</p>

<p class=date>9:26am (in the taxi)</p>

<p>"何が話したい？" [what do you want to say?] I asked Miyuki.</p>

<p>Caught off guard, she goes, "I? uhhhh, stop stop stop."</p>

<p class=date>9:31am</p>

<p>1300 meters and climbing.  Alright.  I can feel it in my ears, baby.</p>

<p>just saw a hiker walking by.  He didn' see me.</p>

<p>There are hardcore dudes... <em>jogging</em> up the hill.  This
shit is steep.  Well.. yeah it's steep.</p>

<p class=date>arrival at Gotemba 5th station</p>

Sumidasan appointed her the treasurer for the trip.  He and I each
paid her 20,000 yen at the train station, and she's paid for our train
tickets and taxi ride.  She'll pay for our train tickets on the way
back, too.</p>

<p>Sumidasan is pondering just which and how many <a
href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?Amount=200&From=JPY&To=USD">200
yen</a> drinks to purchase.  He says they will be 600 yen at the top
of the mountain.</p>

<p>I guess we're here.</p>

<p>Fuckin' asphalt is gross; I'll take some pictures.</p>

This is <em>gross</em>..  we're just like,
there's <em>asphalt</em> (*),...  Over there are a bunch of army jeeps and
shit.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Dammit, bobby.  I just tried to pop my back and it cramped, and it
hurts just standing.  We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>(*) the asphalt, which I thought was so gross, though it might be
gross, is not gross for the reason I thought.  It's not asphalt.
It's Mt Fuji.</p>

<p>Mt Fuji is just a giant pile of gravel.</p>
