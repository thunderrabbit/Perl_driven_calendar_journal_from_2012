<p>Class was pretty good.  Ayana went through all of my notes that I
had written over the past two weeks and made a couple of corrections
that Hitomi hadn't caught.  That took most of thelesson, during which
time I continued with the book, writing sentences and practicing
kanji.</p>

<p>We looked briefly at a new grammar which meant "too much" "I drank
too much coffee" or "I slept too long," or the like.  The grammar
wasn't too difficult, but I was having trouble coming up with results
of too much activity.</p>

<p>My sentences were like, "I played too much tennis so my legs hurt,"
and "I studied too much so my head hurts," and "I watched too much TV
so I couldn't watch a movie."  Okay, finally a different grammar.
Then I came up with sheer brilliance:  "Ayana ate too many sweets, so
she gave some to me."</p>
