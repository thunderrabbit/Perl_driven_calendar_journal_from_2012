<br>if you are so hell bent on exposing ur body parts then peolple will leer and stalk u, it is well known that india is a conservative country . why dont you adopt the norms of a country you visit rather than curse them even after they have been hospitable to u? next time try wearing a salwar kameez (hope u know wht that is- try googling it) and walking down a street . ppl will look at u with respect not with some sexual intentions. i am more than convinced that each country of this world has its share of bad characters. but to denounce a whole country because of that is silly and stupid.<br>
