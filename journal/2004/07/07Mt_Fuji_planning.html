<p>Chillin' with Miyuki and Sumida and Tomoko in Mt Fuji planning
session.  Chowing at this cool Mexican cafe type place.  I need to
buy a poncho (or borrow Morag's (I texted her)) and call Apple to see
if my Mac will survive the cold temperature.</p>

<p class=date>11:18pm</p>

<p>Fun chatting with them. During the meal I called Yasuko because it
was apparent that we wouldn't finish before 10pm, which is how late
she said she was willing to wait in Shibuya for us to finish.  Yasuko
was too shy/nervous to come in to meet my friends, which is kinda cute
in a way, but definitely fires her, not that she was ever in the
running, though.  She was scared about being in Shibuya, saying she
didnt like it (the crowds can be a bit menacing), but she seemed to
make it okay.  I was like, "just be like grrrr" when you walk through
the crowds and throw your shoulders and elbows to get people out of
your way.</p>

<p>Miyuki tried to speak more English this time; she's getting more
comfortable with the idea, it seems.  They were mostly like perapera
zooom Japanese tonight, so I couldn't catch too much, but it's all
good.</p>

<p>I had seen a small herd of yamamba women on the way in to the
restaurant, but didn't see any herds on the way out.  Just one
slightly yamambastically inclined woman walking with her friend.</p>

<p>The next time I see my little group, we'll be ready to climb Mt
Fuji.  Wow.</p>

<p>During dinner we talked a lot about eating habits in Us vs Japan,
and about my favorite foods (sugar-based and chocolte based)_ We ate
several appetizer type things from avacado salad to fried calamari to
cheese side dish (that was supposed to be melted cheddar cheese for
calamari dipping)</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised after dinner to finalize our plans and find
out that we were not going to an onsen afterward.  I should have asked
last time we met, but I didn't want to say anything in front of Miyuki
in case Yuuko was goin g to meet us there and Miyuki was not invited.
Sigh.  Well, I'll have an extra day off work to relax after my Mt Fuji
experience.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can find an onsen around my area in which to
bask.</p>
