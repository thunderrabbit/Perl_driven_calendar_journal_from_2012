<pre>
gently melting on the train:
salarymen,
housewives,
students:
sprawl slouchingly,
spaced carefully:
stay away.

hello, summer.

I'm on the train, headed for work.  I tell everyone that I love this weather.  

I do love it.  

I like to imagine the humidity is a warm blanket,
I am wrapped snugly in a warm bed.  

"I just pretend I'm in bed all day long."

But, 

sometimes, 

I secretly feel hot.

But, <em>never</em> hot enough to long for winter.
