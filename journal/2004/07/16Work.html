<p>Yesterday I learned that one of my favorite students is a TV news
personality.  Wow!  I wonder if I'll ever witness one of the
broadcasts.</p>

<p>Today Yasuko came for her last lesson before her Hong Kong
adventure this weekend!  I'm really excited for her and have given her
the most support I can realistically give.  I reallllly hope her
speech goes flawlessly, and I really expect she'll have a good time.
I loaned her a blue (for relaxation) Rody horse for her nerves.</p>

<p>Saw Kozue on the train after work.  Funny.</p>
