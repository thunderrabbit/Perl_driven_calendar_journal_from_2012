<p>Work was okay today.  My percentage of exciting students was well
below 50%.  Maybe 2.5 out of 7.  I had one really good lesson where
Kazumi was trying to learn the difference between bored and boring.  I
had her do different things and tell me what she was doing. "I am
opening the door.  I am closing the door.  I am dropping beans."
(there are beans in bowls as decoration near my cube.  I put them to
good use.) </p>

<p>Then I was like, "okay, what is the door?"  "The door is opened,
the door is closed, the beans are dropped."  Not perfect grammar, but
it got the point across.  Then I switched to allow her to be passive.
The computer was on screen saver mode.  "Okay, what is the computer
doing?"  (hint: nothing).  And I got her to give me, "the computer is
boring."  and then "The computer is boring so I am bored."</p>

<p>She dropped more beans for good measure, feeling the words tumble
about in her brain, looking for concepts.  This, for me, is teaching
at its finest.</p>

<p>After work, Tetsuya (manager) confirmed that I couldn't work next
weekend.  I'll be at Jen's uncles.  "Yep; I can't work; sorry."  but
not reallllly sorry.</p>
