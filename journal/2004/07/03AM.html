<p>Morning came early today as I'm at Jen's uncle's work learning how
to do stuff around here.  It was fun to chat with Jen on the way here.
Really cool operation going on here at the office.</p>

<p>I'm to take over for next weekend while Jen is kickin' it in OZ.  I
may have the option to take the job permanently, in which case I would
reduce my hours at Gaba because I can make more here in 7.5 hours than
at Gaba in 10.5 hours.</p>

<p>Longer train ride, but it's overall a better deal for me.</p>
