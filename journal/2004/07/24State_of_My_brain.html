<p>Okay: here is an idea (fleeting)</p>

<p>We do different things in our lives.  Some things are done every
day, in order to maintain our lives.  Some things are done once, and
seem to be turning points in our lives.  Like there's a distinction
between things that make a difference and things that don't.  Arguably
*everything* makes a difference, but I can't quite buy that they
actually really make a difference in a soul level.</p>

<p>Now, does that mean it's the case that nothing makes a difference
at a soul level?  Or does everything make a difference at a soul
level?  Or is there a hierarchy?  Some spectrum of differences to be
made?</p>

<p>I could buy a knife at the kitchenware store for 200 yen, come
back here and kill someone.  Or I could go to the convenience store,
buy a lunch for 200 yen, come back here and eat lunch.</p>

<p>Now, my upbringing says that there is a difference between these
two activities.  They cost the same monetarily; they take the
essentially the same amount of time, but they are different.  One is
bad; the other is good, or at least not punishable by law.</p>

<p>My <em>heart</em> tells me these activities are different.  I have
chosen not to join the armed forces because I have made a generally
choice to not kill people.  (Even so, when I'm in a pissy mood, I
think, "I'll fucking kill you motherfucker" when people get in my
way.)</p>

<p>Is there a difference?  What is the difference?  One gets me one
meal for 200 yen.  The other gets me a month worth of food for 200
yen.  Why do I choose the one meal option?  I could choose someone
that I don't consciously know.  What is the difference?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This, by some points of view, is an extreme example.  I could find
many people who would agree with my belief that eating a sandwich is
less damaging than killing a person.</p>

<p>What is the actual difference?  Behind the masks, behind the
systems of humanity, behind the laws forbidding killing, what is the
difference?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>My choice to sit and write this, versus study Japanese, versus
read news on google, versus go get a sandwich...  what is the
difference?  Do some things matter?</p>

<p>I posit that some things do matter, and some things don't matter,
but I can't explain why.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After talking to Jesse about this, I think maybe things matter
when:</p>

<ol>
<li>We are aware of our actions</li>
<li>They affect other entities</li>
</ol>

<p class=date>8:09pm</p>

<p>I've been wranting (wanting and ranting) a desire to have
guidance, to know what is best.   BUT</p>

<p>I have articulated a goal.  I had this amorphous blob of an idea
that there is an ultimate good, an ultimate goal, but, even if there
is an ultimate goal, like climbing Mt Fuji, there are many trails to
the top.</p>

<p>So, that means the ultimate good thing to do <em>right now</em>
depends on where I want to go.</p>

<p>Which is where, again?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So we come back to basics that I've seen before: gotta have a goal
before we can have a path to that goal.</p>

<p>So, let's say my goal is to have 3 million US dollars (inflation
adjusted, and assuming the US lasts this long) in 10 years.</p>

<p>There are many ways to acquire 3 million US dollars.</p>

<p>Some options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>be employed (not likely to work, unless it's a higher salaried
job than teaching English)</p></li>

<li><p>rob a bank (even though it's my name, it's not my nature)</p></li>

<li><p>start a brick and mortar business that works (need money to
open a storefront)</p></li>

<li><p>start a virtual or home based business that works (getting
closer)</p></li>

<li><p>invent something awesome and sell the rights (possible)</p></li>

<li><p>write something awesome and sell the contents (possible)</p></li>

<li><p>sell my body (possible)</p></li>

<li><p>sell pictures and video of me selling my body (compound $$
yeah)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay.  I come down to using my brain (or bod) to generate
something that people will want to pay for.</p>

<p>(( I have honestly considered many times selling sex online.  Sites
like mikesapartment and captainstabbin and ideepthroat seem to have
found access to a huge market.  The last of the three listed is the
only one that I judge to have... morals; the site is apparently
primarily a couple and a few select friends.  I don't really approve
of the first two sites' techniques of finding random girls to
bang.</p>

<p>So I think, would any of my gfs want to start a sex site?  Could we
break into the market and make dollars?  Which of my gfs would be open
to the option?  Should I drop my Japanese life and go do it?  (heh heh
I said do it) ))</p>
