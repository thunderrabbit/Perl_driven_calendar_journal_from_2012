<p>Chatted with Olivia tonight after getting home.  Bought some
foodage (with my 5000 yen) and chowed while we talked about her guy
problems and my similar situations.  I think I'll talk about Jenni
instead of the other one.  She had to work late again tonight but I
called her briefly cause she had emailed me about being down on her
job for such long hours.</p>

<p>Ribbia read to me her horoscope for the year and mine for the
year.  Very interesting how the personalities seem to match.</p>
