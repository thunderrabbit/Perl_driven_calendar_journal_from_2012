<p class=dream>I was talking to Mike Cutaia, my business distributor
about a cassette tape by Jodi Victor.  Mike quoted a funny part of the
tape and asked me to play it so he could hear it again.  Jodi started
his speech making automobile sounds passing at high speed, implying
the driver of the car was afraid to go beyond 55 miles per hour, using
that as an excuse to not move his business forward.</p>

<p class=dream>I was impressed that Mike could quote the tape; he
really had listened to it.</p>
