<p>Today has been a bit of a lazy day.  I have hit some roadblocks for
doing stuff with paypal; I have transferred money from my US account
to my paypal account and it's taken days and days it seems.  Just like
a watched pot (of (non) gold (backed currency)).</p>

<p>Oh, and I fucked up; I forgot about a payment I told my credit card
to get from my bank account, and now my IRS payment will bounce.
Oops.  But I'm not too scared of the lumbering bohemoth; I'll pay
their little fine and pay the amount once the money gets to my paypal
account and I'll bounce some back to my bank account.</p>

<p>The reason I moved money from my account *to* paypal, is that
paypal now offers a 1.0% interest on balances.  My bank account, while
*free*, doesn't offer me any interest.  Paypal gives me interest on
balances as low as one dollar.</p>

<p>But *that's* not all!  Paypal *also* (apparently; I've not
confirmed this yet) can smurf money out of my Japanese bank account!
This is not *so* amazing, but it is WAY cheaper than the way I had
been sending money back to the US.  500 yen instead of 3000 yen!  Wow
wow wow!!</p>

<p>So, if you want to be cool, and you still haven't gotten a paypal
account, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/"><em>get one
now</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you want a business account, where you can accept credit card
payments online with low transaction fees (2.2%-2.9% + $0.30 USD) <a

and I'll get a bonus for the referral.</p>
