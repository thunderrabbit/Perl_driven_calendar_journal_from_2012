<p>Hung out with Olivia, Dan and (for a bit) Morag today before work
in Jiyugaoka.  How fun!  We went on Quests to fix Dan's phone (He went
in and explained, "when I check my email, it gives me some kind of
error..."  The woman checked, and it turns out <em>someone</em> hadn't
paid his bill.  The nerve!), to buy a gilligan hat for me (Olivia and
I had scoped some stores in Motosumiyoshi, but found only women's hats
or hats that were too small for me.  We found something close in
M. Smith skate and surf shop in Jiyugaoka, but it took Dan's arrival
to lead us to Muji, the Container Store of Tokyo.  Not as high quality
as TCS, but still pretty much the same idea, except they have no
travel items, and they have some clothing.  We found the perfect hat
for me there.  It's a gilligan hat, but it's beige instead of white.
Olivia didn't like it at first, and then she said it was perfect for
me.  So either she's a liar, or she quickly grew to like it.</p>

<p>We grabbed some foodage while waiting for Morag, who brought me her
big purple raincoat outfit for climbing Mt Fuji!  I knew she had it
from the story Carla told me about the time they went hiking and
everyone but Morag bought little cheapo throwaway things, but Morag
was a genius and bought this sturdy coat with visor and pants!  Morag
tells the story more like, "I wish I had just bought a cheap thing
because I looked like a giant <b>grape</b>," she says, emphasizing the
final word.</p>

<p>Well, I'm glad she bought it and retained it and has loaned it to
me.</p>

<p>We saw Jesse for a moment; he was on his way to teach a private
student, but he, Dan and I cracked out the hackeysack for a moment.
Okay 1 minute to work time.</p>

<p>gotta put on socks and shoes.</p>

<p>Aw man; I didn't retain both socks in my pockets from my apt to
work.  Walkin' around with one sock on now.</p>

<p>Turns out my sock had lept from my pocket in the shoe-changing
area at the apartment.</p>
