<p>Super special thanks to Hitomi for navigating me to the P
B. We talked to Ken and Melissa, two people who work (or maybe
volunteer) for the organization, which is pretty much busy as fuck
right now so no one has had a chance to send me an application.  (The
desire to retrieve an application motivated my trip to their office
today.)</p>

<p>When they asked me why I want to rock out on the P B, I was
basically like, "I want to do something for the world."</p>

<p>I didn't ramble on about my palm reading experience where Richard
Unger told me exactly that I am asked to do something for the world
this lifetime; I just told them that's what I want to do.</p>

<p>Thank you, ¿ÎÈþ, for taking me there.</p>
