<p>She had been at Starbucks 30 minutes before, but then went window
shopping.  I called her and joined her shopping spree for a bit until
she found some earrings for her sister.</p>

<p>I told her I had seen Asuka, so we went to the Italian restaurant
where she said she worked.  Didn't see her there (plus it wasn't an
ice cream shop <em>per se</em>, so we inquired about the whereabouts
of an ice cream shop).  Second floor.  Ah.</p>

<p>Found her and she gave me 20% off ice cream and Miki relayed the
story of how I took us to the wrong place at first.  I defended myself
by repeating what I had asked Asuka before; anyway it was all good and
we stayed there for probably 2 hours, most of which was me studying
with Miki's corrections, and a little of Miki's questions and my
corrections in English.</p>

<p>Soon I'm going to Shinbashi to meet /е╚ет et. al.</p>

<p>ps: the peeps from the picture place called.  Pics are ready.
Whooo!</p>

<p>overall, big fun.</p>
