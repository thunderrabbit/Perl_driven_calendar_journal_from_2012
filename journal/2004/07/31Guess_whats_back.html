<p>Yay!  My computer is back!</p>

<p>There seems to be a bit of a problem with the power connection in
the back, though.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>They're going to fix it under warranty and Hitomi will pick it up
tomorrow.  I will be strong (surviving without my computer for another
day.)</p>

<p>I want so much to check email.</p>

<p class=date>6:29pm</p>

<p>WOWW!!!!!  They are going to fix it now within two hours!!!!!!  Yay
Apple Store Ginza!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p class=date>3:42am</p>

<p>Err, make that</p>

<p class=date>8:44pm</p>

<p>My computer is back and the power connector in the back is back
too!</p>

<p>And now Hitomi is back!</p>

<p>After arriving at Apple and leaving my computer for its final
adjustment, we went across the street to a bookstore where I bought a
pocket sized science book on the earth and space.  Most of that stuff
I know in English, so learning it in Japanese won't be too hard; just
a lot of new vocabulary.  Cool.</p>

<p>Then we rocked across another street to a Chinese restaurant with
big gyouzas and big spring rolls that were longer and thinner and
crispier than what we call spring rolls in the US. </p>

<p><em>Just</em> as we emerged to the sidewalk (in the restaurant, two
floors below street level, I had no phone signal), Apple store called
me; my computer was fixed.  Double fixed.  Awesome awesome.</p>

<p>Now we're at Tully's where I just chowed four scoops of vanilla ice
cream in a cone.  The ice cream was weak with chips of ice in it.
Nothing like premium ice cream like Ben and Jerry's or Amy's.</p>
