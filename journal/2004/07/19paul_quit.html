<p>Last night when I came home, I found Jen, Tetsuya, Aiko, and Olivia
in Karen's new room (which happens to be below my room).  I hung out
with them and found out that Paul quit working for Jen's uncle.  He
was in charge of the computer side of things.  I was pretty much
floored; I was only there for a weekend, but there was no sign of
quittage in Paul's behavior from what I could see.</p>

<p>I might begin working for Jen's uncle.</p>
