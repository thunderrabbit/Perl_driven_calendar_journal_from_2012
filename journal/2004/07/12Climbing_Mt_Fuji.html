align="left"></a> Probably 5 minutes prior, we began climbing from 1/2
Mountain Souvenir and Drink</p>

<p>The soil is little tiny rocks that slide, so we lose like an eighth
of a step with every step.  Kinda <em>tricky</em>.  Tricky, that
is.</p>

align="left"></a> We're at the 5.5th stage.  Sign says 3 hours to 6th
stage.  (Another sign says 2 hours to the 6th station.) I counted 500
steps in 9 minutes.</p>

align="left"></a>Damn.  I left my gloves down by the entrance, where I
tried to pop my back and strained a muscle instead.  The strain has
been troublesome, but manageable.  This is me wondering if I should
go back and get my gloves.</p>

<p class=date>11:18am</p>

<p>Takin' a five minute break.  My method has been to go fast and pass
them, then wait and let them get ahead of me, and go pass them
again.</p>

align="left"></a> I took a video to show how sloggy it is to climb
up.. it's like little pea gravel with some chunks.. making it easy to
slide, or not slide, but to lose a bit of ground.</p>

<p class=date>11:51am</p>

<p>We're climbing Mt Fuji, and taking a break.  A moment ago I lost my
protein drinks, but found them in my pockets.  I felt a bit of a
headache coming on which I realized was a no-water headache, the same
headache that I got at Tokyo Disneyland, which was a killer headache.
But, not today.</p>

<p class=date>12:48pm</p>

<p>It's definitely colder now.  We have been taking breaks every 30
minutes it seems, but somehow time also is going by more quickly than
it seems.  I think 20 minutes but it's been 30.  I guess the monotony
of climbing on absolutely identical trail all the way up, just
counting foot steps and wondering how my walking staff will look once
we reach the top, and wondering if I can convince the right people to
let me <em>sled</em> down this mountain one day, makes the time go
faster.</p>

<p>It's really overcast, and I'm getting a few sprinkles on the screen
as I type. Visibility is 100 meters - that's how far away I can make
out anything at all, but I wouldn't really call it visible.</p>

align="left"></a> Made it to 6th station, I think.  Wow.  Pretty fuckin'
tired.  And I gotta peeeeeeee like a big dog.  Unfortunately, there's
no bathroom up here; everything is all locked up.  Rusted shut.</p>

<p class=date>2:00pm</p>

<p>At 6th station, I put on Morag's purple grape suit, and peed, even
though there was no toilet.  Right now it is exactly two zero zero
o'clock, and my phone, for some reason, has no coverage.  C'mon
Vodafone, get yer shit together.</p>

<p>Um, I'm takin' a break; they stopped a little ways down the hill.
I can't actually see them right now (due to the fog), but I'm within
yelling distance I believe, so it's all good.  I'm trying to get my
phone back in my pocket right now, underneath Morag's purple grape
suit.</p>

<p>We have a little bit of sprinklage going on, and I'm very thankful
for the grape suit and for Hitomi's mom's gear, <em>all</em> of which
(save the flashlight so far) I have used, or am using.</p>

<p>Okay.  Fuckin' hell.</p>

<p>This is fuckin' awesome and hard.  I'm glad it's not sunny, but
it's kinda sad that I can't see anything.  It's like 50 meters
visibility and that's it.</p>

<p>Here they come; I can see them now.</p>

<p>Okay bye-bye.</p>

<p class=date>2:30??</p>

<p>Um, wow.  I just went up the steep direction, up like a vein of
rocks sticking out; they were solid rocks so I thought it would be
easier to climb than the scree.. and uh, it was pretty tough.  But I'm
making as much (vertical) headway as Sumidasan and Miyuki (who are
over on the walking trail)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I just dropped a little tiny bit of trash (corner
of M&amp;M packet) that I'm *not* going to go recover, because I have
picked up more trash than I just now dropped.  But, Mt Fuji, I'm
sorry.</p>

<p>Um, it's pretty windy, little bit of rain.  The sky is clearing
in a way.  The visibility is greater, but once we get to the clouds,
it's like <em>bang</em> the clouds are there.  I'm not sure if we're
just in a clear patch or what.</p>

<p>My experience right now is that the wind is blowing down the
mountain, whereas before it was blowing up the mountain, which is
interesting, and ... I don't really know what time it is.  I'll
check, hang on.</p>

<p>Sorry; can't get to my phone easily enough.  Probably 2:30.</p>

align="left"></a>It was 3:20 when I caught up with these two guys; I went
the (far) harder way, straight up instead of zigzaggin' on the
trail.</p>

<p>It's about 3:30 now.  We just saw a bunch of military guys, or army
guys, I dunno, going *down* the hill; they started at 7:45 this
morning, going *up* the hill, which I *believe* is 3 hours and 15
minutes earlier than we started.  So, they are definitely harder core
than we are, but.. but nothing; they're hard core.</p>

<p>Alright yo, we're at the 7th stage right now, 3:30.  It's funny;
the army guys were like, "when did you start," "how long did it take
you," kinda stuff; cause they're fuckin' beat, too. They wanna know
when the shit's over.  I told them we started four hours ago and
they're like "fuck."  so yeah, I know.</p>

<p>I don't know at what <em>level</em> they started, though, so oh well.</p>

<p class=date>3:45pm</p>

alt="guess who is not a Marine" align="left"></a>We made it past 7th
station to a place that says it's a good place to watch the rising
sun.  We saw a bunch of soldiers coming down the thing.  No wind yet,
er, no snow yet.</p>

<p class=date>4:30pm</p>

<p>We arrived at 8th station, which has beds, an enclosed area, food,
heat..  oh god I just wanted to fuckin' cry, dude, when we got here.
Really difficult to get here, and we're not at the top yet. We're
going to stay here until 2am, and then go the rest of the way to the
top to watch the sunrise.</p>

<p>Or, we'll sleep until we die.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The guys who were here when we arrived... were <em>doing
pushups</em> when we got in, which is.. ridiculous, but true.</p>

<p>They are also helping each other stretch, in a really, what I
judge, a bad way, like hurtingly stretch.  But, to them their own.</p>

<p>ps: I really had to stop myself from crying.  Wow.  So cold
outside.</p>

align="left"></a>Yay.  picture of janette's quilt up on Mt Fuji.  Level
8.</p>

<p>My clothes were wet with sweat, but I had my long johns and
janette's quilt to make my own warm fashion statement while my clothes
were dried above the diesel generator for 8th station electricity (and
clothes drying).</p>

<p class=date>7:25pm JST Monday 12 July 2004</p>

<p>Woooooooooo</p>

<p>In case I never get around to transcribing my tape, I'll just
mention a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's fucking cold outside.</p></li>

<li><p>It's way way way crazy cold outside.</p></li>

<li><p>It's super duper windy and cold outside.</p></li>

<li><p>As we arrived, I wanted to cry. I had to stop the choked up
emotions of <em>oh dear god I'm so glad that freezing cold nightmare
of walking uphill on slidy gravel is, until 2am, over.</em></p></li>

<li><p>We are <em>inside</em> right now, and I'm *reallly* happy about
that.  So happy that, though nature is calling me, I'm staying inside
because the outhouse, by virtue of being an <em>out</em>house, is
outside.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In a few minutes of effort, I was able to solve the ball trapped in
box puzzle.  The box had holes in its sides, making it look like a
die. One of the holes was bigger, allowing the ball to come out, but
the box was not exactly hollow, but like a maze; had to waggle it
around a bit to get the ball out.</p>

src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/thumbs/8th_station_house_heater.jpg"
align="left"></a>I slept for just over an hour I'm guessing, listening to
the wind blow outside (and a bit inside through the paneling (no
double walls here)) and feeling my feet slowly thaw, though they were
slightly uncovered and getting breezed.</p>

src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/thumbs/8th_station_house.jpg"
align="left"></a>Woke up and chowed stew and rice..  And, janette, Maggie,
Molly, and Wende's food aside, it was the best meal I've ever ever
eaten.  It was good, but its proximity to this climb boosted its
goodness.</p>
