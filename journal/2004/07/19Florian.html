<p>Oh my goodness.</p>

<p>I just met Florian, and I am in love.  This has happened before; I
meet, I fall in love, I fall out of love.  Like rain.  But this is a
little bit different.  It's not that the piercing blue eyes
captivating me is different.  It's not that Florian is from
Switzerland.  It's that Florian is a he.</p>

<p>But those eyes, man.  Wow.  If I were interested in getting jiggy
with men, I would be interested in getting jiggy with Florian.
Wow.</p>

<p>Right now as I type this, I'm thinking of ways to go say HI and
reasons to need to ask him questions, just so I can be pierced by
those piercing blue eyes.</p>
