<p>Waiting for the train to come, standing near the shaded side of the
platform, away from the impending train arrival side of the platform,
twirling my Gilligan hat, I dropped it onto the track below.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>I knew it would take a long time to tell someone I had dropped it,
have them go through the necessary procedure of getting a retrieval
device, etc etc etc and retrieving my hat.  The procedure would
certainly make me miss the next train.  So, before anyone could say
anything or even notice, I jumped down to the track, grabbed my hat,
and jumped back up onto the platform.  Made it back up seconds before
the train arrived.</p>

<p>The two (2) train conductor guys (who were <em>right</em> behind
me) facing the approaching-train side of the platform didn't even see
me.  Haha</p>

<p>It was fun to break the rules and get away with it.</p>

<p>(( concerned-yet-not-carefully-reading readers please note: the
train was coming on the other side of the platform from me ))</p>
