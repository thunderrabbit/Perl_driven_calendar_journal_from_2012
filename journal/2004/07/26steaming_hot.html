<p>My fan hasn't been working on my computer, and I decided today to
figure out why.  I think I know the main reason: it's not plugged
in.  I'm really surprised that they at Apple Store didn't notice.</p>

<p>I'm also surprised that I don't remember the last time they had my
computer apart.  Must have been a long time ago.</p>

<p>Fan works now.  And it's spinning fast.</p>
