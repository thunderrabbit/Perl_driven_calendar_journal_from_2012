<p>This morning I have drafted my application to join the P B's
3 hour tour around the world!  Wait, make that three <em>month</em>
tour around the world!  But the cool thing is not just the tour around
the world, it's that the Pb's activities read a whole lot like
the activities of YRUU, just on a global scale.. focusing on social
action, sustained development, conflict resolution...  It sounds
completely awesomely awesome!</p>

<p>I've written the draft by hand and will type it sooooon.  Deadline
is 30 July.  (two days).  I just received the app yesterday, and the
extended deadline is 6 August, so it would be supa cool if I turned my
app in *today*.</p>

<p>HAhahaha I just started laughing - the idea of riding my bike to
Osaka and then around the world is far from the top of my brain.  It's
still a possibility.  It's my backup plan if I don't get on the
b.</p>
