<p>Ooops.  I apparently told Hitomi that I hadn't previously been to
Tokyo Disneyland.  I sorta remember that, but I didn't remember it
well enough to keep up the tale.  She confronted me and I was like, "I
didn't want you to feel bad," which is the only reason I woulda said
that.  Seems to be basically okay now, but tensions were high for a
bit.  I was like, "fuck this," and was ready to pack it up (and get
off the Splash Mountain boat in a dramatic show of "I care less than
you do," but I chose to stay in the moment instead of acting out.  It
woulda been pretty dramatic though.  Worthy of cameras and network TV
time.</p>

<p>We first rode Space Mountain, and, well, it's got pretty lights,
but it's a weak ride.  Practically no better than SFAW indoor ride
Mayan Mindbender.  It's got a few more twists and turns than
Mindbender, but it's still pretty weak.</p>

<p>We road Big Thunder Mountain and then Peter Pan and Snow White and
Haunted Mansion.  I wanted to ride HM again, but we didn't.  Rode the
spinning teacups and I spun ours as fast as I could.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Went through the Snow white Mansion tour and it was okay.  Honey I
shrunk the Audience was pretty good, and the Buzz Lightyear themed
video game croseed with a wagon train style ride was pretty fun.  I
got lots of points but Hitomi got more.</p>

<p>Fun was had at TDL.  We each have a bit of a headache from the sun,
I'm guessing, but overall big fun.  We rode Haunted Mansion twice to
try and combine sleeping with riding/being in TDL. It didn't work
fantastically, but Hitomi got a bit of a cat nap I think.</p>

<p>We talked through our differences and I think we're better off for
it.</p>

<p>We're on the Rinkai line now, and I had a bit of an internet signal
at Shin Kiba station, but it wasn't strong enough to check email, and
I haven't gotten a signal since then.</p>
