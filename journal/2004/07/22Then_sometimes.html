<p>Then sometimes I like the little home I've created in Japan.  Just
today on my way to hang out with Miki, I saw two different students
from Nova who were like, "HI" to me.  Asuka on the train from Kosugi
to Kawasaki and then Midori at Circle K in Kawasaki.  Both names I had
forgotten, but Asuka told me hers and I read Midori's name tag.  (I
notice that I didn't say Midori had on a name tag; I had to think to
read it, not just read it.)</p>

<p>Midori's son is Takuya, but I didn't remember that until now; I'll
go back and ask her about him.  I wonder where Miki is; she's never
late.</p>
