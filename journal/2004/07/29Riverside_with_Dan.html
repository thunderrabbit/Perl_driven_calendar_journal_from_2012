<p class=note>(written on Hitomi's computer with her weird Japanese
keyboard)</p>

<p>Just hung out with Dan by the river in Tsunashima.  After he took
me to his favorite new internet cafe so I could print 3 pages (of a
document already on the web, that took me less than minute to type in
the address and press print) at a cost of 420 yen, which included
charges for thirty minutes of internet surfing, we went to Subway and
Book*Off and McDonald's and a drink machine for Dan's lunch, perusal,
fries, and drink respectively.  At Book*Off, I took a picture for
Frank, of the cover of _History of the NBA_, a hardcover book that I
would buy for him for 500 yen (I used the word "splurge" when I
emailed him a photo of it), if he were still living here.  At McDs I
bought a 100 yen vanilla shake.  Yum.</p>

<p>Dan and I Chatted about silly stuff and marveled at the bridge
flexing downward when the trains went by.  Huge iron I-beams flexing
about an inch in the middle of a 20 meter span.  Makes me wonder if
the tracks are layed to be an inch too high in the middle of the span,
so the result is a level surface.</p>

<p>We watched a Family Guy episode called "Death Lives," I think.
Pretty funny with a few good lines, some of which I may remember
momentarily.  Ah: Death is at home and his mom is nagging him
incessantly.  He goes, "man, I wish my dad were still dead..."  Oh and
there was the gag that when Peter had a near death experience, and his
spirit, when out of body, stole his own body's wallet.  Peter, when
his fiance's dad offered him a million dollars to not marry his
daughter, goes, "she may be worth a million bucks to you, but she's
worthless to me."</p>

<p>Dan also showed me an episode of Samurai Jack, but I just didn't
feel it.  Not so funny to me.</p>

<p>Good to see Genki Man Dan.</p>
