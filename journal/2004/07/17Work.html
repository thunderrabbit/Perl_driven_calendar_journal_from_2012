<p>Three money things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mariko called off her arranged wedding.  (whoohoo! for her
sake)</p></li>

<li><p>We had an awesome long earthquake a while ago.</p></li>

<li><p>Just talked to a guy who told me about a 2 day trip to a
semi-active (at least way climbable) volcanic island off the coast of
Tokyo.  Cooool.</p></li>

<li><p>I just spent the last lesson talking about languages with Tomoko,
taught her the ASL alphabet, the Spanish alphabet and how to count to
10 in Spanish.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Studying is hard, but I enjoy knowing languages.</p>

<p>I found a free online course to learn esperanto.  Shall I?</p>
