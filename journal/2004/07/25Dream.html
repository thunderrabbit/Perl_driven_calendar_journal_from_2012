<p class=dream>terrible dream that FSD had gotten bad financial news
and 1/2 of the leadership decided to quit and <em>take everything</em>
in the middle of the night, but the other half wanted to try and keep
the business and when I arrived, I was forced into choosing to help
the half that wanted to takeeverything without the consent of the
other half.</p>

<p class=dream>As the night drew to a close, we had to have
everything in the truck, which was a Tomball high school cheerleading
truck, and Heather Bennet was doing flipflops, practicing in the
cooridor inside the back of the truck.  She was on TV from a distant
angle as well.  Wow.</p>
