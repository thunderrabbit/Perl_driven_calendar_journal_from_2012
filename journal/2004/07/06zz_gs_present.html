<p>Okay. Time to open Fred's present to me.</p>

<p>Wow. $27.10 postage.  The box appears tobe a large shoebox for big
Nugen Feet.  He wrote my address in romanji on the box and then
rewrote it on an offwhite card for better visibility.  A new sticker
has been added below that, with kanji and English: "Opened and Packed
for Customs Clearance.  Tokyo Int'l Post Office"</p>

<p>JAPAN POST tape has somewhat restored the box's ability to enclose
things.</p>

<p>Description: jersey</p>

<p>Wow.  He insured it for $100.</p>

<p>Looks like when Fred finished with the box at home, it had been
sealed with clear tape so that I could cut three pieces of tape
lengthwise and open the box.  When he got to the post office, they
made him add a big-ass customs piece of paper to identify the
contents. That got plastered on the side of the box in its own clear
plastic protective envelope.</p>

<p>There's also a super thin translucent white rubbery sticky film on
one side of the box.  I'm sure Fred doesn't have this laying around
the house, but I'm not sure why someone at the post office would have
put it on the box.  It's not sealing the box closed, but..  ah-ha -
it was added after the postmark was stamped on the box.  So I know
Fred didn't do it, but I don't know why it was done.</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm opening the box now.  Plastic bag.  blue UU lettering
on black shirt.  It's gotta be a rally shirt.  Probably Houston Rally
given that he said he's had it for a while.</p>

<p>Oooooh it's *thick* fabric!  Sounds a lot like Houston Rally
style.</p>

<p>Wow!!!!!</p>

<p>It's a hoodie!   I *do* love it!  I *do* love it!!</p>

<p>SWD YRUU on the front and YRUU in the stylized chalice shape on the
back.  I bet they are SWD YAC fundraiser hoodies.  Great work,
guys!!</p>

<p>With high temperatures of 85 to 88 degrees this week, I probably
won't wear it at sea level, but I can wear it ON TOP OF MT FUJI NEXT
WEEK!!!</p>
