<p>Awesome set of students for work today.  Terumi, who I encouraged
to bring work emails to class, has chosen my lesson, and I assume will
bring emails.  Kumiko, who comes *rarely*, is on my schedule (though
she didn't choose my lesson, so she might vanish from my schedule).
She's the one for whom I wrote a postcard of Japanese greetings as
display of how much Japanese I seem to know.  I will ask if she got
it.</p>

<p>She didn't show up.</p>

<p>So I studied.</p>

<p>Today at work a couple of students have asked questions that
resulted in me realizing how much I miss the US.  Yarg.  But I don't
just want to go back and live; I want to do something cool.  Maybe
I'll ride my bike from California to Texas.  (my new bike that I
haven't researched nor purchased yet).  I can save 1000 bucks in a
couple of months and then rock the fuck out of here and buy a bike in
California and map out a trek between CA and TX.  Maybe I'll fuckin'
do it here in Japan and ride to Osaka and ride coasters there.  Fuck
this hating my current life crapola.</p>
