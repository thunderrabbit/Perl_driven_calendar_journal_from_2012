<p>今、みなとみらいに来ています。たくさんの人がいます。私たちのうしろ
にいた、まゆみさんはさいきんグアムにいった。彼女は英語が好きだと言って
いました。</p>

<p>仁美はこの文を教えてくれた。</p>

<p>Soon, fireworks should be kickin' it.  In 5 minutes according to
Hitomi's phone.  This place is pretty packed.  It'll be a nightmare
leaving, I'm sure.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see Hitomi is wearing a yukata.  She
is the first yukataed person I've had the opportunity to walk/talk
with.</p>

<p>Well, that was pretty coolish.</p>

<p>I took a video of lots of it.  I *might* put some on my site.</p>

<p>That's a mighty mc might.</p>

<p>Hitomes and I are chillin' on some seats in Minato-mirai station,
and the stream of people walking by, while not solid, is rather filled
and continuous.  A dude nearby us just chucked his spew on the floor
inside here.  Pretty gross.  Oh, it was a young girl.  I had assumed
huge intake of alcohol, but now I take it back. Still gross,
though.</p>
