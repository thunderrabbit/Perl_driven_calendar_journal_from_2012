<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>Tokyo is a disgusting place to live.  People don't care about the
environment; they try to give me plastic bags to hold one item; and
someone stole my bicycle.</p>

<p>No, not again, but today I went to the bicycle pounds to look for
it.  I went to two different pounds, and yes, I could have gone
before, but I trusted the cop saying they would call me if they found
it, so I didn't go, plus it just seemed like such a hassle and more
specifically so fucking <em>unfair</em> that I should have to *walk*
to look for my bicycle.  I would walk to go *get* my bicycle, but
knowing that it probably wasn't there made it just seem fruitless.
Well, I went today and for some reason the dude at each place took
like forever to understand the concept that even though my bike was
stolen on 31 March doesn't mean that's when it possibly arrived in
their bike pound.  The thief could have ridden it around for a while
and then dumped it.  He could still fucking be riding it; he could
have dumped it in a river, the fucking punk.  Anyway, all I wanted was
to look through the lot to see if my bike was there and they each let
me do that and in each case I didn't find my bicycle and in each case
they were like, "told you so," and I was like, "yes you sure did; you
sure told me." and when I tried to ask if they had a phone number the
dude was like, "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb" five hundred miles per
hour talking and I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Do
you have a fucking phone number or not?  And I was mad and I said in
Japanese, "you speak Japanese very well" and he's like, "I'm
Japanese."  "Yes you are.  And I have no idea what you are saying.
Thank you, good bye."</p>

<p>I mean I would say three words and he would jump to some conclusion
that he knew what the fuck I was trying to say.  NO You have no idea
what I'm trying to say, and I sure as fuck have no idea what you are
spewing back at me.  Fuckin' have some compassion or some common sense
that says if I speak the language at 1 low-level-vocabulary word per
second, I can't understand your fucking' high end speed demon
chatter.</p>

<p>And, and *AND* I asked each of the bike pounds what happens to the
bikes after three months.  "They are crushed."</p>

<p>Ever heard of an *auction*?  Some of the bikes were fucking money.
Yeah yeah the grandma bikes feel free to crush, but the mountain bikes
are worth something!  Fuck!</p>
