keyboard)</p>

<p>Second no-show student in a row.  I've never had either student,
but one had chosen my lesson before.  They both chose my lesson today.
I wonder why they chose my lesson and chose not to show up.  Tetsuya
asked me to wash the cups in the teachers' room sink, so I did and
then in an act of defiance, I washed the cups in the staff sink as
well.  He rushed in there when I started washing.</p>

<p>"No, I meant in the other room."</p>

<p>"Finished."</p>

<p>"Oh.  You don't have to do these, but,.. thank you."</p>

<p>"No problem."</p>

<p>After I finished, I gave a thumbs up to him on my way out.</p>

<p>First lesson was a double booking more-than-1/2-Japanese spoken
slushy mess.  I'm glad she seems to get something out of my lessons,
but I have stopped getting anything out of them (including 5-5s),
except the base 1400 yen.</p>

<p>Second (third) lesson was good, with good homework.</p>

<p>then lunch, and then Makiko, one of my favorite all-star students.
She is super bright and smiley and just so ... huggalicious.  She does
great homework, which nearly inspires me to do homework right now.  I
was really happy because she said she tried to choose my lesson more
times, but I was all booked up.  I would choose lessons with her over
many other things.</p>

<p>Since that time, two no shows.  Next = second lunch and then two
more lessons and then byebye.</p>

<p>Tomorrow's work schedule included 1 lesson after 5:30, so I closed
it in order to make free time for hanging out with Hitomi and
hopefully getting my computer from the shop.  They haven't called me,
but I hope it will be ready by tomorrow.</p>
