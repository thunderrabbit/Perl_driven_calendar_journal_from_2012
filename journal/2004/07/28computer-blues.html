<p class=note>(written on Hitomi's computer with her weird Japanese keyboard)</p>

<p>My computer had a heat stroke yesterday.  At least that's my guess
as to what happened.  It's strange, though, that I just connected the
fan, and it quickly had a problem after that.  I was typing my
Pb application outside by the stream near Sanami's house, and
had no problems.  Went to her house, played for an hour and got 3000
yen, then went to Yoyogi to meet Shufen for Mandarin-English exchange
(I've quit studying; lost my momentum, but she revived it a bit) and
plugged my computer in at the cafe and... it wouldn't come on.  Crap.
I didn't want to lose my momentum on my Pb application.</p>

<p>After chatting with her I went to Apple Store in Ginza and showed
them the situation.  Was able to get a copy of my application written
so far burned to CD.  Chose not to get my emails backed up, even
though they don't guarantee the safety of my data.  In my mind, the
emails paled in importance to a trek on Pb, and though they are
not mutually exclusive, the upcoming trek just gave me a bit of
<em>perspective</em> on the world.  What's more important?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>And I was still able to get to Shinagawa on time to meet Yasuko, to
hear about her Hong Kong adventure (no luggage, no one to meet her, no
hotel reservation (boss changed the booking and forgot(!) to tell
her), but she still had a great time,) and I was quick to point out
that realistically she had proven that she could arrive in a city with
no plan and create one on the fly.  Awesome work.  And awesome dinner
that she paid for as thanks for my help on her speech.  Yay!  And
chocolate, too!  yay yay yay!!</p>

<p>And then I met Hitomi who brought me her computer which I'm using
now.  I've written most of my application; I just need to add links to
the footnotes.</p>

<p>Yes, footnotes in an application.</p>

<p>My goal is to finish the app today and print it and take it to
Pb office by tomorrow morning before work.</p>

<p>Gotta find an internet connection, though; we are not connected
here at my apartment.</p>
