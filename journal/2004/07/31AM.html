<p class=note>(written on Hitomi's computer with her weird Japanese
keyboard)</p>

<p>Just cooked eggs, no time to really write before I need to take a
shower and go to work, but I just want to say I'm still really excited
about Pb.  Was just envisioning how my classes will bond and
how I'll learn all my students names.. I can bring my camera and take
pics of each person; it'll be great!</p>

<p>I was trying to remember what re-juvenated my energy toward this
project; I think I was just like, "might as well do it, or I'll regret
not having applied."</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>
