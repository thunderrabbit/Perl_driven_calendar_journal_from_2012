<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type=a>
<li><p>I'm in a grumpy mood.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm working at Gaba.  If I had no qualms about ditching work, I
could be working for Jen's uncle right now.  Making more money for
less work.</p></li>

<li><p>I want a cool project of my own to work on.  There are *many*
such projects in my mind, and a few in progress, and I don't seem to
be able/willing/happy to focus on one project for any
duration.</p>

<p>What kind of job is good for people with short attention
spans?  Answering that question could make zillions.</p></li>

<li><p>My collection of Rody horses and cowboys is down to 9 horses
and 2 cowboys.  1 horse should come back with Yasuko when I see her
again; she took it to Hong Kong during her business trip
there.</p></li>

<li><p>I was wondering what I want in a life situation.  I was
wondering about the different things I can do in life.  Like things
in general:</p>

<p><ul type="o">
<li>learn</li>
<li>teach</li>
<li>think</li>
<li>build</li>
<li>carry</li>
<li>relax</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So that's data into my brain; data out of my brain; data
manufactured in my brain; making things; moving things; and sitting on
things.</p>

<p>Everything else is just a variant. (except perhaps destroying
things but I couldn't think of a five letter version, and I don't want
to destroy things)</p></li>

<p>Where's Jackie Purdy?  She knows what I'm feeling now.  Lots o
people do, but she seems to be a lot lot lot like me.</p>

<li><p>physical, mental, emotional, spiritual... any others?</p></li>

<li><p>I just want to sleep.</p></li>

<li><p>There's got to be some ....</p></li>

<li><p class=date>8:06pm</p>

<p>I wrote the State of My Brain entry, and now I'm back to this
entry.  The point is that I want some kind of feedback about what is
the optimal thing to do.  My brain is toying around with free will
here, and so far, as before, I've come to the conclusion that free
will is exactly free will and there is no input, and there are no
consequences for our actions.  No ultimate burn-in-hell
consequences.  We just run around on earth doing things to ourselves
and each other and in the end, just sit back and laugh or cry about
it.  No problem.  No rejection by god.</p></li>

<li><p>Uh oh; I need to go back to the brain entry:</p></li>
</ol>
