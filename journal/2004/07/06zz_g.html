<p>Got upstairs and found a package in front of my door.  I assumed
from janette at first, but..  it's from my brother.  I haven't opened
it yet.  But he assured me I would like it and it will be useful.</p>

I need a romanji version of your snail mail.  My netscape isn't
displaying all the japanese chars correctly, and I can't figure out
how to increase the font size.  

Then you get your present, which you will love, and will be useful.
