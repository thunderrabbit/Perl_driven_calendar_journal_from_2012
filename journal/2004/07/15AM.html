<p>I've imported all the pics and videos from the Mt Fuji adventure.
I've not finished writing about the upward climb (though it's nearly
finished) and I have written almost none of the descent.  The video
that was taken at the top of the mountain is less than
publish-worthy, save that I told everyone (in my state of "everything
is funny" tiredness) that I would post it.  (video instead of photo
mode when Miyuki tried to take our picture)  Had I told everyone
to <em>wave</em> when I realized we had been on video mode, it would
be worthy of publication.</p>

<p>The "roll baby roll" video is definitely worthy of publishing.
But right now, I'm gonna get some foodage, and maybe buy a fan.</p>
