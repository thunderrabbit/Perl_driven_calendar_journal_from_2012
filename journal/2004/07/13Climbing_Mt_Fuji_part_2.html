<p class=date>2:36am JST Tuesday 13 July 2004</p>

<p>We woke up around 2:30, and I, for one, did *not* want to go back
out into that horrible wind.  It sounded like it could blow us off
the mountain after it froze us to ice cubes.</p>

<p>I strugglingly got out of bed, with cold aching joints.  Completely
dark so I fumbled about for my flashlight and used my hand to cover
most of its glow as I got my gear together and put my layers of
clothing on.</p>

<p>One thing was missing, though.  My walking staff.  Well,
not <em>missing</em>; I had really no idea where it had been moved,
and therefore no idea where to look.</p>

<p>I was really too cold to care though.  Too cold and too tired.
Sumidasan and Miyuki had gone outside; I headed out, as ready as I
could muster to engage the mountain again.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It was *foggy*.  Five feet of visibility.  I couldn't tell where
the trail began.  I had no idea where Sumida and Miyuki had gone.  I
assume they had headed up the mountain.  Fuck.  No time to waste;
gotta catch them.</p>

<p>I walked in the foggy darkness, which wasn't as cold as I had
imagined, but was windier than imagineable and somehow still
ridiculously foggy.  How can so much wind not blow away the fog?  This
fog is stronger than wind.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Slow count: one foot, two foot. One foot, two foot.  No stop.  One
foot, two foot.  One foot, two foot.  No stop.  One foot, one foot,
one foot, two foot. one. two. one. two. one. two.  Huge Wind: Walk
Stop.  crouch.  Stay on mountain.  Breathe.  Breath.  Wind finish.
Walk more.  One foot, two foot.  One foot, two foot.</p>

<p>Follow the rope.  Thank the rope.  One foot, two foot.  Thank the
rope maker.  One foot, two foot.  One foot, two foot.  Thank you,
rope.</p>

<p>Rope end.  Turn.  Find next rope.  One foot. two foot.  One foot,
two foot.  Rope.  Up up up.</p>

<p>walk</p>

<p>walk</p>

<p>walk</p>

<p>Stay on mountain.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Progressed continued in this manner of non-thinking meditative
state of just walking without stopping until the wind forced me to
focus only on balance.  Without the option of sitting down though; it
would be too hard to get up.  Just focus on walking, knowing the top
will come soon.</p>

<p>At one point, I did rest.  I turned around and tried to see how far
I had come.  I didn't see the glow of the cabin, but it was really
foggy so I didn't know if I had come a long way or not.  Then, wait: I
saw the lights of some climbers.  I wondered if it was Sumida and
Miyuki.  I shined and flashed my flashlight down at them to see if I
could attract their attention.  I saw three lights; three hikers.
Hmm; not them.  I turned back and pressed forward.  Can't let these
three hikers catch me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>They did catch me, though.  And it was Sumida and Miyuki.  I hadn't
remembered that Sumida had two flashlights.  One on a headband and one
carried.  "Rob?" Sumida called.  "はい" I answered back.  I
waited.</p>

<p>They arrived.</p>

<p>"ごめねさい" [I'm sorry]</p>

<p>"We were in the restroom."</p>

<p>Augh; what a dummy I had been.  Didn't even think of that option.
Of course they wouldn't leave without me.  <em>How tired must my brain
be?</em></p>

<p>We trudged forward, with me leading the way, somehow newly
energized enough to walk.</p>

<p>One foot, two foot.  One foots, two feets.  One feet, two foots.
One foots, two foots.  Stop walk.  Stay on mountain.  One foot, two
foots.  One foo, two foos.  Rope end.  Find next rope.</p>

<p>"はい。" I called back, meaning, [I've found the next rope.]</p>

<p>A couple rope ends later, I didn't find the next rope.</p>

<p>I walked where I thought the trail would be, but still couldn't
find the rope.</p>

<p>The wind had gotten even stronger; Sumida began to walk away from
where I thought the trail should be.  Like he was walking down the
mountain to re-discover the trail.  We decided to stop; it was too
dangerous to walk in the wind; we were slipping and didn't know where
to go.</p>

<p>I was happy to stop.  I had janette's quilt, and had found a comfy
pile of rocks to sleep on.  I had to be *really* careful to make sure
the quilt didn't blow away.  Losing the quilt was *not* an option.</p>

<p>After a while, I felt it my civic duty to tell Sumida that the fog
wasn't going to lift until after sunrise.  If we waited until
fogrise, we would be waiting until sunrise, first.</p>

<p>I got up, gripping janette's quilt and headed carefully down
unstable rocks to where Sumida and Miyuki had stopped.  I had left my
backpack (more importantly, my computer) where I had found the comfy
rocks.</p>

<p>He agreed with my assessment.  The sun would rise before the fog.
Fair enough.  I had done my civic duty and curled back up to go to
sleep.  The rocks were not as comfortable.</p>

<p>(( I had a guess that I had been on the trail.  My backpack would
tell us later. ))</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Then, I felt a new civic duty.   I had a warm blanket.  They must
be more freezing than me; I was feeling the cold, but not feeling the
wind.</p>

<p>I got up.  Walked around to behind Sumida and Miyuki and then sat
down in between them, with the blanket spread out over all three of
us.  The wind pinned it to our backs.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>I felt really good about my decision.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The sun began to come up.  Or the fog began to glow, but somehow
things were becoming more visible.  We didn't see the <em>sun
rise</em>, but just a slow change from blindness to sight.</p>

<p>Sumida declared it time to move on.</p>

<p>I agreed, though I would have more readily agreed with sleeping
until someone came to carry us up the hill.</p>

<p>We got up.  Got our stuff.  My backpack was on the trail.</p>

We're at the top of Mt Fuji, um, at five AM, we hit the
first sign that said we were at the top, but we had to walk up hill a
tiny bit more and then back down to..  not the other side, but to a
shop nearby that was open.  Um, bunch of other cats up here, same
time.  Japanese and Ameri, well, Japanese and English speaking.</p>

<p>And we are, well, we just took some pictures, and one was video;
it was great.</p>

<p>We're here up in the thing, and they wouldn't sell a dude hot
water, so we all chipped in from our own noodle bowls.  Craziness.</p>

<p>It's fucking cold.  I'm friends with Kana now, who just went
outside with no shoes!  Crazy!  It's freeeeezing..  The four kids are
asleep.  It's funny.</p>

<p>In the no-sleeping group photo above, Kana is on the right (to my
left) with white shirt and red sleeves.</p>


<p>I bought another hot ramen and shared it with Kana as thanks for
her speaking to me in Japanese.  Her boyfriend was asleep on the side
of the room with no blanket and wet clothes.  It's <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=5+C+in+F&btnG=Google+Search">5
degrees C</a> in this heated building.  He's the one they wouldn't
sell hot water to.  He had brought his own ramen.  What a nightmare.
C'mon Japanese systems.  Have some love for a fellow human.</p>
