<p>Last night I met Masashi for our biweekly lesson.  Hitomi went
with me to the station (on her way home), but Masashi invited her to
join us, so she did.</p>

<p>Everything seemed cool, though her addition caused a lot of
Japanese chatter, which arguably could be detrimental to his English
learning, but we had fun and stuff.</p>

<!-- Hitomi stayed over and we debated fucking or not fucking and
  ended up fucking cause she sure as heck wasn't sleeping; I kept
  falling asleep and she would wake me up "¿²¤¿¡©" (are you sleeping
  yet?) and I'd say yes and she'd start to play with me and talk, so I
  was like fuckit, and walked to 7-11 to get condoms and we fucked
  like hardcore. 

With her, I thought <em>I could marry this girl</em> and it felt
right, but it was in the middle of sex-thoughts so the thoughts were
well tainted with that.  Right now in awake reality, I'm like, "I
gotta rock on to elsewheres and if I still like Hitomi after all that,
then we've got something."

<p>Okay.  I'm going to take a shower and go back to the cafe where we
met last night, cause I think it will be a good place to study without
distractions.</p>

<p>But I've got almost no time before I need to leave to meet Miki at
noon in Kawasaki.  And then meet Tomoko, Sumida and Miyuki for dinner
at 5:30 in Shinbashi.</p>
