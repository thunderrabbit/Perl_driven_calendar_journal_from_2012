When I first heard about Pb from a friend of mine, I thought,
"wow!  teach English and see the world!"  But now, after having read
the website and promotional materials carefully, I see that there is
so much more to the experience.  I am thrilled to find that the work
of Pb closely aligns to what I want to do in my life.  I want
to do something positive for the world.

In January 1996, I began 5 years of volunteer work as a youth advisor
in Houston, Texas for YRUU (1).  This involved attending weekly
meetings at our church and encouraging extracurricular non-church
related activities to promote friendships across the city of Houston
(2).

We also attended weekend conferences/lockins about 6 or 8 times a
year.  Conference activities included four main components: Worship,
Education, Creativity and Social Action.  The social action events
varied greatly in complexity and scope.  Sometimes we simply picked up
litter around the neighborhood.  We sometimes made lunches and brought
them to neighborhood community centers and retirement homes.
Sometimes the social action was a lecture on subjects including civil
liberties and anti-racism.  We occasionally did more complex projects
like planting trees and helping to revitalize school playgrounds.  The
adult congregation of my church took part in a home rebuilding project
every year, helping poor families have better places to live.

One of the biggest long term social action projects has taken place
every year as part of the week long summer camp held in late July.
Hundreds of youth take busses to Ardmore, Oklahoma, a small town that
desires revitalization of its downtown area.  While I was in the
program, we cleared overgrown lots, removed debris from demolished
buildings, removed fallen trees, painted old and new construction.
This project has just taken place for the 6th consecutive year; I
don't yet know specifically how they helped the community this year,
but I'm glad to know the work continues.

In YRUU, while individual expressions were cherished, individuals were
encouraged to always keep the integrity of community in mind.  If a
youth broke a rule (3), the subsequent discussion focused on the
question, "how do our individual actions affect the community?" and
"how can we work together to resolve this conflict?" and "what can we
do in the future to help ensure this problem doesn't continue to
happen?"

YRUU also has a continental level organization.  At this level I
attended anti-racism conferences, and participated in design of Y*FUUD
(4), as part of Youth Council 2000?

During my time volunteering for YRUU at different levels of the
organization, I learned that our efforts make a difference and that
our efforts need to be repeated.  With the short age range of YRUU
(14-19 years), the turnover is quick; we would come to the same type
of problems each year and help the youth learn how to resolve their
own issues.

During my university days (5), I did various types of work for the
good of the community.  For a few semesters I compiled The Feel Good
Net (6), an attempt to spread smiles and happiness through the
internet.  I became involved with the Student Programming Board, and
created Recycling Day (7) as part of Homecoming 1995.  This brought me
into contact with the Environmental Awareness Group, which worked to
raise the university community's awareness of the value of recycling
and the natural environment.  Our efforts resulted in large recycling
bins being placed in all the buildings on campus (8).

In a glorious attempt at environmental preservation, we presented to
the president of the university an alternative plan to cutting down
some large oak trees to build a baseball field (9).  Our efforts
didn't stop the university, but we did raise individuals' awareness of
the issues.

In my last two years on campus, I was selected as a mentor for the new
Scholars' Community (10), a program designed to give commuter students
a better chance of success during their university careers.  As
mentors, our roles included teaching new students how to select and
register for classes, then during the semester, tutoring students in
various classes (my specialties were computer science and
mathematics), and organizing activities for the students to
participate and bond after school.

After graduation from university, I joined The Mankind Project (11), an
organization designed to change the world for the better, one man at a
time.  This non-denominational, non-partisan organization helps
individuals find their own inner truth, and how to express that truth
clearly to those around them. Through this organization, I began a
personal growth experience, learning how to understand myself and how
to express myself clearly and respectfully to those around me.  These
skills were also useful in conflict resolution, allowing me to see and
respect both sides of a conflict and to help resolve the conflict in a
pful manner.  I was able to use these conflict resolution skills
during my volunteer work with YRUU and in my professional workplace.

In my own small ways, I work toward a better environment.  I rarely
use escalators or elevators.  I don't smoke or drink alcohol.  I don't
use air conditioning (12), and I carried trash off Mt Fuji's Gotemba
trail in July 2004.

I moved to Japan so that I could begin exploring the world.  I look
forward to this chance to join Pb and do something positive and
helpful for the world.

I enjoy teaching.  I have been teaching various subjects since I was
in high school, teaching my brother how to do geometric proofs.  My
preferred style of teaching is one-to-one, so that I have a chance to
really understand what the student wants to learn, what the student
knows so far, and what methods work best for the student.  Everyone
learns differently and has their own preferences for classroom styles.
I like to help students learn in their preferred style.

I encourage students to write a diary in their target language.  I'm
glad to see the GET program does as well.

I worked at Nova for 12 months after my arrival in Japan.  I now work
at Gaba (13) because the classes are one-to-one.  On Pb, I
understand I will have as many as 8 students per class.  Because they
will be the same students each day for 90-some days, I will be able to
understand what is in each student's mind, and what each student wants
to learn.  We will have a great time.

	I look forward to serving

(2) HACYAC is Houston Area Churches Youth-Adult Committee, which
    fostered connections between individuals and between YRUU groups
    across the city of Houston.

(3) There were four rules at the conferences (not including logistical
    rules of a particular church), which were summarized briefly as
    follows: no sex, no drugs/alcohol, no violence, yes respect.
    These simple rules allowed the individuals to flourish within the
    community.  The community was so empowering that the youths strove
    to preserve it, self-enforcing each other against any rule
    violations.

(4) Y*FUUD is Youth Funding for Unitarian Universalist Development, a
    scholarship fund that intended to allow individual youth groups
    access to funds to create their own activities.  I specifically
    mention this because our vision required that the individual
    activities be self-sustaining.  The application form required the
    group have an idea how their activity would fund itself after its
    inception.
