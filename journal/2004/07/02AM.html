<p>I said to myself, "self, if someone emails my cellphone before 8am,
I'm going to wake up at go jog."</p>

<p>janette emailed me.  (She's getting her nose pierced!)</p>

Carla!

1) In my quest to increase my genkinicity, I've considered what you
said about jogging in the mornings.

I haven't gone yet, and I'm not really sure I believe it can work for
me, but(!) today is the big day.  I'm going to walk briskly at first,
just to get started.

2) I bought some hiking boots to go climb Mt Fuji on 12-13 July.  12 =
up, 13 = down.  The only boots that were big enough for my monster
feet?  Columbia Sportswear.

I hope you're well.

      Hugs and Love
      - ROB!

<p>Well, that was sortakinda fun.  I found the park that people have
talked about.. oh, Tom came out just as I started my brisk walk, and
he started to run after me, and I was like, "are you late?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm just jogging merrily," but he was more <em>running</em> to
the station, and would have thoroughly beat me there except he stopped
to tie his shoe.  He missed a train by like 15 seconds.
Nightmare.</p>

<p>I found the park and climbed on some of the equipment and then half
walked half jogged back.  A bit light headed, a bit hungry..  gotta
work out the parameters of this jogging thing.  I cooked and ate two
eggs and spinach and cheese after my adventure and chowed them.</p>

<p>Gotta head out to Japanese class now.  I'm definitely more sweaty,
and I might be more awake, but there's still some hunger; it's
interesting to see the effects this jog has had on me.</p>
