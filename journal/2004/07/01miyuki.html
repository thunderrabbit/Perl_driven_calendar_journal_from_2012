<p>Just met Sumidasan and Tomoko and Tomoko's friend Miyuki who wants
to climb Fuji with us (us = Sumida and me).  Tonight she was really
shy and barely willing to speak to me, much less speak English to me,
though they report she was tested into Nova at 7A.  In Japanese I was
like, "why don't you speak English?" and I meant it in a cheerifying
way, but I didn't realize until later that she hasn't started
attending classes yet, so she has not really started speaking English,
so I tried to take it back while we were on the train together from
Shinagawa to Shibuya.</p>

<p>During the train ride (no longer under the pressure of her far more
English-confident friends), she spoke a bit of English, but still we
primarily used Japanese to communicate.  Found out that this will also
be her first time to climb Fuji, that she lives in Shinjuku and she's
going to hang out with her family tonight.</p>

<p>Tomoko had introduced her as Hemichan (maybe), but her real name is
Miyuki, so she (, after some consideration,) asked me to call her
Miyuki.</p>
