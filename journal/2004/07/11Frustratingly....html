<p>Today, after leaving her phone in my room, she was like, "I left my
phone in your room," and seems to have chosen not to go get it during
the day today (she knows where the key is) but instead to meet me
there tonight.  Doesn't a brotha want to have their cell phone during
the day, especially on their day off from work?  I can't really
understand.</p>
