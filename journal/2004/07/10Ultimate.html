<p>I'm in ø∑¥›ª“ to meet À”§µ§Û for a little fris, but it's raining.
So it seems we won't be playing ultimate today.  Maybe another
time.  <em>this</em> time has been a long time in planning; I wonder
how long next time will take.  Oh- I know why; it took me getting off
early on a Saturday for us to hang out during daylight.</p>

<p>Wow; it seems to have quit raining; I wonder if she got my message
saying don't worry about changing clothes (from work clothes to
ultimate clothes), and whether or not she did, if she changed.</p>

<p>Yes that was Mutsumi, and though it was sprinkling, we went to
Tamagawa to play disc.  She was a messs at first, but quickly got
better to the point that we were throwing 20 and 40 tosses without
dropping.  She did quite well considering how much wind there was.  I
enjoyed just playing disc for the first time since I've been here.
She was smiling bigtime as well, and that helped me enjoy playing
more.  I got tired first, I think, but kept on tossing cause she was
having so much fun.  Then I realized that I was tired partly because
my feet were hot, so I took of my shoes (which were pretty soggy from
the rain) and that helped me lost myself in the moment again.</p>

<p>A dude with a digital video camera was photographing the sunset
near us for a while; we wondered why he was doing that; it wasn't a
surprising sunset, but, like most sunsets, it was pretty.</p>

<p>We played until the sun set, and then walked to Shin Maruko in
search of takoyaki.  I got a bit lost on the way to the station; silly
angled streets in Tokyo, but pretty soon recovered my way and made it
back to Shin Maruko (we had walked so far that I wanted it to be
Musashi-Kosugi, but alas..) Outside many stations is a takoyaki cart
vendor, but not Shin Maruko tonight.  So we took the train to
Musashi-Kosugi and chowed 10 takoyaki each.</p>
