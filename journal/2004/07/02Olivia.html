<p>Just before I left for work, Olivia arrived at my room, looking for
shelter and a shower after 3 days with neither. Wow.  When I hugged
her, she was like "I showered or changed in 3 days."  I was like,
"well I haven't either so don't worry about it."</p>

<p>Except I was lying and she wasn't.</p>

<p>I encouraged her to write her story; it's pretty interesting.  She
was abused by the boy she was nannying and the mom wouldn't help and
when she could take no more (Olivia); she ran to the city and found
the next bus left in 2 hours.  Ran back up the hill and took the bus,
14 hours of bussing fun to Istanbul.</p>

<p>16 hours in some airport, and then 6 hours somewhere else, and she
just arrived in Tokyo an hour ago.</p>

<p>Jen is out and about being crazy busy with her uni exam, work and
private students and the pain of boyfriend breaking up with her.  What
a soap opera!</p>
