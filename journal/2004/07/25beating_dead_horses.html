<p>So what the above entry means is this: the girl showed up
unexpected at my room after we talked for nearly 2 hours on the phone
with me repeatedly telling her we shouldn't have so much sex if we
want any possibility of a long term friendship, and she repeatedly
saying she understands but she still wants to see me.  This is sex and
love addictions combined and it's nothing but trouble in the long
run.</p>

<p>Banged in the morning and it was fun, but not conducive to being
just friends.</p>
