<p>I cooked eggs this morning; four eggs with 10 yen worth of
mushrooms and a decent pile of spinach.  In a way, it looks like a
giant greened splot of vomit.  Delicious!</p>

<p>I've been reciting Eminem's "Business" lyrics in my head after we
didn't go to karaoke the other night.  Next time we go (if it's soon),
I'll be better able to utter all those wack syllables.</p>

<p>My first lesson is at 10:45 today.  Today should go by fairly
easily save for that other job thing.  To the best of my ability I
blessed the situation and have (apparently not) released it.</p>
