Good job, Apple, for attracting customers with premium products and
keeping them happy.

After years with Windows, I got sick of it at Windows 98 and switched
to Red Hat Linux 5.0.  I chose not to learn how to keep my machine up
to date, and was still using 5.0 when Red Hat had moved on to Red Hat
8.0 and beyond.

Apple and Macintosh had never really attracted me.  I remembered my
friend's clunky Mac from college days.  They loved it, but I wasn't
swayed.

Then, one day, in a great glorious moment, I learned that OS X had
unix underneath.  Unix equals all my favorite utilities.  Apple equals
easy.  Unix + easy = OS X?  Wow.  I read lots of articles, all of
which hailed the awesomeness of OS X.  I was ready to switch.  I did
research and bought a PowerBook G4 30 667MHz, 30 Gig, 256 Meg ram,
plus a 100 meg firewire Firefly(? (I don't really use it anymore))
external hard drive.  I have never been happier with a computer.

I have never been less kind to a computer, either.  This machine has,
while operating, fallen 4.5 feet onto the (carpeted) floor. I freaked,
but it didn't.  It continued operating.

I bought the machine in Houston, Texas.  I live in Japan now.  Did I
have to change the power supply?  No.  Did I have to reinstall
anything when I started writing in Japanese?  No.  Did I have to
configure anything to get the wireless card to work with my wireless
Yahoo!BB signal?  No.  It all just worked.  Beautifully.

This machine, has, while operating, been crunched in the train doors
of the Tokyu Toyoko line.  It kept operating, but one of the hinges
broke.  I kept using it for a while until the other hinge succumbed to
the extra strain.  For some reason (joke) my warranty didn't cover the
damage.

I got it repaired and it was like having a whole new computer again.

Last summer, the logic board was replaced (covered by Applecare) after
my screen failed (or something).  This summer, the same thing
happened, and Applecare covered it again.

BUT, all of that is not why I'm writing.

In the past 8 months, I have secured for apple two happy Apple users.
These users keep their iBooks in protective cases, and don't throw
them around like I do mine.  They are both really happy with their
computers, and I was able to train (across the English Japanese
language barrier) one of them how to use hers.  The other guy (my
roommate) even being a non-geek, understood his immediately and was
even downloading internet signal searching utilities that I hadn't
even heard of.

Okay, so this happy user ==> 2 new happy users.  Good job, guys.

But THAT'S not all!!

Today, when I picked up my computer after its fried brain was replace
under Applecare, it was noted that the power connection in the back
was faulty.  It was replaced in two hours.  Absolutely fantastic!!!
Thank you guys so much so much so much for being so awesome!!  I
continue to be a realllly happy Apple user, and will continue to
promote apple and all its awesomeness to anyone who seems interested
in buying a computer.

Get an Apple.  They are more expensive and they are worth it.
