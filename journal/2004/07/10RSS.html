<p>Wow.  So I'm a bit behind the times, but I've just read about RSS
for getting my site syndicated.  It looks way easy in concept, but
might be a trick for me to set up an automagic way for perl to
maintain the feed's items file, and to ping (if necessary?) the
different feed readers.</p>

<p>So, ..  I'm wondering wbout the best way to store my ..  I could
just advertise using my existing format, and not worry about setting
up titles (more than the filename) nor descriptions.  All that shit
can be added later once I have an idea of how I'd like to do it.</p>

<p>I have an existing structure; I can just tack an rss descriptor
file to my site and have it point to the most recent entries.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Man I hate people smoking near me..</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've wanted to sorta have different indexes for my site and allow
people to search for different types of entries, etc.  Like, if it's
all indexed in a db, I can sort stuff by date, or by type of file or
whatever criteria (of course).. hey is that mutsumi?</p>
