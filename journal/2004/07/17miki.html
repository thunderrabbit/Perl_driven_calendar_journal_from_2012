<p>Called Miki; will hang out with her tonight after our respective
jobs finish.</p>

<p class=date>10:46pm</p>

<p>Hanging out with Miki was fun; we chatted and munched at Doutour
in Motosumiyoshi (on the other side of the tracks); I told her
Olivia's story from Turkey and Miki told me about her adventures in
teaching and not going to Nova.  She asked a couple of English
questions which I was happy to answer.</p>

<p>Walked her to the bus stop and blew a smooch to her as she got on
the bus.</p>

<p>We'll hang out at her place on 22nd so she can learn how to do
email online.</p>
