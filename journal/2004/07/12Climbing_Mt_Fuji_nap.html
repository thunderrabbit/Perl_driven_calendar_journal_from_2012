<p class=date>8:30pm-ish JST Monday 12 July 2004</p>

<p>Around 8:30 I tried to sleep.  Even though I was tired, I didn't
sleep well with the wind going on outside, and TV and people going on
inside.  The TV went to bed around 10 or 11pm I'm guessing.  At 12:30
ish, I woke up and whispered this into my tape recorder:</p>

<pre>
12:38am

I am in great pain, and I do not want to get up in two hours.

I also have not slept very well.

<p>I slept pretty well after that, but 2:30am came too quickly for
my liking.</p>
