<p>Stupid fucking Japanese systems.</p>

<p>I have a three month pass to ride the train.  So that they can keep
tabs on me, or so that someone can return the card if I lose it, I was
requested to enter my name on computer to get the card.</p>

<p>The card lasted 3 months and expired yesterday.</p>

<p>Today, I asked the dude if I could renew it, and he's like, [yeah
at machine 5 or 6.]</p>

<p>Great.  I was actually surprised that I'd be able to at my small
station.</p>

<p>But, when I entered the card, though the machine knew my name and
phone number, I was asked to enter my birthdate *and* my zip code!!
Why??  It's encoded on the card I had just inserted.  Is it some form
of fucked up security?  "A criminal won't know the birthdate and
zipcode that the previous cardholder entered." </p>

<p>So what?  The card is *expired*!!  Who fucking cares if a criminal
wants to pay money and use a new card with the wrong name?  It's not
like anyone ever checks to see who's using whose card. (*)</p>

<p>It's not like someone would ask for a form of ID and accept my
train card.  Fuckin' A.</p>

<p>(*) correct whose? who's? hoos? hues?</p>
