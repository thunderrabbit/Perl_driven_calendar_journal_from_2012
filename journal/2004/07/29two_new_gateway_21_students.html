<p class=note>(written on Hitomi's computer with her weird Japanese keyboard)</p>

<p>Today at Gateway 21 I met with two new students whose names I've
forgotten; my brain is tired.  I have their names written down, so
don't worry.  The first was a woman who will go in a month to Sydney
for a year, the first month of which will be with a host family, and
the subsequent months will be in a shared house type thing.  She was
quite untalkative even when I was like, ask me a question, but
overall, I survived the lesson without falling asleep.</p>

<p>The second student was much more talkative, and I nearly made it
two hours with him before I suddenly got tired, and was like, "tell me
something interesting" and we finished out the last ten minutes
talking about family and sports.</p>

<p>I'm on the train to Shibuya now; will be home soon and might have
enough brain activity left to type my two example lessons.</p>
