<p>Today is the big day.  This morning on the way to class I picked up
the train cards that I had custom made from a photo of Dan standing
with mannequins at a clothing store, and a photo of me wearing Dumbo
ears at Disneyland.</p>

<p>Dan collects train cards, but I don't think he knows that we can
make arbitrary photos into train cards.  I wonder if they would allow
naked train cards or slanderous cards to be made?</p>

<p>I've got "approximately 8.2 thousand train cards" for Dan (to
which he'll reply, "ah, wait, I've just counted, and I have just over
11 million train cards," and then I'll say, "oh, but these are just
the ones I've collected for you this morning.  I have the rest in a
warehouse in the Port of Tokyo.") and I've kept forgetting (honestly)
to grab them from a little paperclip hook above my door each time I
head out to hang out with Dan.</p>

<p>I can't forget today!!!</p>

<p>Now: I'm not sure if it will be cooler to have his train card in
the very back of the pile, or mixed in the middle of the pile as if
it's not a big deal.  I've got nothing that trumps this card, so I
can't pretend like there's something cooler coming.  So, I'm not sure
on this one.  We'll see what happens.</p>

<p>ps: right now I'm at the govt office where I'll pick up my visa so
I'll be legal again.  My visa has officially expired, but the new one
was available before I was illegal; I just didn't pick it up in
time.  I hope it will be no problemo.</p>
