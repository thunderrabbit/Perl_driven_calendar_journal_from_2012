<p>On my way to work, I saw Miki on her way to work in Motosumiyoshi.
I asked if she wanted to hang with me on Saturday, but she won't be
working in Motosumiyoshi this Saturday, so .. no; we won't hang out.
Ah well.</p>

<p>I was pretty silly at work today; didn't really get into teaching
the book, so was happy to have students who equally didn't want to use
the books.  First student was new to me; she's a university student
and has pretty high level grammar awareness, but just doesn't speak up
enough to practice her English skills.  She is also learning Chinese,
which I think is pretty cool.  I asked her about her dreams and she
said she wanted to go to Iceland.  So I googled iceland japanese
exchange and found a site with people from Iceland looking for
Japanese exchange partners.  Put the link through notlong.com and into
her record.  Should have named the ____ something memorable; I can't
think of it now, and she won't likely choose to memorize it.  Ah well;
next time I will.</p>
