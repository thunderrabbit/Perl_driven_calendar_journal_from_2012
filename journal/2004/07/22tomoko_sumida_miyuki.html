<p>Hung out with Teddy Bear Tomoko, Miyuki and Sumidasan tonight,
starting at a Mexican/American/Japanese restaurant, where we
(eventually) told Tomoko about our Mt Fuji adventure, and then moving
to Starbucks (not Karaoke, as Miyuki wasn't in a singing mood) where I
was completely blessed by all three of them as they suggested ways I
could start my own business here in Japan.  They heaped praise on my
teaching techniques, my writing style, and my self confidence in
general that maybe I can do something cool and interesting in the
world.</p>

<p>During the evening, I basically re-calculated the idea that has
been implemented in Houston: Leisure Learning Unlimited, and asked if
the concept exists in Japan.  (yes)</p>

<p>Though it already exists, I now know my brain can come up with cool
ideas.  I put a bookmark on the technique of the thought process that
I used, not just a bookmark on the idea itself.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>overall, big fun.</p>
