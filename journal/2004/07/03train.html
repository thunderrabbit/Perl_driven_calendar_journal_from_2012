<p>RAN from Toyoko line to Nambu line.  <em>just</em> missed the
train by like 8 seconds.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>'sides that, I had just missed the previous Toyoko train by like 10
seconds, which has just piled up as lots of time spent waiting in the
stations.</p>

<p>It was fun to run through the station, though.  I ran down the
steps faster than a dude ran down the escalator.  And then I ran up
the next steps faster than the next dude ran up them.  Zing!</p>
