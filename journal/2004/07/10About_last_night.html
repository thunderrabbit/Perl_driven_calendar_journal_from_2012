<p>Talked to À” about playing frisbee today; we'll meet at ø∑¥›ª“±ÿand
walk to the river, assuming it's not raining, which the weather says
it might.  She suggested that I make a little ghost-type doll out of
paper to request it not rain.  I don't know if it will work, but I
made a ghost-shape out of two kleenexes last night before bed.</p>

<p>After arriving home from work, I chatted with Olivia some, looking
at pictures with her, finding our favorites from past zaniness so I
can compile an album of sorts.</p>

<p>I resisted watching Bruce Almighty, a movie that I rather enjoyed
when I watched it in the theater, but instead took a shower and went
to bed.</p>

<p>I successfully stayed cool last night by leaving my door open
instead of running my air conditioner.  I haven't run it since I moved
into this apartment.  In fact, last night, my electricity was switched
off at the meter.</p>

<p>This morning I'm going to Jen's uncle's work instead of Gaba.</p>
