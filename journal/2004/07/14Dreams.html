<p class=dream>Back at FSD, trying to get things set up so I could do
some more effective work.  Put my keyboard tray this way instead of
that way, not wander the halls aimlessly, but think of good ideas and
implement them.</p>

<p class=dream>Found my old safe that I had as a kid.  Inside were
notes written to my dad, some of which referred to a savings account
I had started with, apparently, thousands of dollars inside.  Two of
the notes I had written made reference to this account.  I had no
memory of actually opening such an account, and was sad to note that
some of the pieces of paper no longer "said" anything; the ink had
evaporated.  I considered techniques for seeking the grooves in the
paper where the ink had been written, but wondered if the humidity
had faded the grooves as well.</p>
