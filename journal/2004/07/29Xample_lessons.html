<p>50 minute high level lesson:</p>

<pre>
[Chairs facing in a circle]

Intro:  Each person in the circle, please say your name and two words
that describe how you are feeling now.

Now separate yourselves according to who went to which workshops/activities/lectures

Please find a partner who went to a lecture or activity that you did
not attend.

Take turns: each person spend 5 minutes summarizing the lecture or
activity.  Those who are listening should take notes and ask
clarifying questions.  Must talk for five minutes.

Now rejoin the group, or get into two groups of four.

0) Which lecture/activity/workshop introduced the most controversial
subject?

1) Have you seen any examples of what was discussed in the media?

2) Have you been victim to or perpetrator of these types of activities?

3) What actions can we take to help this situation?

For bwork (homework):  Please look for an article that talks about
this type of situation and bring it in to class tomorrow.

end: please look over the schedule and plan who will go to which
lectures tomorrow (next few days).  Hopefully we can have
representatives at each lecture.

<p>Beginner level:</p>

<pre>
Chairs in a circle:

Each person in the circle please say your name and your favorite (type
of) [INSTRUCTOR'S CHOICE: animal, food, pizza, ice cream, music,
sport, place to live]

(instructor takes notes to remember all favorites) 

Please listen and repeat:
(first student) "I want to __(verb) (favorite)__.  Will you _____ with me?"
e.g. student's choice was elephants: "I want to watch elephants.  Will you watch with me?"

(next student) "Yes I will."

Go around the circle having each student invite the next student to
do/see/visit their favorite.

Once everyone is comfortable with that, add the meeting location:

(first student) "I want to watch elephants.  Will you watch with me?"

(next student) "Yes I will."

(first student) "Let's meet at the ________."

(next student) "Okay."  (If the students are comfortable, add "what time?")

(first student) "Let's meet at 2pm."

(next student) "That sounds great!"

This can be expanded to conflicting schedules for meeting times, or
big expansion if we must give directions to the meeting place.

<p>non class activities that we can do:</p>

<pre>
Captain Video: (visual game of telephone) one person shows one other
               person an action exactly one time.  The other person
               tries to repeat the same action exactly once for the
               next person.  This repeats (and the action transforms)
               until everyone has been taught "the" (an) action.  Then
               the original action (first person) and the last person
               perform the action together.

"Nisasa": (Reverse Assassin) teach a new word or song or game or dance
          or handshake to two people and have them do the same until
          everyone knows the new thing

           scenes (cooks, cleaning crew, captain and crew)

Astronomy nights: learn about our universe

                  done/seen/eaten/visited/met someone/something really

Scavenger hunt: (with themes) "things we realize we don't need
                anymore" or "gifts to the community"

Trash art: make art out of things that would otherwise have been
