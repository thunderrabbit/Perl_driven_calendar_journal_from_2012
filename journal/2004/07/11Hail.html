<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Big inch-size hail balls fell for a bit; most of them were
centimeter sized.  [CLINK] [TOK] [CLOK] on the car hood, windshield,
and roof as it crept slowly next to me.  Each thunk easily 5000 yen to
repair.  Yeouch.</p>

<p>Looking up at the sky, I could easily see the hail falling and
tried to catch some, like in an awesome 3D video game.  I bent down to
pick up a larger piece from the ground, with ideas of romancing #10120
with it, but I ended up just eating it cause, well, cause I didn't
think she'd understand what I was trying to say, and it was too
delicious of an opportunity to pass up.</p>

<p>I didn't see her at the windows anyway, and on the way back, I
nearly sprinted to the door past the throngs of people who, for some
reason, did *not* (???) want to be in the hailstorm, so I could
gleefully sprint and slide along the pavement for near 15 feet at a
time.  Fun fun FUN!!</p>

<p>This is a storm worthy of Houston.  Good work, Tokyo.  Finally,
after 16 months here, a decent storm.</p>
