<p>It's almost 4:30 and I'm on my third no show today, which is nice,
to be sure, but dammit if I wouldn't be DONE in 30 minutes at Jen's
uncle's job, were I to be working there right about now.</p>

<p>Reallllly fun lesson with Sawako.  Wanted to merge with her.
Thrilled that she chose my 7pm lesson tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bought dried ume boshi for Sawako cause she said yesterday it's her
favorite snack.  It's my gift to her for choosing my lesson.</p>
