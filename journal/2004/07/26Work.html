<p>Jen thinks I'll be able to work for her uncle in September.</p>

<p>In the past two days, I have gotten 2 new students (3 consecutive
hours per week) via Gateway 21, at 2500 yen per hour plus travel
expenses from <em>each</em> student.  So I get double travel
reimbursement.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Gaba was aight tonight.  Saw Miyuki (not the same Miyuki with whom
I climbed Fuji (fuck, I still gotta get that entry completed, but with
the girl here, I am distracted) two weeks ago) but she didn't have my
class.  It's okay though; it was a red booking (she didn't choose her
instructor).  (didn't <em>not</em> choose me.)</p>

<p>I rearranged a few braincells for a few students today.  Taught a
student how not to say "I like the area because there is my favorite
hotel," but instead "I like the area because my favorite hotel is
there," [ After some consideration, I realized he was using "there is"
to mean あそこ as opposed to ある, which are the different meanings of
"there is" and "is there" in the sentences above. ]</p>
