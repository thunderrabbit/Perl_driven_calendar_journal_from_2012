<p>At work; 11 minutes left in lunch.  First four lessons were 1/2
boring and half exciting.</p>

<p>I wrote a postcard to ¤Ê¤ª¤³ who was super genki.</p>

<p>Yay Junko!  Yay Yuki Suzuki!  Yay for homework-doing students!</p>

<p>Hitomi got a level up today!</p>

<p>I have three more lessons today.</p>

<p>Sweet.  I got another evaluation today, but it wasn't a 5-5.  4-4
from Naotoshi who only takes my classes (at least for the last 2
weeks) but still only gives me 4-4.  What is that about?  Doesn't "my
favorite instructor" qualify for "best instructor"?</p>

<p>I showed Hiromi how to provide feedback; it was like she didn't
know.  Wow.  Today we talked about wrestling and she was just amazed
at the idea of wrestling for fun.  I pulled up pictures on google
images "wrestling" and on the first page there are two girls fully
clothed wrestling on the bed.  She was like, "is it professional?"
"does it hurt?"  "does everyone do it?"</p>

<p>I was like, "no, not really, and I don't know," but mostly I was
just amazed that it could be such a foreign idea.  She was quite
adverse to the idea of being hurt.  I tried briefly to explain the
idea of a safeword to her, and I think she got it, but not 100%.</p>
