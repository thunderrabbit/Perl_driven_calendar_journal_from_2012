<p class=date>9:11am JST Saturday 10 July 2004</p>

<p>I'm at Jen's uncle's work now, getting everything set up for the
day.  I arrived a bit early (and took a nap against the wall), and
they arrived a bit late (after having eaten breakfast at Mackers).</p>

<p>I've just remembered I had a dream where I couldn't turn the volume
down on my computer.  Each time I turned it off, it wouldn't be off;
like its state (off/on) wasn't correctly indicated by its
indicator.</p>
