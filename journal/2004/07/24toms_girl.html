<p>The woman who came in with Tom is <em>beautiful</em>.  Wow.</p>

<p>I think I met her earlier in the day as Naz's sister Kuri.  But, I
further think Tom met her at the same time.  Lots of envy if they
spent the day together and are this close so fast.</p>

<p>But: I know the feeling on the other side of a speedball
relationship.  Crash!</p>
