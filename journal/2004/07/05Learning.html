<p>It seems clear to me that when I don't get stuff done because of
the pursuit of sex, I'm least impressed with myself.</p>

<p>Last night I had a dream about a cool project to work on.  I can't
remember what it was.  Well, I can, I'm sure, if  I try.</p>

<p>Wow I'm in a bad mood.</p>

<p>It's something like I'm not doing what I think I am built to do
(again) and I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do.  Fuck.
Fuckin' around with fucking recently has fucking got me off fucking
track into fucking oblivion.</p>

<p>Or something like that. And now I'm supposed to go to Tokyo
Disneyland and how can it seem like I don't have time go go?  Because
I haven't been taking care of what I need to do.  TDL will be funner
than anything I think, and maybe even Space Mountin will be available
for riding.  There's really only four rides I want to tride.  Thunder
whatsitcalled, Big Thunder Mountain, the water ride nearby, and Space
Mountain and the 3D dog movie.   Damn; even Disneyland can't get me
excited.</p>

<p>Right now I hate Japan and all its robot seeming citizens not
doing anytihg but pokerface all the time.  Where's the joy in life?</p>

<p>I just found out that Joe surfer has a desire to make a B&B in
Hawaii.  Suweeeet.</p>

<p>I'm off to work, into which I pur my heart and get nothing in
return.  That's what it seems like now.  Plus, even though it's cool
that I can read the difference between cream bread and curry bread
(<em>very</em> different flavors) that happiness of being able to
read (and type without looking (woman next to me is looking at my
screen and I assume, wondering how I'm typing or wtf I'm doing) oops
lost track..  even though I can read some japanese, I'm not happy
about it because I bought cream bread instead of a corn dog (they
call it Amercan dog) which was almost certainly less healthy for me.
Ah well, fuckit.  the cream was yummy.</p>

<p>Work time now.</p>
