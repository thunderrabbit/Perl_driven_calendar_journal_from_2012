<p>Richard's friend Joe from Hawaii just got a cellphone yesterday. I
got his number (actually he asked for mine first; I shoulda thought
that with a new phone he would likely want to collect numbers asap)
and he told me his upcoming plans which include setting up home base
in Kamakura for the local surfing options available there. He invited
me to come down there and hit the waves with him. Calder's wish may
come true soon. I think I'll try surfing.</p>

<p>Ah - I just realized something about google's adwords. It seems
likely that the first time they see a new page that has goodle adwords
adspace on it, that they crawl the page for content and decide what
keywords to key on and therefore what ads to serve.  On a particular
day (particular URL), if I post a small entry first and then post
subsequent entries, they won't likely crawl the page again
immediately, so the initial small entry that may not have been worthy
of any ads will make the page end up with no ads even if the
subsequent content would trigger ads.</p>
