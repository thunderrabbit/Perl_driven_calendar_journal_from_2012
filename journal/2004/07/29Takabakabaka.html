<p class=note>(written on Hitomi's computer with her weird Japanese
keyboard)</p>

<p>Going to Takananobaba, a station that I think is on the yamanote
line north of Shinjuku, so I can turn in my Pb application.
I'm really glad to have it finished, and I look forward to serving on
the ship.  It will be big good stuff for all involved.</p>

<p>on the train now; naptime.</p>

<p>Woah!  Just met some of the peeps behind the scenes here at
Pb; chatted mostly with Audrey who accepted my application and
helped print my resume and all that;  everyone seems really cool and genki
and they all seem to be bonded and focused working on this cool
project together.  Wowowowo I'm really excited!!</p>

<p>Turns out I didn't get the full application when it was printed for
me a few days ago, so I didn't have everything, nor really follow the
directions for the application (I wrote more than the recommended
cover letter length, and my resume exceeds recommended length), but
Audrey was quite accomodating and wrote a note saying, "we messed up
his application" etc so it will be all good.  I need to write a few
more things and I'll email them to her soooooon.</p>
