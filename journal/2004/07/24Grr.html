<p>First student was okay; I tried to keep a positive outlook.
Second student has been a no-show for the first 30 of 40 minutes; I
doubt I'll see him.  Simon is currently teaching <a

this model</a>, who I've taught one time before (but didn't know at
that time she was modeling.)</p>

<p>During the previous lesson, my student was like, "what kind of
music do you like?"</p>

<p>I go, "hip hop and Irish folk music," trying to make Simon
laugh.</p>

<p>Later my student was like, "who is your favorite singer?"</p>

<p>"Shamus O'Flanigan, the Irish hip hop rapper."  Simon laughed.</p>

<p>"Is he so famous?"</p>

<p>"No, he's not so famous."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So why is my entry titled grr?</p>

<p>I don't know.  I just feel poopy and I hate Japan and want to
leave.  My mood is hugely affected by the genkiness of my
students.</p>

<p>I gotta work on a project of my own.</p>
