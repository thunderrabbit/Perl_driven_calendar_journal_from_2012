<p>Work has been cool so far.  Three students; two more to go.  First
two students chose me and the next one gave me a 5-5.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I got two 5-5s today!  Whooooo!</p>

<p>I had a discussion with Simon who said that I take teaching way
more seriously than he does.  I was interested to hear that; I can't
really imagine not being serious about teaching.  Part of my argument
is that I want to scare away the non serious students who don't study;
teaching lumps is agonizing for me.</p>

<p>Kozue was my last student; we scoped her diary and I noted that
her spelling is getting better and her sentence structures are
getting more complicated.  I informed her of both these points, and
gave her a raving commentary in the Every Lesson field and Today's
Lesson field of her profile.</p>

<p>I had Kumiko today; she loves the movie Finding Nemo, and has been
using it to study.  I explained the humor in two of Nemo's dad's
lines: "That snail was about to charge!" and "You're letting them go
to the drop off?  Why don't you just fry them up and serve them with
chips?"</p>

<p>She gave me one of my 5-5s.  :-) I love happy students in fun
lessons.</p>
