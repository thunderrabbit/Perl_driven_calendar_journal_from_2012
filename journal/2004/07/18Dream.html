<p class=date>7:48am JST Sunday 18 July 2004</p>

<p class=dream>My dad was sleeping in the cab of the 18 wheeler he
had been driving.  He was parked in a parking lot by some train
tracks, and I was awake.  I noticed an earthquake occurring and some
ways away was a bridge undulating and subsequently being destroyed.
I had my camera and got some great pictures of it.</p>

<p class=dream>The earthquake continued to approach, and I ran back
to the cab of the truck to grab my backpack, since it had my computer
and would thereby allow me to upload my pictures.</p>

<p class=dream>I took more pictures of some nearby buildings that were
not yet destroyed.  I considered climbing a tree if the earthquake got
any closer, but it stopped.</p>

<p class=dream>Trains in the train yard subsequently started to roll
out, and I therefore had no way to get back to my dad, whose truck was
now way down below me.  I started to whistle as shrilly as possible
and got his attention.  He was still quite sleepy and not able to tell
where the sound was coming from (somewhat above him, which wouldn't
necessarily be normal).  He spotted me after a bit and began to drive
my direction, but he was falling asleep as he drove slowly my
direction.  I woke up when he arrived.</p>
