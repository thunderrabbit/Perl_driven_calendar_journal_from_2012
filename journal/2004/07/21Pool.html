<p>The pool with Shoko was fun.  She's really cute and nice, so I was
glad to get to be friends with her.</p>

<p>The pool, near the station south of Kikuna on Toyoko line, is cool
because it's a ring shaped flowing water pool, like a river.  We can
just laze around, revolving slowly around the lap pool in the middle,
or do more energetic things like tread water while revolving, or try
to walk or swim against the current at the 5 or 6 water jet points
that keep the whole thing moving.</p>

<p>I immediately got some fans when we were there; some kids were
like, "hello!"  "hello!" and one told me his name was Brian, and then
they would whisper in Japanese and then talk to me again or give me
high fives or underwater fives; it was fun.</p>

<p>The boys left and I got two girlfriends soon thereafter.  They were
like [he's so cool!] in Japanese, and then kinda yelped when I asked
them in Japanese if they could speak English.  They broke up with me
when they learned my age.  Gosh.</p>

<p>The pool is pay-by-the-hour, and though Shoko was 3 minutes late
leaving, they let her out without paying for an extra hour.  Whew.</p>

<p>Ate some chicken nuggets from a street vendor for 100 yen.</p>

<p>She showed me a far less expensive grocery store in Motosumiyoshi.
I bought several meals worth of food for 600 yen.</p>
