<p>Today Hitomi and I are going to Tokyo Disneyland!  I'm pretty
excited about it, although I might get a bit sunburned with no sun
protection if we end up standing in the hot sun waiting for rides.  Ah
well.</p>

<p>(( Dude right beside me with snotty attitude because the card
reader wouldn't read his card trhough his wallet.  I understand. ))</p>

<p>Right now I'm in Oimachi station, waiting by the Rinkai line gates
for Hitomi.  I think this is the right place and time to meet her.
Well, I think I'm early, cause I think we said 8:20.</p>

<p>Hmm; she just emailed me including a kanji that I don't
understand.</p>

<p>Actually 2 kanji and a possibly new vocabulary word in
hiragana.</p>
