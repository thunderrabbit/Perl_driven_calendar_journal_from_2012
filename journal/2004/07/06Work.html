<p class=date>4:55pm JST Tuesday 6 July 2004</p>

<p>Work is a pretty light load today.  Three classes between 4pm and
9:15.  Then I'm meeting a private student at 9:30 in ¸µ½»µÈ.</p>

<p>I recorded for Yasuko her speech, allowing time for her to listen
and repeat between each sentence or phrase.  I hope it's helpful for
her.</p>

<p>Right now, during this free lesson, I'm recording the Chinese tape
via the analog cable Roscoe lent me several days ago.  He inquired
about it yesterday which has prompted me to get the shit recorded and
done.</p>

<p>I'm going to look (again) into voice transcription software for
Mac.  Closer to buying it this time.</p>
