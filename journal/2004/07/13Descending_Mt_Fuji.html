<p class=date>7:00am</p>

<p>We're leaving this place now.  Um, the four kids from Serbia and
England have left, and we're going down, too.  Kana and her guy are
still here.  Okay byebye.  Kana is from Nagoya.</p>

<p class=date>back down</p>

These are taken after sunrise, after it had cleared up a lot.</p>

align="left"></a> Here are Sumida's and Miyuki's coats as we made our way
down.  This is the average fogification that we had on the way down at
first. </p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from tape)</p>

<p>We've been walking for a while, and the temperature is, kindof
acceptable now.  We're on the way down the mountain now.  The wind is
blowing really really hard, so it's... I mean we could fucking get
blown off the mountain.  Sumidasan lost his hat; it just got blown off
his head..  including the strap that it was attached to: byebye.  I
was holding [huge wind noise] I was holding [huge wind noise] I was
holding onto Miyuki when she was taking pictures so she wouldn't get
blown off the mountain and crush her camera and suck, plus her camera,
yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p>So, we're heading down the mountain and made it down in one hour to
the one point, uh and left the one point, the great house at 9:25.
And on the way back down now.  The wind is blowing really really hard
like I said; it's kinda clearing up now.  There's clouds, scattered
clouds and uh some pretty nice [wind noise] I'm going to try and maybe
get some pictures. Okay bye.  We just made it up Mt Fuji and back.
Awright.</p>

align="left"></a> Here I am after having won the Mr Mt Fuji contest for 2004.  There were only two competitors, and Sumidasan didn't know he was in the competition, but here's his pic anyway:</p>

src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/thumbs/long_way_to_go.jpg"
align="left"></a> These are some random pictures that I took on the way
down.  They are from around 8 or 9am July 13th.  Sumidasan looking out
as we were getting started down.  Well, we had gotten started and we
wanted the bottom to be closer than it seemed.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/desolate.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/thumbs/desolate.jpg"
align="left"></a> Here's a partially fogless shot showing the monotony of
the terrain.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/Mt_Fuji_is_taller_than_this.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/thumbs/Mt_Fuji_is_taller_than_this.jpg"
align="left"></a> This image was nearly a lucky shot; it was usually so
foggy that we couldn't see the bottom of the mountain, but for brief
moments, it would become clear, and once or twice, I got my camera out
quickly enough to get a photo.  This picture is called "Mt Fuji is
taller than this" because we had been climbing down for probably an
hour when the pic was taken.

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/Mt_Fuji_is_this_steep.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/thumbs/Mt_Fuji_is_this_steep.jpg"
align="left"></a> This pic is called "Mt Fuji is this steep" but actually
it's a couple degrees steeper; look at the clouds in the background;
I imagine they should be horizontal.  We climbed down gravel like
this for hours.  *hours*, mind you.  Hours.  Not like 10 hours, but
like three.

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I just competed in my own version of the Mt Fuji Olympics.  Uh.
Scree sliding for a while, and uh, tons of fun at that.  I decided it
was the most fun I've ever had with my shoes on, and separately, the
most fun I've ever had without water involved.  Although maybe I've
had more fun at rallies, but the most fun I've had <em>alone</em>
without water involved.</p>

<p>Uh, it's windy, still.  Like <em>crazy</em> windy; there's grit in
my eyes and shit like that, not just because of scree sliding, but uh,
cause I also did the Mt Fuji Olympics javelin toss, where I try to
throw my Mt Fuji stick as far as I can, but uh.  uh oh.  I'm sliding
by the wind is blowing me down the hill sliding. almost.  Um, I got
bored of that, so, I just wanna say that's how big Mt Fuji is.  It's
so fuckin' big I competed in two Olympic events and got bored with
both of them and I'm still not down yet, not to the bottom, or not to
fifth station.  Uh, Mt Fuji is a monster.  Uh, hey I see someone else.
Uh, Mt Fuji is big and don't you forget it.  Alright.</p>

    align="left"></a> Okay it's catch up time.  Those cats are way down there.  I'm gonna
leave the recorder on so we know how long it takes; I don't have any
way to measure it, well I do, but whatever, aight.  Recorder's on.
I'm gonna take a picture; I'll tell you when we start.</p>

<p>Hey there's some trash flying.  Stop that.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a picture of it.  Of them.  Again, I'm going to
leave the recorder on; they're way down there and they look like ants
or so, actually they look like people the size of ants.</p>

<p>Fuck.  for some reason.  ran out of tape maybe?  I don't know.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>[panting]</p>

<p>I call this the Fuji Effect, or maybe the Nugen Effect, or the
Foojen Effect.  The Foojin Effect.  Hey, Fooj In Effect.  God I'm
fuckin' tired.</p>

<p>The Fuji Effect is it takes longer to get down from a certain point
to a different certain point, than it did to get up.  For the last
part of this fuckin' mountain, it's like it keeps on fucking going.
It was interesting; the size scale, or the angle scale whatever; I was
going down this steep part and then I looked down and saw one part
that looked like it was going up, like we had somehow found a trail
that went down the mountain too far and had to go back up to get to
the foothills or something.  But the part that looked like it went up
(*) does not in fact go up, well, the direction that we're going now,
it goes down, and it is in fact the same hill that we went up
yesterday, but this time it's <b>longer</b>...  how the <em>fuck</em>
is that possible?  <em>Fuji!</em>  ARRggh.</p>

<p>[[ </p>

<p>(*) Okay, "the part that looked like it went up" is visible in the
picture above at "Okay, it's catch up time."  There's a little white
speck near the center of the photo.  Sumidasan and Miyuki are visible
just to the left of that speck.  The trail that they are descending
appears to reach a valley and then go back <em>up</em> toward the
left.  That up-looking portion is actually going down, just not as
steeply as the slant from which the picture was taken.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/bas_station.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Fuji_July_2004/thumbs/bas_station.jpg"
align="left"></a> This way to the bas station.</p>

<p>We made it back down.  It was longer, I tell you, it was longer on
the way down.  So that means we got down in four hours, but it took us
[going] up, like a million hours.  But I still claim that it's longer
going down, at least at the end.  Also I forgot my shoe coverings up
at the lodge.  D'oh.</p>

<p class=date>- - - -</p>

<p>Sumidasan says the had the lady at the 8th station known we were
climbing [this morning at 2am] she would have stopped us cause it was
so treacherous.  Wua ha.</p>

<p class=date>11:48am JST Tuesday 13 July 2004</p>

<p>We descending the long trail of Mt Fuji in 4 hours, including a
break for breakfast at the 8th station.  There, it seems, I forgot to
put on Hitomi's mom's spats, and, therefore, left them.  Fuck.  Good
thing, though, is that my 1000 yen gloves that Fred and I bought
together when he was here, were still within windblown distance of
where I had left them yesterday.  That's nice.</p>

<p>Things I will do differently if I climb Mt Fuji again:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bring more protein drinks (the squeeze pouch kind that are pretty
popular here)</p></li>

<li><p>Bring a jacket.  It was comforting having janette's quilt over
my shoulders, but it was nearly blown away once and nearly blew me off
the mountain twice.  (Okay, not *nearly*, but it definitely acted as a
sail.)</p></li>

<li><p>Bring business cards (or my adventure cards (I need to get some
more made)) to pass out at the top of the mountain.  We really bonded
for complete strangers in 1/2 hour.</p></li>

<li><p>Bring my computer.  I'm glad I did this time.  (It would
probably be good enough to just bring a voice recorder that could be
used with transcription software. (*))</p></li>

<li><p>Take my staff to the top of the mountain to get it
stamped.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to this list, I'm bound by honor to visit again the
8th station house thing if I climb Fuji again.</p>

<p>(*) I'm a bit closer on this; I have contacted the software
manufacturer to see if I can use an iPod to transcribe.  I can't
because it only records at 8MHz, which isn't fast enough for the
software.</p>
