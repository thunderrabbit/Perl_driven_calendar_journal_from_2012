<p class=note>(written on Hitomi's computer with her weird Japanese
keyboard)</p>

<p>Done diddly did it!  I've finished my application for Pb's
47th global voyage, and am now waiting for their invitation to an
interview.  I've not officially been given the position, but I have a
good feeling about it.</p>

<p>Super duper special thanks to Hitomi for letting me use her
computer.  Otherwise, I would have had a lot more difficulty getting
the application done.</p>

<p>If I don't get on Pb, I'll work for Jen's uncle and make
some mad cash.  If I don't get *that* job either, I'll revisit my idea
of riding my bike to Osaka.</p>

<p>I need to update my WTF page to add the 47th global voyage
itenerary.  I am not able to update my site from work, though; no
non-http protocols are allowed from our computers.</p>
