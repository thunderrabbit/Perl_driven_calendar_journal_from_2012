<p>First student was a no show, which is kinda sad cause she's one of
my new favorite students.  She chose a few of my lessons with her few
remaining points; I was really happy about that.  She probably had a
bit too much fun and too little sleep last night after fireworks; I
hope she's aight!</p>

<p>The student I just had is a HS student who is going to OZ soon for
a month.  I tried to be a bit genki during the lesson so she would
feel relaxed; I dunno if it worked or not, but she smiled a few times.
At the very end of the lesson I was like, "write a diary while you are
gone," and I showed her my (Japanese) diary as an example.  She took
my meaning as, "write in my diary right now," which is not what I
meant, but apparently seemed normal enough to her.  She wrote
something like, [I am going to Australia soon so he told me to write
in here.]  Fair enough.  While she was writing I didn't want to be
like, "no no you moron!  your *own* diary!" and destroy any hint of
confidence she may have had, and I tried to think of ways to tell her,
"okay; great practice; now you can do it during your trip!"  I don't
know if I was successful or not, but I release the outcome.</p>

<p>Kinda weird, but the postcard I wrote to the first student was
given back to me after the address was written on it.  "Can you post
it?"  The stamp has been affixed, and her address written.  I can post
it, and now that I have her address I can stalk her.  I don't know why
*this* postcard, after all the tens of postcards I've written already,
can't be dropped in the mailbox by the staff.  It seems like a
violation of policy to give me her address.  Maybe I misunderstood the
reason we give the un-addressed postcards to the staff to be
mailed.</p>
