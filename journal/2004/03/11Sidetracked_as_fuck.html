<p>Fuck.  I'm getting sidetracked as fuck.</p>

<p>I've got two competing ideas now.  Well 3:</p>

<p>1) keep cleaning and packing</p>

<p>2) find my calendar book thing (eeek!), which I think I need
before work tomorrow.</p>

<p>3) Open a new domain for the sole purpose of running spam assassin
and letting people set up email accounts and their own whitelists
(always allow addresses) and blacklists (never allow) and maybe make
some cash by helping people have spam-free email.  Several of my
friends have expressed disapproval at the amount of spam they
receive.</p>

<p>So this is part of cleaning:  I've got a pile of papers that I've
collected from Nova Kawasaki, many of which had quotes of the day
written on them:</p>

<pre>
I have been studying Arabic since yesterday.

You should go to Czech Republic because no reason.

I have a pair of sore shoulders.

I like all sports.  Except winter sports.

"What instrument do you play?"
"Euphonium."
".. Phone?"

Where did my fin go?

I ate bambi's leg.

"When did <em>you</em> come to Japan?"
"...  I'm 13."
</pre>

<p>Some of them I can attribute to their speakers:</p>

<pre>
I feel like a little squirrel finding things that I left here and I
need later.

"Do you have a flying raccoon?  er vampire?  er do you have a dancing
ballerina?"

<p>I don't want to fucking move.  I'm scared.  I'm sad.</p>

<p>I can't believe that fucking camera broke today.  Fuck!</p>
