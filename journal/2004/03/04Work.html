<p>Good news at work today; I got a note from the student who loaned
me a book a long time ago.  At the moment I got the book I was like,
"yay; book!" and then she said she was loaning it to me.  I
subsequently never opened it for I didn't want to bend up the pages;
it was near crispy, with thick pages that would end up all splayed out
with much usage.  I soon forgot who gave it to me and have wondered
how I could get it back; I was really happy to get the note.  I'll
bring it to work tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just before last lesson, I told Takuya that I wanted to get a
picture of his fly threads after the lesson; he was wearing his
bathrobe coat ensemble.  He was like, "okay," but he split before I
finished putting my files away.</p>
