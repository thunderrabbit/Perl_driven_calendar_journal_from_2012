<p>So far work has been a good variety of class and no class with
plenty of studying in the non-lessons.  I can now write ¼Ì¿¿¡£
Yay.</p>

<p>Classes were a good variety of high and low students.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've had four more students today with 2 more (?) to go.  All new
students so far today, including a woman who works for a toy company
that imports globes made in Mexico because (although the shipping is
three times as expensive) the Chinese government won't let them print
"Peking" for the capital (China wants "Beijing") on globes made in
China.  (make sense?)</p>

<p>I don't know enough about the history of China to know why who
wants what name for the capital city.</p>
