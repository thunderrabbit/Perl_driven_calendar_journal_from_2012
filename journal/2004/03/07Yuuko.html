<p>Yuuko couldn't drive her car today; her sister's car was blocking
her in and her sister had the keys.  She and I took the bus home to
Tsunashima and she saw a ramen place on the way home so we ate there.
Had to wait in line longer than I would have chosen, but she said the
place was famous, and I always see a line there.  I enjoyed being able
to read hiragana in a book they had in the waiting area.  The ramen
was good but not like amazing.</p>

<p>Back to the apartment and Yuuko (and Steve) watched me and Dan play
hackeysackjack and hackeysackjill for a while.  Steve was like, "how
long did it take you to make up this game?" when he heard all of the
rules we were blabbing about gold coins and points and pushups and
such.</p>

<p>After a while Steve went to bed, and Yuuko should have left to
make the bus, but she didn't.  We kept playing and switched from
counting hits with numbers to counting with train stations on the
Yamanote line starting from Shinagawa toward Shibuya.  We got as far
a Shinjuku twice and one past Shinjuku once, but I didn't know the
name of that station.</p>

<pre>
Shinagawa  しながわ　　品川
Osaki      おおさき　　大崎
Gotanda    ごたんだ　　五反田
Meguro     めぐろ　　　目黒
Ebisu      えびす　　　恵比寿
Shibuya    しぶや　　　渋谷
Harajuku   はらじゅく　原宿
Yoyogi     よよぎ　　　代々木
Shinjuku   しんじゅく　新宿
</pre>

<p>Awesome.  I think we could learn the stations pretty quickly this
way.</p>

<p>Yuuko chose to go after a bit, and I gave her a lift on Bluey,
Dan's bike.  Lots of laughter and she was like, "kowaii kowaii
kowaii!!!" over and over.  I was like, "gambatte kudasai!"
"kowaii!!"</p>

<p>We stopped by the bus stop but she had just missed the bus by 5
minutes and the next one was in 20 minutes.  I told her it would be
faster to go by train and not wait for the bus.  So we headed on, and
then zoom the bus went by, 6+ minutes late.  Aw man.</p>

<p>We arrived along the street by the taxis and I was like, "Segiwa
Tsunashima shuten, Tsunashima shuten des," mimicking the bus/train
announcers.  Funny stuff.</p>

<p>Small kiss on the cheek and see you tomorrow.</p>
