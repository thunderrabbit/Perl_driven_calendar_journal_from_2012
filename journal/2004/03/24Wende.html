Hi.

You've written me many times (thank you for the birthday happiness and
the funny comic strip - yay for Lyle Lovett) and I've been terribly
remiss in writing you back.  I miss Taco Bell and Malcom in the
Middle...  I saw a show on how 'they' dub sitcoms into Japanese and it
was pretty interesting.  They have an actual cast and reherse and say
the lines while watching the show...  It was pretty cool.

I've hesitated in writing you back because I have news that makes me
nervous to tell you.  No, I'm not pregnant!  I am engaged though.
Peter is the lucky guy and I'm lucky too.

It's hard for me to tell you first because you are so super special to
me and a soul mate and I love you but we're not getting married but we
were going to get married and it's a hard thing to think about in
relation to my relationship with you.  How's that for a big ol' run on
sentance?  It's also hard because I know you've 'moved on' and so have
I, but this pretty much makes it official with no going back.  Also a
little hard to put out there.  Then *also*, it's hard becuase you're
not here and I'm not there and I can't judge your reaction or really
let you hear how right this feels.  But it does feel right and I'll
still always love you.

I wonder if you'll even be able to come.  We're talking about next
April or maybe even this September (!).  Just know you're invited.  It
will be in Texas, but not in Hunt.  I told mom & Mike that I'd like to
have all or part of it at their house.  We'll see how that works out.

At any rate, Peter is moving in to my apartment (as we speak) and
we'll live here until my lease is up.  I still intend to move back to
Texas but I still don't know when.  I think I'll give work another
year or so and then if they don't find a place for me, I'll have to
move myself.  Stacy and Roddrick are going to have another baby at the
end of July and Karston is THREE and Julie is going to leave for TEXAS
A&M in the fall and my heart is still there.

So I guess that's it.  Actually, there's more to my life, of course,
but I kind of want to hear your reaction before I go on forever.

I really miss you, Rob.  I miss your hugs and your voice and your
perspective and your bunny energy...  I hope this finds you well and
happy.  Are you in your new apartment and your new job yet?  I look
forward to hearing from you.

Love from here to there!!!

HI Bear

I just saw a preview of Malcom in the middle dubbed over into
Japanese.

  It was weird.  I thought of you, and the good times we had eating
Taco Bell and watching Malcom.  Thank you for buying Taco Bell all
those times.  I really appreciate the love.

	And More Love
	- Rob

Wende!!

Wow.   I've wondered why you weren't writing back.  I'm glad you are okay.

I hear your hesitation, and I understand.  Yes, it does mean there's
no going back.  Yes, there have been times that I've wondered if we
could get back together.  I'm really glad for you.  I'm glad for you
and I'm glad to be the one that was able to break your cycle of big
relationships ending and then the male running off and getting
married.  I just ran off.  Completely different.  [happy]

Yesterday (this is a true story), *yesterday* a man brought Taco Bell
to work.  He lives on/near the US Navy base in southsouth Tokyo.  Mmmm
Taco Bell.  Erg Navy Base.  [distraction]

I invite you to release any guilt/concern/bad feelings you've had
around telling me.  I feel more happy for you than sad for me/us at
this moment.  I'm -+= really =+- rooting for you to have the best best
marriage *ever*.  Better than Irene and Nick.  And I hope they have
the best marriage in the southern hemisphere.  I can't bear the idea
of my Bear being broken hearted again.  [highest point I can reach now]

I still feel a lot of guilt feelings.   [guilt]

I love you tons.  Thank you for all we shared and all the continued
emails and stories and goodness.  [truth.  hope]

Another true story is Steve Feinstein's song "Time and Time Again"
just came up on my computer.  It's an original song of his.  [YRUU]

I love you, Wende.  I always will.  Maybe next time we can hook it up. [tears]

	- Rob   [me]
