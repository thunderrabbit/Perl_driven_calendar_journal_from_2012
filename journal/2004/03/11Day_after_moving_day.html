<p>The day after Moving Day is another moving day. I'm still at my
old apartment, kinda stuck at the end of this project.  Not actually
at the end, but past the middle, and if I were to Just Do It, quite
possibly I'd find myself finished in a short while.</p>

<p>I have, however, done some other productive things: I've mailed a
letter to Maggie, a pile of flyers to Stephenae, and a box to ジャネト。
</p>

<p>Dan and I are going to ride bikes to the shinkansen tunnel to make
bets on which way each next train will travel.</p>

<p>Okay; I'm kinda inspired to pack my clothes.  Go go go.</p>

<p>Almost go go go.  I just put some pics up from my <a

byebye party</a> and my <a

byebye party</a>.</p>

<p>New file boxes seem like they'll help a lot with organization.
Thanks for working at The Container Store, Wende.</p>
