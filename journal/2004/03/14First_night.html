<p>My first night spent at my new apartment was quite successful.  And
cold.  I wore socks, my jammie jams, an undershirt, my GAP hoodie, the
warm gloves that Fred and I bought and traded the day we went to Lake
Kawaguchi, and knit cap.  I put up two foam walls from my nest (one
against the window-wall, cause it's really cold).  And I wore earplugs
to drown out the debate downstairs.  Mmmmmm cozy.</p>
