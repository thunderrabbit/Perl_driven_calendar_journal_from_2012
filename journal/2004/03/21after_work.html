<p>Ryan and I geeked out in the living room.  He's a tall kinda mean
lookin' cat with scruffy red beard and shortly buzzed hair.  He's down
with games, currently playing Civilization III.  I argue that I can't
see spending that much (more) time on the computer to no end.</p>

<p>He flipped when I said I've never been drunk.</p>

<p>Usher is on MTV struttin' his moves to no one's delight here in
Millenium House.  Oh well for him.  Ah; he got booted.</p>
