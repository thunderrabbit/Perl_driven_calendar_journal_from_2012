<p>Mailed a puzzle to Fred (don't tell Fred, but it only cost 100 yen
(though 1200 yen to mail it).) and asked Naomi at the post office (who
has good English speaking skill (good enough to work in a Japanese
post office) and who said my Japanese kanji was good (for my
address),) where I could find a bicycle shop.  She suggested Ito
Yokado, a big department store type place around these parts.</p>

<p>I doubted their ability to fix my disc brakes, but I figured I
could try.  They didn't charge anything for their fix, and it didn't
do any good, so we were even.  I rolled around until I found another
bike shop, the proprietor of which directed me to another bike shop
(by way of a somewhat accurately drawn map) that could fix disc
brakes.</p>

<p>(+ Opposed to my earlier rant, Japanese customer service is almost
always way way way above US customer service.  We are always greeted
upon entering almost any business establishment (except for 100 yen
stores), especially restaurants and convenience stores.  Service is
fast, accurate, polite, prompt, though usually includes no English.
We are always thanked for our patronage after leaving the store,
whether we bought anything or not. I know I'll miss this when I leave
Japan. +)</p>

<p>I thanked the guy profusely and proceeded without incident (good
map) directly to the suggested bike shop.</p>

<p>The proprietor of this bike shop apparently lives above the shop.
I was like, "sumimasen" (hello?/excuse me) and a little speaker
squawked "wakkawakka" so I waited a bit and he came down.</p>

<p>To fix the brakes, he first tried the same thing Ito Yokado did,
but quickly aborted that mission (before even saying, "wakka wakka"
meaning "try it now") and clipped the brake cable, trimmed the brake
cable sleeve, got a new brake cable, zing zang pow.</p>

<p>"Wakkawakka" (try it) and I did.  I nearly ate shit flying over the
front of the bike.  Fortunately I was going really slowly, so tragedy
was avoided.  The brake was obviously far better than it had been.</p>

<p>After he fixed the front brake, I was like, "koremo" pointing to
the back brake.  (this, too)</p>

<p>The back brake took much longer, and that was when I began this
entry, wanting to hail praises for Japanese customer service.  This
man has tried a few different fixes, including replacing the brake
pads by cannibalizing a new set of brakes he has in stock.  When that
wouldn't work, he determined that he could just replace the whole
thing, but that would be too expensive.  I don't know what he
ultimately did to fix the brakes, but they work quite well now.</p>

<p>So, newly adjusted front and back brakes.  Awesome.  I tested it
out and noted that the chain would pop in back when I tried to
accelerate quickly.  He replaced the chain and it still popped, so he
unreplaced the chain, and replaced the back sprocket by ganking one
from his in-stock Peugeot.  The old back sprocket was noticably (*)
worn.  Zoomzoomzoom on my nearly new bike!  Rar.</p>

<p>(*) if one knew what to look for.</p>
