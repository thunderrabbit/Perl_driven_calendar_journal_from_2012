<p>My first lesson was with Mariko who I like completely connected
with and basically fell in love with the moment; she was so *cool*
compared to most Japanese I've met.  She totally filled my heart; she
told me the story of how she had a crap job working from 7am to 11pm,
and it was (of course) killing her, so she took some time off to
decide what she really wanted to do, and she decided to do some
hospice training and volunteer work.  Awesome.  I was
just <em>moved</em>.  I suggested that each person we meet has a gift
for us.</p>

<p>She asked if I have any lessons tomorrow.  I checked, and I did
not; I was not on the schedule at all.  I showed her when I had
lessons available on Sunday and Monday.  I wanted to hang out with
her during my lunch, but did not.</p>

<p>Release; if there's a connection to be made, she'll request one of
my lessons.</p>
