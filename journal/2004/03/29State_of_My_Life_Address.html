<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type=b>
<li><p>I now live in 中原区, no longer in Tsunashima.  Though my
skates are still in Tsunashima.</p></li>

<li><p>I can write the kanji of my address.  My Japanese is getting
better.</p></li>

<li><p>Dan's AT's camera is still not fixed; I'm becoming a bit
surprised at how long it's taking.  Not worried; just surprised.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm enjoying Gaba a lot.  When I don't have a lesson scheduled,
I use the time to study Japanese.  Lots of resources available -
staff, other teachers, internet.  Awesome.  When I do have lessons,
they are low stress and often happy fun.  I still don't quite have the
hang of the business books yet, but that will come soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I hung out with Miho from Nova for the first time last night.
There are three Mihos from Nova that I know, but I don't have written
designators (besides their last names which I'm slightly hesitant to
use due to privacy issues) for them yet.  How about T Miho.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been formulating a theory about how I live my life; I
think janette used the word touchstones.  What are the touchstones in
my life..  internet and work.  Work to make money, internet to
simulate a feeling of connection with my friends.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently met a bit more carefully Jimmy da magnet from Gaba.
He seems to have some wisdom / insight that I'd like to grok, and
hopefully help direct that to a fulfilling income producing project;
specifically my roller coaster book.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently I logged on to aim and chatted with several [former]
YRUUers.  Nice to hear their current life stories.  At the risk of
missing a name, I chatted with Joe!, Kate, Gene, Amanda, Colleen,
Aimee, AnnieB, Calder, Padre, and Austin at length.</p></li>

<li><p>I've recently learned that Wende is engaged to be married.
I'm really happy for her and hope she has the most fabulous marriage
ever.</p></li>

<li><p>If I've got this correct, when my dad was as old as I am now, I
was ten years old and in fourth grade.  I clearly remember things from
fourth grade.  (1) Mrs Deleary, (2) wanting to be in 5th grade, (3)
drawing messed up pictures of The Adventures of James Fond, depicting
him in situations difficult to escape, but somehow he (apparently)
always managed to get out, though I never knew how.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have a girlfriend.</p></li>

<li><p>janette and I email occassionally; I'm glad to stay in touch
with her.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any debt; I paid off my credit card a few days ago
(though now I'm under the minimum balance for my bank, so they'll
charge me $10 per month until my balance is boosted to 2500
dollars. The credit card company charged $20 one time after my 0%
interest offer ran out.)</p></li>

<li><p>I'd like to include meditation in my daily routine, but it
just doesn't seem to become a priority.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been in Japan for a year and 2 days.  In that time, I
haven't left the country.  I've had four visitors from the US, not
including りえ, who came to see her family more than she came to see
me:  janette, ma & jon, janette & Fred.  I'm really thankful for all
the visits.</p></li>

<li><p>Maggie sent me a funny birthday card of Great Farters
throughout History.  She says she wants to come see me this year, and
expressed regret at not seeing me in the past year.  Oh
Maggie, I love you.</p></li>

<li><p>The cherry blossoms are beginning to emerge; it's beginning to
be Spring.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm considering going to Mongolia for a horseback adventure in
June for my 12,500th day celebration.  I might do something smaller
(cheaper), but I definitely want to get out of the country, just
because I haven't yet.</p></li>

<li><p>今東京のちず持っています。私のへやの中あります。</p>

<p>I now have a map of Tokyo in my room.</p></li>

<li><p>Jesse and I have hung out hackeysackeying on a couple of
occassions; we haven't hung out overtly during non-work days, but we
likely will.  He, like me, is weird in a good way.</p></li>

<li><p>来月ニこ週あやなさんと日本語を勉強します。</p>

<p>Crap I forgot how to say two times per week.  I might study with
Ayana twice a week next month.</p></li>

<li><p>Jesse just called me, for the first time overtly outside of
work.  It's his birthday.  He was born in 1976, making me, officially,
as far as he's concerned, old.  (Haha; I wonder how old Katy Carpman
is these days.)  I wonder how I perceive myself when I see myself
hanging out with people younger than me.  Apparently I think I
oughtn't because I'm thinking about it at all.  But really, he's not
that young.</p></li>

<li><p>I've enjoyed living in my new apartment; recently (past two
days, maybe three) I haven't really emerged from my room at night;
I've been at work too late for myself to feel genki enough to go hang
out downstairs.</p></li>

<li><p>I live really close to my work now.  Awesome.</p></li>

<li><p>I have received a response regarding the history of Silent
Football.  The response is bizarre enough to seem plausible in that
it's quite unlikely that one person could have thought of it, and yet
still similar enough to be the source of the game I call Silent
Football.  The receipt of this response requires that I remove the
Silent Football Rules from my site.  But I am still looking for a
loophole, the closest candidate being that the game described is
different enough from SF to be arguably a different game.</p></li>
