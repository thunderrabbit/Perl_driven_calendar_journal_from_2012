<p>How much fucking sense does this make?   I had to pay 150 yen
again to park my bicycle today.   I paid once, came back, grabbed it,
came back, parked it and I still had the motherfucking tag that said
I motherfucking paid my motherfucking 150 motherfucking yen and the
motherfucking motherfucker was like, "WAKKAWAKKKAWAKKAWAKKAWAKKA" all
this stream of bullshit and I'm like, "I'm sorry motherfucker, I
don't motherfucking understand you because you're and asshole if you
think I'm going to pay another motherfucking 150 yen to park my
motherfucking bicycle in your shithole overpopulated suck my ass
bicycle parking lot, bitch."</p>

<p>So I paid him 150 yen and I hated him for it.  Fuck you no I hated
myself for conforming, for being a fucking pussy and paying it and
not fucking leaving and going "fuck you and your fucking rules
shitface jerkoff" especially since I already motherfucking knew I
could pay only 100 yen at the other place.  God damn I should have
fucking left to show him what a dickface rule that is.</p>

<p>Did the parking lot lose money when I left?  No.  Did they have an
opportunity to fill my parking spot with some other
non-bike-pass-having motherfucker after I left?  Yes.  Was it even
stupider that he fucking removed the old tag and put on a new one,
wasting even more of Japan's precious resources and filling up
Japan's precious landfill space?  Yes!</p>

<p>Does Japan suck?  Yes.  This place is in an environmental and
financial sinkhole with all the money going to destroy the environment
with continual construction projects and rich fat guys at the top
getting a percentage of all the construction projects they set up.</p>

<p>I think I'm in a bad mood.</p>
