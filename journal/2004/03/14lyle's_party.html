<p>At Lyle's party, we had a gift exchange thing with all the
information that people brought.  Ali, Erik and I spent several
minutes discussing how to set up the game, but Lyle claimed he (and by
"proxy" everyone else) was too drunk to understand the rules of the
gift exchange game.  (Take a gift from the center or take a gift from
someone who already has a gift.)  After the resulting free-for-all
with everyone just grabbing things out of the box, Carla was like,
"when are we going to play the game?" and I was like, "that was it; it
was supposed to be more structred [blah blah blah]" and I explained
the rules and all that.</p>

<p>"Oh. wakatta.  I thought that was a little strange."</p>

<p>Lyle asked people for challenges, ("anything.  any challenge") and
Ali set up this challenge between me and Lyle for doing pull ups.  I
was like, "I can do five, but not ten" but the contest still required
the winner to do ten first and the loser has to kiss Junko on the
lips.  I lost, and Junko was like, "waaaa!" and wasn't having it.  I
didn't try very hard.</p>

<p>Ali was like, "no! you gotta do it!" and "doesn't matter" when I
was like, "naw man; she obviously isn't interested." so Lyle solved it
by giving me a faux open mouth kiss.  Ali goes, "done," in his way
that means "the problem has been resolved."</p>

<p>Oh my gosh the funniest part of the night was when we went to
Lyle's and walked inside and it smelled like cat shit and Benny and
Tomoko were like, "where is everybody?" and then a big dog started
trying to push its way out of its closed-with-a-shoestring door to eat
us and then they were like, "oh shit this is the wrong room!"  I
shoulda snapped a photo, but I was like <em>shoop</em> and headed
downstairs.  I thought it was a bit weird that the boys had said,
"it's on the second floor" and then went to the third floor.  Also
interesting that the people seemed not to be home upstairs, yet the
door was unlocked.  Just like Canada, eh?</p>

<p>Lyle and I drove around in his upside down box labeled "Lyle's
Love Box" for a bit, but didn't get very far before he ejected
himself from the car.</p>

<p>Rumi, somehow, looked cuter than ever.</p>

<p>At the end of the evening, Fritz showed me how to access train
information on my phone.  Awesome.  I told him I'd give him a hundred
yen if he showed me, but I didn't make good on my offer because he
didn't seem to care/want it.</p>

<p>Walked back to the station with Beth (an AT at a different Nova
school) and Tomoko (who wasn't wearing a coat) and we got our
respective last trains back home.  Dropped off Beth at Yokohama and I
enjoyed talking with Tomoko who said she would give to level 3 Miho a
letter if I give it to Tomoko.  I didn't get a chance to thank Miho
for giving me a new job charm from her father's shrine, and for giving
me the bilingual history of Japan book, so I'd like to do that.</p>

<p>Tomoko asks good questions.  At least as many as KG Miki.  I can
learn a lot from them.</p>
