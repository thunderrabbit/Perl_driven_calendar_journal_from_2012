<p>I found the funnest fastest way to get to ÉðÂ¢¾®¿ù from my house
(on bike).  It may not be the *fastest* because it goes at right
angles and not angle angles, but it's pretty fuckin' direct.  It's
funnest because I get to zoom along the tracks (around which
construction is going on) and then shoop under the tracks twice in a
dogleg fashion.  <em>[shoop!  shoop!]</em></p>
