<p>I got some editing done on my videos from Fujikyu.  The most
difficult was figuring out how to synchronize the video and audio of a
clip that was taken from a different vantage point of a different run
of Dodonpa.  I got it pretty well done though in the end I think.</p>

<p>Halfway done with visa stuff.  Tomorrow I will go to a visa place
in Kawasaki and show them all my proof that Gaba will sponsor my visa.
Will have to submit proof of Nova's releasing me from duty later.</p>
