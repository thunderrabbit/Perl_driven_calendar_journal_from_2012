<p>It's 4.4 megs: movie of Tony's paper <a
href="/images/art/tony_merry_go_round.mov">merry-go-round</a>.</p>

<p>Wow! Amazing that Tony was *there* (in the tea cafe / art showroom.
The place used to be a bookstore and display room, but the bookstore
wasn't making enough cash so it got switched to a tea cafe), and
showed off the awesomeness of his merry-go-round.  Now I wish I had
seen his previous version (but the window for that was very short as
it lasted only 1 day); he says this one is far superior.  A working
paper merry-go-round!  Its mechanism is quite smooth; the horses ride
around, up and down, all that good stuff.  He was driving it quite
quickly at one point.  I got two videos of it; I hope I can get them
online easily enough.  Oh yeah that reminds me; I'm going to πÀ≈Á now
for internet access.</p>

<p>Want more?  Here's <a

together</a>: (9.5 megs)

<p>Satoko and Sachiko were there; we chatted and drank tea together.
Quite a fun time.  I'm going to hook up with Sachiko for a party that
they said Guy is going to as well.</p>
