<p>Yuuko dropped me off next to Cinecitta, where I bought tickets for
Brother Bear, a movie that KG Miki wanted to see.</p>

<p>Every Wednesday is Ladies' Night at the movies; women get tix for
1000 yen, whereas guys gotta shell out full price of 1800 yen.  1200
or so for after 9pm.</p>

<p>Miki cut her hair since I saw her last; it's pretty cute, but maybe
that's just because she's cute.  It reminds me a bit of Trinity from
The Matrix.  but with bangs.</p>

<p>Grabbed some snackaroos from the nearby conveni (convenience store)
and brought them into the theater.  Snacks don't have to be smuggled
in; the ticket prices are high enough, apparently.</p>

<p>The movie had its moments, but overall it was weak.  It was nothing
compared to Finding Nemo.  The story didn't hold even itself together;
the eagle turned the bear back into a man before it was time.  Koda
should have knocked the spear down the mountain, an avalanche should
have happened, and brother bear should have risked himself to save the
human by keeping him warm, then after the night he would be turned
back into a man as the snow was transmogrified into flowers.</p>

<p>I did like how Koda was snorking unintelligibly when bb was turned
back to a human, but I still kinda knew what he was saying.  It would
have been funny if they coulda had him telling a story in grunts, but
I'm not sure how that could have been easily worked into the plot in
the time allotted.  They could have spent a day as bear and human and
then changed back to a bear, but hey.</p>

<p>Miki finished her job today.  She love[d/s] her students, but
didn't seem to express any sadness today after leaving them.  She had
a big bouquet of flowers and her purse and two gift bags in addition
to her flute today.  Quite a haul to be hauling around.  I'm glad she
was so well appreciated at her work.  I hope she feels the same or
even better.</p>

<p>I felt a bit conspicuous with her/them, like she had just won a
beauty pageant, but true to Tokyo form, no one paid notice, from the
conveni to in and back out of the theater, to the okonomiyaki place
afterward.</p>

<p>We checked the start date for Drumline, a movie I've wanted to see
since I saw a review for it in Metropolis.  April 10th.  But I work on
Wednesdays in April.  Fuck working Wednesdays anymore; that's movie
night.  I'll not work Wednesdays in May/beyond.  Probably I'll take of
Wednesday and then a floating day off each week, one that moves from
week to week.  Maybe it should include Wednesday in its cycle so I can
trick myself into getting some more hours.  Miki said my Japanese is
getting better; I was able to ask when the movie started, and able to
get the answer.  But I'm not sure that I asked the way she would
have.  But whatever.</p>

<p>Walked her to her bicycle and helped her pack all her goodies into
her basket.  purse, gift bag, flowers.  Flute, being most expensive,
stayed on her arm.  "おやすみなさい。" (good night)</p>
