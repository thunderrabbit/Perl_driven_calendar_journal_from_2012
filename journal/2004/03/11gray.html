<p>Things that could be contributing to my unease:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I can't seem to find my little calendar thingie.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm supposed to move by tomorrow at noon (or was it
today?).</p></li>

<li><p>I broke Dan's friend's camera (I imagine that will cost me some
$$ to fix).</p></li>

<li><p>Dan is gone for the evening (so I can't spend our last chance
at quality time together, nor can I get his input on how to go about
fixing the camera)</p></li>

<li><p>I have Japanese class tomorrow before work (so i can't take
the camera to Yodobashi Camera before work)</p></li>
</ul>
