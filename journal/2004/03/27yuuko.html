<p>After work, I was feeling a bit unsettledly anxious for an
attention fix, even though Jesse and I had been hanging out throughout
the day each time we had a break or some such.  I called Miki (H Miki,
not KG Miki) and asked if she wanted to hang out sometime, now that I
live closer to her.  Actually I wanted to know if she wanted to hang
out tonight, even though when I played through the scenario, I could
see I would soon be bored/frustrated with trying to bridge the
language gap, and there must be some something that is inside me
trying to come up or get out or otherwisely be noticed.  She couldn't
hang out, but said she would called Mamiko to see if we could all hook
up for a night of karaoke, etc and all that.  Cool.  I was nearly
kinda relieved that she wasn't available tonight; it was just too much
for me to generate the genkiness required to go hang out with someone
I don't know *all* that welll.</p>

<p>Just after that, however, Yuuko texted me.  I was far more willing
to spend the time with her; though the language gap can be
frustrating, we are past any uncomfortable silence concerns in our
relationship.  She wanted to show me some nice sakura (cherry
blossoms) around the area.</p>

<p>The blossoms were neat.  Right now I'm too tired to post the pics,
but we got some.  The sky was all dark, so they're a bit strangely lit
due to the flash, but definitely gives an idea of what it's like.</p>

<p>Wandered around the neighborhood with Yuuko a bit and then she
drove us to Dan's where I found my flash cards and got my umbrella
back and all that.   Good stuff.  Reallllly tired.  Saw Dan on the
way home.  And then saw Steve at the corner in Tsunashima. </p>
