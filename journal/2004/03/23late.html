<p>Called Dan on the way home; came over to watch Family Guy with
him.   Met him and JennyJ at an izakiah in Tsunash and on the way
home, convinced Jen to watch "just one" Family Guy with us.  She, as
we suspected, laughed her ass off and watched three with us.
Awesome.</p>

<p>I told her and Dan how awesome Gaba is.  I'm realllly happy with
working there.</p>
