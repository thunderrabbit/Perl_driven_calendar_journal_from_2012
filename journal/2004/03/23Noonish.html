<p>Got the letter to Tomoko (she's such a superawesome friendly smiley
person. So kind and giving.  I would just love her if I actually spent
time with her.  She works really hard to speak English correctly and
is always helpful to those who ask Japanese questions of her.  Wow.),
went to Yodobashi Camera to find out that they couldn't tell me
anything about the cameras ETA, mailed my friend's (*) letter to
Colleen.</p>

Hey Colleeniebeanie 
I have a friend who wants to send you a letter.  Can you give me your
snail mail address so I, uh he, can send it to you?

Wutup Homey G!! haha well that is very nice of your friend to want to
send me a letter. you, umm, THEY can send it to blahblah Corpus Christi TX.
</pre>

<p>Special thanks to Akiko who happened to see me looking curiously at
the public phone which had its own case (to protect the phone), but
not a booth (that would protect a user).  She was like, "Rob [what are
you doing?]" and I was like, "HI!  Do you have a pen ballpeen
arimasuka?"  And she did, so I wrote アメリカ on the letter, and she
offered to mail it for me.</p>

<p>Before that, I had wandered around Jiyugaoka station looking for a
post office and ultimately found stamps at the convenience store.
They didn't know how much it cost to send to America; I told them I
thought it was 110 yen and they seemed all impressed that I knew what
they were talking about.  Even if I didn't understand any Japanese, it
was easy.  I was like, "kitte arimaska?"  (are there stamps [here]?)
and she's like, "hai wakka wakka ?" and I figured she must be asking
where's the shit going, or what value stamp do you want.  I was like
"America" (which is what they say for the US).  She was all,
"chottomatte" (just a moment) and ran off to talk to her boss guy and
they're all scratching their heads, "um er..."  So either they were
trying to tell me that they couldn't send letters to the US, or they
didn't know how much it cost to send to the US, or they didn't know
what "America" meant, or the US had been reported missing recently and
was unavailable for postal mail.  "hyakujyuentomoimas" (it's 110 yen,
I think).  [surprised look; "you figured out the solution to the
problem that we didn't directly describe to you!"]</p>

<p>Yah, I guess I do write like a jerk.  I remain unimpressed by how
much people use their brains.  Yes, including me.</p>
