<p>Two dreams today where I helped others:</p>

<p class=dream>In the middle of a thickly wooded area, but with a
road going through the middle, I handed a large board to some guy,
but there was a bird nest attached to the back of it, with little
not-yet-able-to-fly baby birds in it.  I was like, "whoah," and
unhanded the board to the guy and put it up in a tree so the parental
birds could get to it.</p>

<p class=dream>I knew they were crows, so I made cawwing sounds to
attract the parents, who came promptly.  They began to feed the babies
and then proceeded to reattach the nest's board to the trees using a
paste of old feathers and birds spit.  Great intelligence was
displayed by the bird's behavior.  S/he used a rope to gently tug on
the nest to see if it would hold, and then once the nest seemed sturdy
enough, pulled the rope into a bundle and put it in the nest so no
predators could use it to get into the nest or pull the nest down.</p>

<p class=dream>Pretty smart for a bird.</p>

<p class=dream>Steve Feinstein was in a car accident in the middle of
a field, while the car was carrying a couch on top.  I went to help
and the couch fell down, crunching the driver's side of the roof and
pinned him in the car.  I didn't know if he was okay or not, but I had
to get him out.  I got into the car (actually it was a minivan) and
used one of the seats to prop up the ceiling while I got Steve out and
layed him on the grass.  He was really small, like the size of a
shampoo bottle.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone else was in the back seat, but he was just
sleeping (or already dead), so I wasn't worried about saving him as
much.  But I did get him out of the van just for safety.</p>

<p class=dream>Some youth were nearby in a different car, but they
were just babies and mostly unaware of the significance of the
situation.  Susie Robinson's mom came back from a walk, with Susie
somewhat lagging, talking on her cellphone, and I was like, "come
quickly [blah blah blah]" and by the time they arrived, Steve had
recovered in both animation and size.</p>
