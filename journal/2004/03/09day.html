<p>Got a package put together for Stephanie, mostly colorful flyers
and stuff, plus a one page letter saying wazzap.</p>

<p>Didn't mail it.  Did eat lunch though.</p>

<p>Yuuko is over and will spend the night.</p>

<p>Yuuko went home this AM; we'll meet in Kawasaki to buy some stuff
for my new crib.</p>
