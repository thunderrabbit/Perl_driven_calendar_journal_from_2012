wow.
</pre>

<p>I didn't really understand her reply, and I had a secret guess in
the back of my mind that I had made her mad so I tried to accentuate
the positive.</p>

<pre>
And we had the most fun with the most rides!

Thank you for getting up in the middle of the night in the blistering
cold to go with me that day!
</pre>

<p>But really it was a lost cause; there was no way to fix anything,
and I didn't really know what could be done about it.</p>

<pre>
i commented because i want you to know how your writing affects
others.  i want you to know that your journal sometimes makes you
sound inconsiderate and a little heartless.
</pre>

<p>I'm leaving out the bits that I think will get me in more trouble
with janette.   Maybe this is one way to really piss her off and
never be allowed back.  I don't want that.</p>

<p>I thought about just closing my journal with a big "JOURNAL CLOSED
[to the public; fuck off]"</p>

<p>But I choose not to do that.</p>

<pre>
the point i want to make is- are you becoming the narrator of your
journal? are you heartless? NO!  then why do you sound that way? why
don't you write about your feelings more?

for example yuuko. we don't know anything about her except you kiss on
her, you see each other alot, she has a car. what's she like?  is she
funny?  how does she see the world?  what does she bring out in you?
what are her endearing qualities?  how is she different from american
girls you have known?  how has she touched your heart or opened your
eyes or comforted you?  how does she piss you off ?  do you like the
way she dresses,looks,walks?  how does she rate with all the other
women you have know?  what do you talk about?  how do you feel when
you are around her?

we don't know shit about her or any of your girls, including janette.
and it makes it seem like they mean not much to you.

is that true?  who does matter to you?  why? what's important?
</pre>

<p>I don't know what's fucking important, but writing why I like
people sounds like an interesting project.</p>
