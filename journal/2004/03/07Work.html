<p>Gotta get this written before work starts in 1 minute:</p>

<p>Woke up from a HAPPY dream where Fred had just come back from
somewhere and he was super chipper and genki and happy happy and
hugging him was just awesome *AND* he was about 10 year old version
of Fred.</p>

<p>Then I woke up.  I was alone in Japan.  I just started to cry.</p>

<p>Rode the bus with Morag to work today.  At The Kuykster.  My last
day here at KQ Kawasaki Nova.</p>

<p>My first two lessons were scheduled man to man with the same guy,
and since he's not my favorite student, I wanted to switch with Ali
or Morag.  I wanted Ali's second class because Takako, my Aries bud
is in there, but Ali wanted that class because Honma, Ali's bud is in
there.  We had Junko choose which to switch and she switched my first
class with Morag's.</p>

<p>As it turned out, Morag got a free cause my (originally scheduled)
guy didn't show up.  And he also didn't show up for my second class
(so far) so I have a free.  I was going to switch with Ali even so,
but only on the condition that Takako showed up to class before the
bell rang.  She didn't, and hasn't shown up so far.  I wonder if
she'll come to my party tomorrow.</p>

and then when she left I was like, <em>shoop</em> and left too.
Caught her halfway down the stairs and we went to the conveni
together.  I got a small salad and she got a chocolate milk.  Walked
toward KQ Kawasaki station and found steps to ヨドバシカメラ were
available because they moved recently.  Talked mostly in Japanese and
she a little bit in English.  Taught her a couple phrases that she
attempted.  About movies and stuff.  Lord of the Rings, Finding Nemo,
Lilo and Stitch.</p>

<p>Sad-ish slow walk back to the Q and she said it first.  "Next week
I will come to Nova and you won't be here.  I am sad."  "Me too."
J-wave goodbye.  No hug.</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm back at work.  1 minute to plan my lesson.</p>
