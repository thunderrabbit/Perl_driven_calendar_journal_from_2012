<p>Work was good yesterday.  I empathised with a student when I told
her she needed to change a long-believed rule of grammar.  She
believed she needed to say</p>

<pre>I had been in England for seven years.</pre>

<p>because of the "for seven years" part.  She was speaking really
well and I debated disrupting the flow, so I asked her, "do you want
me to fix your grammar?  Or do you just want to talk?"</p>

<p>"Um.. fix it, please."</p>

<p>I told her it should be</p>

<pre>I went to England for seven years.</pre>

<p>She was pretty adamant about her belief, and was nearly able to
convince me that I was wrong.  We dropped the topic for a while and
when I thought about it more, I knew I was correct.  "had been"
requires a reference to a ending point for the action being
described.</p>

<p>That was our first lesson together, and she had specifically
selected me as her instructor just to get a change of pace.  I wonder
if she'll ever choose me again.</p>
