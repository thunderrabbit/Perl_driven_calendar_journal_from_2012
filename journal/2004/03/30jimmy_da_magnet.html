<p>Went to Jimmy da magnet's house after work to talk about the
business idea that Jesse described to me earlier today.  Jimmy seems
to have a good business sense about him; knowing or at least
describing logical growth progressions, so we're not trying to start
with a huge business model, but start easy and grow from there.</p>

<p>It's pissing down rain; actually it's just a hard sprinkle, but the
wind makes it go all over the place.  This seems a really impressive
storm for Japan.  One of the best I've seen.  But still no
lightning. Still nothing on a Houston storm.</p>

<p>Jimmy may help me find the means to produce my roller coaster
book.  Money.</p>

<p>As I was leaving, I was like, "I'd love to work on you
with.. wait.  I'd love to work with you on this book," which was
actually pretty funny, considering the innuendos we had been tossing
about during the evening.</p>

<p>His apartment is a proper sized apartment.  Two big ass fish tanks
in the living room; maybe 200 gallons each I'm guessing.</p>

<p>We'll hang out more.</p>
