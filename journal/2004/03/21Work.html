<p>Sachiko didn't come, but Yuuko did; she hung out and had some
cookies, filled out their questionnaire and I showed her the computers
and books.  I was really happy that she came; she brightened my lunch
hour.</p>

<p>My last student is a sales manager for Logitech.  She told me about
a M$ mouse design that has the wheel for vertical scrolling which can
be pressed sideways for horizontal scrolling.  I was like, how about a
trackball?  And she laughed a lot at/about the idea, but I was like,
"naw it would be cool; you could say, we moved the mouseball on
top!"</p>

<p>A cointoss said I should pursue the idea.  I'm not sure how to go
about it though.</p>

<p>Though it doesn't show up on the page for me, James said I got a
5-5 evaluation!  Whoohooo!  That's 1000 yen bonus for me.</p>
