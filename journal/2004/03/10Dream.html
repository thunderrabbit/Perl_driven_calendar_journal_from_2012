<p class=dream>Supposed to meet Wende who planned to come see me in
Japan, but we didn't have a plan on when/where/how to meet.  She had
left a message on my phone saying the had arrived at the airport the
previous night at 8:30.</p>

<p class=dream>I went to the amusement park as planned and one of the
rollercoasters was being transitioned from a normal coaster to a
suspended gondola to go wooshing around the park on an oval set of
cables.</p>

<p class=dream>Ma arrived and I introduced her to my friends,
including the woman in LotR who killed that wyrm dragon thing and the
undead knight rider.</p>

<p class=dream>Woke up before I saw Wende.</p>
