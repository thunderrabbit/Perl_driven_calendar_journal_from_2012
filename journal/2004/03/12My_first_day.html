<p>I'm at Jiyugaoko Gaba now; have met Akiko and Marselli (which is
her last name, but that's how she introduced herself.  Her first name
is Hikari, and she'll be off work soon with her new baby!).  I've got
5 lessons today, which isn't as many as I had hoped, but it's all
good.</p>

<p>Three (3!) students chose me as their instructor.  I don't know if
I know them from Nova or what, but that's money.  Or a misclick.</p>

<p class=date>7:10pm JST Friday 12 March 2004</p>

<p>My number of lessons has swelled to 7.  It was 8, but then it
shrank; a student cancelled on someone else's schedule so mine got
moved over (??) I think that's how it happened, cause I'm the low guy
on the totem pole.  There's a cat named Simon who's worked here for 3
weeks, so maybe that's when I'll get moved up a notch.</p>

<p>Everyone has been friendly and cool.</p>

<p>Finished.  Well, I finished at 10.  I had 7 students, including 6
women.  Yay for that.   One woman was a computer person and said her
shoulders were sore, so I told her some ways to keep from straining
them so much while keyboarding.  Taught her proper keyboarding
posture.  Didn't have enough time to tell her about stretching her
wrists and such every hour.</p>

<p>I don't have work tomorrow.  I'll use that time to see why I don't
seem to get internet access at the new apartment, take the camera to
Yodobashi camera, unpack my junk, and one more thing I think but I've
forgotten it for now.</p>
