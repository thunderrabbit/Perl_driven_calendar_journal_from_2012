<p>My alarm went off at 5:30 (I wonder why I set it that early last
week..  oh yeah to go to Fuji-Q Highland!) and I reset it for 7:30 so
I could get up and go home on a crowded morning train.  It wasn't too
crowded; no one was touching me.  As I zipped semi-quietly up the
stairs, I was amazed/disgusted/saddened by the silent crowd trudging
up the stairs.  I'm just so glad that isn't my life.  _What_ isn't my
life???  I don't know.  It's just so alien; like a bunch of robots
going to work, with no emotions, no talking, no acknowledging others'
existence.  It's really weird to me.</p>
