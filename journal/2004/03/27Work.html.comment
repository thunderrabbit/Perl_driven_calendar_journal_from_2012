<br>I think "Peking" might be the rendition of the city's name in the Wade-Giles system of Romanization, which is older and less accurate than the pinyin system promoted by the Communist Party.  I believe the Kuomintang (or Guomindang, in pinyin) stuck to the older system, but I don't know which one Taiwan uses these days.  At least, that would explain the difference between the "Pe-" and "Be-" parts of the names; i don't know why one should end in "king" and the other in "jing."
