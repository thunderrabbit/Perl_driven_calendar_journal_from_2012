Greetings.

I am writing to impart to you my mixed feelings
concerning your web page explicating your rules for
Silent Football, or SF.  I myself have been playing
for years, and certainly feel the unspoken unity of SF
players with you.  I, like you, was trained in the
construct of a church entity through youth
conferences, though by means of a different
denomination.  Before I present to you my concerns, it
first behooves me to present to you at least a very
small fraction of the various and sundry differences
our methods of game play present.
First of all, the moves of our two games concerning
the football, while serving near identical functions,
have very different names.  The methods of my
denomination also contain an entire system of highly
complex rules concerning the entirely separate
function of punishments throughout the game for
various mistakes on the part of the players.    I get
the sense also that the game play of my denomination
is significantly more serious than that of Unitarian
churches.  For example, players are not allowed to
laugh or even giggle except during punishments, no
player under any circumstances is allowed to leave the
room until completion of the game, whenever that may
be, and only actual names are used, though with a
formal and deferential twist.  Finally, and most
importantly, the SF play of my denomination explicitly
states that as the single most important rule of SF,
no one must talk about SF.  From the game's inception,
it has remained in the strictest of confidences, which
is why I take such issue to your website presenting a
written history of the game.  The game's secrecy in
itself is a large part of makes its' execution so fun.
 Since its creation, the game has only been passed
down by oral tradition, as exemplified through the
great works of Homer and Plato.  And especially, under
ANY circumstances, NO GIRLS WHATSOEVER are ever
allowed to know even the existence of the game, much
less the rules, even much less actually be allowed to
play.  A bit extreme, perhaps?  Not when the true
origins of the game are made clear.  Let me thoroughly
express myself, though.  I am not here to judge or
persecute you for your SF play, whatever it and your
tradition entails, and I believe your system of
wormholes and parallel universes is exceedingly clever
and, to my knowledge, unprecedented in the game's
history.
I have the distinct and honorable fortune of being
trained by a mentor who himself was trained through
the direct lineage of the Creators of the game.  Which
is why I'm prepared to make a little deal.  If you
agree to remove the rules of SF from your website,
leaving only the vaguest and obscure references to it,
I will transcribe to you the full and complete history
of the game's creation and development.
Eagerly awaiting your reply,
	Fellow SF player

Mr Philip

Mr Philip's proposal regarding Silent Football (SF) has been
acknowledged by Mr Rob.  Mr Rob, being curious about Mr Philip's
alleged awareness of the full and complete history of SF's creation
and development, has removed the link to the aforementioned SF
information on Mr Rob's website.  While the information itself is
intact, a fact which Mr Philip may find disheartening, Mr Rob posits
that such information has already been cached by the wonderful web
search engine named, if Mr Rob may, Mr Google (1), which Mr Rob
further believes is how Mr Philip came to find Mr Rob's SF information
in the first place.  Mr Rob therefore suggests that leaving the
information intact on Mr Rob's website while disengaging the links on
Mr Rob's website to Mr Rob's SF information causes Mr Rob's SF
information to be less available than Mr Google's cached copy of Mr
Rob's SF information, and therefore less threatening than Mr Google
toward Mr Philip's beliefs about the importance of not writing the
rules of SF down in any medium.  Mr Rob admits that Mr Rob has
presupposed that Mr Philip does not know Mr Google well enough to
request that Mr Google remove information that Mr Google has already
cached.

Having effectively removed the rules from Mr Rob's website, Mr Rob
requests that Mr Philip effectively present Mr Rob with information
regarding "the full and complete history of the game's creation and
development."  Mr Rob encourages Mr Philip to include sufficient
information so that Mr Rob may truly know that the full and complete
history of SF has been given to Mr Rob via Mr Philip, or Mr Rob may
freely, and without recrimination from Mr Philip or any of Mr Philip's
associates, be allowed to restore the links to Mr Rob's SF information
on Mr Rob's website.

	Mr Rob
