<p>I got an FSD update from Dave via Henry:</p>

<pre>
You asked about FSD... well, it's not doing very well
compared to when you were there.  The downturn in the
economy relly hurt it.  Most of the existing contracts
didn't get renewed, and there weren't many new ones.
Internal surveys apparently are a luxury for them (for good
times only). And Enron going bust didn't help either. 

There is just a skeleton crew left (Debra, Drew, and Minh).
 Kevin is working contract somewhere using SAS - of course!
 Karla is teaching at UH (I think). Patrick is working
contract at Wachovia (or some Bank).  Dave is just loafing
around since he got laid off about a year ago.  They are
mostly just doing paper surveys now.

<p>Sigh.</p>
