<p>Wow.  Finished.</p>

<p>happysad moneybad mostlyglad for all the funIhad.</p>

<p>Ooh, that was bad.</p>

<p>Crap first: Voice was shit today; I had The English Teacher and
some elderly gentleman, both of whom hate America and seemed happy to
bash America in front of (at) me where I pretty much can't do anything
about it.  I kept thinking I wanted Frank's balls and knowledge of
history and politics; I figured with that I could easily shred them
to bits.</p>

<p>Good second:</p>

<p>Switched two lessons with Guy because I was scheduled to have full
seats and he was scheduled with man to man.  I completely enjoyed both
of my man to mans.  The first one I played Mindtrap with The English
Teacher (this was before he was in voice).  He mostly gave up on the
questions (and then said they were too easy), but hey whatever.</p>

<p>The second money lesson was the second to last of the day (my Nova
career), with a woman named Naoko, who had written a cool book with
double-images that look like one thing and then they look like another
when viewed with a cylindrical mirror.  She asked me to look at her
advertising deal and I was able to correct some mispellings and such
with no problem, and then I nearly redesigned the thing, moving around
and rewriting portions of text, relabeled the image on the page... all
directed toward simplifying and grabbing the readers' attentions.</p>

<p>I was so into helping her that I kept helping her after the bell
rang for the end of class and suddenly (ten minutes later), the next
bell rang for the start of the next class.  Whoah!</p>

<p>I was like, "oops bye!" and zipped to the teachers room, grabbed
several level 5 files that I thought were likely to be the ones I
needed, and went to my next and final class at Nova.</p>

<p>Koji and Yuki, two of my fav students were in there.  Two other
students I don't know were there too.  I was like, "HI" and "I'm
sorry" and "It's my last lesson at Nova," (which Yuki knew already
and seemed to be well aware of it before I said anything) and found
that I had three of their files.  Close.</p>

<p>I remembered that I had planned to do number 52 (level 5) about the
UFO so I asked if any of them had seen a UFO.  Yuki had seen one (so I
gave her high five), and she told her story.  The target language
being the responses, "could it have been a plane?" "no it
couldn't."</p>

<p>Per Dan's request, I said, "please listen, and repeat," starting
witih Yuki, and the hilarious thing is she answered the question
instead of repeating it.  I gave her five again.</p>

<p>After her story and the subsequent 'debate,' I was like, "what
about you guys?"</p>

<p>And they were like, "[naw man I ain't seen] nothing,"</p>

<p>"Nothing?  Nothing??  No ghosts, UFOs, Godzilla?  Nothing?"</p>

<p>And then Yuki goes, "what about you, Rob?"</p>

<p>"Good question."  I smiled at hearing my name.  I answered
"Umm.."</p>

<p>"No," chimed in one of the other students, and I was caught as a
hypocrite.</p>

<p>I gave her five.</p>

<p>Koji and the other guy didn't speak up too much, so I didn't give
Koji five when he answered when he should have repeated; I didn't want
to embarass him.</p>

<p>At the end of the lesson, I wanted to ask Koji and Yuki if they
were going to my byebye party.  I'm pretty sure I told Yuki about it
a couple weeks ago.  We'll see what happens.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Back in the teachers' room.  "Wow."</p>

<p>"See you" from Morag.</p>

<p>"I made you this" from Benny as he handed me a little kids card
thing <em>You are a woman named Mary.  You have a husband named John.
You have two kids and live in an apartment in the city.</em> that he
didn't make, much less make for me.</p>

<p>Handshakes with Phil and Phong.</p>

<p>"See you" from Steve.</p>

<p>Peace sign thrown to Benny while he was in class and I walked
out.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p><em>what would it be like if there were people waiting for me as I
left?  If I went down there and some students were like, "thanks for
being great" and stuff..  What if there's a whole crowd of
students??</em></p>

<p><em>Mate.  Forget it; it will be just like every other day.  This
is Japan, not YRUU.</em></p>

<p>My second thought was right.  I went to Starbucks, called Yuuko,
drank hot cocoa and wrote this entry.</p>

<p class=date>6:45pm JST Monday 8 March 2004</p>

<p>Now Yuuko and I are going to Warawara to get a table.  I'm a bit
worried cause Yuuko seems surprised that I hadn't reserved a table yet
and I don't have really any idea how many people will be there, nor
even how many I invited.</p>
