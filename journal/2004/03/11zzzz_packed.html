<p>I'm packed.  The room is clean.  Thanks to Dan for slowing me down
and helping me consider that <em>they</em> might come and take all
the shit out of the room *and* charge me for cleanup.  So all of the
stuff is out of the room and</p>

<p><em>piled up in the living room!</em></p>

<p>Well, it's not *that* bad, but close; I have properly packed my
clothes and the paper files and scrapbook, but all the other piddly
stuff has been stashed in the plastic sets of drawers and will be
stashed in Dan's room tomorrow, along with the sidewalls of my nest,
which I'm taking, and along with the mattress, which will stay in
Dan's room.</p>

<p>Tonight, Dan and I are camping out in the living room.  He's on
the couch and I'm on my mattress and well worn futon pad for one last
night.  My pillows are packed, but that's cool cause I'm only going
to sleep for one cycle.  For my legs, I'll use a trashbag full of the
packing material janette has sent me over the year.</p>

<p>Pictures of this night will likely be posted.</p>

<p>The plan for tomorrow is to wake up at ohgod thirty, move my
properly packed stuff to the new place, unpack-kinda, shower there,
put on my work clothes (suit), and go to my Japanese lesson in
Shibuya by 9:30.</p>

<p>Then I can dawdle a bit on my way to work, but (oh shit I'm glad I
thought of this) I don't yet know *how* to get to that office.  I
won't dawdle too long because it's my first day of work and all that.
Work ends at 10:40pm.  I wonder if Yuuko will help me move my last
load over at that time.</p>
