The party was basically perfect.  Morita giving me the hanko (little
circle stamp thing that says ROB in katakana) is well up there on the
favorites; it was low key, given to me before anyone else had arrived.
(good for his low key personality) Um, number two is that I moved
around the table a bit.  I had to be pushed at first (hey Rob; go over
there to be in a picture with those peeps as well) cause my style
seems to be never wanting to be the one to move, to break a
conversation.  I'm not sure what's underneath that, and how that could
be compatible with not wanting to stay in a long term relationship
(these are easily orders of magnitude different timescales, but it's
still kinda the same idea I think).  Anyway, I moved around the table
and seemed to cheer people up by sitting next to them.  Is it
possible?

It's fureezing here.

I'm using your quilt to stay warm.  Have one more row to snip.  My
goal for today is to finish my scrapbook so I can pack and move.  I
have three days of no plans before I work at Gaba.

	With Love
	- ROB!
