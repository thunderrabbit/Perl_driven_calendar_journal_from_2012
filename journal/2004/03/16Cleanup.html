<p>Room cleanup is proceeding.</p>

<p class=date>10:58am</p>

<p>A guy from ヨドバシカメラ called me and I had Rene translate for
me, cause when I was like, "ちょっと日本語" and
 "カメラはいくらですか。" the guy was like, "??? wakka wakka wakka
 wakka"</p>

<p>Rene said the cost would be 10390 yen.  That is fabulous.  Dan and
I had agreed we would be willing to pay 5000 yen each. I guess we'll
have to fight over who pays the remaining 390.</p>

<p>Obviously it will be him because I paid the train fare to take the
camera to the shop.  Obviously it will be me because I hit the camera
in the first place.</p>

<p>Back to cleaning.</p>

<p class=date>1:12pm JST Tuesday 16 March 2004</p>

<p>Cleaning has been pretty successful.  I've thrown a lot of crap
away and gave away my old camera by putting it with a note down on the
table downstairs.  (I felt a bit upset when I later saw the note taped
to the 'public' computer and the camera left on the table (with no
note) but I realized being upset about that meant I hadn't actually
released the camera.  So I released it.)  Cleaning has slowed; I've
noted that I don't seem to have my new calendar anymore.  Fuck.  I
think it must be at work.  I intend to keep it more carefully than
leaving it various places.</p>

<p>I listened to one of the CDs janette sent me which included the
song "the way we ball" by Lil' Flip, and I was like, <em>hey I can
reduce wear and heat production by playing the copy I already have on
my hard drive</em>, so I searched for and subsequently played all the
songs that have the word "ball" in the title on my computer, which
included Bill Cosby's "baseball" (which I deleted as soon as I
listened to it once; it's hardly his best work), and also included
Scott's "Mia - The Ballad of Vincent Vega" which I quite enjoy and
reminded me of his song "Bryn - See you Sunday" which I listened to
and cried a bit; I miss my YRUU peeps.</p>

<p class=date>2:02pm</p>

<p>Crud.  I called work and the girl who answered couldn't find my
calendar.  I wonder where it is.</p>

<p class=date>2:13pm</p>

<p>Found it.  It was in my coat pocket, which I thought I had already
checked.</p>

<p>Ooh I'm glad I found it; I *did* have plans for today.  I'm going
to see Tony's paper merry go round.  Sweet.  Then I'm going to go to
Tsunash to get some internet access.</p>
