<p>I had Makiko today; we finished talking about giving directions,
which we've worked on during the previous double-header lesson we
had, where I made a 3D map of the area around her work so I could
understand how to describe where people should go to get different
places that she regularly needs to send them.  Today we worked on
generalized direction giving, and she lined up some of the same
language with the longer sentences I gave her so she could really
grok the vocab and the reason for saying it.  I think this was a
really good thing for her; I judge it would help me a lot with
learning the structures and the vocab all at once.</p>
