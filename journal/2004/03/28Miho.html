<p>The best thing about today, not including that I did 7 lessons in a
row, which proves I can easily handle packing in 5 lessons at a time
at Gaba, and not including hanging out with Miho from Nova for the
first time in general, is what Miho said to me while we were eating
ice cream at Denny's.</p>

<p>"I like Rob's lesson because you heard students carefully."</p>

<p>I was touched.  completely.  So much so that I couldn't bear to
correct "heard" to "listened to."  Oh my gosh what a blessing!!!</p>

<p>What a blessing.</p>

<p>I'm t i r e d .</p>
