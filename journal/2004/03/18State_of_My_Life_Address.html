<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type=A>
<li><p>Today is Maggie and Molly's birthday, and I've gotten them
nothing.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been to Fujikyu Highland three times.  Once with Nami (in
August 2003), once with janette (in January 2004), and once with Yuuko
(yesterday).  It was best with janette in January because there were
so few people crowding the place up.</p></li>

<li><p>I've got a pile of storage space on my site; I've been moving
more pics and even two movies of Tony's merry-go-round to my site.  I
really appreciate Fred's comment a long time ago, "bits are cheap,"
which has allowed me to keep pouring stuff into my site.</p></li>

<li><p>It's super windy here in Tokyo again today.  Fujiyama didn't
run consistently yesterday because of the wind.</p></li>

<li><p>I have recently moved to my new apartment in Motosumiyoshi.  I
can nearly write the kanji for my address.  I've not met everyone as
dynamically as I once imagined I might, but I have met some people.
Mostly it's cause I'm still not feeling perfectly settled here, and
I've been out of the apartment frequently.</p></li>

<li><p>I now work at Jiyugaoka Gaba.  I like it a *lot* more than
working at Nova.  There's like zero stress at Gaba.  I just roll in
there, check each client's info a few minutes before the lesson, teach
and write about it on the laptop in my cube.  No stress looking for
files (that someone else might have, that might have a different
number than what I'm looking for, that might be filed in the wrong
place, that might be missing altogether), trying to plan lessons, etc.
Bang easy.  Done.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer has been stable for a while and has even properly
been reading data from my camera's memory card as it should.  yay for
that.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently hung out with Sachiko and Satoko (frequent flyer AM
pair at Nova) and might go to a party with Sachiko next Friday or
next next Friday.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have a girlfriend.  I've begun to temper my kissing on
Yuuko, even.  I've just been less hornified; I wonder if it's because
I'm under less stress with new living/job situation.</p></li>

<li><p>I learned the word "さいしょ" which means first.  I think; I
kinda forgot since last night.  (yes; it's correct) I've recently
learned あさって and おととい (day after tomorrow and day before
yesterday), which are pretty good words to know.</p></li>

<li><p>Oooh. おととし means the year before last.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>I've gotten stuck here; I'm going to send some snail mails.</p>
