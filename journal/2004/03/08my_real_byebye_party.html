<p>The party was basically perfect.  I got a hanko from Morita, tons
of Japanese conversation poured into my ears, got to yammer with
everyone there, ate tons of food and OJ; had a great time.</p>

<p>Kathy was the only other teacher there.  Dan and Phong texted me
that they couldn't come.  So did Mamiko.</p>
