<p class=dream>I was in my dad's house as he was planning to make some
more remodeling changes.  The plans seemed well thought out and I was
really impressed with them except for one detail.  He was not
including a second staircase to get from the second floor to the first
floor in case of fire. I was like, where is the second staircase? And
he's like, "not gonna have one" and I'm like, what "if there is a
fire?"  and he's not swayed that this is a really good reason to
include a second staircase. I got really hot about the situation.  I
was like yelling and angry at my dad, which was a big deal for me.  I
was like, "what if there is a fucking fire and you get sued a million
dollars because some cat dies because there is no staircase?  A new
staircase, repairing the old external staircase would only cost around
800 dollar and that's well worth the investment to not have a million
dollar lawsuit."</p>

<p class=dream>He was all, "how do you know it would only cost 800
dollars?" and I'm like, "I have a sense of how much wood costs", and I
could see him smile inwardly; his son was growing up in more than just
awareness, but in guts, too.  He still wasn't convinced and I began to
wonder if this was just an elaborate scheme to allow him to guage how
well I had grown.</p>

<p>In "real" life, I am sad that I've not been in contact with my dad.
He's not emailed me in a long time, and I've emailed him and called
him a few times. I blame his new wife, and I feel sadness for my dad's
new life; he seems to have changed everything that he once stood for.
whatever that means.  I miss my dad.</p>
