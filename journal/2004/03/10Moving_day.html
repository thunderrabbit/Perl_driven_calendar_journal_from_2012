<p>Now I can say that most of my stuff is in my new apartment.  Super
special thanks to Yuuko for her car and mad driving skills (and good
humor through getting lost repeatedly in this zoo of small one way
streets haphazardly blocked by signs enforcing foot traffics' right
of way and bisected abruptly by a street level train line with trains
each direction every 4 or 5 minutes).</p>

she took me to a store where I bought a thick mattress that folds into
a chair and a three drawer plastic chest of drawers.  We took that
load to my apartment and got a picture of me in the zipper bag posing
as a new robot.</p>
