<p>Just met Kimika, a student who has (now) two more lessons.  I
taught her two today, and have 1 more (her last one) with her at 4pm
on the 26th.  After that she'll be moving into her parents house for a
month and then her grandmother's house for 10 days and then will go to
NZ for a year!  She's a bit nervous about the whole ordeal and I told
her I totally understood.  I greatly encouraged her to get a diary and
begin to write.  I'm thinking of buying one for her.</p>

<p>I just love how at Gaba I feel like part of the group.  Really;
everyone is super friendly.</p>
