<p>Dan and I went riding our bikes on this glorious (ly windy) day and
had tons of fun riding around and getting lost and finding a shop to
fix my flat tire and rolling down a speedy hill and steps and
everything.  Fun fun stuff.</p>

<p>The d'oh part is that for some reason, I felt inspired to ride as
close as possible to Dan when it was my turn to be the star of an
action shot on my bike.  Hit his arm and he dropped the camera.
Expensive digital camera.  That he has borrowed from a friend.  Fuck.
I encouraged Dan to call his friend and let him know what's up, but
he's chosen not to do that.  I am not really sure where's the "best"
place to take it to get it fixed or replaced or what.  I've emailed
Yuuko to ask her.</p>
