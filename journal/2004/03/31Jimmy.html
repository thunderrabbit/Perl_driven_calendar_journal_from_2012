<p>Jimmy woke me up, calling this morning around 10:25.  He said he
had some more ideas for my roller coaster book, so we're going to meet
in a bit to talk about them.  He says, "I'm the ultimate enabler."
That sounds like a good thing for me.</p>

<p>D'oh.  My bike got jacked.  Going to the police station with my
registration to get it back.</p>

<p>Jimmy hung out at my house while I looked for the registration.  I
couldn't find it anywhere it seemed.  But I got a lot of cleaning done
on my room.  <! Jimmy gave me a foot massage and > I meditatively
visualized my bicycle coming back to me easily and simply with no
embarassment or difficulties on anyone's part.  When the <! massage
and > mditation finished <! themselves,> I got up and looked in two
places; the second had my registration.</p>
