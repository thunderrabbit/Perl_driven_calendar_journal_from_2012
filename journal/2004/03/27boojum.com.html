<p>After the great capital of China debate, I surfed around to see
what name different sources said.  I found two before I got
distracted; they both said Beijing.</p>

<p>I got distracted with names of cities in Mongolia.  Things like
Ulaan Baatur and cool stuff like that.  I'm like, "I should go there
just so I can say I've been to a city with a crazy name."</p>

<p>A little research produced a website for a horseback tour agency
called <a href="http://www.boojum.com/">boojum</a> (taken from Lewis
Carroll because of the wanderistic nature of the company) that gives
horseback tours around Mongolia!  Wow.  I might do it for my 12500th
day present.</p>

<p>Jesse says: "Yeah right; good luck.  Watch out for the
mosquitoes."</p>
