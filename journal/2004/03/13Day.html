<p class=date>2:33am JST Sunday 14 March 2004</p>

<p>Today was a super productive day, with lots of cool things to
write, but so far I've written almost nothing.</p>

<p>Spent the night last night at Tsunashima; at this point I don't
remember specifics, but I woke up in the AM, meditatively wrote down
a list of things to do, and did most of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pack hat, bike pump, gloves, et. al.</p></li>

<li><p>Bicycle to Motosumiyoshi</p></li>

<li><p>Check internet connection.</p></li>

<li><p>Talk to Rene about internet, light, and closet.</p></li>

<li><p>take camera to Yodobashi camera</p></li>

<li><p>copy key</p></li>

<li><p>buy a trashcan and tie rack</p></li>

<li><p>Write a letter to ____</p></li>

<li><p>Fix robots.txt</p></li>

<li><p>Meet Yuuko, move the rest of my stuff, buy her dinner</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(2) the hill at Hiyoshi station is significant.</p>

<p>(3) there was a sign on the dry erase board that said the problem
would be resolved in a few days.</p>

<p>(4) chose not to talk about closet; he wasn't home anyway, so I
didn't talk to him today.</p>

<p>(5) The guy said it would take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>(6) While looking for Mister Minit, a key copying shop, I went down
the adjacent street (not remembering where Mr M was exactly and this
guy was like, "eee?" which means "[is it] good?" or in this case,
"would you like to come see our quality goods and services?"  and I
had no idea what he was talking about so I basically ignored him.</p>

<p>It became apparent I was on the wrong street or had missed Mr M, so
I turned around and had to listen to this guy again.  This time I was
like, "nan des ka?"  (what is it?) and he made a face like he was
throwing food in his mouth or throwing up or like he was shooting
vomit across the room like in The Exorcist and I was
like, <em>????</em> and he goes, "service" and waved at his
crotch.</p>

<p>Oh jeez; I got it.  Suddenly I was disgusted by his display, and
was like, "oh no" and walked away.  For a moment afterward, I was
turned on at the mystery of it all.  But then I thought about what it
would really be like, and (mostly) how much money it would probably
cost and I was glad for my decision.</p>

<p>On my way back into the right area to find Mr M, I found Yutaka, a
student from Nova!  What a surprise!  So I asked him where Mr M was
and he showed me immediately.  Yay for local knowledge.</p>

<p>(7) I also bought a plastic burr puzzle for Fred.  12 pieces: 4
each yellow, blue, red.</p>

<p>(9) to allow <a href="http://www.archive.org">archive.org</a> to
crawl my site.</p>

<p>(10) she met me in Tsunashima, we moved the last load, (taught her
the word "mess" as in "my room is now a big mess") ate at Denny's then
went back to Tsunashima to drop off the drawers in which we had moved
everything, ended up staying there for hours (four.five hours)
sleeping some and playing hackey sack with Dan.  Weird how when I
wanted to sleep she wouldn't let me (this will be the end of us) and
when Dan arrived, she was suddenly sleepy.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Back at home now and it's 2:55 am and the guys downstairs are
debating loudly enough to keep me awake.  Fortunately, I have ear
plugs.</p>

<p>ps: the internet access is not working although the whiteboard has
been updated saying that internet is working.  Mystery.</p>
