<p>Just played 15 minutes of Hackey Sack Jack with Jesse, making it
HSJJ.  Money.</p>

<p>We had been study/chatting in the teachers room, when, for no
apparent reason, I pulled my hackey sack out of my pocket and tossed
it to my other hand.</p>

<p>[blink] goes Jesse.  "You play hackey sack?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah (!)  Let's go."</p>

<p>Jesse grabbed *his* hackey sack, which is a really quality footbag.
Leather, with dense small pellets, and excellent for stalls.  "Damn!
This bag can't help but stall."</p>

played out kinda behind the building in a roped off area that we
decided was just for our entertainment.  "There's no room, otherwise."
True enough to be true.</p>

<p>Jesse was able to do a tie stall three times.  His hackey sackey
style is mostly using feet; he can do inside kicks well, and his
outside kicks got better through the 20 minutes that we played.  (He
hadn't played in a year before this.)</p>

<p>My style is mostly using my knees.  I kept getting flubbed up when
the sack would hit my lump of gloves in the front pocket of my hoodie,
but I did generally well; I was glad and we both had way fun.</p>
