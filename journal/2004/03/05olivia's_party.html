<p>Studied briefly with Kathy at Starbucks tonight and then went to
Yokohama to meet Olivia et. al. <a
href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/janette_fred/Page8.shtml">for her
party</a>!  KG Miki was included in the et. al.; I was really happy
about that.  Good times were had by all, especially on the second
floor when leaving.  Dan and I have more plans for that.</p>
