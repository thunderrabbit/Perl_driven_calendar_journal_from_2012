<p>I was late to my Japanese lesson today.  I called Ayana but she
didn't answer.  I told Ayana this and she was like, "really?" and I
checked.  Oops; I had called Akina.</p>

<p>I was able to read from the book kinda sorta fast, after a slow
pass or two.  Partially I had memorized the words, and not-so-much
linked the kanji to words in my mind.  But progress was made even
so.</p>

<p>After the lesson, that cute girl who is always behind the counter
when I arrive was not behind the counter, but chillin' outside
against the rail next to the street.  Ayana was like, "you want to
talk to her; I gotta go."</p>

<p>I was like, "おなまえは。。" and she's like, "ゆり" though
actually she said a long something and then "yuri.  Nice to meet
you.  はじめまして。"</p>

<p>I told her my name and she didn't get it the first time so I wrote
it on the trunk of the nearby motorcycle with my finger, and kinda
scratched the trunk's sunfaded plastic surface, and I was nervous and
misspelled it (in katakana, I was like "ラブ wait, no ロブ") so that
was kinda weird, but it all worked out, I'm sure.  I felt bad about
marking that motorcycle, plus, <em>oh great, on the first time we met
I defaced private property.</em></p>

<p>Oh well.</p>
