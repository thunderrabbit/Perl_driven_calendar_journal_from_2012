<p>My first onsen today.   Indoor co-ed place, with all the
amenities.  Lockers open by putting my clock shaped wristband in
front of the locker.  I can buy food with the wristband, too.</p>

<p>Wow. Fun fun fun.  It reminded me of a futuristic utopia, with
couples walking around in loose cotton coat-shirts, enjoying the
spotless baths of all variety of temperatures and styles.</p>

any of this brine water touching the eyes was something of a party
stopper.  Floating on my back allowed the water to, let's say,
disinfect nicks under my chin from shaving.  Eeee.  In this pool Íµ»Ò
and I played float around with eyes closed and after a few minutes try
to point to my camera (a convenient arbitrary point).  We found large
discrepencies between our optical and our inner ear's belief about
where things are. (*)</p>

<p>(*) "optical" means pertaining to light, and in this case, our eyes
using light to gather information about our surroundings.  What means
pertaining to balance, our inner ears feeling changes in orientation
and momentum to gather information about our surroundings?</p>

<p>Anyway, the "Cairo" sauna was Super hot and humid, almost chokingly
so.  I didn't seem able to relax in there enough to actually sleep.  I
had to breathe slowly or my lungs would choke and my heart would speed
up in that room.  Wow.</p>

<p>We enjoyed sleeping on the large warmed marble pedestal.  This room
was all white marble, with a meter tall white marble pedestal in the
middle, about as big as a king size bed.  This room reminded me of
ancient Rome, not that I consciously remember being there.  This was
one of my favorite places, but I forgot to get a picture of it
though.</p>

<p>Though the weather was literally freezing today when we arrived,
and stayed pretty cold all day, the water in the outer pools was well
hot enough to make staying in them very long an overheating
experience.  There were some girls shooting water canons (more like
pistols, but the pistols were mounted on the wall of the pool, unlike
plastic toys) at a target that would turn on a hot fountain thing in
the middle of the pool, and I found myself wondering if I wanted to
know them more.  Like, how old are they?  I think they were just
flip-flat too young for me to even bother saying HI, much less
considering hanging out with them.  But at the same time I was like
who are they?  What are they like?  Do they speak English?  This last
question made my brain go "aru?" because my mind apparently thinks
that these previous questions can be answered only if they speak
English.</p>

<p>I didn't talk to them.</p>

<p>We saw some other outdoor pools, one of which was called "coffee."
I was like, "is it <em>coffee</em> coffee?"  It was.  I got in it just
for the picture, but dude, I assure you it was disgusting.  Like a
sick watered down coffee flavor, a flavor which I hate anyway, but
somehow watering it down made it even worse; I guess the smell was
made worse by weakening it.  Bluh.</p>

<p>Íµ»Ò is tired (me too); we're going to rock out of here and maybe
I'll write more.  In short, this day was money.</p>
