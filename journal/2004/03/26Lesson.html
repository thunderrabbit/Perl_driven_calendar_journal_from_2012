<p>Lesson was pretty good.  When I arrived, I saw Jimmy (da magnet)
having a coffee so I sat down with him for a bit.  He said he was
interested in taking Japanese class, and was impressed with the
price, so he may hook it up with Ayana.</p>

<p>I hadn't studied hard core, but some stuff that I studied over the
week remained in my brain: おととい、昨日、えらぶ</p>

<p>I was also able to read some kanji and figure out/remember the
meaning of 魚.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After lesson, Ayana went to a book store and I tagged along because
she said it was pretty big and would have some English / hiragana
maps.  I bought a southeast Asia map in English and a Tokyo map in
Japanese.</p>

<p>I hadn't previously planned to otherwise visit a bookstore, so I
flipped a coin to see about buying a diary for Kimika.  It said
no.</p>

<p>My first lesson at work is at 3:15.</p>
