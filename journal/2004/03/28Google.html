I'm smilin'.

I made a guess that (and how) google would make it easy to get
definitions.  (In this case I wanted to confirm the spelling)

http://www.google.com/search?q=define:diligence&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

I note that
http://www.google.com/search?q=define:dilligence&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
doesn't say "did you mean diligence?"

I sent them feedback:


Thank you for being the best thing since bread itself, far surpassing
sliced bread.  I think you can be the best thing since *flour* by
making a tweak to your define: function, which, btw, I made a guess
would exist, given some of the other "modes" available.  Good work on
thinking of it before I did.

Sorry; here's the point: define:dilligence doesn't recognize that I've
misspelled the word.
http://www.google.com/search?q=dilligence&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 recognizes
the misspelled word.  It would be superfly if define:dilligence said,
"do you mean diligence?"  (and takes the liberty of searching for
define:diligence since define:dilligence had no results.)

Thank you for being so awesome; may you continue to make the web useful.
