<p>Yuuko called as I found the registration, and she drove over to
help me report my bike stolen.  We checked out hanami along the small
river on the way to the cop station.  She helped translate, and called
the bike shop with at which the bike had been registered and let them
know the situation or something.  I'm glad about that, for I couldn't
have done that part by any stretch.  I was generally able to
understand what the police officer wanted me to write and tell him
about the bike, and I drew a picture to describe how I had locked the
bike, though not tightly to the frame and not through a loop (stupid
stupid topographic error I made) and I assume that's how it was taken.
fuck.</p>

<p>But Yuuko and I had fun together and I bought her a snack at 7-11
(yes, there are some here) and we ate in a little park under the shade
of sakura (cherry (blossom) trees), watching a girl riding around on a
unicycle and kids playing in the wet sand with shovels.  We smelled
some cherry blossoms on a tree next to the small river thing near my
house that's shaded with cherry blossom trees.  (they don't provide
much shade, actually).  I accidentally knocked my plastic bottle of
tea into the river and I was unable to recover it easily without
getting really muddy so I decided to pick up ten different pieces of
litter.  We walked along the river and I collected trash, counting in
Japanese.  I joked about putting bicycles (cars, houses, trees, etc.)
into my little plastic bag, just for entertainment value.  In the
river I noticed a red-ear slider (as we called this type of turtle
back on Methil Drive) and we followed it for a bit.</p>

<p>裕子 is funny.  She listened as I left a high-speed English
message to Jimmy about another cool idea I've had about making
history interactive and after I hung up the phone, I asked Yuuko if
she understood what I said: "わかった？"</p>

<p>She said, "わかった。" (I understand), which I knew was a lie
because she had no context for the message, much less could she have
kept up with the speed of my speech.</p>

<p>So I was like, "何？"  (what [did I say]?)</p>

<p>She goes, "今日さくら見た、きれいだったよ。かめも見た。"</p>

<p>And I was like, "HAHAHAHAHAHAA" cause I knew most of what she said,
and it was really funny.  I had some context which increased my
comprehension.</p>

<p>It reminded me of "Hello, my name is Bingo; I like to climb on
things; can I have a banana?  Eeek eek!" which is the main reason it
was funny.  She said, "Today we saw cherry blossoms (sakura) and they
were pretty.  We also saw a turtle."</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAAHAAA!</p>
