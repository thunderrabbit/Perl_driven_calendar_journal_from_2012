<p>Today is beautiful and sunny.</p>

<p>Even though I (inadvertantly) got the express train here, I arrived
4 minutes after their 1 hour lunch break started.  I'm in
Shin-Yurigaoka out by a waterfall thing that reminds me of a happy
memory (*).  I've just eaten lunch ("I'm gonna eat lunch, too.") and
talked to Nami, with whom I've not hung out since October or November.
We may hang out soon.  Anyway, in a bit I will go to the visa
immigration office to get my visa extended.</p>

<p>(*) In Memphis, hanging out with Lisa, we went to a working model
of the Mississippi River (that was on an island(?) on the Mississippi)
made of concrete plates, kinda like a relief map.  I've lost my
vocabulary (if I ever had it) for this.  The point is, water poured
through this model Mississippi and, being in a relatively outgoing
mood and enjoying a relatively warm sunny day, I sat in the middle of
the model river to make a human dam.  So much fun from a play in the
water point of view, and so interesting from a how far back will the
water be affected point of view, and so challenging as in how do I
most effectively block the water in this squared off channels with my
rounded off butt?</p>

<p>Super happy thoughts to Lisa for sharing that fun day with me.</p>
