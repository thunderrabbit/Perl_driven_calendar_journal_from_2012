<p>After work Sachiko met me at Jiyugaoka station - came in the
blistering cold with her friend ¤«¤Á¤ó to walk me back to some
izakiah where she was having a gathering of her peeps.  
Satoko, Tomomi, Shou, Tsukan, Chikako</p>

<p>oops I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p>Chikako seemed to be the least drunk and I didn't notice her
smoking while I was there.  Her English is really good; we'll hang
out again.</p>

<p>Work starts in as few as 7.5 hours.</p>
