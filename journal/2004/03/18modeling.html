<p>Went downstairs and Ricky was watching TV.  On TV was a guy who
looked a lot like Ricky.  "Is that you?"</p>

<p>"ya," but his voice was kinda squeaky-hoarse, and I kinda didn't
believe it could be true.</p>

<p>"Is that you on TV?"</p>

<p>"ya," same squeak.</p>

<p>"That's amazing," and I continued my trek to hang up my laundry.</p>

<p><em>That does it; I'm going to call those modeling agency numbers
that Clayton gave me months ago.</em></p>

<p>And that's just what I did.</p>

<p>ps: internet is up in my room now.  :-)</p>

<p>Ricky is a bit loud and possibly obnoxious.  I've been a bit
tentative around the place here, wondering what's appropriate attire
for going down to the shower area from my room.  Ricky goes down in a
towel.  I'm going to go down in a towel.</p>
