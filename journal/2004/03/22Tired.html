<p>Work was good.  I had 7 lessons and got lots of studying done.
Everyone at work is friendly and helpful.  Just a really nice place to
be.  I feel like part of the team already instead of an outsider for
9+ months like I felt at Nova.  I'm really thankful to my coworkers
for being so cool and for the staff for helping me with Japanese (and
being so cool).</p>

<p>Today after work I saw Ricky on the train and chatted with him a
bit on the way home.  He still seems a bit mysterious to me.  We
watched MIB downstairs with John, and then watched The World According
To Garp, which was not the comedy I suspected, but a bizarre movie
about which I knew less than nothing.</p>

<p>Because it's so cold, I considered sleeping in my 6 tatami closet,
which I could pretty easily (and cheaply) keep warm.  But the floor of
the closet is thin laminate and not actual boards nor tatami, so I
don't think it would effectively support my weight.  But it woulda
been fun like a camping trip.</p>

<p>終わり。 おやすみ。</p>
