<p>I'm glad I've correctly recognized Hitoe and Shoko at home today.
Hitoe was on the couch watching Discovery Channel about Nefertiti, and
I helped her watch.  We chatted a bit, and I was able to tell her 90%
of the plot of Brother Bear in 80% Japanese.  So I guess that's worth
telling 72% of the movie in Japanese.  I'm getting better.</p>

<p>Thanks to her and others for helping me.</p>
