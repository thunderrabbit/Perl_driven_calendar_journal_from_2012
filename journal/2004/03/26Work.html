<p>I've gotten two 5-5 lessons.  Yay!  My first lesson today is a
[student's] First Lesson.  This will by my first First Lesson.</p>

<p class=date>4:56pm JST Friday 26 March 2004</p>

<p>First lesson's First Lesson went well.  Got through the material,
but found some grammar problems that are assumed not to be problems by
this book.</p>

<p>Just taught Kimika.  Told her that I had considered getting her a
diary.  Before lesson, one of the other teachers was chatting it up
with her.  During lesson, she gave me an idividually wrapped chocolate
after I thanked her for giving me chocolate in a quick role play.  She
ate one and then gave me the rest of the pack.  (I don't know a word
that means a "stick" of individually wrapped chocolates like starburst
is wrapped.)  I gave her one more chocolate from the pack after I
assumed that her piece, like mine, had dissolved to nothingness.
After lesson, another teacher was chatting it up with her.  I'm
jealous, but I'm more sitting within the emotion than acting on
it.  <em>More fish in the sea</em> is going through my brain.</p>

<p>She has perfect teeth and great smile and cute little voice and
soft-looking hair.  But she didn't always understand my questions
today.  I don't know how much it was because my brain was thinking of
ways to exchange emails, and how much it was because she didn't have
the language yet.</p>

<p>Release.</p>

<p>I taught Mariko, and it was great fun.  She had questions about how
to direct people to various places around her work, and I asked her to
draw a map, but the terrain included hills, so we ended up making a 3D
model out of paper.  A crap model, but it worked to get the terrain
into my brain so I could write the verbage for her.  It was a double
lesson and we barely had time to get it all done.  I'm really glad to
be that flexible and able to help.</p>
