<p>Today I've been productive already.  Got my address changed on my
gaijin card at the ward office (far easier than I suspected; they
just write it on the back of the card), mailed the old apartment key
back to Nova (had to improvise an envelope with a piece of paper
obtained from an English speaking woman at the post office), and went
to get my bicycle parking pass.</p>

<p>On Saturday (my convenient day off), I went to the bike parking lot
to see how to get a monthly pass.  I rolled around the parking lot,
looking for what could possibly be the identifying feature.  I found
the pattern after a while; each bike had either a piece of paper wired
to it (day pass) or a red tag hanging from it.  (interestingly, the
red tags, although more resistant to weathering, were usually less
effectively connected to the bicycles.  some red tags were just
loosely tied to the handle bars.)  I went to the booth and tried to
describe what I wanted to buy.  "ちさい　あかい　タグ" (small red tag
(or maybe "eat my shorts")) but he wasn't getting it.  So I was like,
"来て下さい" (come here please) and was like <em>one of these</em>,
pointing to a tag on one of the bicycles in the parking lot.  He was
like, "oh!!" and gave me a small sheet of paper to fill out.  I
figured it needed my address, so I said "okay　わかった" (okay I
understand).</p>

<p><em>Awesome.</em>  I thought.</p>

<p>Today I still had no idea how to fill out the form, so I went back
and was like, "わからない" (I don't understand) and the guy filled
out my shit, given my newly changed address on the back of my gaijin
card, and then he was like, "wakka wakka wakka wakka wakka wakka" and
showed me a stack of papers like the one I had filled out, putting
mine at the bottom.  I was like, <em>okay, you've got a lot of
papers</em> and he showed me specifically the date on the top paper
(14年) and I'm like, <em>aight, you've been collecting them for 2
years</em> and I pulled out my money to pay.</p>

<p>They were like, "wakka wakka wakka wakka wakka" and I was
like, <em>??</em> "いつ" (when), and they were like, "one year half"
(one and a half years).</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>I won't even be here in a year and a half (probably).  And they're
just sitting on their collective asses making more money by *not*
processing the month pass requests, thereby forcing everyone to pay
150 yen per day instead of 2100 yen per month; what a beauracratic
nightmare!  (fuck I still don't know how to spell beauracratic (and my
internet is still down so I can't look it up... oh wait it might be in
my electronic dictionary (but I can't find it so nevermind)))</p>

<p>I rolled around a bit and found another bike parking lot.  The guy
was like, "wakka wakka wakka" and I'm like, "じてんしゃ　てっきを買い
たい" (I want to buy a bike pass) and he's like, "自転車てっき?wakka
wakkaニ三年ぐらいwakka" (bike pass? wakka 2 or 3 years wakka.)</p>

<p>Dammit.  I realize now that was my perfect chance to say "うそう"
(really??) (though it may be only fit for casual speaking), but I was
like, "wow.  なんで" (why?)</p>

<p>"wakka wakka いっぱい自転車" (wakka many bicycles)</p>

<p>He then explained "wakka wakka wakka wakka wakka wakka wakka マクド
ナルドス wakka wakka 左 wakka wakka wakka" (..... McDonald's .... left
....) which I took to mean, go to the McDonald's turn left and you
may have better luck there.  I think he also explained the history of
the problem.  He pointed to a rather large apartment building and I
took it to mean either I could park there, or when the apartment was
built, a quagmire of bicycle riders moved to the area.</p>

<p>So.  Musashi Kosugi is so crowded that we can't even easily park
bicycles.</p>
