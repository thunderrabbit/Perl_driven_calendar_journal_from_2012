<p>Awesome.  Work was pretty much super fast today; no worries
(except one (*)) and it just flew-ish by. I had nine lessons today
between 1pm and 8:25pm</p>

<p>(*) the one lesson that kinda fucked me up was a level up test.  I
forgot how to administer the test, so I winged it.  I talked to Eric
afterward and he showed me how.  I had forgotten in the month since I
had training.  Oops.  No worries though; I was upfront about fucking
up and he didn't make a big deal about it.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Now I'm on a train to Yokohama to meet Lyle (!) (I thought he had
left town) et. al.  He said I should bring info like an old CD or book
that I don't want anymore.  I brought a semi-backup CD of mp3s from my
computer and a book called Ishmael, about a gorilla that talks about
how we can recover our souls in the wack society.</p>

<p>I never finished the book; I couldn't get past the premise of a
gorilla talking.</p>

<p>I asked Lyle, "is bringing the book or CD critical or just
whatever?"</p>

<p>"Um, it's critical."</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>
