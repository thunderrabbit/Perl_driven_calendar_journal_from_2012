<p class=date>2:18am JST Tuesday 16 March 2004</p>

<p>Went downstairs and hung out watching TV with the guys who were
down there.  One guy from NZ, a guy named Ryan from the states it
sounded like, one guy who seemed English but with apparently fluent
Spanish, and a couple others.</p>

<p>They all left and a dude who looks to my ignorant brain like he's
from India, and speaks English with the accent I associate with people
who I think are from India, yet is named Roger, told me his story of
how he's lived in Japan for 16 years and just recently has been
separated by/from his wife, who has taken their 7 year old daughter.
Holy fuck what a story that I'm thankful to not experience.</p>

<p>My biggest concern is that I still don't have internet access, but
that will apparently be resolved on 18 March.  Holy shit that's
Maggie's birthday!!!!!!!!!!  And I haven't gotten her anything!  And
Molly's birthday toooo!</p>

<p>Oh crudola on missing birthdays.  And that means Colleen's is just
around the corner.  26 March.  Yep.  The day I left for Japan last
year.</p>
