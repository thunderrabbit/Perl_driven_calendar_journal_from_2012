<p>Amazed at how many things I can find to procrastinate.  And I
don't seem to know why I'm procrastinating.</p>

<p>But, I took my suit to the cleaners (and the guy provided the
epitome of attentive perfect Japanese customer service), and I took my
bike to the bike shop to get my seat reattached to the seat post.  It
had been glued to the seat post, but the glue got old (or tired) and
it came out of the post.  The guy reglued the seat, got a little dab
of glue *on* the seat.  I don't think the seat cover was texturally
damaged, but it did stain a bit.  300 yen for the service.</p>
