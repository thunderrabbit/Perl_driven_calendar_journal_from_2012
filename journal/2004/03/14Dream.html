<p class=dream>I had a birds' eye view of a scene created to be art: a
farmer had collected 6 geese, 7 maids, 3 cows, and 2 something else,
and though the numbers were off, I guessed it was supposed to
represent some of the items in the 12 Days of Christmas song.  Then a
fourth cow joined the picture by *falling out of the sky* upside-down
onto the backs of the other cows.  I was like, "wha?" trying to figure
out the symolism of changing 3 to 4, and <b>then</b> a giant yeti
walked onto the scene, picked up the cow that had just fallen and ate
it.</p>
