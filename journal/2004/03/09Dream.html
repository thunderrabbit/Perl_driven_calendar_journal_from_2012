<p class=dream>Inside a house that had a pool out front.  On the
bottom of the pool a large, realistic image of a woodpecker had been
painted.  I wanted a picture of that woodpecker, but I couldn't get a
good shot of it from inside the house.  I needed to be farther away,
and up higher or the image would be too oblique.  Fortunately, the
house was built somewhat like a ferris wheel.  It started as a normal
one story house, and then a lower story kinda grew up underneath that
first story, causing it to become the second story.  The action wasn't
a straight vertical growth, but as the new bottom story grew larger
than the top story, the top story slid back to remain centered on the
bottom story.  So my point of view of the woodpecker shifted just like
I needed it to; higher and farther back.  But then the lower story
itself eclipsed my view of the woodpecker as the lower portion of the
house grew large enough to cover part of the pool.</p>

<p class=dream>Doh; it became apparent that I needed to climb up onto
the roof of the house.  There were several non-specific students plus
Kaori there, but no one expressed surprise nor concern about my
climbing onto the roof.  I held my camera in one hand and tried to
climb out the window and up onto the shingles of the roof with the
other.  I realized it was a bit silly to do that so I turned the
camera off and put it in my pocket and then climbed the rest of the
way up onto the roof.</p>

<p class=dream>As I turned my camera on, someone started fucking with
the house and it began to close up again.  Actually this was perfect
because I would have just the right moment to take the picture after
the lower portion had moved fully out of the way and the upper portion
was still far enough away.  I took the picture, but the camera was
moving at the time as I was trying to stay balanced on the roof, and
the roof shifted past the point where I could stay balanced so I lept
to the ground.</p>

<p class=dream>Hmmm.  I saw that I could take a picture from the
opposite side of the pool by climbing some thin but basically stable
trees over there.  The trees were rather small, but kinda gnarled like
large vines that had grown haphazardly through small spaces and back
out again.  I found lots of tiny twigs that impeded my way, but I
generally was able to climb past them without breaking them off.  A
rather large spiderweb tent thing (cross between a web for a spider
and a tent for tentworms) (built over the years it seemed) strung
between some partially rotten branches and some good branches had
captured several bugs and larvae and such, but didn't seem dangerous
for me while I was taking a picture of the woodpecker in the pool.</p>

<p class=dream>I faced away from the web toward the pool and my view
was partially obscured by leaves, so I shifted a bit higher past those
branches and got a great view.  Kaori was walking toward the pool and
I told her to act natural.  I took the first picture as an owl flew by
the woodpecker, partially obsuring it.  The second picture was taken
while a squirrel ran across the pool partically obscuring it.  The
third picture was unobscured and included Kaori artistically posed
next to the pool admiring the image that was the focus of these
pictures in the first place.</p>

<p class=dream>Successful in my quest, I climbed down the tree and
woke up toward the realization that the memory card from my dream
camera couldn't be connected this computer.</p>
