<p>Just got my computer back.  Hey, the time is set incorrectly.</p>

<p class=date>8:55pm JST Tuesday 2 March 2004</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Today I had planned to move a load of stuff to my new apartment.
That idea dwindled when I began to contemplate how to move piles of
papers and crap over.  It became apparent that I needed to do some
organizing, so I went to the 100 yen store and bought some scrapbook
pages and made 11 scrapbook pages with a good portion of the little
scraps of papers I had accumualted.</p>

<p>I recognized the value of paying my rent today so I spent some
time at the new apartment, paid my 58万円 to Rene, and hung out with
John who was watching a cooking show and says he loves to cook.  He
lives in the room next to mine.</p>

<p>I took a token load over: my dress shoes (which I found today,
after having misplaced them in my underwear drawer), and the bottle
of Dr Bronner's that janette brought me.</p>

<p>Yay: I just got my computer to display the date in Japanese
format.</p>

<p>Boo: I forgot to put in a load of LAUNDRY before we left for
Ginza.</p>

<p>裕子 and I are on our way back from 銀座 after having picked up my
computer from the Apple store there.  This is the second time I've had
the motherboard replaced (he called it a logic board; I wonder if that
is an apple thing or an industry thing or just him) in six months.  He
suggested I get a <a href="http://www.medicalmac.com/ELtop7.html">-4C
for PowerBook G4</a> to keep the machine cooler when I'm using it.  I
hope that helps.</p>

<p>Right now I'm not in the mood to write tons about every detail
that would have been captured, but here's what I think of now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I woke up from a vivid dream that, summarized, gave me an idea
for how to begin doing little practice things of getting myself "out
there" and meeting people.  And as I move to a new apartment and a new
job, I can be a new person, as I did when I shifted from high school
to 2 year college to a 4 year university.  Each time I was like, "be
less shy," and it worked to a great extent.  I'm considering doing
things like offering to treat people to dinner at their favorite local
restaurant in my new areas.  That way I get to meet people and eat
good food.  And do something that most people (I imagine) don't
do.</p></li>

<li><p>I will definitely miss Dan if I don't see him as much after
moving. We plan to play hackeysack tonight.</p>

<p>Dan is feeling a bit sick lately, and he's considering moving
into my room when I move out.  I told him that I would delay my move
until he feels better so he can move only when he's genki.</p></li>

<li><p>Jiyugaoka is spelled 自由が丘 and pronounced じゆうがおか。
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We are in 自由が丘 now; the faster train will stop here soon;
we're going to jump over to it.  Bye!</p>
