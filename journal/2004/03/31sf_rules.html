Mr Rob wishes to express to Mr Philip Mr Rob's appreciation of Mr
Philip's continued concern and Mr Philip's continued pleasant
demeanor.  If Mr Philip observes the SF url in question, Mr Philip
will likely note that the Southwest District YRUU Silent Football
Rules have been removed along with the basic description of SF.
However, Mr Rob has not removed, and will continue choosing not to
remove, the pages describing wormholes and parallel universes, and the
foot motions for moving the sacred football, as these pages only refer
to the basic rules of SF vaguely, and without specific description
given to the technique by which the basic motions are performed.
Further, as Mr Philip has previously expressed, the wormholes and
parallel universes are unprecedented in the history of SF and, Mr Rob
posits, may therefore be described in any medium Mr Rob chooses,
without damaging the sanctity of SF's own basic rules.  Though Mr
Philip did not express the fact directly, Mr Rob believes further that
the foot motions described on Mr Rob's website are equally
unprecedented in the history of SF and are therefore as equally
describable as the rules regarding wormholes and parallel universes.
Mr Rob trusts that Mr Philip agrees with Mr Rob on these points, and
further, Mr Rob trusts that Mr Philip agrees that Mr Rob has completed
Mr Rob's task of removing the basic rules to SF from Mr Rob's site.

Mr. Rob:

I'm sorry to say that the claim that our games are inherently
different is dubious at best.  When considering various factors, of
which just a few are: methods surrounding the address of the leader,
the arbitrary and complete authority of the leader, the game setup,
the methods of moving the football, and of course, the identical name,
provide every indication that our games are one and the same and have
only very cosmetic differences, the most notable of which is the names
of the various moves, which serve nearly identical purposes.  I
respectfully request that on your honor and the honor of the noble
institution of Silent Football, that you fulfill your end of the
bargain, so to speak, and remove all but the most vague references to
SF from your website, as you promised.  I feel as if I have,
completely and satisfactorily, provided you with the information you
were seeking from a highly reliable source, which was only given to me
after my implicit trust was attained, (and needless to say, this
information is highly secretive, and I am very priveleged, as you are,
to have received it) and thus rightfully expect what was promised to
me.  Thank you, and good luck in all your future endeavors.

Mr. Philip
