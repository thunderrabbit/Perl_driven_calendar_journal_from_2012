<p>I got halfway stuck today.  Wrote one page letter to Miho and 1
page worth of a letter to someone who might read this page, and
didn't get to the letter-sending stage.  Got stuck online.  It's too
cold to venture outside.  Time to go to work now.  Fred sent me <a
href="http://www.brunostrip.com/1998.html">Bruno</a> a comic about a
woman who seems to go through the same things as (all of us) me.</p>
