<p>Ikumi and I explored the first and part of the second floor of the
house next door.  The rooms on the first floor are big.</p>

<p>I wanted to go to the third floor, but it was dark on the way to
the steps, with metal ceiling-support poles in the path, so Ikumi
didn't want to go.  I chose not to go alone.</p>

<p>Afterward, she bounced some ideas about going to the US to get a
job in website design as a steppin' stone to get to design in England.
For some silly reason, I didn't think to tell her about Dude, but I'll
tell her.</p>

<p>Ikumi and Shoko yammered in Japanese about stuff, and I was able
to understand about 1/2 of it.</p>
