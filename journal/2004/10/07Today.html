<p>Today from 10 to noon I traded English for Chinese
instruction. Today we got a quiet room in which to study, but my tape
recorder didn't work for some reason.  Not sure what.  The wheels
seemed to turn, but it wouldn't play.  I don't know if it would record
and not play or neither or what.</p>

<p>Took a bit of a nap after toying with website redesign.  I was
like, <em>okay, so basically, I want to</em></p>

<p><em>Whew I'm tired; now is a good time for a nap.</em></p>

<p>I napped for about an hour and then rode TJ Bike to Yoyogi for my
Chinese lesson with Shufen.  Didn't get lost this time, and it's over an hour
ride.</p>

<p>She was tired and didn't want to study much English, but she (and
I) was pleased with my progress; my pronunciation is much better; she
asserts that I can pronounce all the Chinese sounds.  I agree that I
can pronounce all the initial sounds and all the final sounds, but I
haven't put them all together yet, and I haven't done the tones for
most of them, and I sure can't do them quickly, BUT, I'm getting
better.</p>

<p>Now I'm in Gakugeidaigaku for a private English lesson with Mika at
7pm.  But she cancelled the last lesson (our first scheduled lesson
after our initial meeting) and hasn't confirmed this lesson nor
responded to my attempted confirmation, so I'm not sure that she'll
come.</p>

<p>After this, I'm going to Jimmy's house to watch Olympics that his
dad taped; he has womens' gymnastics.  Awright.</p>

<p>I'll probably crash out there; I need to be in Shibuya in the
morning and Nakamegura is way closer to Shibuya than (it is to) my
house (is).</p>
