<p>Seven lessons at work today; I forgot to schedule in breaks for
myself.  I'll do that soon.  I have a no-show now it seems.</p>

<p>Had Makiko's level-up-test lesson; she got 93% correct; awesome!  I
showed her the first two lessons of GTS 4; she wanted to scope the
book a bit, and I summarized the first two lessons' grammar.  I told
her I felt really honored by her choosing my lessons.</p>

<p>Had Naotoshi, who had written a long section about the first 4
lessons in GTS 3.  He started in GTS 1 I think.  He's doing awesome
work.  I should do homework instead of writing about people who do
homework.</p>
