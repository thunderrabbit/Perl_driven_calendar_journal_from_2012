<p>Well, it's ironic, but in Japan, the day Wende got married to
Peter has just passed.  I don't know what time it is in the US, nor
do I remember what time they're supposed to be getting married, but
Wende is getting / gotting married today to Peter, who I've never
met.</p>

<p>I had ideas in my head of writing a letter to her family laying
out my feelings and my blessings to her and my appreciation of their
being so understanding of my flipflopped feelings.  That didn't
happen; I don't know if I ever will.</p>
