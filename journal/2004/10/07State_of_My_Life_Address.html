<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I am single.  I broke up with Hitomi because I wasn't allowing
myself to spend time away from her.  She was living with me and I
felt obligated to be home for her.</p>

<p>We are still talking, and she wants to live with me just on the
weekends.  I'll tell her no when I talk to her this Saturday.  Basic
reason: something like, ".." hell I don't know.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm working at Gaba three days per week: Monday, Tuesday,
Friday.  I'm working at OM on Saturday and Sunday.  Officially OM is
a computer related job.  It's not exactly that, though.</p></li>

<li><p>I have a bicycle named TJ Bike.  TJ stands for 大変じゃない 
(たいへんじゃない) "taihen jyanai" [no problem].  Bike stands for 
自転車 （じてんしゃ）"jitensha" [bicycle].</p>

<p>Pictures are online <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?date=2004/09/29#dan3">here</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm planning to begin a bike ride in March from Tokyo to
Hokkaido, and then to the bottom of Honshu and maybe take a boat to
some of the islands south of the main island and then, if all is well,
I'll take a boat to Korea and ride across Korea, then a boat to China
and ride to Southeast Asia and then north to Mongolia and Russia and
then across Europe and boat to New York and then ride to Texas.</p>

<p>I have no idea how long it will take, but probably years.</p>

<p>For now, I've been practicing by riding from my house to Jiyugaoka
(25 minutes), Shibuya (55 minutes), Yoyogi (70 minutes), and once to
Shinagawa (55 minutes).</p></li>

<li><p>I'd like to carry a GPS around with me and upload my tracklogs
to a website and be tracked online.  I haven't yet found a site that
will track me though.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't yet own a GPS, but since I want one for my trip and
because I'm out of debt, I may get one soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently found the site called <a
href="http://www.confluence.org">Confluence Project</a>.  It's cool,
and I think I'd like to help out.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm studying Japanese once a week in Shibuya.  I can slowly
tell stories (with low vocabulary) and explain what I want and
describe people and things and my pronunciation is generally
good.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm studying Chinese twice a week plus once a month.  I can
pronounce some of the syllables and read maybe ten kanji.  Right now I
can only think of about seven kanji that I can read.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is still my Macintosh G4 with 30Gig HD and 512Meg
RAM and DVD-R CD-RW drive.  I'm still quite happy with it.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still living in Millenium House, and my address is still
the same.  BUT, without me changing my residence, my address will
change.  All the blocks in my area are being renumbered and all the
buildings within those blocks will be renumbered as well.  I have no
idea why.</p>

<p>I haven't notified anyone of the impending change.  Well, besides
you.</p></li>

<li><p>Wende got married on October 3rd.  I sent her mental hugs and
love.  I cried a bit.  Ironically, I was in the middle of breaking up
with Hitomi at the same time as Wende's wedding.  I wrote a
blessing/apology letter to Wende and one to her parents.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't done anything with the domain chatbotchats.com.  You
can buy it from me if you want.  $10 US via paypal.</p></li>

<li><p>My journal is still being run primarily with journal.pl, with
the indexing code that was written primarily by Fred.  I'm considering
writing a new MySQL driven thing so people can search for types of
stuff more easily and have different ways to view stuff.  Optimally,
I'd like to have a site with my journal and images and stuff in
different languages.  I just write whatever language I want that day
and people can select the most recent things that were written in the
language of their choice.</p>

<p>I won't change the filesystem, but just have a DB that points to
the different URLs and knows the type of content at each URL.</p></li>

<li><p>I am in negotiations with Dennis from my I-group to play a
betting game with him.  I'll place bets on his behalf, up to 2000 yen
per month, and he'll deposit in my US paypal account the equivalent
value in US dollars.</p>

<p>I'll pay the 2000 yen out of my pocket, and if he wins I'll send
money back home, minus approximately $30 US because it costs that much
to wire money overseas.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any debt; I paid janette the remainder of what I owed
her plus a thankyou bonus at the end of August I think.  Last month
was my first month recently to just flat save money.  Not including
buying TJ Bike.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets.</p>

<p>I assume Spot is still a happy cat with Jen in Houston.</p>

<p>I assume Jen is still a happy cat owner with Spot in
Houston.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't been in touch with janette, Maggie, Molly, Meredith,
Kristen, the Katherine's, nor my brother in a while.  My brother the
shortest while, janette the second shortest, Molly the third, Maggie
fourth, then Kristen, then Meredith, then Catherine, then Kathryn.</p>

<p>There's something about release to be learned here.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't done BBST in a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Life changes every day.</p></li>
