<p>Hung out with Tomoko and Sumidasan tonight at The Lion, apparently
the oldest beer pub in Tokyo (built in 1930-ish).  Chowed bread cheese
fondue, roast beef, raw horse meat, raw octopus, and something else or
so.  The horse was a bit disconcerting; horses are so *big*, but the
horse meat slices were so thin and so small...what did they do with
the rest of the horse?  Is there that much demand that they can slice
up horses and not waste a lot of meat?  Do they toss the rest in a dog
food making machine?</p>

<p>After the Lion, we went to Le Cafe Doutour, a hoity toity cafe in
Ginza where I showed them the video I took on Fujiyama.  I should
prolly put it on my site.  We brainstormed stickers for TJ Bike and
came up with:</p>

TJ Bike: 全然大変じゃない。

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>We're going to meet on Tuesday so she can take measurements of TJ
Bike for making stickers.  I'm really thankful for her help on
this.</p>
