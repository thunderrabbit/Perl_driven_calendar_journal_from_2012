<p>Rode to Shinagawa TGI Friday's in 1 hour, including getting a bit
lost.  At one point, near Gotanda station, there is a cool part that
goes downhill with traffic.  I was like zoooooom downhill with
traffic.  Awesome.  And I didn't die nor wreck.</p>

<p>But I did get a bit lost.  I thought Gotanda station was Shinjuku
station and I was stopped, trying to orient myself at that station
and I just couldn't recognize anything.</p>

<p>Asked some people and crossed Keihin Kyuko line, which was pretty
cool; big red trains on angled curved tracks.. Ah man I should have
taken a picture.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Tomoko et. al. were not at Friday's when I arrived, so I had a
moment to change into fresh clothing.  They arrived soon thereafter
and they asked about Hitomi.  I told them I had forgotten to ask her,
and I specified why things were a bit hectic in our lives.  I showed
them the pics of us at Dan's Hihi and Byebye parties and at Fujikyu,
etc.</p>

<p>Miyuki showed up and I decided to call Hitomi, but she was still at
work so she couldn't come chow with us.  I was like, [I'm with Tomoko
and, uh, my Mt Fuji friends at TGI Friday's in Shibuya..]  Tomoko
said, [Mt Fuji friends] "that's you guys."  Hitomi was still at work
though.</p>

<p>Most of the conversation was indecipherable for me; there was too
much ambient noise in the room, but I could tell that overall I am
getting better.  I could at least parse most of Tomoko's words,
though I didn't know their meanings.</p>

<p>Miyuki didn't say a whole lot either; she's a good listener like
me.  She would happily give her thoughts when asked, but would rarely
just jump into the conversation.</p>

<p>Dinner was great and Sumidasan paid.  I'm thankful for that.  No
karaoke tonight, but they scoped TJ Bike and Tomoko said she could
make stickers to uniquely label it.  We'll probably use my kanji and
stuff.. not sure yet.</p>

<p>Byebye and watched them go and wow Miyuki had nice stockings and
short skirt.</p>

<p>I went back to the hotel restroom to sit and write this and get
ready for the ride back.  Hitomi called me and said she was finished
with work.  Pooh on timing.</p>
