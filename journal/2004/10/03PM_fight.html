<p>Laid it out with Hitomi; she jokingly likened herself as my pet
and I was like, " " because I just couldn't say how funny that wasn't
cause it seems quite accurate at times.  I tried to look up the word
codependent for her, but it's not in our translators, and I can't
seem to get an internet signal right now.</p>

<p>Jen and Olivia were like, "you can't just keep stringing her on,"
and I was like, "I know," and I went upstairs and when I said, "一緒に
は難しい" that's what broke it and she said she was going to go home
and I cried a lot and she asked me why I was crying and I told her I
was sad because I forget what I said, but I told her, but the one I
remember is when she was like, oh, I was like, "I can't see you
everyday" and she was like, "well, I can't see you just sometimes," so
the result would be we'd see each other never.  That really made me
feel sad.</p>

<p>We've talked and apparently she's staying the night here tonight
because it's nearly last train time; I don't know if we'll change
nothing or wtf is going to happen, but I tried at one point to
explain that I can't give her a list of things to change and then say
it will all be good after these things are changed because that would
be a nightmare and maybe things wouldn't be good anyway, and I
don't know if my point was taken or not.</p>

<p>The most closest we got to a resolution of sorts was when I was
like, "I can't marry you; I can't be with you every day from now
until 2100," and she was like, "I know," and I'm like, "?" [really?]
and she was like, "yah; I just want to kick it with you in Japan, and
occassionally say HI in other countries."  Wow; that could be
acceptable, but there's still this whole deal about each individual
leading each individual's own life.</p>

<p>Bewitching hour; I'm done.</p>
