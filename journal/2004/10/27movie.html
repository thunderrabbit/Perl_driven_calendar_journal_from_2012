<p>Going to Kawasaki (by train) to meet Hitomi now.  Leaving my
computer here.  Feeling a bit dizzy.  Pooh.</p>

<p class=date>1:38am JST Thursday 28 October 2004</p>

<p>Movie was good.  I chowed some chicken on the way there and a small
Freshness Burger at Cinecitta.  I got bacon omelette burger, which had
no beef, so Hitomi gave me most of her burger.</p>

<p>The movie was in Spanish with Japanese subtitles, so I understood
the overview and about 1/8th of the dialogue.  It made me realize I
need to get crackin' on planning my trip if I'm really going to do
it.</p>

<p>After the movie, Hitomi and I walked through Azalea, and found the
escalators being cleaned.</p>
