<p>Talked to Ikumi for about an hour.  Was able to give her my take on
her situation and she said she felt a lot better.  Said that my advice
was much different from her girlfriends' advice of "gambatte."  Yeah;
I can imagine.</p>

<p>I'm no longer jealous of John, with whom Ikumi spent some time
when she first moved into the building.</p>
