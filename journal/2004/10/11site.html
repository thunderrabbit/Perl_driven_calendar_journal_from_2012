<p>I've got a bit of a start on the new backend for my website.  Just
a little perl thing that recursively goes through all my directories
until it's sniffed all the files.  Right now it just sniffs the
filenames and doesn't actually smurf the files.  Ya smell me?</p>

<p>I talked a bit to Ikumi, who is feeling a bit blue.  I would love
to get into her brain a little bit more.  We'll see how that goes.</p>
