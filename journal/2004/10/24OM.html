<p>Work was pretty okay today.  Ended up with more quintarks than we
had when we started.  I took a couple of naps, including one long
enough to produce drool.</p>

<p>I decided to invite Mikiko to Cosmoworld near Sakuragicho
station.  It's pretty close to Yokohama, so maybe it's convenient for
her to visit.  Maybe she would even enjoy going.</p>

<p>But I didn't ask her today.  She's always busy at work.  I may have
to just give her a note.  Due to the language barrier and how busy she
is, I can't do any quick inviting.</p>
