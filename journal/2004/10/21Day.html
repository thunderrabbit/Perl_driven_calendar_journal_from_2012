<p>I wonder what I will do today.  I have no plans.  I haven't
studied Chinese in a while, nor Japanese very much this week.  It
rained all day yesterday so I chose not to ride my bike.  Tomorrow
I'll get to ride, and tomorrow is my Japanese lesson; I think I'll be
doing Japanese homework today.</p>

<p>I won't fart around with my website too much; Ikumi is going to
help me brainstorm a user interface on Sunday night.  I was thinking
about it a bit yesterday... very simple:</p>

<pre>
TEXT    PICS     [flag]
</pre>

<p>Where TEXT will reveal REAL, FAKE</p>

<p>(and REAL will reveal DAILY, OTHERWISE.... but that's too deep of
a navigation structure)</p>

<p>wait; I want to go back and scope the bridge.</p>

<p>How about</p>

<pre>

	 TR

</pre>
         
<p>Journal will offer by default my daily journal.  Also available
will be slices of my daily journal and mass emails that I write to my
peeps.  Slices will include YRUU/Rallies, Dreams, skating adventures,
etc.</p>

<p>ThePIN will be my book, TR is Thunder Rabbit stories,
Synchronicities is my movie, Ramblings will be rants and theories and
crap like that. Other will be chatbot chats and guest writers
(basically people who include me on their mass email lists (Ginnie,
Carla, and barely Dan (who wrote two such emails)))</p>

<p>Pics will be pictures arrangeable by subject or by date</p>

<p>[flag] will be a Japanese flag or a US flag, depending on the
language that is not being primarily displayed at the time, the idea
being that I'll have more than just a piddly amount of crap in
Japanese and Chinese.</p>

<p>Wait..  I would need more than one flag.</p>
