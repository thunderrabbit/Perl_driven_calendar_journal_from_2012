<p>Met with Misato after doing some homework at Gaba.  I chowed and
she had tea at Jonathon's and kinda had a lesson, though no money
changed hands.  Except that I paid for her tea.</p>

<p>After the lesson, I got a call from my non-English-speaking Chinese
teacher, and Misato tranlated for me.  My teacher is pregnant and in
danger of miscarriage so she has to relax at home.  At the end of the
phone call/translation, Misato goes, "are you okay?" which I assume
must have meant [did you understand everything?], but sounded a lot
like, "will you be okay if you can't study Chinese?"  and I'm like,
"I'm *fine*; she's the one that might miscarry."  Yeouch.</p>
