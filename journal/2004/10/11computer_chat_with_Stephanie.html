<p>Stephanie chatted with me a bit; she's doing well, and is going to
send me a present soon.  yay!  She seemed really impressed with my
bicycle plan, and as I told her about it, I was like, "fuck."</p>

<p>We're going to send each other leaves in the mail.</p>

<p>She asked about janette, and I had to report that I didn't know,
but I hope she's well.</p>
