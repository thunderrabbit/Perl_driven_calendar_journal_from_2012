<p>OM wasn't at work today so Jen and I had the run of the place.  We
put CNN on TV the whole day and when the printer ran out of paper we
just refilled it with no crisis intervention required.  It was nice
to be there without OM drama.</p>

<p>We went to see Mikiko at the conveni across the street, but she
was in the back; we didn't get to ask her where she lives, nor to
invite her out for drinks.</p>
