<p class=date>8:34am JST Sunday 3 October 2004</p>

<p>Had a fight with Hitomi this morning, which just escalated from
such a dumb little utterance on my part; I don't know what the deal is
overall, if it's worth it or not.  We had woken up around 5:30am and
had a great romp and then she went to clean up and I went to sleep.
When she came back, I was still in that state of "wow that was great"
and wanted to continue enjoying that state.  She went to close the
window, and so she could get to the window, put one hand on each side
of me like she might do to adjust my blanket.</p>

<p>I thought she was going to adjust my blanket, and I didn't want
her to so I said, "¤ä¤À" [don't/the current activity is undesireable]
and it all went to crap from there.</p>

<p>I tried to explain that in the past she has moved my blanket and I
didn't want her to do that again.  She explained that in the past she
had only moved it because I wasn't using it.</p>

<p>I stopped explaining, for how was I to explain that I wasn't
talking about times that she moved the blanket when I wasn't using it,
and furthermore why in the world would I be talking about such a time
when this time I was using the blanket, but I was talking about the
times that we had already talked about recently when she had moved my
blanket even after we had talked about it before those times?</p>

<p>Nightmare.</p>

<p>So she cried and I apologized and she slept on the floor and it
was not what I had in mind for after romp cuddling.</p>
