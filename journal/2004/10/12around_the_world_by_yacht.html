<p>Just watched most of a documentary on the 14 year old dude who
sailed around the world alone in 329 days.  Now I'm just
like <em>damn, why even <b>try</b> my bike ride to Texas?  It's too
late; I'm 34 years old.  Mofo was <b>fourteen</b>.</em></p>

<p>Talked to Dave some about cameras; I just need to ride to
Akihabara and start looking at what's available.</p>

<p>This has got me in a pissy mood.</p>
