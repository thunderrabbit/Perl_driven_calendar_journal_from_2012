<p>After having a bit of a big miscommunication with Hitomi I was late
and a bit mad at myself for causing the situation while I was trying
to leave for work.  So I was like, "I'm sorry; bye" and went outside
and then caught my finger in the sliding glass door (in a maneuver
designed to let me see if Hitomi had come into the hallway to wave
bye) and I was like, <em>rar</em> and went outside and stamped my foot
sideways on the wall for a nice loud resounding thump.</p>

<p>Lovely.</p>
