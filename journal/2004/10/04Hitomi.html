<p>Jen bitched me out (as a friend) for not having been more firm with
Hitomi last night: letting her stay over.  I tempered my desire to
break something in the kitchen where we were talking and listened.  I
squeezed through the fourth gap in the banister support bars on the
way upstairs and Hitomi happened to be calling me at that time.</p>

<p>She was like, "HI" and I was like, "HI" and then I was like, "you
can't come over; you can't stay over; you have to get your stuff" (in
English and Japanese) and she was like, "why?"  and I was like, "I
need my space" and [it's my room] and "I need my space"</p>

<p>And she was like, "you don't like me?"</p>

<p>Aw god, not that one, and I'm like, "it's not that; I need my
space; I can't see you every day"</p>

<p>and even though I was telling her you have to go home tonight and
you can't stay over tonight she was like, "no" and "I will come over
and we won't fight" and I'm like, "you're codependent; I'm
codependent; we can't do this anymore" and she was like, "well I'll
see you tonight" and I'm like, "if you come over you cannot stay" and
"if you come over, I will not be here."</p>

<p>This is nutso.</p>

<p>I translated a page defining codependent and emailed it to her.
But even if she agrees that she is that, I don't think the page said
that codependency is an non-optimal trait.</p>

<p>We talked and she agreed to not come to my house tonight,
apologizing for having said "¤ä¤À" to my requests above.  She was
like, "now I understand you [after talking last night] we won't fight
anymore."  and I'm like, <em>that's the most codependent thing I've
ever heard in my entire life</em>, which while not necessarily true,
it does seem like a pretty silly thing for her to believe.</p>
