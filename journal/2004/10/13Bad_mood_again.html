<p>I was coming out of my bad mood and working on my website when
Hitomi called me again to explain in English that which I already
understood; she wanted to be able to hear all my ranting last night
but she couldn't because she doesn't understand English well enough
yet.</p>

<p>Okay, great, thank you; I appreciate it.  But I already fucking
knew that last night.   I don't want to spend 15 minutes of me
helping you explain to me that there is a language barrier.</p>

<p>What is underlying this?  We hung up the phone and I looked at the
timer 21 minutes of saying *nothing* except for a bit at the end
about upcoming movie tonight; let's just fucking move on.  It's this
fucking language barrier surrounding me that sucks so royally; I feel
so trapped by it, perfectly able to escape and just give up, but I'm
still here, 5 more months of excruciatingly slow English.</p>

<p>Fuck I'm in a bad mood.</p>

<p>I was telling janette last night, and she was telling me the same
thing; tons of people are all like, "oh you're so great blahblahblah"
and I'm like, fuckoff go be great yourself and then you'll be so great
and it will be great.  It's not great to have a bunch of people
running around going you're so great.  And it's not like there's more
than a handful of people who are saying that, but ...  something like
those are apparently the people that I'm romantisexually attracted to
cause it's my lovers who have been saying that shit.</p>

<p>What is the bigger lesson here?</p>

<p>Grrr fuck off.</p>
