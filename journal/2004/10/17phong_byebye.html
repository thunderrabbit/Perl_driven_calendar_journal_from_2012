<p>I forgot to tell Phong that Jesse said HI, but I did tell him that
Jen said HI, but he didn't remember her.</p>

<p>During the izakiah part, Louise called me and I went downstairs to
lead her back to the place.  She was in a genki mood <! and gave me a
hug and kiss on the cheek> and at the table was quite anticky with
Michael from my building's twin building.</p>

<p>After people left, Hitomi and I stayed out with Phong, Michael, and
Louise.  We went to Karaoke for about 45 minutes.  I rapped Eminem's
"Business" almost flawlessly, and sang "Oops I did it again" with
Louise in quite an entertaining way (including me getting the knock
knock joke in just before the lyrics started), but not half as
entertaining as Michael and Louise were with their songs.  Wow.</p>

<p>Big fun and Big Echo.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Phong, Michael, Hitomi and I took the Toyoko line back (Louise
lives near Jiyugaoka and walked home).  Said bye to Phong and wished
him well on his adventures.</p>

<p>Saying permanent goodbye to people in Japan has become easier than
in the US because I don't let myself get as attached now.</p>
