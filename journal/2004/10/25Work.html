<p>Work today:</p>

<p>Six lessons, six no-shows.</p>

<p>Now, it's actually only 4 students, but two of them doublebooked
me.  Including the one that I'm supposed to be teaching now; she's 15
minutes late for her second lesson.</p>

<p>This student has no-showed for her last 15 lessons, including 5
for me.</p>
