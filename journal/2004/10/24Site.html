<p>Ikumi helped me with my website tonight.  She's good at knowing
about user interface design and helped shaped my ideas about the
interface for my site.  She doesn't know a lot about backend perl
stuff, but she acted as a good sounding board for that.</p>

<p>She apologized for not having been much help, but I think she was
more help that she seemed to think.</p>
