<p>Worked.  Got a note from Louise "hey man, you want a bike?"
(Showed Simon TJ Bike after work.)  Called Louise.  Went to her house.
She only wanted 3000 yen for it, so I said "yah."  It's a
non-impressive mountain-type bike with crooked handlebars and nearly
flat tires.  It will work well for making short journeys around my
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Chatted with Louise; talked about movies; her favorite is Shawshank
Redemption, which I've never seen.  "Is tonight the big night?" I
asked her.  "Sure!"</p>

<p>I went to the conveni to get snackage and she did whatever she did
and then we watched the movie.</p>

<p>Well, we watched the first half.  It got to 1:09:50 and the DVD
player froze.  Right when the good guy was playing music over the
loudspeakers for the entire prison.  The player wouldn't even eject
the DVD.  With her 100 yen store screwdrivers, we tried to take the
player apart (it's a VHS DVD combo) but got stuck; we got the case
off, the circuit board off the DVD player, the DVD player unscrewed,
but we couldn't get the DVD player out of the case, nor the DVD out of
the player.  It was really weird; I don't know why we couldn't find a
switch to let/make the DVD tray eject.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the little secret project with Louise; it has to be a
secret because it's her roommate's DVD combo thing and she would flip
if she knew we had it all strewn apart.  Roommate came home, so we put
it all together, including having to hold the whole thing upside down
to get the screws to go properly into the right holes.  (gravity
assist because we had no magnetic screwdrivers.)</p>

<p>"Well, you wanna watch a different movie on my computer?"</p>

<p>So we watched _The Sting_ on my computer.  Good movie.  The days
back then seem simpler.  The movies definitely were simpler.  But it
was good.  Good characters.</p>

<p>Movie over; I pressed eject.  No.</p>

<p>Had to reboot my computer to get the DVD out.  Weird.</p>

<p>I left her place on TJ Bike at 3:36am.  Arrived home at 4:01am.</p>

<p>No trains, but plenty of newspaper bikes zipping around.</p>

<p>Damn.  I Gotta be at work in 4.25 hours.</p>
