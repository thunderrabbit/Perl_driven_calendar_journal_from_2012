<p class=date>10:35am JST Monday 18 October 2004</p>

<p>I just woke up, but here's what I remember from my 7am dream (that
I thought I would remember easily):</p>

<p class=dream>I was with a group including Frank who challenged the
group, "give me *any* name [of any famous person and I will have a
link to that person in this super fantastic database (and I'll know
something about that person).]"</p>

<p class=dream>I challenged him back, "why [do you just have links
from your website to the content of someone else's website (and no
content of your own)?]"</p>

<p class=dream>I persisted in asking why until he gave me the
circumlocuted answer that ultimatly meant that  although their website
has all the content, they benefitted from having Frank's website link
to it all.  Very egotistical.  Very Frank.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in a bathtub room with Louise while we were
hiding from everyone in this big house.  I was like, "let's get down,
make love" and she was like, "no way; I just wanted to clean the
bathtub."</p>

<p class=dream>damn.</p>
