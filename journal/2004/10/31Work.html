<p class=date>6:52pm JST Sunday 31 October 2004</p>

<p>Work was interesting today: the internet connection went down due
to being cancelled via cancelling a different phone number that was
linked to the same account.  Crisis.  OM is going out of town tomorrow
so he is not able to fix it.  I offered to do it tomorrow, on the
assumption that I'll get paid a little bonus.</p>

<p>Jen was asked to come in as well and basically learn how to do what
I was about to do so that she could manage the company sometime down
the line, but that is not how it was presented at first, so she didn't
understand why she was being asked to come in, and she felt a bit hot
about it.  I remained cool like a cucumber though she was a fireball
on the inside, playing it cool on the outside, and biting her tongue
in the middle.</p>

<p>On our way home, Jen asked me how I was able to remain calm, and I
just had to credit my mens' group for such fantastic mental tools to
handle this kinda thing.  I told her about the time I got bitched out
at Telecheck by _____ (I can't remember her name yet) for
insubordination after I claimed that her morning rounds of "good
mornings" sprinkled around the office were a poor attempt at
disguising a head count, and how I remained calm during that to the
point that she was totally flustered by my demeanor.</p>

<p>Jen was still feeling bad when we got home, so I egged her on to
tell the full story to people in the living room so she could get it
out of her system.</p>

<p>Shoko and Ikumi were on the couch, and, per my touchy-feely nature,
I began to give Shoko a shoulder/upper back massage to which she
responded in moans and utterances that could have been mistaken for
gentle but nonetheless pleasant sex.  Ikumi was like, "me too, me
too," and I was happy to spread the fascia (sp) relaxation to her as
well.</p>

<p>While I massaged Ikumi, Jeff tried his hands on Shoko and got
similar results.  Ikumi then gave me a hand massage, and I returned
the favor until it was time to chow nabe, and we all had a nabe feast
(basically a fondue-style soup/stew where the pot is heated on the
table and we just throw stuff in until it's cooked and then chow, but
there's no concept of who has dibs on what food.</p>

<p>I corrected Ikumi's English (at her previous (and continued)
request) a few times, and we talked about the difficulties and
differences of different languages.  I was nearly moved to study, but
I have a private student tonight (Akiko at St Mark Cafe) at 7pm.</p>

<p>She's always late, which is convenient for me to know; it gave me
time to write this entry.</p>

<p>I really like Ikumi.</p>
