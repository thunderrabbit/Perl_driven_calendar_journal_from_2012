<p>Had four lessons, starting at 7pm.  I arrived to find 2 Rody
horses on my desk, given to me by Misato, who took two of my Rody
horses.  She told me that those two horses ran away (after she gave
me the big ones), but I told her not to worry about them, even
though I think it's more likely that she misplaced them, than that
they ran away.</p>

<p>First two lessons were with Hiromi with whom I get to speak a lot
of Japanese in class because she hardly speaks English at all.  She
has 12 more lessons at Gaba and has chosen me for every one.</p>

<p>Third lesson was with Kumikokondo, who is cute and funny and now in
GTS 3.  We worked one comparatives "hard -&gt; harder" etc and she did
quite well.</p>

<p>Next lesson was a no-show.  This student has no-showed the last 6
lessons or so.  Her last four lessons with me have been no-shows.</p>

<p>There is supposed to be a hurricane coming again soon.  Er,
typhoon.</p>
