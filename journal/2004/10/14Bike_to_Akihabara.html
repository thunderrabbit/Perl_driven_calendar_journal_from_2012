<p>I'm a bit sore, and it's a bit cold, but I'm going to ride to
Akihabara and look for cameras to mount on my bike.</p>

<p>So that I don't go crazy and buy one too fast, I won't take any
money, but I will take notes while I'm there.  I'll take my bank card
to get some money, in case I find a money camera.</p>

<p>I didn't go to Akihabara.  I decided to just enjoy my day.  I saw
most of the following today: (click for larger pics)</p>

house looked pretty neat.  For camping.  But he lives there for
real.</p>

Between the tracks, next to the river and several blue tarp houses,
people play golf.  I watched, and a guy let me try.  This photo he
took is amazing.</p>

On the way back, I saw some guys practicing moving these big things
around and between poles at crane school.</p>
