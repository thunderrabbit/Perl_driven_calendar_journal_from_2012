cops, but then he was back later in the afternoon with all his

<p>Thinking about my site:</p>

<pre>

Indexes on imageID and image_path.  description_extension, if it
exists, is the extension that, if appended to the full path of the

imagesDB:
imageID  image_path  description_extension


Some of my journal entries have images linked in them.  This will
list those entries.
these_images_are_referred_to_by_these_filesDB:
imageID  referring_path
