<p>Wow.  Well, I didn't exactly get anything done on redesigning my
website, but I had great fun talking with Roger, Ikumi, Amanda, and
Shoko downstairs.</p>

<p>I asked Roger how his situation was and he said it's finished
today.  I was like, "congratulations," and he was like, "no - finished
means we are now officially divorced and I've lost my daughter."  Aw
jeez nightmare.  He talked a lot and I listened a lot and understood
probably 75% of what he was saying.  Sad story.</p>
