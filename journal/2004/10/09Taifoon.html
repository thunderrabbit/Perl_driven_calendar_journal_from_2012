<p>Taifoon is how Yasuko spelled the type of storm that is here
now.</p>

<p>It's pretty impressive.  I've not been directly in a typhoon
before.   Hurricanes, yeah, but not a typhoon.</p>

<p>Hitomi and I met at Sakuragicho station, which used to be the last
station of my line (Tokyu Toyoko) before it was diverted starting 1
February of this year, I think.  The typhoon had just begun to rock in
when I arrived.  Hitomi's hair was mussed up when I saw her.  Pretty
cute and funny.</p>

<p>I was pleased with the wind; it would loft my umbrella, and I had
to (keep it balanced and) actually hold it down.  Then it flipped
backwards and broke.  Oops.  Oh well; it's only the second umbrella
I've had to toss in two days. </p>

<p>I am wearing Morag's purple grape suit (gotta send her an email to
let her know) so I was happily at the edge of the train station,
looking out into the incoming gale.  I made sure to keep an eye out
for things blowing around, and sure enough a rather large kiosk on
wheels started to roll.  It was closed, but not locked in place.  It
began rolling toward me and it fit neatly between the large concrete
columns of the train station.  It kept rolling and picking up a bit of
speed, and I noticed the train station employee wasn't noticing the
oncoming kiosk.  He was fiddling with something on the wall.  I was
like, [excuse me!!] and bonked him with my umbrella to get his
attention.  He turned around and got out of the way as it crunked into
the corner of the column at which he had been standing.  The air
conditioner on the kiosk took the brunt of the blow, but didn't seem
damaged beyond having its shell dented.  (given that the kiosk has an
air conditioner is an indication of its size)</p>

<p>The guy held the kiosk at bay with one foot while he continued to
fiddle with the wall.  Ah, he was lowering the gate to the station, to
block about 1/2 the wind that was blowing through.  This kept the
hanging signs from swinging so much, presumably making things safer.
Afterward, he and a bud wheeled the kiosk to a less windy
location.</p>

<p>Wow; it's already over. People are walking around outside without
umbrellas.  I wonder if it's actually over or just the eye of the
storm.  That would be cool.</p>

<p>On the way home we stopped by ghetto river in Tsunashima.  It was
ten feet deeper than usual.  Usually the water is this far from the
upper sidewalk:</p>

<p>Stupidly, I did not bring my good camera on a typhoon day.</p>

<p>Here are pictures taken with Hitomi's phone camera.  My phone
camera is crap compared to hers.</p>
