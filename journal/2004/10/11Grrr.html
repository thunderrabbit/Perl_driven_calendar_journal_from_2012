<p>Fuck.  In the US if one pays for a service that is not performed,
one has one's money refunded.</p>

<p>After the typhoon, Jen and I paid for tickets for a train line that
was out of service.  We received little cards by queueing up in the
exit line; I thought they were some sort of receipt "yes you were here
on typhoon mess-up day."  Today I went to try and get our money back,
but no.  I had our tickets and the receipts.  But the dude was like,
"this is from yesterday, but you can go through."  I know it was from
fucking yesterday, dipshit; I was here and I want my money back.</p>

<p>I couldn't think of the word for receive, so I asked if it was okay
for money to return, using the verb for [return home].</p>

<p>Grr.  That dude is a stupid ass bitch.</p>
