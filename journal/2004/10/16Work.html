<p>At OM work today, but haven't done anything business-like all day,
unless I consider business to be washing dishes and cleaning the
toilet and sink.</p>

<p>This environment is not good for learning Chinese.  I sure have a
lot of excuses, eh?</p>

<p class=date>6:15pm</p>

<p>I ended up studying a bit of Japanese.  I wrote two sentences and
then fell asleep.</p>

新しGPSがほしいです。

<p>We ended up able to make one transaction for 23 sheets of
quintarks and got zero quintarks back.  That was the second to last
chance to transact, and we missed the last chance.</p>

<p>After work, Jen and I rode home together on the train, and I
commented that I was really glad that I've maintained my journal.  I
have about 60 (sixty!) State of My Life Addresses!</p>

<p>At Motosumiyoshi, I recorded Jen on video while she was unlocking
Bluey.  I got on the back of Bluey for a bit while she was riding
home.</p>

<p>Zipped over to Tsutaya where I wanted her to rent Man of 1000
Disguises, but it was only available on VHS, not DVD.</p>
