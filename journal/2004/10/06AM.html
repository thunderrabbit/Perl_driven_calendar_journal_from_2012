<p>Yesterday was rainy so I didn't ride to work.  I'm still looking
for a way to get GPX files projected onto China maps online.</p>

<p>I don't want to write it from scratch (definitely not), and I don't
really want to write it using toolkits that are being developed under
GPL.</p>

<p>Today I researched a bit, did laundry, cooked rice, and wrote three
doublespaced pages of Japanese.  The story of buying my bicycle and
riding to Shibuya.  The ride to Shibuya story is not finished, and it
wasn't eventful, really, but is just for practicing Japanese.</p>

<p>I'm considering rewriting the backend of my website.  I've
determined that I don't want to mess with the directory structure,
which would break a bunch of links, but just add a layer of DB with
URLs to all the files.  It will know a bit about each file and be able
to display types of files.  Show me all journal entries written in
Japanese about bicycling.  Oh fuck; that would mean I need to allow
for Japanese keywords in the database.  I assume MySQL can handle it,
but I don't know.</p>

<p>I looked on the map and found that Shinagawa is closer than Shibuya
to my house, so I'm going to ride there today (to hang with Teddybear
Tomoko) at 5pm.</p>
