<p>Heh heh; I found the notes I was looking for; they were closed
inside my computer where I'd be sure to find them when I opened it.
But, OM asked us not to connect to the internet today (for an
incorrectly placed fear of viruses) so I never got my computer
out.</p>

<p>Today I made a 4500 yen bonus.  The woman took about a week to
count money and cards and everything and double triple checked and all
this extra checking and then gave me 5000 yen instead of 500 yen.  I
was mad at how long she had been taking so I accepted it without
hesitation.  I knew instantly that it was too much, etc, but if she
double-triple-checks and determines that's the right amount, then
great. Byebye.  I hadn't even done any fancy bill offering to reduce
the number of bills I got back.</p>

<p>I knew I was home free when she hit the equivalent of the submit
button, which cleared out the transaction amount, and she showed no
hint of recognition.</p>

<p>I went back to her a couple more times to make sure, but it was
like it never happened.  Nice.</p>
