<p>Hitomi texted me a few times during the meal and while I was
heading home; I chose not to accept her invitation to hang out with
her tomorrow night; I was with her yesterday and I'll see her on
Saturday.  Tomorrow I just want to sleep cause I've got to get up for
OM on Saturday.</p>

<p>Once I (*) got back to Kosugi, I was like, <em>tonight's cool,
though</em> so I called her but she didn't answer.</p>

<p class=date>9:51pm</p>

<p>At the (*) above, she called me back, and will call me back once
she determines her ride situation.</p>

<p class=date>11:19pm</p>

<p>It was determined that she would be able to come.</p>
