<p>Hitomi and I chatted on iChat for a while, and just as she was
going to bed, she tried the telephone button.  It worked!!!  We were
able to talk in realtime voice without paying for a phone call!  I
think I'll call this new amazing technology Voice Over IP.  I'll go
back in time and start people using the acronym.  brb.</p>

<p>I was flabbergasted for a moment, but I got over it after a
while.  I'm really glad she tried it; that was neat.</p>

<p>And it could be a cool way for she and I to have English classes.
I can type corrections far faster than I can write them, and I can do
other stuff while she's trying to think of what to say.  Coooool.</p>
