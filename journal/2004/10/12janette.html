<p>I just talked to janette for 42 minutes and 42 seconds according
to my phone.  And 42 is the answer, so something is just right about
our connection.  Thank you, janette.</p>

<p>This was cool; she walked four dogs around the same time as I had
the dream about her walking three dogs.  And she doesn't really like
dogs.  Nice to be connected on various levels.</p>
