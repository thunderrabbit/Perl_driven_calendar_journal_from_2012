<p>Just came across <a href="http://www.arimaa.com">Arimaa</a>, a game
which uses a chess board and has been designed specifically to be
difficult for computers to play, but easy for humans to play.</p>

<p>A different game I'm playing is stay warm cause it's fucking cold
in Tokyo.</p>

<p>The game I'd like to be playing is <em>get some good ideas on my
new website design.</em></p>

<p>Gotta go to bed, but I want to check in on BBST for a second.</p>

<p>Oh, today after work, I told Katrina the stories of my top five
most interesting skating adventures: underground linoleum, Jesus
Saves, George R. Brown Convention center, Galleria and back on 6
wheels, Jones Hall launch ramp, plus how I met Diane on skates and
went to her palm reading party.</p>

<p>Katrina took note of my tears shed when he told me I was supposed
to do something for the world.  "That means it struck a chord with
your soul; it must be true."</p>
