<p>Katrina and I played Monopoly ((Sydney), Australia version) last
night.  She told me her story of coming to Japan, which, like mine,
included a breakup with marriage material lover.  In her case, he was
a guy from Germany.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is she knows a woman named Wendy (sp) who lives
(lived?) in San Francisco.  But her Wendy is of Chinese descent.</p>

<p>I was the thimble and banker, and she was the horse and real estate
agent.  She wanted to use a crazy rule like when mortgaging property,
they go back into the for sale pile.  Woah!</p>

<p>I just thought of a funny idea: the real estate agent can get 10%
commission on every sale, but has to lose a turn to get it.</p>

<p>We pretty much zoomed through the game, and chatted a little bit,
but when the game got going, more attention was paid to the game than
to talking.  She was going to beat me cause she had Boardwalk and Park
Place equivalents with 2 houses on each, and I had only the set of
properties just past jail (but with hotels on them).  I negotiated and
got the third of the green properties for $1500 plus giving her the
third light blue property, which blew all my cash at that moment, but
I lucked out a few rounds by missing her Boardwalk properties on my
way past GO and put three houses each on the greens.  I lucked out
again when she hit one of them and bankrupt.  She wanted to quit
anyway, so she wasn't too upset.</p>
