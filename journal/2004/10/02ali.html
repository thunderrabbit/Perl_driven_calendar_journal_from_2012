<p>Saw Ali in Yokohama while we were looking for 31 Flavors.  He said
he saw me from far away, which jives  with what he has told me in the
past, "I see <em>everything</em>, man, I see <em>everything</em>."</p>

<p>We chatted a bit about what's up recently and ranted about Bush's
idiocy and how Ali and John (with whom he was walking (to meet Benny
and play video games)) can't vote because they're from Canada, but I
argued that everyone in the world should be allowed to vote because it
will affect all of us.</p>

<p>We tried to get the girls (仁美 and 紀世美) to speak English, but
they were too shy.  Hitomi busted out with a little sample from Willie
The Kid, but that was the extent of her English for Ali.</p>

<p>An old man came up and it seemed like he was miming that he
couldn't hear and he had written something on a piece of paper 
"マンコやる" and I was like, "wtf?" and Ali was like, "and that means it's
time for us to bounce," which we did.  The girls were like, "ya! don't
say don't say" when I kept reading what he wrote.  I guess it's a drug
reference or something rude.  Ah, he was offering us women for sex.
He's a pimp.</p>

<p>So now we're at Baskin(31)Robbins and I had a single scoop of 
ポッピングシャワー flavor.  It was pretty good.  Kiyomi described it
as "light"</p>

<p>Now Hitomi and I are on the train headed home.</p>
