<p>Dammit.  Ryan is going to China.</p>

<p>I'm proud of him and not a small amount envious.  I am a lot
envious.</p>

<p>Why do I feel compelled to keep my commitments in Japan?  I have
told people I will leave in March.   Why not just piss on that and
leave now?  Fuck a duck.</p>

<p>I didn't go to China because I was scared to go.  I was like,
"China?  damn that sounds scary," and I chose Japan.  I also chose
Japan cause some of my friends spoke Japanese and I thought that was
cool.</p>

<p>I can speak a bit of Japanese, and that is cool, but I can't speak
awesome Japanese.  (Thank you for your words of patience, Annie.)</p>

<p>I'm studying Chinese a little bit, but my sensei has recently had
to chill out to keep from having a miscarriage.  Fair enough.  I just
need to get my ass to studying.</p>

<p>I would study now, but my book is at home and I'm at work.   But I
do have the internet.</p>
