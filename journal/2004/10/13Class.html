<p>Class with Sanami was fun; they now have a floor mat of that mushy
colorful rubber mat stuff with different colorful shapes that are
like puzzles.  She was able to correctly identify colors like red,
blue, black, white, pink and orange, but she couldn't consistently
name yellow nor green.</p>

<p>She remembered circle and square sometimes.  She knew dog,
airplane, horse, koala, but not rabbit.</p>
