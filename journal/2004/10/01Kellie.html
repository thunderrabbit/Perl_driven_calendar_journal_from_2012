<p>I just met Kellie at work, tall white-bleached-blonde with dark
black roots with non-accent American accent.  Turns out she's from
Hawaii; lived on Oahu for 10 years.  I was like, "oh!" and showed her
the pics of me on Wailua falls.  I was reallly happy when she said she
had never seen anyone go down there.  Awesome.</p>

<p>She's lived in Japan for a while I think; I might have my 10 years
mixed up, but I think she said she's lived in Japan for 10 years as
well.</p>

<p>She wears gold-looking bracelets and her forearm muscles are
literally shaped as if the muscles start well up her arm, like giving
her a long wrist.  She said long-term bracelet wearing does that.
And, "you're not Hawaiian if you don't have the bracelets."</p>

<p>She's wearing a gold looking frog ring that used to have emerald
eyes.</p>

<p>She told me how to get to Secrets Beach where everyone runs around
naked.  I thought I had been to Secrets Beach with Zach et. al, but
there were no nekkid people, so maybe I'm wrong.  Or they didn't want
to come out in February.</p>
