<p>During the night and a few times today, I've felt unnecessarily
dizzy.  This has happened to me in the past, and it's certainly not
the most pleasant feeling in the world, but it hasn't persisted for
more than a day, so I've never sought any information about the
source.</p>

<p>Today I wondered if it might have been caused by chowing too much
sugar last night.  I ate some not-pure-sugar food this morning and
felt a bit normal after that.  Then I ate some white chocolate and
after walking downstairs, when I bent over to pick up my shoes, I
felt <em>whoah</em>dizzy and had to sit down.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>
