<p>Oh man.</p>

<p>Jen is off to Thailand (haha I spelled it Tailand at first) and I
was left to do the computer and documents on the last race.</p>

<p>I was counting the quintarks and one of the printers beeped.  "I
ain't got no paper!" and I was like, <em>yikes</em> and filled the
paper bin.</p>

<p>Grabbed all the documents and ran down to the depository.</p>

<p>They were analyzing them and then I realized I had forgotten the
quintarks on the quintark counter.</p>

<p>Oh damn.</p>

<p>What to do?  Call OM?  Grab the documents and run back?  Leave the
documents and run back?</p>

<p>It was a lot of quintarks, too.</p>

<p>I was like, "okane nashi" and they gave me the documents back.  I
wriggled my way through the crowd, ran back, ran up three flights of
steps, unlocked the door, grabbed the quintarks, locked the door, ran
down three flights of steps, ran back to the depository, weasled my
way back through the crowd, gave them the documents for analysis.</p>

<p>Made it.</p>

<p>30 seconds to spare.</p>

<p>We got 10% of the quintarks back.  Crap.</p>
