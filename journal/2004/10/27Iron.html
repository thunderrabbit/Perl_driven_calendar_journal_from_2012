<p>Jen suggested that my dizziness was caused by an iron deficiency.
I can certainly agree that I hadn't eaten a lot of greens recently; I
basically forgot that just eating conveni macaroni and cheese every
day was not a "balanced diet," as the cliche goes.</p>

<p>So I rode the green bike (who doesn't yet have a name) to the cheap
grocery store and bought broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, and eggs.
Cooked three eggs, ate several leaves of spinach (two clumps) and
we'll see what happens.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for Jen's free nutritional advice.</p>
