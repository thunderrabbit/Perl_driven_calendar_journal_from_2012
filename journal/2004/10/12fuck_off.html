Stephanie: u should be in bed.
Stephanie: i'm worried about you staying up so late.
Rob Nugen: You should be in bed, too.
Rob Nugen: You don't know how late I sleep in the morning.
Rob Nugen: Plus I'm in a bad mood so I'm allowed to stay up late.
Stephanie: why?
Stephanie: whats wrong guy?
Rob Nugen: I just watched a documentary about a little fuckin' 14 year
           old who sailed ALONE AROUND THE WORLD on a small ass yacht.
Rob Nugen: Now I'm like, fuckin' hell why even go on my little jaunt
           across china; there's no point.
Stephanie: whats wrong with you?
Stephanie: thats the sorriest excuse to ever go on a journey i've ever
           heard
Stephanie: no one can talk you out of that pathetic state of mind!
Stephanie: come now ROB.
Stephanie: off to work we go

<p>Fuck off, fuckin' Stephanie; you call that being a good listener?
That's the fucking worst listening I've ever seen.  Jesus if you use
a single braincell you could see that I'm not fucking really meaning
that; I'm just feeling a bit old right now, that's all.  If you don't
want to fucking listen then don't fucking offer.  Fuck.</p>

<p>and *then* I get some message from Hitomi like,</p>

<pre>
i feel sad because I wasn't able to listen to your feel [sic] (feeling)
</pre>

<p>And I'm like, "fuck off, too, fucker, if I don't want to fucking
talk then I don't want to fucking talk."  I turned off my phone; fuck
everyone.</p>

<p>Except janette or Suzanne or Wende or anyone in my I-group.  They
are good listeners.</p>
