<p>Okay, now I've gotten my code to check the timestamps and
extensions of files to see which ones we should look at.  The
timestamp thing was working, but it took me a while to get a debug
version of it working; I don't want to process every file every time
while debugging, so I tried to subtract 1000 seconds from the last
run time but it looked like it was running all the files since a few
days ago...  Turns out the subtract was inside a loop so it was being
subtracted multiple times.  D'oh.  All good now.</p>
