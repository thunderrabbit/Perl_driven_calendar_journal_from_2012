<p class=dream>I was invited by my cousin with Down's Syndrome to
compete with him playing a video game.  He was confined to his bed and
I was going to sit on the edge of the bed, but he insisted I had to
sit next to him because of the way the game controllers were shaped.
The game featured a panel for each player with a similar scene.  A
keyboard was superimposed on a large tree of fruit, and one of the
flowers blossomed, corresponding with that keyboard letter.  We would
get a point for typing that letter.  The flower would turn to a fruit
and birds would fly to it and chow and be happy.  I found we could get
more points for typing a word that started with that letter, and even
more points if we typed a phrase starting with that word.</p>

<p class=dream>The phrase was only parsed for correct words, not
grammatical correctness.  I would just type anything that came to
mind:</p>

<pre>
Monkey fruit banana dog fly ear corn umbrella face
</pre>

<p class=dream>And the birds on my screen were suddenly pleased to
find an abundance of fruits; plenty of fruit for everybody.  The
season reversed back to spring, while his season was turning into
winter. Soon, the birds on his panel stopped paying attention to his
attempts to type a single letter, and migrated over to my panel.</p>

<p class=dream>That was fun; do you want to play again?</p>

<p class=dream>Misato left her book, so I ran down to give it to her.
I didn't know if I'd be able to find her, but I did; she was not too
far away, and she was wearing a fur coat and interviewing President
Bush Jr, and former Presidents Clinton and George Bush Sr.</p>

<p class=dream>I gave her the book as she asked a question, and as I
was going back, the wiser two men gave sensible answers, and George Jr
said something horribly sexist.</p>

<p class=dream>I noticed that I didn't have to go all the way back to
the base of the ramp to walk back up it, but I could just climb up a
cool ladder thing that was available at every 5 feet or so, allowing
me to save time, and have more fun climbing back up.</p>

<p class=dream>I was back in the house with video game guy and he was
surprised that I had slept there before, while [President Clinton's
daughter] Chelsea was at school, I had slept in her room.</p>

<p class=dream>Samuel L Jackson's face was messed up like in XXX, but
for real.  Someone was sent with a chainsaw to kill him, as a societal
cleansing.  Samuel L Jackson ran, and the guy chased him and was
killing anyone that he could catch, including a cop who did nothing to
stop him; the cop was paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p class=dream>The chainsaw killer was racing on a horse, and news
cameras were broadcasting him live.  I expected at any moment for
someone to kill him or for him to stupidly kill his own horse.</p>

<p class=dream>A large dog was standing next to a large ambulance-sled
that was being loaded with with water and supplies to save these
people who were in need.  A scientist was pouring sterile water from a
huge drum into a smaller cup, but the rest was no longer sterile and
had to be tossed. He at least saved it for non medical drinking, but
it was still an expensive several gallons of water.  The dog somehow
knew where to go; he was given street directions (turn right at the
light).</p>
