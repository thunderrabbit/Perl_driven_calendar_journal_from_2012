<p>Last night after typhoon entertainment, Hitomi came to my house to
give me a massage (officially payment for me teaching her English) and
we talked.  I was really far more talkative than before, telling her
funny shit and making up funny shit and telling her in Japanese.  Like
how all the buildings go climb Mt Fuji when all the people, animals
and carrots are at work or at school.</p>

<p>I encouraged her to go to massage school, and I think she
appreciated the support.  I'd love to see her get out of the job she
hates and do something she loves.</p>
