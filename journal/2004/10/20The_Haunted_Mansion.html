<p>We just got some foodage at the conveni and traded Paycheck for The
Haunted Mansion, starring Eddie Murphy.</p>

<p>Haunted Mansion was cute, but not money.  I'm glad we didn't pay
(extra) money to see it.  Not coincidentally, the movie reminded me of
the Haunted Mansion ride at Tokyo Disneyland.</p>
