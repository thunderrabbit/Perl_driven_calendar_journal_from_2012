<p>Akiko isn't a dentist, but she did all the dentally stuff that my
dentist in the US did on my mouthguard.  She's been a dental
assistant(?) for 8 years.  She's my new girlfriend; I totally fell
into those big eyes while she was working over me.  And she has
braces.  Mmmmm.  I'd love to scope a movie with her.</p>

<p>Now I have a practically new mouthguard and a definitely new
mouthguard case.  And she gave me 2000 yen off an 8000 yen procedure.
'cept I didn't get X-rays... wait-a-minute... maybe I didn't get a
discount at all.  Oh well; I got to fall in love.</p>
