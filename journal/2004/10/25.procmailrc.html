<p>Today I slept late and then settled in to study.  Right after I
checked my email.   Oooh got an interesting project from Fred; he
wanted to borrow one of my email addresses for scanning all the
emails in a yahoogroups email list that gets a ton of email every
day.  Like 200 messages per day.  He wanted to parse the subject line
for anything matching</p>

<pre>.*OFFER.*(chest|drawer)</pre>

<p>We got it all set up, all tested, and procmail was rejecting all
but the messages he wanted and it was all great, but, for some
reason, we couldn't get a verification email from yahoo sent to
any(?) of my addresses.</p>

<p>I even turned off the thing, and it still wouldn't go through.  The
verifications weren't being trapped by my personal spamassassin, and I
don't think there is a system spamassassin on the system I'm
using.</p>

<p>Weird.</p>
