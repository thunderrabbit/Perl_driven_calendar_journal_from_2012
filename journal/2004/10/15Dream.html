<p class=dream>My brother Fred and I were living on a large cube.  On
one side of the cube there was a large chasm with freeezing cold water
at the bottom.  Our friend fell into the water and began to
hyperventilate, and Fred flew down to save him and flew him back up
and began to warm him with his fire breath.  Fortunately, Fred was a
dragon.</p>

<p class=dream>Dad's new wife/girlfriend slipped on that same edge
and was hanging over the edge.  I immediately ran over and grabbed
her wrists and helped her get a foothold on the staircase over which
she was hanging and tossed her backwards onto the soft mattress
behind her.  She got a bit angry (and Dad did, too) because she said
she could have handled it herself.  Fine.</p>

<p class=dream>I wanted to take a train far away, so I found the exact
point where the guy would stand to signal the train to a stop.  It was
in the grass, and there wasn't a track, exactly, but as I looked out
toward the oncoming train, there was a wall to my right, like, I was
standing in a big empty lot.  I stood near that point so as to be
ready to get on, but not in what some people might consider harm's
way.  I could see the train coming and there were two guys in front of
it.  One walking and one on bicycle. The train went to the wrong spot,
so the bicycle guy rode over there and redirected the train to the
correct spot where I had predicted it.</p>

<p class=dream>This was an old west scene, and the sophisticated, well
groomed, well mannered ladies and gentlemen were standing near where
I had parked myself by the wall, and they were being addressed by the
train guy who had been walking.  With the wall to my back, I was
looking toward the right, watching him speak.  The audience was next
to the wall as well, looking ahead at him.</p>

<p class=dream>He was saying stuff like, "there is a man who has come
from a far away place.   His customs are not like ours: he wears
different clothes and he speaks differently.  This man isn't as
sophisticated as you nor I, but he tries to be polite."  Someone
responded, "what about you [being polite]?" and I looked; the guy's
pants were down by his ankles.  Then I noticed his jeans had been
ripped into short shorts, so he was wearing shorts and the pants legs
were crumpled down at each ankle.</p>

<p class=dream>He ignored the question, but asked if the crowd would
be willing to let this man on the train.  I realized he was talking
about me, and I was thankful, but a bit concerned about being so
well-known; I feared I wouldn't be able to have any private time on
the train.</p>

<p class=dream>I realized that I needed to start packing, but that
the room in which my stuff was located was dark and had people
sleeping in it, plus all my stuff was all over the place.</p>

<p class=dream>A woman who spelled her name ERI-J-KA (and I pronounced
it "Erika J") had written her name on the end of a US dollar bill and
gave it to me.  I was looking for my money to pay her back, but I
couldn't find it.  I even looked in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter I woke up.</p>
