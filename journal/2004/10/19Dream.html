<p class=dream>The George Bush era finally ended; their house was
locked with a chain lock and the window was cracked and there was a
large oak tree that had the secret extra key still hanging on it; they
had forgotten to take that key.  I saw the key and was like, this
could fetch some money on eBay, so I snagged it. I even tested it on
the original lock in the door (not the chain lock) and it worked, and
the alarm went off in the building, which consisted of the vaccuum
cleaner turning on to scare people and dogs away.</p>

<p class=dream>I went downstairs with my prize key in my pocket and
tried to act all natural like I hadn't done anyting wrong. I was
successful.</p>

<p class=dream>Driving in Scott on a slippery road with 18 wheelers
roaring by, I tried to keep from slipping into the river,but finally
Scott slid off the bank into the river, so I remained calm, got out
and just picked Scott up and put him back on the side of the road. Got
in and drove away cause I put him on a part what wasn't muddy.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in a marching band.  My job was to be one of the
people who held a pole above our heads.  Basically walk the entire
route with our hands held straight up.  As we got started, the pole
behind me was sagging; somneone had fallen to the wayside. I looked
back to see what was the problem, and our drill sergeant person was
running up to fill in the spot, but then the original guy came up; he
had stopped to take off his shirt cause it was hot. The drill sergeant
bitched him out and was like, "you better rmember my name and never do
that again."  So we started walking again, and then we were lined up
with the other groups, and I was supposed to wait until someone lifted
their shoe in the air, and then lift the pole and go.  So I did that
and someone was trying to lift the pole out of my hands before the
shoe was raised, and I was like, "you want to do this? we're supposed
to wait for the shoe, so stoppit." and they were like, "oh sorry" and
then the shoe was raised and it was time to go so I started walking
and then I couldn't find the rest of the band; who was I supposed to
follow? But it turns out it was me in the lead of the whole band; they
were all lined up behind me.</p>

<p class=dream>The lazy guy behind me stopped lifting the pole, which
I didn't care about, but then he was resting his arm on my shoulder,
making it not only the case that he wasn't helping, but he was
loafing, too, so I was like, "you either help or get out," and he
helped.  I noticed how convenient it was that I was sitting on a
toilet during the parade and I peed, but it wasn't helping, and I was
like, oh, and woke up.</p>
