<p>Synchronistically, Jen was on the same train that I rode from
Okurayama to Motosumiyoshi after scoping the high water levels in
Tamagawa and Tsurumigawa.</p>

<p>She told me she had bad news; her friend Marty back home killed
himself.  Horrible, right?  Let's compound it: 1) Marty had a four
year old son.  2) Marty's older brother did the same thing 7 years
ago.</p>

<p>Yowza.  And Jen is feeling bad like she should go home, but I'm
telling her that she won't be able to help; she should only go back if
she needs to for herself.  By being here, she is living an inspiring
life for others.</p>
