kung fu uniform thing.  I don't know what to call it.  I wanted to
start taking kung fu after I saw him.</p>

<p>I was talking to Kevin who said he drank to feel more relaxed so he
could talk to people.  I was like, "why don't you just talk to them?"
and realized that I sure as fuck was too afraid to talk to them.  I
couldn't pose the question without being able to answer it myself, so
in a manly display of manhood, I forced myself to talk to people even
though I didn't drink.</p>

<p>I was asked to do a strip show, but I was like, "no way."  [let's
do a strip show together; but I won't do it alone.]</p>

<p>Talked to Junko a while, and another woman, but she didn't want to
talk to me for very long.  She goes, "it's cold here" (we were
standing under a vent) and when I moved, she kept on moving.
Byebye.</p>

<p>Pretty fun night overall.</p>

<p>When I came back home, I went into the living room to say HI and
show off my threads to the peeps.  (Met Hsuan (sp) (pronounced like
Schwinn as far as I can hear) who is from the US with American accent
and all that.  She lives in the smaller room by the kitchen.)  Ricky
saw my suit and was like, "hey... lookin' good!" and then I walked to
the front of the couch and he busted out laughing; he couldn't see
the towel from the original vantage point.  Hahaahahahah Awesome.</p>

<p>(*) She let me go.</p>
