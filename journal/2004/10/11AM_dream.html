<p>I just woke up from a lovely dream with janette:</p>

<p class=dream>I had just taken a shower and had to walk back to my
house a block away, or actually it was longer than that; I hadn't
taken into account something when I started the shower, so I had to
walk a long way.  When I went outside, janette was coming back!   I
was really happy that I got to see her.  She was walking three big
dogs and I was joking like, "you should just let them go inside" the
joke being that they would go anywhere but inside, or that they would
even go anywhere together, now that she was this close to the end of
completing a successful walk with three big dogs.  She went inside,
and I waited and then</p>

<p class=dream>we were at a big multi-story grocery store, and
janette was pushing the cart and I saw a TV advertisement for a kids'
breakfast cereal that had been translated to Japanese versions, and I
was reading the Japanese on the ad and translating it for janette.
She already understood it all, and had already seen the ad, (or maybe
wasn't interested in watching Japanese ads on tv in a grocery store,)
so she went on to the checkout counter.  The groceries were being
checked out and I saw that after the cereal commercial was a beer
commercial, so I yelled across the entire place to jantte, "and beer
flavor!!" because even if she had seen it before, I'm sure she hadn't
seen *that* part.</p>

<p class=dream>She bought the groceries and then went behind a
partition to put them in bags (we must have been in a Japanese style
grocery store) and I also tired of the commercial and ran over to
where she was, but she was gone!  There was an elevator behind the
partition!  That sneaky girl was trying to sneak up on me!  I ran
back to where I had been, so I could sneak up on her sneaking up on
me, and I just barely didn't make it; she was coming up the elevator
on my side, and we had a good laugh.</p>

<p>Life is so much fun with janette!!!!</p>

<p>I called janette to tell her about the dream.  She wasn't home, but
I left a message (in two parts, cause I got cut off) on her answering
machine.  I hope she's doing awesome happy stuff!</p>
