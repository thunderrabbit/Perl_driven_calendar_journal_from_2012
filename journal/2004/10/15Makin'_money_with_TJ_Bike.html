<p>Got 2000 yen on the way to work today. I asked for 5000 but the guy
was like, "shubabublah ba eh umblubalh" and I'm like, [fine, 2000],
and he gave me 2000.</p>

<p>Bike seems fine except for needing new grip tape on part of the
handlebars that I don't use very often.</p>

<p>I was zooming down a slight hill with a light at the bottom. I was
on the sidewalk, and I had a green walk signal. Traffic going my
direction was stopped, and I was surprised to see him as the nose of
his car poked through the lane of cars.  He must have been turning
right from the opposite direction. He appeared on the sidewalk where I
was trying to ride and I swerved and clipped the front of his car. I
fell gently and had no bruises as a result; I'm not really sure how I
pulled that off.</p>

<p>TJ Bike's frame and wheels were fine. All the important parts were
fine. The handlebar grip tape was ground a bit on the right side in a
place where I don't often hang on. The front fender got wrinkled, but
I was able to pull it out so the wheel spins without hitting it.</p>

<p>The guy was like, [are you okay?] and stuff and I was like yeah,
but my bike is not. He balked when I asked for 5000 yen, but went for
2000. I didn't see the messed up grip tape before I left, but
whatever; I probably won't replace the fender or grip tape immediately
anyway.</p>
