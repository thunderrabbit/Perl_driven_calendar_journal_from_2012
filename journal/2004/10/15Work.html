<p>7 students at work today.  2, break, 5.  First student had a LUT
(Level Up Test) and she did pretty well. 92%. Good accuracy, but
slow.  I don't remember her name.</p>

<p>Also had Erika Miki, who in my notes I've written that she has a
crush on me, but she was born in 1984.  I really think she would like
to go out; I'm having to constantly monitor myself to keep from trying
to meet her outside.  It's a dangerous situation for me to be in.</p>

<p>Mai chose my lesson twice for today.  She is *so* tall and *so*
beautiful.  Simon joked, "get the digits, man," and we subsequently
talked about who was our favorite students.  My favorite most
beautiful student at Gaba is Makiko.  She is like, perfect.  And
married.</p>

<p>I don't know how old Mai is, but I interviewed her interests a bit
today and found that she is afraid of flying, skydiving, and bunjee
jumping.  She probably doesn't like roller coasters, either.  She's
still beautiful, though.</p>
