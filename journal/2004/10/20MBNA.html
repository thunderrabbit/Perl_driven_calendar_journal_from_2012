<p>I called MBNA to change my address back to my dad's address in
Texas because paypal flipped when they found out I moved to Japan.
Paypal said "oh no!  we can't authorize you if you live in Japan;
we're idiots!"  or something like that.  So now I've just gotten the
card added to my paypal account cause the MBNA address change took
place immediately.  And, in a great boost of customer service, the
MBNA rep (Laura) informed me that Paypal checks the address of the
credit card every time its used as verification, so my plan of getting
it verified, then switching the address back to Japan would not work.
She said she and MBNA would be happy to switch it, but that paypal
would flip again.</p>

<p>So I told her to just leave it as Texas; I don't really use the
statements anyway.</p>
