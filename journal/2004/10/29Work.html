<p>Work was okay, though I was a bit ungenki.  I wanted to crash-sleep
during Naotoshi's double lesson.  He does great homework, but even
that was not able to keep me interested.</p>

<p>My first student had lipstick way around her lips, as if to make
them appear more full, I guess, but it just looked sloppy.</p>

<p>A bit cold on the way home on TJ Bike, but I made good time.</p>
