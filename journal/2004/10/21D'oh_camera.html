<p>D'oh!  My camera got wet (soaked?) last night, and it's not
working optimally (basically not at all) today.  I determined this
when I tried to take pics of the quite swollen Tamagawa River.
(That's actually like saying Tama-river River, cause in this case
gawa (usually kawa) means river.  But that's okay, cause I'm going to
the ATM Machine in a minute to withdraw some cash money.</p>
