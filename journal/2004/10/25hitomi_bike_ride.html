<p>Hitomi and I rode my bikes home from Jiyugaoka tonight.  She did
well, though the bike is a bit too big for her, even with the seat at
its lowest setting.  One slightly dramatic dismount, but no blood, so
she did better than I did when I first rode TJ Bike.</p>

<p>We rode with her in the lead (in areas that were basically
well-lit) so I could watch her, and so no one would come up from
behind and not see her.  On the backside of the bridge that goes over
Nambu line, I rode first because the sidewalk is narrow and dark, with
a fence on both sides, so no place to bail out.  TJ Bike has a
headlight, but the other bike doesn't.</p>

<p>It took 42 minutes to get home.  Usually it takes me 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Definitely fun riding around with her.  Definitely want her to have
lights if we ride again at night.</p>
