<p>I just saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with Misato.  We had planned to see
Motorcycle Diaries, and I wondered how it would affect my desire to
ride across China.  I had assumed it would increase my desire, and
maybe give some good ideas.</p>

<p>It was sold out, so we went for <a
href="http://www.michaelmoore.com">Michael Moore's</a> movie.  Now I
don't want to go across China.  I don't want to do anything.  I'm just
numb.  If my stupid government is so hellbent on making money with
Iraq's oil, how can I help stop them?  Jesse just pointed out that
Michael Moore has critics.  Of course he does; so does every famous
person.  But somewhere in the middle is the truth.  And </p>

<p>I was trying to make the point that though MichaelMoore has some
antics, the documents he points out in the movie and the connection
Bush has with the Saudis is really really really really spooky.  Go
see the movie and judge for yourself.</p>

<p>And for God's sake, GO VOTE!!</p>
