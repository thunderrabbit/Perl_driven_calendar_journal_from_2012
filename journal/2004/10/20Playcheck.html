<p>Hitomi and I just watched Paycheck starring Ben Affleck at a hotel
called Will Shibuya.  Hitomi is okay, and I'm okay, and there is a big
bloody mess on the towels.  Hitomi said I looked like a lion.  The
movie was good, as well as channels 2 and 9, although they featured
mosaics of all the interesting bits.</p>
