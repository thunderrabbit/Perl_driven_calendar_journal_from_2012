<p>This morning I worked a bit on the new backend for my website.
This is the code that scans the directories and will write information
into my MySQL DB so it can be sliced and diced.</p>

<p>So far I have the recursive part working, and it can identify
files' extensions and modified dates.</p>

<p>Need to add a bit to remember the last time the update was run (so
we don't parse files multiple times if they haven't been modified
since the last run), and start pseudocoding the part that will write
to the DB. </p>

<p>Oh oh, first I need to write the part that parses the files; that
could take the longest time.</p>
