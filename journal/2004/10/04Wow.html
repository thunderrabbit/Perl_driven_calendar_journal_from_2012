<p>Hitomi is out.  She gets big points by sucking it up and getting
all her stuff out tonight.  She called a friend with a vehicle and I
didn't have to worry about any of it.  Good job, her.</p>

<p>Jen has been good support, but I wanted to yell at her this morning
when she was like, "you have to be more direct; you have to be a
man."</p>

<p>Grrrr.</p>

<p>I just found out that my close friend Sally almost received a visit
from death.  I'm glad she was able to avoid it.  Wow.  I'm really
glad.</p>

<p>It's cold and pooey and I am alone.</p>
