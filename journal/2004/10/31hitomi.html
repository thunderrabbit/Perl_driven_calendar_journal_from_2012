<p>Hitomi texted me during Akiko's lesson; she wanted to hang out
with me tonight and I was like, "why?" and she was like, [I don't
want to talk about yesterday, but I want to talk about new stuff.]
and I'm like, argh fine, with the understanding that she would go
home tonight cause I have to be up in the morning.</p>

<p>Jeff and Ikumi came to St Mark's to eavesdrop on my lesson, which
was fun, so Ikumi was still there while I was talking to Hitomi, and
she had a sense of the situation, and the conversation, and gave me
emotional support and hand squeeze.</p>

<p>Before we walked home I told her the situation and she was quite
understanding of my side.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Ikumi said she wanted to chat with me as well, but
we didn't get a chance.</p>

<p>Hitomi arrived home and we were talking, and I was surprised and
just like, <em>aw jeez; can't we communicate <b>anything?</b></em>
but when we finally bashed through the conversation, she was like,
[I want to help you learn Japanese cause you're in Japan.] and I'm
like, [okay; hook it up; no more English.]</p>
