<p class=dream>janette and I were emerging outside after a big storm.
I was amazed to see the river was so high that it not only covered the
bridge, but was running backwards.  I was even more surprised to see a
guy ride through the water over the bridge on his bicycle!  Then
another guy went across in his car and soon it became apparent that no
one else really cared about the super deep flood waters.  I looked
back and was triply surprised to see that the waters had receded and
they had been deep/heavy enough to cover/squash the bridge that now
arced up before me.  Wow.</p>

<p class=dream>Decided to go back and get my bicycle out of Mr Van.
There were lots of testosterone laden guys gathered around the auto
parts place where we had parked, so Wende didn't want to hang
around. I chose to not leave her with the scary looking people.</p>
