<p class=dream>On a ship with a subversive plot going on, Russians
  and British (both groups were bad guys) each planning to kill the
  others after the others gave them what they wanted; lots of guns
  planned, and when the groups started the facade of formalities,
  walking through a door on the ship (isn't there a word for a door
  on a ship?) I was like, eeek and tried to walk well out of their
  way.</p>

<p class=dream>Talked to someone else about the ookiness of the
  situation and generally we were safe and stayed out of the melee.</p>
