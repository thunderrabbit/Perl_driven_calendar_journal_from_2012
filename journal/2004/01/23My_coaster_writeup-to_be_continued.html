<p>I got a copy of ECC's First Drop magazine because two of my
  pictures of Fujikyu Highland's Hamu Hamu Kingdom coaster were
  included in the issue.  Nice.  I'm going to send a "Ride Comment"
  to the magazine, along with pics of coasters.  I'll write about
  Dodonpa first.</p>

<p>(last week with Morag, writing this was my homework for tonight.
  I don't know if we will meet or not, but we might.)</p>

<pre>
I moved to Tokyo Japan last year and have visited five of the coaster
parks.  Tokyo's parks are quite small compared to what I'm used to in
the US.

<p>Hmmm didn't get very far.</p>
