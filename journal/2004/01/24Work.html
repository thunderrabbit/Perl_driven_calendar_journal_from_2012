<p>Junko and Rumi took the Tokaido line from Shinagawa, intending to
  go to Kawasaki.  Once they got on the train, they recognized how
  comfortable were the seats, so they slept all the way to Odawara
  (Hakone (900+ yen away), which is where janette, Fred and I went on
  our planned Fuji-Q Highland day) and back to Kawasaki, and then
  slept in Nova for an hour and 1/2.</p>

<p>When I arrived, the lights were on, but the door was locked.  I
  assumed it was the cleaning crew who had turned the lights on, so I
  took a short nap.  Then I heard Rumi and Junko's sleepy voices as
  they opened the door for Lyle who arrived and knocked on the door.
  I didn't consciously hear him knock, so I was surprised to find him
  already inside when I got back to the teachers' room.</p>

<p>The gang from the previous night trickled in, with mostly genkiness
  from all (except, ironically, from Carla (at first)) and we drank
  energy drinks and basically cheered each other on through the
  day.</p>

<p>Good stuff.</p>

<p>I got in trouble twice today: once for having worn non-professional
  shoes (as I couldn't find my work shoes this morning) and once for
  switching a lesson with Carla.  I don't think I'll be rehired for
  another contract; I've been in trouble a lot recently it seems.</p>
