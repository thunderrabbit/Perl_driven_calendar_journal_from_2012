<p class=dream>I dreamt that Jackie Purdy sent me an email saying
  basically that she missed talking to me and looked forward to
  having the ability to walkie talkie me at any time.  (*)</p>

<p class=dream>She wrote in an email, "I look forward to chatting with
  you in realtime.  Maybe we can play something like Doom online." or
  something that referred to an existing (game) technology that I
  don't use (yet?).</p>

<p>(*) I read David Pogue's article about <a
  href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/01/technology/circuits/01stat.html?th">walkie
  talkie phones</a> last night.</p>
