<p>Zoomed-ish home and found it to be snowing again (ps; if I don't
  write the previous entry, it snowed today (didn't stick, but
  snowed), but Benny argued that it didn't snow cause it didn't
  stick)</p>

<p>Rode train home with Cathy and her friend Mike got on at Musashi
  Kosugi.  Ate some stew, grabbed Fred and janette and now we're going
  to meet Carla at KQ station to hang with Masayo and peeps.</p>

<p>Dagnabbit fuck we missed the train I didn't want to miss because
  this was a fucking loser train that only went as far as
  Motosumiyoshi.  I wonder if we could have gotten off at the previous
  station (Hiyoshi) and been picked up by the Unlimited Express (if it
  was, instead, a Commuter Express).</p>
