<p>Fred and I have been up fucking around with trying to make dots
  work in java.  We toyed with the idea of writing it ourselves, and
  glanced at a few different array structures to make it work and
  then he looked online for sourcecode and then I looked online for
  sourcecode and found a version of the game at <a
  href="http://www.5lab.co.uk/Squares">http://www.5lab.co.uk/Squares</a>.</p>

<p>Wrote the guy for the source code and he sent it, but Fred and I
  haven't been able to compile it on my machine.  Fred is snoring away
  and I'm about to jump in bed.</p>
