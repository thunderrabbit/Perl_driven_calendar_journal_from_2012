<p>Morag and I saw KG Miki in Kawasaki station.  I hugged her and we
  said HI a little bit.</p>

<p>Morag and I rode the bus home together.  She ranted about Lisa and
  I listened, gave her feedback as requested.  I told her about
  Barbara Cher's _Wishcraft_ and Barn Raising.  Morag and I will have
  our first Jam Session tomorrow.  (I think Heather and I came up with
  the term Jam Session.  If not, that's still the term we used way
  back in the day.  Damn 10 years ago.)</p>

<p>Hugged her as we parted.  I like Morag.</p>
