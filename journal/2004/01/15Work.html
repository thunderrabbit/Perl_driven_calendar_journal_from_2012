<p>Ummmmmmmmmmmm.  Saw KG Miki and Sonoe.  They were in a lesson with
  Ali maybe.  Said HI to them. Miki moreso than Sonoe.  Miki said HI
  to janette and Fred.  (I guess I'll tell them now.)</p>

<p>Fred said, "not that I heard."</p>

<p>Taught Yutaka in my last class and he was worse than I remembered
  him being.  It's like I treat him as a friend and assume he knows
  as much as my friends, but he does not.</p>

<p>Voice was a fucking nightmare that I think I handled rather well.
  One student (who all the teachers complained about today) was like,
  "how long are we going to talk in pairs?" (except it took him a
  month to spit it out) and I'm like, "I dunno; I don't come in here
  with a set agenda," and he was like, "whine whine whine" saying all
  this shit about "I pay money and I want to listen to a native person
  speak" and I'm like <em>if you would shut the fuck up I would have a
  chance to say something, fucker</em> "I hear that you want to talk
  to a native speaker and the best way to do that is to buy a man to
  man lesson," and he kept on and on, and I finally interrupted him
  because he was interrupting three other students, specfically 2
  other students who from him I had separated (the other two students
  who from him I separated were still talking) and to whom I was just
  beginning to speak (I interrupted their convo to say something) when
  he interrupted me and they never got back on track so I was like,
  "aight; why do you guys come to voice?" and though I did (on one
  level) actually want honest answers, they all said, "this shit is
  fly dog" and he was like, "you were right; I am wrong" and I'm like,
  "well that wasn't my point; at least you are willing to speak up,"
  etc. and I really acknowledged him (moreso than the other students
  deserved (to be ignored)) and blah blah blah.  I think I handled it
  well.</p>

<p>No kids lessons.  Morag and I have Sundays together at KQ (yay)
  which is ironic because I would have been over there with Carla but
  I said, "hey can M-dog and I have KQ together?" and asked for
  Friday, Carla got bumped from Sunday with me and Ali and Morag moved
  in.  Fair enough.  Carla's my favorite teacher, but Morag's my best
  friend here so it's still sweet.</p>
