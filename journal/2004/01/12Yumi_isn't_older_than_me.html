<p>Today I was quite distracted during the lesson with Yumi; I was
  dancing to the music and singing (the songs are somewhat distracting
  to me: "Love Shack" etc) and stuff.  For some reason I asked her how
  old she was and she was like, "I can't hear you," and I thought she
  was making a joke like, "eh, what's that sonny? I can't hear
  you."</p>

<p>But she wasn't exactly; though she did get the joke when I
  explained it.  (I really like it when Yumi gets the ヤッタア！ look
  on her face when she understands something that I've been explaining
  to her.)</p>

<p>Anyway, she was certain she is older than me, and I am certain the
  other way and I was trying to get out of the confines of Gateway 21
  but wanted to hang with her so I was like, "Okay, I bet you dinner
  that I'm older than you."  Had to explain what exactly I meant "If
  I am younger, then I will buy dinner; if you are younger then you
  will buy dinner." and she got it and hesitated, then assured
  herself of her belief and was like "okay."</p>

<p>"But!" she interrupted before I gave my age, "But, you tell me
  your age, and I will only say older or younger."</p>

<p>Fair enough.  So I pulled out my gaijin card and showed her.</p>

<p>She looked, then got up and bowed to me, saying something that I'm
  sure translates to "oh honorable wise one please forgive my
  foolishness" or some shit like that.  I was like <em>ummm</em> and
  bowed back to her.  She seemed to reveal her age at least partially
  by saying "I thought you are 25 oh, um I thought you are 27" which I
  thought was kinda funny.</p>

<p>We went to El Torito (the name of which we had previously discussed
  under the implied heading "what did you do last week?"  because she
  had gone twice to TGI Friday's, which is just above El Torito)
  though we couldn't think of its name. I came up with Tapatias, but
  she was sure that was wrong.</p>

<p>Random talk and chat and stuff and she told me about having seen
  some sumo / kick boxing / K1 / etc famous martial arts guys at a
  steak restaurant (after I revealed that I don't like beef) and I was
  like <em>Hmmmm Sumo is in town; janette would like to see that (I
  imagine)</em> "hey do you want to go watch sumo next week?"  So we
  may go see sumo on Monday or Tuesday next week.</p>

<p>After the meal, I ate the bed of lettuce from her plate and
  explained that I am a rabbit, but not NOVA usagi, and she did the
  little nova usagi dance from the TV commercials and I'm like,
  "never seen it" and explained that I don't watch TV, etc and I
  forget the point of bringing up that conversation.</p>
