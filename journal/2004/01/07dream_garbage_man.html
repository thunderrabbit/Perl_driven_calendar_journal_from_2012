<p class=dream>I got a job as a garbage man here in Japan.  Though I
  don't know in what city.  I was on my first day of work, sitting
  below a firestation and the guys up in the fire station were looking
  down at me, but they were sleeping, possibly sleeping with their
  eyes open, but their heads were down like they were sleeping, but
  with eyes open so it looked like they were looking at me, but they
  made no reaction to anything I did.  Maybe they did this all the
  time and were never surprised by what people did below their
  station.</p>

<p class=dream>I was not sure what to do on my first day of work, so I
  waited until the other trash truck arrived and I started to do what
  they were doing, but quickly I got caught up because they were on
  the other side of the parking lot and I couldn't see what color cans
  they were collecting so I waited until they got to my side of the
  parking lot and I showed them my delimma.  I had been about to pour
  some different recycleable materials together and I didn't think it
  was a god idea to unsort the sorting that had taken place
  already.</p>

<p class=dream>I woke up before they could explain what I should do.</p>
