<p>Holy shit.</p>

<p><em>Fred</em> is <em>also</em> in Japan.</p>

<p>I'm still, dumbfounded.  He did an incredible job of fooling me,
  sending the perfect email before janette had arrived:</p>

<pre>
        From:     Fred
        Subject:  whadja think?

Bill's puzzle is pretty cool, isn't it?  Have you already fubarred it?
[etc etc]
</pre>

<p>And I was like, "wha?" and then replied,</p>

<pre>
Oh, you must think janette is already here.

[etc etc]
</pre>

<p>Actually, no, he did not think janette was already here.  Holy
  fucking shit!</p>

<p>What a mind warp my brain is going through; all my plans (not too
  many (okay, only 2)) need to change slightly.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So, I'm all like sleepifying a bit on the train and rockin' up
  here like, "aight where's janette?" and before I see janette, I see
  a guy who looks <em>a lot</em> like Fred.</p>

<p>I looked down, recalibrated my brain, looked back up.</p>

<p>WTF? That cat looks <em><b>a lot</b></em> like FRED!</p>

<p>[blink]</p>

<p><h1>THAT CAT IS FRED!!</h1></p>

<p>He jumped out and said "WAZZAP NIGGAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!" (*)</p>

<p>HUGE HUG.  Holy shit, Fred is in Japan.</p>

<p>(*) not actually, but he thought of that as a possible
greeting.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I repeatedly told janette how amazed I was that was able to keep
the secret, and how it was the best present ever and all this other
good stuff.  Wow wow wow how amazing.</p>
