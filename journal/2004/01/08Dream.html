<p class=dream>I was supposed to drive Mr Van (*) pick up some people
  from the airport and take them to a place by 8pm.  I had to leave
  some newfound friends from OZ and I didn't know when I would see
  them again.  It seemed so unfair to have to leave them for such a
  mundane reason.  I was like, "can I come visit you in OZ?" but
  didn't really get an emphatic yes.</p>

<p>(*) Mr Van was my first car (van), four cars ago.</p>

<p class=dream>I had a choice as to which end of Mr Van I would drive
  him from.  I chose the normal end just because I wanted to.  I had
  to stop and do something before I got too far and when I was ready
  to get back in the van, I was nearly blocked by an oncoming
  ceremonial dance of Africans (I don't know from what country or
  tribe) including some lions, both male and female.</p>

<p class=dream>I tried generally to not interrupt their performance
  and slip through the gaps, but one of the lions took an interest in
  me so I was like, "RAR!" back at it and it backed down.  This wasn't
  a huge feat; these were domesticatedish lions.</p>

<p class=dream>I talked briefly to the leader and a different lion
  tried to bite my coat and I was like, "heYY..! StopPIT!" and he also
  backed away.</p>

<p>I don't remember much past that.</p>
