<p>あやな called me this morning and asked if we can move our lesson
  back to 10 o'clock instead of 9:30.  Almost as good as cancelling
  altogether, which I partially hoped when I saw her name on the
  caller ID.</p>

<p>I requested that we don't learn new grammar today, but that we go
  back over the て form of conjugations and start over from that
  point.  That's where I started to really get lost, in my
  estimation.</p>

<p>This is a benefit of having private lessons.  My own syllabus.</p>
