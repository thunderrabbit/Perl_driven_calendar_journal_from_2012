anyway, enough negative stuff.  you hate nova, you want a change.
would you consider china?  the reason i havent answered you until now
is because i'm now in china and hotmail (for whatever reason moves
really slow here).  my school is hiring and a friend of mine's school
is also hiring.  both schools are in northern china.  the winters are
cold.  COLD.  VERY COLD.  its not easy here but if you're looking for
something different send me your resume and i will take a look at
it. the money is better than japan (believe it or not). <! and the
girls here arent retarded. > anyway, if you're interested send your
resume.

My resume is online at http://www.robnugen.com/resume/

I'm interested in teaching in China, but not quite yet.  I want to get
a little better grasp on speaking Japanese before I leave here.  I'm
likely to sign with a different school here in February.  Oh, and I'm
not good with cold weather.  Especially not VERY COLD weather.  But
maybe I can work wherever you are for some months and then move to a
warmer part of China.

	Take care
