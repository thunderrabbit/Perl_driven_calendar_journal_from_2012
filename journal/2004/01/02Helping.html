<p>When I arrived in Shibuya, a backpacker fully lost was down by the
  trains and tried to get the help of a Japanese cat who walked by,
  but I was right there and approaching him (the backpacker),
  "hi."</p>

<p>I couldn't place his accent; his English seemed quite good, but
  not quite native.</p>

<p>He wanted simply to go to Yokohama and had four equally confusing
  gates to choose from.  I told him all four go to Yokohama; it just
  depends on how fast he wanted to go.  In his case fastest is
  bestest so I pointed him to track 2 which I could see from the
  kanji was the next limited express train to Yokohama.  Four stops
  and bang Yokohama.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Eight and a half months.  Wait, nine months." <em>Wait, nine and
    a half months.</em></p>

<p>"Maybe I should ask you this; I'm looking for a place to stay and
  these places that I looked up are closed for the holidays.."</p>

<p>And I explained that I never had to go through that housing search
  deal and therefore couldn't help him.  But I didn't remember in
  time that Dan and I have an empty room in our apartment.  I quit
  harassing myself about it and called Dan.</p>

<p>He was sleeping.  "mate?"</p>

<p>"Mate!  Do you need some purpose in your life?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"You can meet a guy who's going to Yokohama right now and offer
  him a place to stay in our empty room."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it."</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that means he'll go back to sleep, but hey.</p>
