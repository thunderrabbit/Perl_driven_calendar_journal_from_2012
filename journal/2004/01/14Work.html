<p>What a wonderful opening of my day to find Carla at work; she was
  in a chipper mood and we played little teacher games like reading
  teacher comments and the other has to guess who wrote the comment.
  That's a game that she and Clayton apparently play.  (I covered for
  Clayton today (who was in a <em>commercial</em> shoot today!
  WHAT???  I asked, and she's like, "yeah" and explained that he just
  signed up and he can turn down offers or go for it.  Money dude,
  that's completely money) so I assume she plays that game with
  him)</p>

<p>Anyway, fun stuff and early lessons were gentle and good and I was
  reallly happy to get positive comments from the students I had.  Guy
  and I switched one of our lessons so he wouldn't have man to man and
  I tried to position myself so I could see one of his students (ゆき)
  during the lesson.  It's good I didn't have her; I would have been
  quite distracted.</p>

<p>I texted 裕子 as I went to lunch to invite her to voice room when
  I was to teach, but she replied that she had no voice tickets.   Ah
  well.</p>

<p>During my very last lesson, あきな was in the next room with Andrew
  and two other students.  He taught them "I'm mad at you," while I
  was watching her in the window reflection and allowing my student to
  choose lessons that he liked and I would give him a short summary of
  the lesson material.  He requested #74 (none, any, some, every) and
  #64 (there's too many/much, there's not enough) and #70 (X is ___er
  than Y, X is the most ____/___est).  After the lesson, I presented
  him with his level up 2 (given by Jon and Morag that day) and
  congratulated him and all that.</p>

<p>When I walked past Andrew's room, Akina goes, "I'm mad at you," and
  I'm like, "why?" playing along and she said "I can't tell you."  and
  I thought she meant she didn't have the language, but she meant
  "I <em>can't</em> tell you" because she was mad that I didn't meet
  her at Nambu line after we had a man to man lesson some week-ish
  ago.  Fuck.  I was like, "I didn't know there was a meeting
  scheduled." or something.  I'm sure that day she had said, "maybe we
  will see each other on the Nambu line," and I was like, "yup, maybe
  so," having no idea that she meant "let's meet tonight."</p>

<p>D'oh.  The Japanese "maybe" strikes again.</p>
