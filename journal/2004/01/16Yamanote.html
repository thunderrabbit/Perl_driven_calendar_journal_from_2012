<p>There was a young woman conductor on the Yamanote line today.  I
  really enjoyed watching her smile as she did her job.  She seemed a
  bit nervous; she had a mentor guy there as well who didn't [Vocab
  error: missing verb] too much, but who would occassionally check a
  couple things at the stations.</p>

<p>As I got off at Shinagawa, I kinda was too nervous to say what I
  wanted so say, "gambatte" and "arigato gozaimas" but I said,
  "arigato" to her and she seemed to smile.  I think she giggled a
  bit when I specifically turned to watch her go by when the train
  left.</p>
