<p>Work was 1/2 full of students.  Had Kaori in my second to last
  class.  She was kinda quiet, but she says she's always like that.</p>

<p>Miki called me after work and I thought it was KG Miki at first,
  but it was Haneda Miki and I didn't realize it until Kaori got on
  the phone.  Oh yeah.</p>

<p>They met me and Morag and Kathy at Starbucks for Japanese study
  time.  Fun stuff.  Kathy helped me and Kaori with Mandarin as well.</p>

<p>Yuuko texted me; we will meet after work tomorrow.</p>
