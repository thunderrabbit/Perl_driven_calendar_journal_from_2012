<p class=date>12:06pm JST Saturday 3 January 2004</p><h1>State of My Life Address</h1><ol type=A><li><p>I've been in Japan 9 months and 7 days.</p></li><li><p>I work at Kawasaki Nova teaching English.  Scheduled days:    Thursday, Friday 1:20pm - 9pm; Saturday, Sunday, Monday ~10am -    ~5:30pm.</p></li><li><p>But right now, I'm on day 8 of 9 days of wintervacation.</p></li><li><p>I live in Bell Wistaria in πÀ≈Á with Dan.  John, our strangeroommate, moved out recently.</p></li><li><p>I have been taking Japanese every week on Friday in Shibuya for    some months.  My Japanese is getting better.  Recently I asked    Ayana to jump back to learn the §∆ form of verb conjugation,    which is where I seemed to lose it and new grammars just piled on    top.</p><p>(This reminds me of jumping into Calculus my first year of college  and doing miserably, and then jumping back to college algebra and  doing famously.  Well, better.)</p></li><li><p>Today I went skating for the first time in Japan, though I've    had my skates here for 3+ months.</p></li><li><p>This was my first New Year's (I think???) spent outside of the    US.</p></li><li><p>I've not hung out with Miki in a while; she has been removed    from my list of potential mates (for lacking the courage to meet    me in Ginza for dinner), but I'll probably still be buds with her.    I've drawn a painting thing that I'll probably give her    soon.</p><p>I judge that I owe her an explanation so that she can choose to  better herself if she wants.</p></li><li><p>I have hung out with Yuuko some recently.  She's loud and funny    and seems more apt to go for what she wants.  I kissed Yuko a few    times on New Year's Eve night.  I haven't seen her since    then.</p></li><li><p>janette and I have decided to break up after she comes to    Japan in a couple weeks.  We'll still be buds though we haven't    really defined what that will look like.  I'm partially torn    about her coming as if it's for the wrong reasons; like if we are    going to break up, then she shouldn't oughta come.</p><p>Her POV suggests that we are already broken up and she is coming as  a Friend With Benefits and she says she's okay with that. I have  tried FWB relationship in the past (Christine) and it was somewhat  disasterous.  This time, though, I'm much more emotionally and  personally mature.  I imagine it can work for us.</p></li><li><p>The answer to, "tell me something sweet" is not "like    what?"</p><p>Fortunately, I knew this.  I said, "I like how clear your eyes  are," then added, "when you smile at me."  Whew.</p></li><li><p>My new computer battery (obtained free via Apple Store in Ginza    and my Applecare Warranty (with which I have been veerry happy))    holds a charge for hours instead of 8 minutes.</p></li><li><p>I've not had the "courage" to bring a burned CD to work, like,    "hey guys this is <em>my</em> offering to our musical stylings in    the back room," but now I'm listening to the final draft of my    playlist and will burn a CD today probably.</p><p>The playlist:</p><pre>  Homer explains the Muppets        The Simpsons               Johnny Ryall                      The Beastie Boys           I left my wallet in El Segundo    A tribe called Quest       Posse On Broadway                 Sir Mix-a-Lot              The Frail                         Nine Inch Nails                    The Wretched                      Nine Inch Nails                    MC Speller                        Muckafurgason              My name is Lenny                  Lenny                      Turning Japanese                  Punk Covers                Just a Friend                     Biz Markie                 Pollen                            Mirah                      Moe And The Lie Detector          The Simpsons               Apache Rap                        Sir Mix-A-Lot              Like You Just Don't Care          Si Begg                            Particle Man                      They Might Be Giants       What Would Brian Boitano Do...

That's been  true for me since high school.</p><p>But then besides just buying stuff, there are online RPGs that are  super popular I've heard, but I don't know anything else about  them.   And I don't know how to use or even access IRC.</p><p>Maybe he's talking more about different technologies as in earth  shaking technologies like cloning will be, or nanotechnology will  be.. Sigh; I dunno.</p></li><li><p>I have just realized a point of confusion in my brain.  It    seems to stem from me looking to other sources for guidance.    janette has told me that she is money ($) and I'd be hard pressed    to find anyone as amazing as her and I therefore believe that and    think of ways to make myself get over my judgement that janette    is too old for me.</p><p>But there it is; I think janette is too old for me; I take to  heart my peers (Frank, in one case) saying rude things about anyone  who would date someone 18 years older, and just remained silent when  they all agreed to various degrees.</p><p>I think my angels are telling me to make a list of qualities I want  to find in my perfect mate.  Wende did this some time ago and a cat  named Peter showed up (and by cat I mean man (not her cat Peter (and  by cat I mean feline housecat (and by feline housecat I mean fat  feline housecat (and by fat I mean gentle giant))))).  janette has  talked about doing this.</p><p>I trust that this will work.  My shadow consciousness says "the  universe can provide, but can you recognize?"</p><p>I trust that this will work.</p></li><li><p>($) dammit I don't want to use this phrase in such a serious (+)  thing as a State of My Life Address, but I'm going to anyway  because I'm dumping out what is truly coming to my mind, like the  thoughts just wiggle down my arms and through these keys (thanks,  janette)</p><p>I often use the term money to mean good; Frank put it in my  brain.</p></li><li><p>(+) Yuuko says I'm serious a lot, so it's interesting that I  use this term; maybe there's a lesson in this about acting serious  all the time, like life is seriously serious.</p><p>I tend to seek things that bring me joy; that allow me to not be  so serious.  (I'm intrigued by this word "allow").. These things  are (currently): sleeping, having the attention of attractive  women, eating.   These things have been: YRUU advising, riding my  bike, skating, climbing waterfalls, </p><p>There's something in here about proving to others my integrity, or  being myself (who is serious(?)), or being the best me I can be.  Like being such a stickler for spelling, and for honesty, and for  determination, and strength, and health, and generosity, and all  these myriad traits that I think are good in a person; I went them  all for myself.  Not all for myself, but all <em>in</em> myself all  at the same time.  I want to be the best me I can be, and part of  that drives me to monitor my every action and scrutinize it and see  how I could have done it perfectly, (right now I'm thinking about  how I continuously try to optimize my transit time when I'm  traveling between any points A and B) instead of just fucking  relaxing that scrutiny and allowing myself to do just whatever I  want to do.</p><p>What comes from that is that I'm worried about what people will  think of what I do, or that I don't trust myself to always make the  right decision.  I wonder what's underneath each of those?</p></li><li><p>I want Dennis Church Powerful Loving Hawk to be like, "wow;    you're a really great human and I honor what you are doing, and I    think you've got a huge potential."  I want to look back on my    life and be like, "whooooooo that was amazing!  Best    life <em>ever</em>," and to really mean it.</p><p>I just noticed that there's a fear that if I conquer (interesting  word) my current problem <em>du jour</em>, I will have different  (and I fear different = bigger) problems to conquer, and I imagine  this tends to keep me focused on these problems that I think are  therefore smaller cause they are being dealt with first.</p></li><li><p>From all this rambling, I want a task; a list of things to do    today.  Recently I have not been particularly task oriented; more    like schedule oriented.  And I've not at all been goal oriented.    I want to get back toward goal oriented, Important not Urgent    oriented.</p></li><li><p>Goals:</p><p><ol><li><p>Learn Japanese enough to chat with friends in    Japanese.</p></li><li><p>Have a long term marriage oriented relationship.  (marriage?    what am I, crazy?)</p></li></ol></p></li><li><p>Tasks:</p><p><ol><li><p>Write conjugation flashcards</p></li><li><p>Write a list of perfect mate qualities</p></li></ol></p></li><li><p>There is something the fuck wrong with my desire around    relationships as written above.  I'm pushing for something that I    don't actually want or actually need.  I'll meditate on    it.</p></li><li><p>Okay, bye.</p></li></ol>
