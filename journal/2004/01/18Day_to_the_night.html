<p>Ummmm</p>

<p>Today janette cooked me french toast.  Mmmmmm.</p>

<p>Work included two lessons with Takako my Aries mate.  She's slowly
  slipping in status though; she seems to be getting worse or maybe
  staying the same and the interest is wearing off.</p>

<p>I gave LU 1 to a woman after her second class.  She met the LU
  criteria by a mile; I think she must have just been not warmed up
  when Benny LCed her into 7A.  He said she needed to work on past
  perfect, so we worked on that and she crushed it, asking and
  answering questions in that form no probs.  Bang LU.</p>

<p>Ali wasn't willing to LU her all the way, but it's cool.  I think
  she'll rock out of 7A super fast.</p>

<p>Ali and I did give LU 1 and 2 respectively to a student who
  had been in 7C.   He was with a low student in my class, but he did
  rather well even so.</p>

<p>Kiyomi, who I randomly saw in Starbucks on Friday started warmup
  with "the day before yesterday I met Rob in Starbucks," and I was
  like, <em>eep</em> and corrected her usage of the word "met."
  explained the meaning of "I <em>saw</em> Rob in Starbucks."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After work I met janette and Fred at KQ station.  I saw them and
  greeted them from behind by simultaneously bonking the insides of
  all four of their knees to surprise them.  mu wa ha</p>

<p>We wandered about Kawasaki area, where I showed them my Nova
  building, Cinecitta, the game center, Tuk Tuk where I asked for
  "something おもしろい (interesting)" for dinner (<em>and</em> where
  the waitress accidentally dumped a glass of ice water on my
  leg).</p>

<p>janette really enjoyed the lighted glass tower above Cinettita,
  and the water fountain performance (tune of "Swing Swing Swing" by
  Glen Miller janette says).</p>

<p>We went down into the game center where we marveled at the
  complexity of some of the gambling games, and the apparent
  trancelike compulsion of the people playing them.  I'm
  like, <em>dude; it's not that interesting</em> as I wondered what I
  was missing.</p>
