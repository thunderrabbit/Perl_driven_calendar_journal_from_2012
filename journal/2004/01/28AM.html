<p>I trust that this will be a super awesome day, no matter what
  happens.</p>

<p>My intention is to take terrific photographs and videos at Fujikyu
  Highland and have them published online and in print.</p>

<p>We're on the second to last train: from Takao to Otsuki.  We had
  been early, and I skipped one train in Hachioji, so now we are
  exactly on time.  I was a bit worried about making the connection in
  Otsuki; we had one minute to make it across (and down) the platform.
  But we made it.  I noted the sign on our train had changed from
  Takao to Tokyo (Takao was its last stop that direction and it is now
  headed back for Tokyo) and I was like, <em>eeep what train??</em>
  and then I saw the kanji for Otsuki.  Âç·î Easy kanji, but kanji.
  And I read them and knew which train to take.</p>

<p>"We're inside a mountain," clarifies janette as we speed through
  this tunnel.</p>

<p>Going from Hachioji to Takao, be more toward the middle of the
  train than the very end.  That way, it's easy to change to the next
  train; just walk across the platform.</p>
