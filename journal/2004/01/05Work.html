<p>Today is the first day back to work, but it's only for half a day
and then my weekend starts tomorrow.</p>

<p>Nice way to ease into work.  Tomorrow I'm going to look into a
  applying at Berlitz and Geos, the two other big schools in Japan.
  Actually I'll do some research to see how people like them.</p>

<p class=date>10:51am</p>

<p>Yikes; I gotta get going.</p>

<p class=date>6:37pm</p>

<p>Wow, jack, wow!</p>

<p>Before the first lesson at Kawasaki, Tomoko came into the
  teachers' room and asked Ali if he could cover at Hiyoshi.  I'm
  like, "I live next to Hiyoshi; I'll go," and Ali liked the idea; I
  liked the idea, so bang, I got to go to Hiyoshi after teaching two
  man to man lessons at Kawasaki.</p>

<p>(Saw Yuuko at Kawasaki; said HI to her but not much more than
  that.)</p>

<p>My first lesson started out as a no-show, but I wasn't completely
lucky.  But it was still fun cause I kept uttering Japanese words and
going "oops" and almost really meaning it except the student (はるな)
was endlessly laughing at my slips.  Not polite laughter either; real
guffaws.</p>

<p>My second lesson had far less Japanese in it; the lesson was with
  a level 3 student named せりな but she pronounces it Serena after
  having lived in New Zealand for a while.  I'm not sure exactly how
  those are related, but hey.  Oh, it had a lot less Japanese because
  we were nearly chatting at normal speed; I didn't have time to
  really think of much Japanese.</p>

<p>After lesson number two, I saw 裕子 who waved at me (and I waved
  back) and I thought about waiting to talk to her but I had to zip
  over to Hiyoshi.  I did text 裕子 on the way there.</p>

<p>At Hiyoshi, I hoped I would see Jen (who works there (and who lives
  in my building)) but it turns out I was covering for her.</p>

<p>Tim (who works there, lives in my building, and who was at work
  today) said he was leaving Nova, so I'm like, "woah" and I turned in
  a transfer request to cover Tim's spot at Hiyoshi.</p>

<p>I wrote on the transfer request that I want to work at a smaller
  school and that if I get to change I may stay longer at Nova than
  otherwise. Wrote that I'm considering working at other language
  schools.</p>

<p>Now, here's a challenge for me: not to <em>stop</em> working to
  change my current work situation if I go to Hiyoshi and still don't
  like working for the rabbit. (*)</p>

<p>Nova's mascot is a rabbit, the NOVA usagi.  (usagi means rabbit in
  Japanese.)</p>

<p>Sad thing is that I'll miss Morag at Kawasaki.  Good thing is I'll
  see あや at Hiyoshi, likely feel better about teaching (at Hiyoshi
  with fewer students), and be closer to home.  Oh, Morag's roommate
  Lisa works in Hiyoshi, so I'll still get M-dawg gossip without much
  difficulty.</p>

<p class=date>6:47pm</p>

<p>Right now I'm on a local train (** I live close to Hiyoshi, but
  forgot that today I'm going to Shinjuku to teach Yumi **) toward
  Shibuya, but am about to transfer to an express (crowded) train, so
  see ya.</p>
