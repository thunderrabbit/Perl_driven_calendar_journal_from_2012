<p>Dan cleaned his room today.  He didn't have far to go to make it
  clean.  Good deal.  Via peer pressure I was inspired to clean my
  room.</p>

<p>I've gotten as far as throwing out the trash into the kitchen
  trashcan, putting up one picture, putting two pictures into their
  holder, and washing the mildewed cover of my old futon mat.</p>

<p>When it came time to do anything else, I'm like... bluh.</p>

<p>I note that I'm looking for the correct place to put things.   On
  my website I have designed a structure that has worked pretty well
  for storing a lot of thoughts written in English.  I've even gotten
  to where I can write things in Japanese, でも I don't have such a
  structure for all the stuff in my room.</p>

<p>I do see a couple more things I can do though.  I can put my (unbroken)
  umbrella outside and put all my laundry in a pile.   And I know
  where my scrapbook is; I've got things to put in there.</p>

<p>I'm planning to release the need to put things in my scrapbook in
  perfect chronological order; just get them in there is enough.
  They will be in a rough order within 6 months I imagine.</p>

<p>一 ニ 三 go</p>

<p>Okay.  I've put the umbrella outside, started a load of laundry,
  put two things in my scrapbook and pored over a map of Shibuya,
  getting things situated in my brain.</p>

<p>Oh, and I smurfed an article on hip hop culture to send to DL at
  KTRU, assuming he's still there.</p>

<p>I'm distracted beyond working on my room more.  But I hung the
  first load of laundry up and put another load in.  Second load
  includes my keys so I will remember to get it out and put it up in
  the AM when I go.....  skate with Carla!!!!</p>
