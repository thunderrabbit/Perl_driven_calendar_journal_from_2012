<p>Called janette last night and hashed out our situation.  She told
  me that I am in a long term relationship with her; inviting me to
  un-believe "I can't maintain long term relationships."</p>

<!-- p>I told her that I need the freedom to have sex with women here.  I
  need that not so I can do it, but so I can choose not to do it.</p>

<p>We ended our conversation with phone sex, which we do a lot when
  it's my bedtime.</p -->
