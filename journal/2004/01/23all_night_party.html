<p>We're on the train now after having spent the night at La Fabrique
  (backwards F) dancing and such.  Some coupling occurred, and Clayton
  did some funky sexy dancing, somehow temporarily winning the hearts
  of millions of women around him.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see ¤ä¤¹¤³ there, who I met as Peter's
  girlfriend, ex Nova student.  So, yes; she's an ex-student, but how
  did she get into the AT's group of friends?</p>

<p>janette and I boogied down together and apart.</p>

<p>A couple of times, a circle formed around a guy who had been DJing;
  his feet are pretty speedy.  One of those times, I spent some time
  in the middle of the circle.  My feet were pretty speedy as well.
  One guy kinda patted me on the shoulder when I exited the circle.
  Nice.</p>

<p>My camera battery didn't quite last the night.</p>

<p>Neither did I.</p>

<p>Upstairs, I slept about an hour while the gang was flocked around
  the tables.</p>

<p>Sumika got off the train just now.</p>

<p>Carla goes "see you in an hour!"</p>

<p class=date>5:28am</p>

<p>"When it's time to wake up, let's all call someone.  Everyone call
  somebody."</p>

<p>[Ring]</p>

<p>"Lyle.  Not yet."</p>

<p>"I was practicing."</p>

<p>Before the party, I went to Cinecitta where I had emailed janette
  to meet me.  Oh; I had the computer; she couldn't have checked her
  email.  D'oh!  So I called her and asked her to meet me at Shibuya.
  Cool thing is she was train-competent enough to change to the
  fastest train at Jiyogaoka station.  Awesome.</p>

<p>In Shibuya, I happened to see Clayton out by Hachiko; we joined
  them and waited for Carla et al.  Ate at the club, thereby
  bypassing the 3000 yen cover.</p>
