<p class=dream>Hanging with YRUUers, Rich from San An, Colleen from
  Houston but now Corpus, and others.  Rich was working on some sort
  of school project thing and I was tired so I had to go and Colleen
  was walking with me for a bit, but then I remembered I had forgotten
  some papers so I went back for them.  Colleen didn't wait for me and
  I was sad at first, but then released it.</p>
