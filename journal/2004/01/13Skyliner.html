<p>I ended up easily finding the Skyliner to Narita Airport, which I
  intend to use when it's time to take janette back to the airport.
  It's 920 yen more (than 1000 yen) but worth it, I judge, for the
  comfy seats and such.</p>

<p>I still haven't worked out which direction around the »³¼ê
  loop is fastest from ½ÂÃ« to ¤Ë¤Ã¤Ý¤ê.</p>

<p>On a productive note, I looked through the valunteer guide that
  Neil H-Y gave to me (and that I gave to (and have borrowed from)
  Morag) and found some organizations I may call to try to hook myself
  up with some counseling here in big T-town.  I'd like to find some
  peace with my relationship pattern, and not continue to maintain a
  high traffic (though thankfully low bandwidth) list of
  girlfriends.</p>
