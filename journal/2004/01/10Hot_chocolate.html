<p>I bought hot chocolate from Doutor this morning (after a student
  was like, "I work at Doutor on Saturday mornings," but she wasn't
  there) and the large size was smaller than the large size at
  Starbucks.  I thought maybe this was a good chance for the little
  guy to outdo Starbucks, but.. no.</p>

<p>The cashier spoke English to me (price and "for here or to go" and
  "do you want it in a bag?") but I didn't compliment her on it.  I
  intend to compliment English-spoken customer service by
  Japanese.</p>
