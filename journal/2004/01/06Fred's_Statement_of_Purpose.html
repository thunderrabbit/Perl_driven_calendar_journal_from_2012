Statement of Purpose

Over the past year, I have come to realize that no questions of a
mathematical nature have held my attention for more than a few months.
Engineering problems, on the other hand, have filled my mind for
years: vehicular traffic, building and programming robots, and, most
recently, the use of engineering models for predictive medicine.  
It is for this reason that I ask to change my graduate major from
Mathematics to Mechanical Engineering.

I have already earned Masters of Science degrees in both Mathematics
and Mechanical Engineering, and I desire to study Mechanical
Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin in the Doctor of
Philosophy program.  My outside funding, my extensive engineering and
mathematics studies, my computer programming skills, and my teaching
experience make me a valuable asset to your program.

Last Fall, I assisted Dr. Thomas Hughes (ICES) in preparing a
preliminary National Science Foundation grant under which I will be
funded.  The grant is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, and
should last one year.  Other funding will follow.  The research will
create the first patient-specific mechanical and geometric model of
the human heart: the model will take MRI and other imaging data of a
patient and simulate the mechanics of his heart, showing the blood
flow through its chambers from one beat to the next.  With this, a
physician will be able to view <i>her patient's heart</i>, comparing
different interventions on the computer, watching the predicted
behavior.  The ability to explore multiple solutions is fundamental to
choosing the best one.  Surprising as it seems, however, this concept
of predictive medicine is novel for the medical community.  Previous
work in predictive medicine by Dr. Hughes was well-received, and the
project should grow for many years.

Dr. Hughes and I have had good success finding outside interest on
this project, including collaborators from the Stanford Medical Center
and the Bio-X program at Stanford University, the Department of
Cardiovascular MRI Research at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital
(Houston), the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Rice
University, and the Simula Research Laboratory (Lysaker, Norway).

To prepare myself for doctoral work, I earned a Master of Science
degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University, studying
nonlinear control theory.  I studied Lyapunov stability, linearization
by state feedback, perturbation theory, and applications of these.  I
also studied analog design, fluid mechanics, sensors, and vehicle
dynamics.  I have spent two years in the doctoral program in
Mathematics here at UT, studying analysis, complex function theory,
dynamic systems, and kinetic theory of fluids.  Last August, I passed
the Preliminary Exam in Analysis.  To date, I have taught nine courses
at the level of Assistant Instructor, from Algebra to Calculus.

My pure mathematics background has taught me to dissect complicated
systems carefully, create new methods to solve problems, and
thoroughly test my results---all of which are essential skills in
engineering design.  Moreover, with this background I will add
diversity to the program, viewing problems from a unique perspective.
I have studied mathematics and engineering from many different
aspects---theoretical, computational, and practical.  This gives me
unique insight into the interplay of engineering with other fields,
enabling me to combine both effectively.  In particular, my experience
will better allow me to present results to members outside of the
engineering community, and the contacts I have developed so far give
me a head start into doing so.  If accepted into the doctoral program
at UT, I intend to pursue a faculty position at a university, where
these contacts will form the basis of collaborative networks of my
own.

I want to put my talent to work in the Mechanical Engineering program
at UT-Austin, a lively program with eminent faculty.  Given the
opportunity, I will add to this environment, making important
contributions to the design and application of engineering medicine.
