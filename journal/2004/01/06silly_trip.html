<p>"This is a silly trip."</p>

<p>I taught 裕子 the word 'silly' a while ago.  Right now we are on
  the 埼京線 (さいきょう line), waiting in 大崎駅 (おおさき station),
  the last station of this line.   Wow cool music just before the
  doors close.  And we're on track 7 in this station.  :-)</p>

<p>So anyway, this is the mysterious line that I found in the bowels
  of 渋谷 station yesterday after my lesson with 由美。</p>

<p>On the way to this train, 裕子 and I repeatedly rode the bouncy
  moving sidewalk up and down the hall, maybe ... 5 times I'm
  guessing.  Fun(ny) stuff.</p>

<p>That's when I taught her the word silly.</p>

<p>A weird thing though is the last station of this line is not all
  that far away, just two stations.  But the map in Shibuya shows
  about 30 stations extending both directions from that platform.
  Obviously there's more mystery to be unraveled.  Later.  Or never;
  whateva.</p>

<p>We took the train back through Shibuya to Musashi-Urawa, which is
  in the next prefecture.  Pretty long trek.  I asked the station guy
  how much it would cost to go to Shibuya, and then Yuuko asked him in
  Japanese and he was like, なになになになになになに and I'm like,
  "what?" and Yuuko said he said we should go through the turnstiles
  (and pay the price before we know what it is *and* have to pay the
  same price to get back to Shibuya) and I'm like, "no way jack" and
  we didn't.  But I can look up the price so nyah nyah.　(tsk. only
  380 yen each way; I thought we went *forever*)</p>

<p>On the way back we took the Express train (zoooom) <em>and</em> we
  got seats.  Money.</p>
