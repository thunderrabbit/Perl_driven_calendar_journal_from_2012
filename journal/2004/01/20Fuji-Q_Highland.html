<p>We're in たかお now, headed toward 大月 in order to reach Fujikyu
Highland.  It's been a challenge to figure out these trains.  Really
helpless feeling when I'm in a crowd of hurried pokerfaced people all
seemingly equally disinterested in helping me find my way.
Like <em>who should I pluck from this crowd to ask a question?  Who is
least busy?  Who will be most helpful?</em></p>

<p>No station attendant in sight at the past three of four
stations.</p>

<p>Freddo is writing a letter to Nick Carter, and one to Ma.

<p>Fucker.</p>

<p>Between July and February (and possibly between July and June),
Fujikyu Highland is closed five days (not in a row).  Today is one of
those days.</p>

<p>janette is in charge of finding something else to do in this area,
  and Fred is in charge of getting food.  I am in charge of not
  inappropriately killing someone for this fiasco.  Whatever is the
  lesson here, let's have it and get it over with.</p>

<p>Yes, I did look up FQH website to see when it was open.  No I
  could't find any reference to days this year.  Yes, I did not ask
  for help from any of my Japanese friends.  I had assumed that what
  I remembered Nami having said was true: Fuji Q is open every day of
  the year.</p>

<p>For the record, these are the dates in the list of dates that end
  with 1/20 (today) which the guy pointed to and said, "おやすみ" (day
  off): 7/8, 10/21, 11/18, 12/16, 1/20.</p>

<p>Today is absolutely stellar beautiful weather.  Clear clear clear
  clear sky.  Fantastic photos of FQH coasters I hoped to take and
  have published.</p>

<p>"Saddam Hussein is to blame for this."</p>
