<p class=date>1:41am JST Thursday 8 January 2004</p>

<p>Just went out riding bikes with Dan and Lubo (from upstairs).  I
  told them about the cool place to watch the shinkansen at night
  (that janette and I found) and Dan was like, "I'm up for an
  adventure; let's go check it out."</p>

<p>The shinkansen wasn't running; there were workers on the tracks.
  When one of them was nearly below us I was like, "こんばんわ" and
  the person looked up at us as if dumbstruck.  I'm sure s/he was
  just wondering what we were doing up there.  Nothing more was said
  and they continued walking into the tunnel.</p>

<p>After about 20 minutes of taking pictures with Lubo's camera,
  including an inadvertant video of him on the phone (and almost a
  video of me trying to break into the phone booth) the group of
  workers started walking back toward the nearby shinkansen track
  entrance/exit.  We were also ready to leave and I asked them if we
  could get pictures, and basically they said no.  "いいじゃない" (not
  okay).  I was surprised and a bit taken aback (yay; I've felt
  insulted in Japanese!) but pretty much got over it.</p>

<p>We rode around the back alleys behind our building, retracing
  backwards where Dan got lost and then exploring a bit ourselves.
  (Fun = me zooming past them as we rode underneath the train tracks
  with low sidewalk clearance.  The sidewalk makes a distinct dip to
  go under the tracks.)</p>

<p>We were pretty much freezing, and they were tired after having
  worked instead of sleeping all day.  Got home and I checked the
  temperature: 37 degrees ("feels like 31") (3 C ("feels like
  -1")).</p>

<p>Fucking brr, dude.</p>
