<p>Today will be my last day of work until janette leaves.</p>

<p>This morning janette fixed me breakfast of diced potatoes (and
  onions?), a fried egg, chopped cucumber, toast and jelly.</p>

<p>Sarah from ultimate sent me pics from her wedding.  In one she's
  wearing her gown and holding a disc.  Quite surreal to see two
  worlds together like that.</p>

<p>I got a note from Jeff Harrow that I'll be cited as a contributor
  for an upcoming issue!  This is cool because I've sent him a lot of
  links to a lot of stuff.  This is the first time I'll be credited in
  his <a href="http://www.theharrowgroup.com/current.htm">technology
  newsletter</a>.</p>
