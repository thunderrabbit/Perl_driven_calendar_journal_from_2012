<p>I don't have enough time right now to finish this entire thought,
  but I have been repeating a thought in my mind: "pattern
  matching"</p>

<p>I keep noticing how many of my thought processes are just pattern
  matching.  Seeing things that are similar and making assumptions
  about them based on similarities.</p>

<p>For example, making cookies.  janette knows just when to pull them
  out of the oven by monitoring the cookies in the oven.  No timer
  needed; just some pattern matching in her mind.  Last time the
  cookies were good when I took them out when they were this shade of
  brown / fill-in-the-attribute that can be matched.</p>

<p>When I'm trying to read kanji, it's just pattern matching.  That's
  how a kid was reading HAMPSTER as KANGAROO.   First three letters
  look almost the same.   Four points, then a triangle then a
  zig-zag.  "Kangaroo!"</p>

<p>"Ah!  let's look."  And I showed him KANGAROO, which he discerned
  to more closely match his pattern of "kangaroo" in his mind.</p>

<p>"Hampster!"</p>

<p>"Hampster!  Excellent!"  high five.</p>
