<p>Computer hung last night after doing an update; it was 95% done
  optimizing the disk all night long.  I'm at Apple now with Íµ»Ò and
  about to download fink.   Today was way productive in terms of
  laundry and studying.  Awesome.</p>

<p>The cat here at Apple just Forced Quit the app and everything was
  fine. But since it was a system update and the system was otherwise
  partially responsive, I didn't want to do that.</p>

<p>Íµ»Ò said she won't be too bored here for a bit, but I wonder.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Okay, that's freaky.  On emacs it shows Yuuko's kanji correctly,
  but on my site it's messed up.  I don't know if that's a function
  of me having uploaded the page here from Apple, or a function of
  the page having been written after the update.  Verrry strange.
  I'm tempted to go back to the Genius Bar to ask them.</p>
