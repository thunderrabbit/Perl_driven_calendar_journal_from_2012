<p class=dream>I had to collect US quarters from specific years for
  some kind of presentation at a party or something.  I was surprised
  to find that 1978 quarters were not round, but kindof an angled
  diamond shape, and featured an image of the ice crawlers from the
  planet Hoth on Empire Strikes Back (interesting because that movie
  wasn't out in 1978). Ali was interested in helping me collect
  quarters, but he didn't actually help me, but just made random
  comments about some of the coins.</p>
