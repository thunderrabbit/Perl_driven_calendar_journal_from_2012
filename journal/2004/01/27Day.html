<p>janette and I are at the bank getting 话它边 <em>not</em> 话浇它边,
  for that would be far too much, of course.</p>

<p class=date>4:49am JST Wednesday 28 January 2004</p>

<p>Yesterday we ate at かいていん　すし and I made a video of it with
  my camera and iMovie.  There's not much of a plot to the video; I
  have an idea for it, but we'll see what happens (in this plot
  called life).</p>

<p>After sushi, we watched _Dirty Third II: Home Sweet Home_ the movie
  that Swa'vet and them were working on when I met them at Kinko's
  back in the day.  Lots of funny scenes that janette and I didn't
  really get, but they were still funny, ya smell me?</p>

<p>The idea of tired was in our brains when we went to bed at 10:30pm.</p>

<p>This morning I'm up early cause I'm excited about Fuji-Q
  Highland!  I've been dreaming about waking up on time, dreaming
  about talking about dreaming about waking up on time, dreaming
  slash wondering about sneaking my camera aboard DoDonPa, etc etc
  etc; I'm so excited about going!</p>
