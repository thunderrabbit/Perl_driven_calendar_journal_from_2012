<p>Today has been a lazy day so far.  We need to start movin' if we
  want to do stuff today.  I've been looking up digital cameras and
  have gotten stuck on making a choice of what type of storage media
  to use.  I want the most popular one to make sure it will be
  compatible, but really I won't need to swap that often, if ever; I
  think Dude and I swapped media like once or twice; I really just
  need USB, so fuckit.</p>
