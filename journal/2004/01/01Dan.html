<p>Dan and I walked around Tsunashima, contemplating life and looking
  for his bike and buying chocolate.</p>

<p>I'm still looking for my life purpose, and he is still looking for
  his bike.  Difference is that his bike was taken from him the day he
  bought it and my life purpose has never been for sale nor found.</p>

<p>I seem to lose passion for everything that I start.  (*) Each
  relationship, each job, each project... It's a struggle to finish
  things that are finishable and a struggle to keep doing things that
  have no clear ending.  And things (marriage, kids) that seem like
  they'll last forever, I'm quite loathe to start at all.</p>

<p>Tonight, I have started importing pictures from my camera.  These
  are, mostly, pictures from yesterday (dammit I have no picture of
  me and Karen) at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, including a lot of fish
  type things.</p>

<p>Grr. I hate how fucking slow iPhoto is.  Each operation takes like
  15 seconds to do.  I don't know how to make it not open all my
  photos at once; there are 3304 in my library now, and it seems to
  put a thumbnail of all of them in RAM which of course slows it down,
  but which of course I don't need to fuck with all of them at
  once.</p>

<p>That's one reason I don't have a million pictures on my site; it
  takes so long to jack with them and do things like change the
  filename, rotate the image, write a memo about it.  Grrr.</p>

<p>(*) for the record, as I type this, I'm not in a bad mood, but I
  wonder if it could turn bad by focusing on it.  I'll keep an eye on
  that.</p>

<p class=date>7:23pm</p>

<p>Fuck a duck man.  It takes like (**)</p>

<p>(**) 9:44pm.  So sidetracked here that I don't remember my
  train-of-thought that I was on when writing.</p>

<p>Oh, images.  It takes way too long to fuck with these images.  Like
  20 seconds for it to save 50 to 100 bytes of notes.</p>

<p>Sidetrackification:</p>

<p><em>I'll post images from yesterday on my site.</em></p>

<p><em>Hey, I should tell the story of how I got my Phat Farm
    hat.</em> (one of the pictures includes it)</p>

<p><em>I'm tired of writing the story; I think I'll work on my painting.</em></p>

<p>"Haha hey Dan, this color is called <a
 href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=PHTHALOCYANINE">PHTHALOCYANINE
  GREEN</a>."</p>

<p>"How do names like that get in the dictionary?"</p>

<p>"I dunno; writers write them."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Orwell's essay on making a cup of tea?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Orwell's essay on why he writes?"</p>

<p>"Now <em>that</em> one I'd like to read."</p>

<p><em>Orwell says there are four reasons to write: 1) ego (that's
    me).  2) archiving history (that's me).  3) aesthetics (that's
    sometimes me).  4) political persuasion (that's rarely but
    sometimes me).</em></p>

<p><em>Hey here's an essay on autobiographies.  Hey, he says all
    biographies lie.  Mine lies.  It's time to reveal more about
    myself.  I've got to be different.  To be better.  Aries.</em></p>
