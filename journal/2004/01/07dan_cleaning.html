<p>Super thanks to Dan for cleaning the kitchen yesterday.  We had an
  inspection today (we had forewarning (though Dan didn't know this))
  and the kitchen passed with no worries.  To keep from having to work
  on the kitchen with him, I told him two jokes: the vaseline car joke
  and the pirate joke (which is actually the magician parrot
  joke).</p>

<p>I did take out the recycling that he bagged up, though.</p>

<p>ps: Today is the first day of the four days Dan has had his bike
  that it was not ticketed, nor stolen.  However, he almost caused a
  four bike-pileup (almost being the key word) and in the resulting
  state of shock, he got lost on the way home.</p>
