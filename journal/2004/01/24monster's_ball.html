<p>janette rented <em>Monster's Ball</em>, but I couldn't stand to
  watch it just before bedtime.  I've never seen it, but I didn't like
  the opening scenes' racism and sexism and stuffed emotions and many
  "negative" qualities that I've worked to release from my life.  Plus
  I was just shivering from the tension as they're preparing to kill
  this cat whose character has only been developed as a man who is
  calm, caring, encouraging and apologetic.</p>

<p>I intend to watch it with her tomorrow when it's more like daytime
  instead of the last thing before bed.</p>
