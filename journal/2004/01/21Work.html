<p>Yesterday at work I had a class with a guy whose tickets expire
  the next day, so he was taking a man to man lesson to ease the pain
  of losing the tickets/money.  I was like, "what do you want to
  study?  you wanna use the book?" and he goes, "no," and clearly
  flipped the book upside down and away.</p>

<p>He asked me to help him with his job; he needs to make phone calls
  to customers, and he didn't have a few set introductory lines.  I
  asked him the parameters and came up with something like this for
  him:</p>

<pre>
Hello my name is Bingo; I like to climb on things; can I have a banana?  Eeek eek.
</pre>

<p>Oh wait, not that.  I came up with this:</p>

<pre>
Hello; this is Akiakiaki from Joe's Computer Shop calling in regards
to a problem with your [fill in the blank].  

Are you familiar with the problem that was reported?

(( Do you know who I can talk to about it? ))

Excellent.  Before we begin, may I have your name?

HI, Jack, what seems to be the problem?
</pre>

<p>and I wrote it all down nicely for him on a flow chart according
  to what the customer says, etc.  When we practiced it, I
  deliberately didn't follow the flowchart perfectly, making sure he
  could use the language without just mindlessly reading it from the
  page.  Like I would say, "hello, this is Joe" to make sure he
  didn't say "before we begin, may I have your name?"  but  he said
  it anyway, and caught himself halfway through.</p>

<p>A different time I stated that I had no idea what the problem was
  before he asked, "are you familiar with the problem?" to make sure
  he didn't ask that line.  He did ask anyway; he didn't know the
  meaning of the word 'familiar.'  So we worked that bug out of the
  flowchart.</p>

<p>The next time I went right into the problem so he didn't have to
  ask the familiar line, but interrupt with asking the cat's name.</p>

<p>The student seemed really happy with the results; I was really
  pleased to have helped him so meaningfully.</p>

<p>A different student's points expired the next day, so she also
  booked a man to man lesson.  She's a cartoonist and just wanted to
  chat.  I gave her the line, "When I get a deadline [for my work], I
  pretend the deadline is sooner, then I go travel after I finish the
  project."  (or something like that; what I gave her sounded better)
  She was like, "this is really important for me," meaning "this is
  really useful for me."  I was like, "yay!"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Had the opportunity to talk to the student who makes no sense in
  voice.  This is the student who chided me for not having given
  enough personal talk time last time I taught voice.  I put everyone
  in pairs and paired this student with myself.  When I was asked,
  "what do you understand, think, or consider about my opinion?" I
  was able to say, "I don't follow most of what you said," and
  explain to the best of my ability what I heard, but how I didn't
  understand how they were related topics or how any of them related
  to what I had asked.</p>

<p>A super high level woman came in and was able to interrupt my
  conversation with this student, and I gave her the lowdown; and the
  other student continued the convo for about 5 words, she was like,
  "I think I'll join the other group," and got up and left.</pre>

<p>I did a quick check-in with the other groups in the voice room, who
  had spontaneously switched from pairs into two larger groups.  They
  said they were doing fine.  I wondered if they were specifically
  happy I had taken the confusing student out of the group.</p>
