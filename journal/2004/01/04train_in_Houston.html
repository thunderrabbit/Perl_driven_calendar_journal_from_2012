<p>Yay.  The first train in Houston is now open.</p>

<pre>
   Moments later, the train came to an unexpected halt at the Ensemble
   station, about midway along the route. "This train is out of
   service, please unload this train," came the announcement.
   Conductors on the platform said someone had pulled an emergency
   brake. "Folks," one said, "do not pull this hammer. Nobody can go
   anywhere."
