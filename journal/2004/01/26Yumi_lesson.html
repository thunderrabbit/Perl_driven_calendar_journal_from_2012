<p>On the way to Yumi's lesson.  Because we didn't ride bikes, bang,
got flowers for Yumi (cause I cancelled last lesson with her).</p>

<p>Though we didn't ride bikes to the station, and were on a local
  train to Kita Senju (therefore not a train going all the way to
  Shibuya), and had to wait for a Shibuya-bound train at なかめぐろ, I
  made it to the lesson with a minute to spare.</p>

<p>I knew 3 hours (planned lesson time) was really long for a lesson,
  so I taught her only two basic things.  1) "I have been ..." and "I
  had been ..." and 2) "I am wearing black and red" and "I am not
  wearing blue or green," plus the word "actually."</p>

<p>She actually had an easier time with the have and had, or I
  misunderstood how much trouble she didn't have with and and or.</p>

<p>Yumi terminated the lesson after we had been studying for 2.6
  hours.  She had had enough.  "Finish."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After lesson, Yumi didn't actually want to wait around for 10
  o'clock to meet janette at the time and place we had agreed, but I
  actually found janette who had been trying on green and black hats
  or something, and we caught up with Yumi at the Yamanote platform.
  Actually, she had just gotten on the train.  They met and yammered
  and when we got to Shibuya, janette forgot to get off with me; she
  actually had been thinking Yumi had to get off there.  janette would
  have stayed on the train, even though I had gotten off, so Yumi had
  to push her off.</p>

<p>In Shibuya, amazingly, a Japanese guy talked to us.  He was drunk
  (I wonder how long he had been drinking) but even so, no Japanese
  people have straight up talked to me for no apparent reason, and
  I've seen lots of drunk Japanese.  We yammered as best we could in
  Japanese and English.  As we were nearing Tsunashima, he was
  inviting janette and I to drink (!) with him in Yokohama or
  Sakuragicho.  No way jack.  We're um, meeting friends.  Yeah, that's
  the ticket.</p>

<p>We did meet a friend.  Jen was coming the other way as we got to
  Lawson.  She told us about her head injury story and showed us the
  staple in her head.</p>

<p>(( Her chain popped off her bike as she had been trying to
  accelerate quickly (standing up) and she just flipped the fuck off
  her bike and busted her head.  She was like, "hey I fell" and was
  trying to get the chain back on when the blood started to pour into
  her eye.</p>

<p>Good thing Grace hadn't been too far ahead. ))</p>
