<p>Watched approx the first half of Monster's Ball with janette.  I
  have to zoom to my lesson with Yumi so I stopped the movie as the
  dad was going into Halle Berry's house for the first time.</p>

<p>janette was a bit teary, so I intoned his voice</p>

<p>"Naih huney, Ima gonna be gown foah cuppla ars.  Yoo gonna be
aight?"</p>

<p>"Ah reckon."</p>

<p>Hahahah funny.</p>

<p>Wow.  Um, pretty good movie.  I was reallly worried about her
  reaction to seeing the truth of the history of Billy Bob and her
  husband.  It didn't seem realistic, but I was happy for the soft
  ending because I didn't want to go to sleep with crunchy memories
  floating around my noggin.</p>
