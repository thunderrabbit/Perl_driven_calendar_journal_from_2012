<p>I've been up for hours (4 hours?) since the bike ride, smurfing my
  photos with iPhoto Buddy, a freeware tool that helps organize my
  photos in iPhoto, making it work with smaller chunks of photos,
  thereby increasing the speed when working with a particular
  chunk.</p>

<p>The process of creating chunks requires copying libraries and then
  removing the unwanted bits from the various libraries, XORing the
  pics, kinda.</p>

<p>Right now I've asked iPhoto to import a large directory structure
  with very few files in it.  It's taking far longer than I hoped, but
  it might be doing the right thing (importing 4 art images from a
  library).  We shall see after I wake up; I'm going to bed now.</p>

<p>Ah, it seems to have worked.  Nice.</p>
