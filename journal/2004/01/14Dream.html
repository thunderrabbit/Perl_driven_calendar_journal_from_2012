<p class=dream>Katie B-H and i were not allowed to meet, but we met
  anyway and were thinking of a code of sorts to send each other via
  text message that would tell us where to meet, but not be traceable
  by anyone else.  "he wants to meet you" would mean "meet me at the
  Mickey Mouse statue (he)" and "she wants to meet you" would be "meet
  me at the Minnie Mouse statue (she)" and then we could add times or
  whatever to that.</p>

<p class=dream>Then KB-H turned into Fred and he was throwing rocks
  at a car in a most malicious manner I thought, but turns out he was
  trying specifically to hit a rock that was an answering machine
  that was currently taking a message by some woman we didn't know.
  She was a mom, "I don't know where my son is, but he was supposed
  to be at ____ but all I can find is his shirt with vomit on it."
  and some pretty scary stuff for real life.</p>

<p>I'm glad it was a dream.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a sandwich that had either been left out
  since last night or last week and I figured last night, but I still
  didn't want to eat it because it had lunch meat in it and I threw it
  away.</p>
