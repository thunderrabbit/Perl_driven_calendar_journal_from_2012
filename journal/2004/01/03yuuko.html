<p>Yuuko and I went to dinner.  First place was closed and we paid a
  dollar to get the car out of the parking lot though it had only been
  5 minutes.  Second place has a buffet that I think I'll visit again
  soon.</p>

<p>Rented a movie on the way home.  <em>The Tuxedo</em> starring
  Jackie Chan.  I figure it's a better first movie than seeing 
  <em>Kill Bill</em> with Miki.</p>

<p>After the movie we talked.  She typed something into her
  dictionary and said I was often "seriousness," which she has told
  me when my brain goes to mush-mode wondering wtf I'm doing in this
  situation with a cute woman whose heart I fear I'm destined to
  break.   (janette, I know, grrr; I hate it too, but this is my
  truth right now.)</p>

<p>She reached into the far reaches of her brain to come up with
  English to say essentially the following:</p>

<p>"I watched your journal; some I can understand.  is your girlfriend
  mad?"  (why did you write about kissing me?)</p>

<p>I explained that I had to be honest with janette.  That though I
  could have chosen not to tell janette, that would hurt my heart and
  make me cry.</p>

<p>I further explained that honesty and ほんね are really important to
  me.  I said, "please don't tell me あたため," (Japanese for the
  officially stated position, designed to keep people from being mad
  at each other).  She was really happy to hear me say that and gave
  me high fives.</p>

<p>Then she dropped a big question.  First in Japanese which I didn't
  understand at all, and then in English.</p>

<p>What do you think about me?</p>

<p><em>Wow.</em></p>

<p>I explained that I want to get to know her more.  I explained that
  I want kiss her but I can't because I have a girlfriend.  (?) That I
  shouldn't have kissed her at Hakkeijima.  I explained that I try to
  kiss too soon in relationships. (!)</p>

<p>(!) all this was a good challenge to communicate with 7A
English.</p>

<p>"What do you think about me?"  I asked of her.</p>

<p>She explained that I was her first foreign friend and that she
  wants to get to know more foreigners because she doesn't like
  Japanese; she explained that Japanese hearts are too small.  (I
  imagine she's describing what I call Japanese holding all their
  emotions in.)</p>

<p>I'm like, <em>eek, so basically you're a virgin when it comes to
    foreigners.  Holy shit that scares the crap outta me.</em>  I
    went back to serious mode.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>My brain had gone to mush.  In the best Japanese I could muster I
  said basically, "Now, my brain is an eraser."  {いま、私ののうはけい
  しゴムです。}I consulted her dictionary and entered "fate" and she
  said she understood the term.</p>

<p>I grabbed a shiny gold (color) 500 yen coin (enough to buy a small
  lunch) and said, "Sometimes, my brain is an eraser.  Right turn,
  left turn, I don't know.  But this [coin] knows." {ときどき、私ののう
  はけいしグム。　左まがて右にまがて、わかない} I flipped the
  coin. "Ah, right turn."　{ah 右にまがります。}</p>

<p>I recognized I had one serious flaw in my plan.  I could not just
  flip the coin and make it choose if Yuuko stays (to talk) or goes
  (now).  She is a human with her own wants and needs.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you want to do?  Talk or go?" {いま、何をしますか。は
  なします、いきます？}</p>

<p>She answered in English, "both okay."</p>

<p>Perfect.  "Okay."  (this word is now Japanese as well) "Flower is
  talk.  500 yen is go.  Okay?" {花は話します。 五百円は行く。わ
  かた？}</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>"Understand?" 　{わかた？}</p>

<p>"Understood."  {わかた。}</p>

<p>I flipped the coin.  Missed it and it landed on my leg and fell on
  the couch.  "Sorry."  {ごめね}</p>

<p>"No problem."  {いいよ}</p>

<p>I flipped it again.  Caught it, flopped it hidden onto my other
  hand.  "Okay?"</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>I uncovered it.  "Okay, it's byebye." {okay byebye です。}</p>

<p>I gave her a hug.  I mentally hugged my angels.  One day I'll be
  able to say what I need instead of relying on a coin.</p>

<p>- - - -
<br>- - - -</p>

<p>(?) janette and I have decided to break up after she comes here.
  Actually we are broken up now, but she'll choose not to have sex
  with me if I have sex with anyone else, so I'm using "I have a
  girlfriend" as a front to keep myself from kissing and risking going
  further with women I don't really know yet.</p>
