<p>Last night I moved my mattress to the guest bedroom (the empty
  bedroom cause Dan and I have no roommate; I should add that to the
  State of My Life; brb; okay) because my room had accumulated some
  mildew from the windows (which explains why the windows had been
  sealed shut with plastic wrap when I moved in).  I dried out the
  room last night and am moving back in today.  It was kinda like
  camping to move my bed, but I was so tired that I didn't spend much
  time being awake in the other room.</p>
