<p>Just now I have finished the State of My Life from yesterday and
  find myself unwanting to work on my suggested tasks.  I'm stuck on
  this sticky machine type type typing.  I want to erase all these
  confused feelings with a good orgasm that will just put me to
  sleep.</p>

<p>I'm going to close this computer, and (aha!  part of it is that I
  need to go pee.  That need to pee draws my attention to my crotch
  and I sometimes mistake it for a need for sexual release.  It's
  just a need for physical release.)</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to close this computer, go peeee, then sit and
  bathe these concerns with love and trust for a brighter future.</p>
