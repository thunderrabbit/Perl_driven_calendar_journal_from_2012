<p>I typed this dream with my eyes closed; don't have time to
  spellcheck it now.</p>

<p class=dream>We all got a bunch of furniture near the book store at
  the corner in Tsunashima and had to carry it home.  Most of us got
  chests of drawers. I got a chest with two drawers side by side that
  loked double deep but were just single deep with a large  front
  face thing.  Laura Caddell (YRUU) was going to help me carry it to
  my apartment over the river and she went walking that waay to get
  something to help us carry it, and aI found that we could carry it
  ourselves; it wasn't that heavry and I called her name.  Had to
  yelll pretty oudly to get her attention and I was a bit worried aht
  I was remembering te wrong name, but I was correct.</p>

<p class=dream>She turned around and came back and I had put the
  drawers on the side (which is how I found out they were only half
  size) and she grabbed one end of the chest and I grabbed the other
  and we hefted it up and soon as we really started walking, we were
  sudenly in line behind all the other YRUUers who had their own
  chests, but were stopped in line waiting to toss them onto a big
  greyhound type bus that waa donated to us to carry our stuff.</p>

<p class=dream>The bus was right behind a big plane cockpit and we
were tossig our chests into the plane and some of th boys had climbed
through the bus windshield to get to the plane.  I wasn't 100% sure
they had done that, so I asked the bus driver how I was supposed to
get to the plane and he was like through the windshield.  It was a
really thin (not tall) windshield and I climbed through kinda on my
hands and feet (had to be prone) but didnd't eally have anywhere to
put my hands or knees or feet and I hit some switches on the control
panel of the bus and turned on his horn and somethig else.</p>

<p class=dream>But I made it through and tossed my box forward toward
the plane, oh I had already done that but it had fallen short of the
plane so when I climbed through, the bus driver noticed ow far it was
to teh plane so he said, "here I will scoot forward a bit a" and the
plane tarted toooting forwad as well and the box that had fallen to
the ground was repeatedly disappearing underneath the bus, which I
knew was chronoligically impossible, but I went with it and reached
down and snagged it the next time it passed by with no problem and I
tossed it onto the plane.</p>

<p class=dream>A piece of string that I needed for my bo was caught on
the cockpit control panel, whcih was really old and looked like a
circuit board from an old 1975 ish calculator or something, and I had
to gingerly lift the string off the control panel so that it wouldn't
interfere with the pilots' flight and I sorta hit the yoke of the
plane and I hoped I hadn't knocked it too far to make the plane start
moving off course cause there was no one to fly it properly.</p>

<p>the dream switched</p>

<p class=dream>studying Japanese and there was one teacher and two
students, me and a Japanese woman who was studying English and at one
point the woman goes, "I don't know what "wear first time" means" or
something and I translated it to Japanese "ichi kiru mae" and the
sensei was like "yep" and I'm like "really?" and then I woke up and
I'm like</p>

<p>oh maybe not.</p>

<p>but it still felt pretty good to be right.</p>
