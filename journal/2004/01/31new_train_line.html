<p>Holy cats.</p>

<p>My brain is kinda spinning from what I've seen here.</p>

<p>At this station (Tammachi), the Tokyu Toyoko line has been changed
  from going above ground level to being 4 stories below ground
  level.  The change happened in one night.  Or, actually, within
  four hours.</p>

<p>Now, granted, they didn't build this new station four stories below
  ground in four hours; this shit is so fly that they've probably been
  working on it since before I arrived in Japan.</p>

<p>But, yesterday, the trains ran on the tracks five stories up.
  Today they run right here.</p>

<p>The next station is still the old station with the old tracks with
  pigeon poo all over them.  I got off at that station and followed
  the tracks back toward where the change occurred.  The pictures
  didn't come out, but there are towers</p>

<p>that have two sets of supports for the overhead electric cable
  thing for the trains to get energy.  So the tracks used to be, for
  example 5 feet higher than they are now.  Which means the train is
  going through where the old tracks used to be.  Which means the old
  tracks had to be removed while the trains weren't running (during
  the four hour window last night) and then the new track put in
  place.</p>

<p>Shit it's 2am; I'm tired as fuck.  I was pissed at the guy in my
  train station for kicking me out; I just wanted a momento of this
  change.  But all the old maps seem to be gone, and the old (unneeded
  as of today) posters are apparently too important to give away.</p>

<p>I was glad to talk to Dan about it, and relay all the mysteries I
  had seen.</p>
