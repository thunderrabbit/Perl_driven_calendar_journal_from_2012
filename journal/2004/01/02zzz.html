<p class=date>3:29am JST Saturday 3 January 2004</p>

<p>Today is the day Dan and I put up some maps, cut the advertising
  part out of the JR line map of Tokyo and reattached the trim to the
  map part of the poster, put up a blank sheet of butcher paper (that
  had been used to protect my canvas) on the wall where a poster of
  some basketball cat had been (Kenyon Martin I think (whose name I
  only remember cause it said "Grand Kenyon" on the poster)) after
  Dan had said "we must find a replacement poster before the end of
  the holidays," and the day I began to clean my room before janette
  comes to visit in less than two weeeeeks!</p>
