<p>AM comes early these days it seems.  janette and I showered to get
  the disgusting smoke smell off us and then slept for 1.5 hours.
  Ooooh that alarm came quickly.</p>

<p>I hit snooze once, but was smart enough to know that I didn't have
  enough time to snooze enough to help; I had already set my alarm 40
  minutes later than on a normal Saturday morning.  After I had been
  up a bit, I sat on the bed to put on my socks and realized I was
  nearly falling asleep sitting there.</p>

<p>oops get up get up get up</p>

<p>Called Carla (who asked an obvious question, "did you have fun last
  night, bud?" (which I would quickly discard before asking (but not
  have an alternative)) and I was like, "yeah most def,"
  plus <em>thanks for asking</em>) to make sure she was up, and then
  called Cory (Janis answered) to make sure they were up.  Phone call
  with Janis lasted 8 seconds.  "good morning."  "HI, yeah, we're up"
  "okay see you."</p>

<p>Whew.  I have successfully made it to Kawasaki without falling
  asleep or missing any stops.  (helps that this is the last stop on
  the line, but hey; I'm conscious.)  I'll probably be at work before
  anyone else and will take a short nap therefore.</p>
