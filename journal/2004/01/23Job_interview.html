<p>I saw a strange ad on the train today; one that had a book with
  really strange English wording on it:  "Hello, Jane, what is the
  book that you are reading?"  "Hello, John,  I am reading the book
  of Arnold Whatsisname in order to write a paper of it." or some
  shit like that, and on the page on which it's written, is a picture
  of a young man and woman and then scribbling on the page, little
  doodles of graffitti including a disco light near the letters DISCO
  of "Discover" etc etc.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page, was katakana that I slowly read:</p>

<p>マンツーマン英語</p>

<p>"ma n tsu ma n eigo"</p>

<p>"mantsu man eigo"</p>

<p><em>Man to man English!</em></p>

<p>So I wrote down the number and called them during janette's lesson.
  I have an interview with them on Tuesday 10 February at 10 am.</p>
