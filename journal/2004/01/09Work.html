<p>I had my end of contract review at Nova today.  I got an S on "acts
  in a professional manner with students."</p>

<p>"Why did I get an S here?"</p>

<p>"Do you really want to get into it?"</p>

<p>"... no."</p>

<p>"Maybe you can imagine why that's there."</p>

<p>[imagine] [imagine] [imagine] "fair enough."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the evaluation, I felt kinda poopy.  Like <em>aw man i'm a
    bad person yaddayaddayadda</em>.</p>

<p>But then I let myself cry in the stairwell a bit, to try and get
  to the core of the issue.</p>

<p>Ah.  I found it.  I'm a bad person if I assume that this evaluation
  describes what I'm supposed to be.  I'm a money teacher; I know
  that.  This evaluation just says I don't fit in to
  what <em>Nova</em> wants in a teacher.  Oh happy day!</p>

<p>Today, Yutaka told me Akina told him to tell me HI.</p>
