<p>My dream included a guy speaking to me in Japanese and I couldn't
  understand him, and then I realized that if I can't speak Japanese,
  but my dream is speaking Japanese, then probably it's unintelligible
  Japanese.  But as I'm more awake, I wonder if I can access
  intelligible Japanese.</p>

<p>Yamanote kept coming to my dream.  The word in Japanese, not the
  thing.  »³¤Î¼ê</p>
