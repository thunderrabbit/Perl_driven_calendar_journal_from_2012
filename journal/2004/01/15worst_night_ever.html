<p>Ironic that I'm writing just after she said, "I won't read your
  journal anymore until I'm able to read it without being upset."</p>

<p><em>now</em> we are broken up.</p>

<p>But we're too good of friends to be idiots about it for the rest
  of her visit.  I'm thankful about that.  Just right now while I'm
  tired I feel like shit.</p>

<p>She pointed out that though I don't see a solution to this, I have
  not given as much concerted effort toward this issue as I gave
  toward, say, my men's group, learning how to communicate
  effectively.</p>

<p>True enough.  I'm glad she said that.</p>

<p>Like, will she come to japanese class with me tomorrow?  If she
  doesn't I sure as fuck won't be able to have an effective lesson; I
  haven't studied nor done my homework; I would just feel like fuck
  like I don't know jack shit what's going on, and if she does go I
  sure as fuck hope we aren't like mad at each other; that would suck
  worse that sucking.</p>

<p>Gad; I've got to sleep.</p>

<p>We did hug; we will be okay.</p>
