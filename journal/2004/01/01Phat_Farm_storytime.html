<p>Some weeks ago I was in Cinecitta while Miki was in her flute
  lesson.  A guy was on the street handing out flyers for his hip hop
  clothing store.  That was the day I hurt my wrist falling off my
  bike due to my umbrella engaging the front wheel and I was walking
  around looking for a Vodafone shop to have them replace my broken
  phone.  When I walked back by the guy, he was all, "hey man, how's
  it going, lemme show you what we got."</p>

<p>And he led me to (*)</p>

<p>(*) it's 8:58pm; I've been well distracted in the middle of the
story.  And I'm not done being distracted yet.</p>

<p class=date>10:03pm</p>

<p>And he led me to their little store about 50 critical feet off the
  main walking drag.  Expensive jackets, pants, shirts, shoes that I
  would never wear.</p>

<p>"Man...  <em>I'm</em> not cool enough to wear any of this..  I'm
  way too white."</p>

<p>"You can wear it mon."</p>

<p>Accent from Jamaica.</p>

<p>It was kinda hard for us to communicate (seemed to me); he seemed
  to mumble, and I seemed to be white and felt out of place.</p>

<p>I didn't want to leave empty handed; I simultaneously wanted to
  prove that I was cool, that I could afford it, and to help his
  shop.  <em>What could I wear in here?</em></p>

<p>"Lemme see your hats."</p>

<p>He showed me to some pimp Gilligan looking hats and I was like,
  "naw naw more like this one" and pointed to my knit cap that
  janette sent me.</p>

<p>I really hoped he had some.</p>

<p>He did; they were in the front case.  Celtics, Lakers, something
  else, and Phat Farm.  White with black logo and black with white
  logo.</p>

<p>"How much is Phat Farm?"</p>

<p>"Tix tousand yen."</p>

<p>He handed me the white one.</p>

<p>"Naw the black one."</p>

<p><em>holy shit six thousand yen is a lot.</em></p>

<p>My mind chewed on the number and my desire to buy something.</p>

<p><em>I'll bargain with him.  What's a good number?  Four?  Five?
    How do people normally bargain?  I don't want to be a wuss nor an
    ass.</em></p>

<p>I fingered the material.  "Five thousand yen?"</p>

<p>"No, treetousand," with a hint of "are you nuts?" intoned.</p>

<p><em>Three?</em> "Oh, okay; cool"</p>

<p>I pulled out three bills and he started to put the hat in a bag.</p>

<p>"Naw, I'm gonna switch it now."</p>

<p>And I left wearing my new Phat Farm hat.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"switch it now" ??? This was my attempt at being cool with the
  language instead of using "put it on" which seemed quite white, or
  "wear it out [of the store]" which reminded me of being a little kid
  with new shoes.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I felt a bit conspicuous, but no one seemed to notice I was
  wearing it.  Now it's nearly my favorite knit cap.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I was walking around with Miki some days later in the area and
  caught the guys eye.  I smiled and gave that guy head-nod thing and
  he did similarly, like, "nice hat."</p>
