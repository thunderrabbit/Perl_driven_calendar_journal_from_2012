<p>Lesson with 由美 was fun as always.  She was there before me for
  once (we usually start at 7, but today due to working late (welcome
  back to work; it's a short schedule in the middle of the day), I had
  to shift the lesson to 7:30.</p>

<p>I taught her how to say "Aw man, that sucks, dude." and something
  else equally important I'm sure.</p>

<p>The biggest any one part of the lesson was making sentences using
  "since."</p>

<li><p>I have been here since 7:00.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been here since yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been here since December 5th, 2001.</p></li>

<li><p>I have had this watch since Christmas.</p></li>

<li><p>I have studied English since last summer.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't had a job since December 25th.</p></li>

<p>いろいろ</p>

<p>I tried to keep the Japanese to a minimum.</p>
