<p>janette gave me 5000 ±ß for the trip home.</p>

<p>The woman is yammering in Japanese about drinks and I heard
  "vanilla ice cream."  That's just what I want to have right about
  now.</p>

<p class=date>7:10pm</p>

<p>I do feel better after ice cream.</p>

<p>Carla wrote to me to ask where I was today and to see if I can do
  a shift swap (probably this was primary reason for her message) and
  to say HI.</p>

<p>I told her I was eating ice cream to feel better.</p>
