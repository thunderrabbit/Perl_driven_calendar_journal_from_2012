<p>Finished lunch at work; been listening to my mix CD that I made.
  Glad that some of the others are enjoying it. Kinda feel like I
  could fit in here.  That kinda makes me wanna stay, but we'll see
  how gaba feels when I visit there.</p>

<p>Quote of the day: "Shinjuku smells more dangerous than
  Harajuku."</p>

<p>I successfully did not give my email address to a student.  She was
  like, "this is my last Nova day and I'm worried about losing my
  English so I'm looking for an exchange partner."  I'm not sure how
  much more of an opportunity I would need, but I didn't take this
  one.  I did give her a Metropolis magazine and showed her the
  language exchange classifieds in the back.  She seemed quite pleased
  with that.  I also gave her Rie's email address in the US in case
  she wants to try and rock over to the US.</p>

<p>Oops there's the bell.  Lunch is over.  Peace.</p>

<p>I have two homework assignments from work:  how many light minutes
  is it from earth to mars, and what's this business about NASA
  having named a rock "sashimi" or something like that?</p>

<p>My last lesson was these two level 4 students whose grammar was not
level 4 calibre, though their fluency was pretty up there.  I am happy
to feel like they actually got something from the lesson.  I taught
them the difference in meaning between "I have gone shopping" and "I
have been shopping" and "I have been going shopping."</p>

<p>I had presented the language and one said, "Recently, I have been
going to Hawaii," and I told them that meant he must be very rich. He
wanted to know why it meant multiple times, and I was like,
"hmmmmm."</p>

<p>Then I was like, "arigh" cause I figured out how to explain it.  I
  had the perfect tool at my disposal; a room overlooking trains at
  Kawasaki station.</p>

<p>"That train is going to Yokohama."</p>

<p>"That train has gone to Yokohama."</p>

<p>"Trains have been going to Yokohama all day."</p>

<p>blah blah blah bang they understand.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>To balance, another student was making the same errors I had
  corrected before, using the same technique I used today.  I didn't
  notice it was the same until he started telling me the same story,
  and I wondered why he couldn't learn it, and I wondered what
  different way I could teach it.  Hmmmm.</p>
