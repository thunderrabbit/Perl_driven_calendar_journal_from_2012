<p>Damm that Dodonpa is fast.  I snuck my camera on in my pants and
  took a video of the ride.  But the video is nearly useless except
  for the very beginning of the ride.  The rest is less than a blur;
  it's just <em>white</em>.  I don't know if I was aiming up at the
  sky or what.  I might ride it again to try videoing it again, but
  that line is long for a short ass ride on which I can't even wear my
  glasses.  (It's that fast)</p>

<p>Right now we're on the ferris wheel and I moved all my pics from my
  camera to my computer.  I wanna ride the ferris wheel again (no line
  whatsoever) and get a video of Dodonpa.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>There's this cool cheapy little dungeon game where each player gets
  a card onto which little card reader(writer)s will write (or not)
  one of four different symbols.  In this darkened three story maze,
  we try to find all the readers, some of which are completely fake,
  and some of which don't write anything, and one of which will
  "erase" (write X on all four corners of) the card.</p>

<p>This has got to be the cheapest attraction for FQH to maintain, and
  it has captured my attention.  I want to solve it.  We've played
  three times and are making battle plans on how to go back in there
  with a systematic technique for winning.</p>

<p>Oh, the card readers (the real ones) do different things each game;
  they are reprogrammed between games, so the key, as we see it, is to
  learn which card readers are real, and memorize where they are. Then
  we'll put an old card in to test the readers' settings this game.
  If they are good, we'll put the real card in (one card per couple
  upon entering the game) and collect that symbol.</p>

<p>I'm writing now just before we put our jackets and computer in a
  locker while we run around inside this maze.</p>

<p>ps: my computer screen is solar powered right now.  (solar
illuminated)</p>

<p>Fuji-Q's haunted house closed before we went in.  I wonder if/why
  they didn't tell us they would close soon the first time we went to
  check the time.  We wanted to go in after dark; or rather we wanted
  to not waste daylight on an indoor ride.</p>

<p>We won that card reader game.  We got a card full of all the right
  shapes, but then got killed in the last room.  The second time we
  got all the shapes, we ran up to the room and read the instructions.
  "Get through the room without touching laser beams."  Ah.  I stepped
  over one and slid under another, pulling myself with my forearms.
  janette passed through similarly.  We got little keychains that
  pointed us to <a
  href="http://www.fujikyu.co.jp/shingen.htm">www.fujikyu.co.jp/shingen.htm</a>
  with password tm46yw.</p>

<p>(( what a crock.  That page doesn't exist.  There's signage outside
the game that says "now play online" or some shit like that, but
[bang] 404 on that page.  ))</p>

<p>At the top of victory hill when we successfully completed the
  game, we got some pics of me an' janette before Mt Fuji, and a
  video of me sliding down a railing on my butt.</p>

<p>So, pretty much the lines were short today.  Plenty short that I'm
  more likely to wanna come back in the freezing winter than in the
  summer.  We probably rode more rides than Nami and I did.</p>

<p>I'm really thankful for janette waking up in the middle of the
  night to go.</p>
