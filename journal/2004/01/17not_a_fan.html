I like to read your journal, it makes me feel really good about
myself. Your journal is pretty transparent, used just to play
mindfuck games with your NOT girlfriend. You really need to get
honest if you want it to work. Come on rob reach down and touch
that inner child.

<p>I've come home tonight after a pretty good night with janette and
  Fred and several peeps from work at Masayo's house and find this
  comment waiting for me.  I'm barely awake enough to finish this
  entry and I've got these words echoing through my mind.  I wonder
  what this person means about my needing to be honest (after saying
  my journal is transparent (which I'm taking to mean honest))
  Further, how could my journal be just to play mindfuck games with my
  not girlfriend?  I started my journal well before I met anyone that
  I hang with now (except my brother, mom and dad)</p>

<p>I'm glad my journal makes this person feel good about him or
herself.</p>
