<p>Noteworthy about last night:</p>

<p>"Byebye Canadians!"  - Junko when Benny and Carla didn't notice
  that everyone *else* was going into the nearby grocery store.</p>

<p>Masayo's apartment complex is really nice looking.</p>

<p>Now I've eaten nabe.</p>

<p>I started a trend by getting my ice cream first.  I was worried
  that people would complain that it wasn't time yet, or that I was
  being rude by not getting some for everyone.  (I did ask some
  people if they wanted theirs, but they were like "no")</p>

<p>janette left her glove at the train station ticket booth and Carla
  had to sign some paperwork to pick it up.</p>
