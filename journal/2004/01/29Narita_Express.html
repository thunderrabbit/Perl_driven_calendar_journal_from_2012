<p>Taking the Narita Express from Yokohama to Narita costs 4000 yen
  each.  We get assigned seats and zoom to our destination in 90
  minutes.  There's also (I believe) a restroom on the train.  Yay.
  And a smoking area.  Boo.</p>

<p>janette is taking measurements of my wallet so she can make me a
  new one, faster, stronger, more powerful than the one before.  This
  wallet that she's replacing is the one I bought at the 100 yen store
  with ¤³¤³ back in the day.  (Damn.  I've got "back in the day"
  stories here in Japan.)</p>

<p>I've made a .avi copy of one scene from Dirty Third II.  I'm going
  to send it to Fred.  (g- it's a secret so forget you read that.)</p>

<p>Ooh weird.  I was just trying to figure out how to adjust how big
  the panes are on finder and I discovered the Universal Access icon
  in System Preferences.  Zoom is pretty fun (for a while) and now
  I've got my screen set to negative colors.</p>
