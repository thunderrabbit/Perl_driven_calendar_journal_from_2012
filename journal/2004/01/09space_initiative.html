     President Bush will make a speech next week outlining a major
     space initiative, the White House said last night.
     
     Administration officials said they expected that Mr. Bush would
     propose a research and development program with the aim of
     establishing a base on the moon, as a prelude to a longer-term
     goal of sending humans to Mars.

<p>"Mate!"  and I read the above to Dan.</p>

<p>"I know a way they could sorta raise funds for this.  They could
  sell lottery tickets for like two dollars apiece....  Wouldn't it be
  just <em>wicked</em> to win a trip to Mars?"</p>

<p>"Uhhhhhhh.  I can think of a few reasons that I don't think that
  would work.  One: I don't think they could actually make enough
  money on a lottery to send someone to Mars.  It would be really
  fucking expensive to send a body to Mars.   Two: ... not
  just <em>anyone</em> can go to Mars."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It takes seven months to get to Mars."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  And you put someone who is a bit claustrophobic in the
  ship, or a bit psychopathic, for seven months.... they would destroy
  it."</p>

<p>". . . ...  Homer Simpson went into space."</p>

<p>[blink]  "You're right.  That completely destroys my logic.
  I'm so sorry to have wasted your time."</p>
