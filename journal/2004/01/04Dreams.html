<p class=dream>I was in a military jet with my dad flying and he was
  headed angled toward the ground it seemed and I'm like, "dad" and no
  change, "DAD!" and I hit him on the shoulder to make sure he was
  awake and he shifted slightly and he's like, "watch" and flying
  really slowly he tilted the plane on its side flying and flew
  through a Walgreens store in one door and out the other on the
  opposite side; not breaking anything as the doors opened properly
  and everyone moved out of the way.  I was like wtf and he said that
  it was just something that he and his peers do and I shouldn't worry
  about it.</p>

<p class=dream>I asked him how he did it and he said he dropped the
  exhaust down to lowest mode and said it produced a lot of black
  smoke, so I said, "so is Walgreen's now full of smoke?"  Like see it
  wasn't such a great non-interrupting thing after all, but oh well,
  hey.</p>

<p class=dream>and then a car drove by with a sign saying UPS TIX or
  TIX UPS in a strange font and then I saw a train go by and the last
  car was just the trucks of the train and it released itself so its
  momentum still carried it forward but it was lagging behind the
  train.  and the train went along one branch of the tracks and then
  the track switched to the other dirction and then it switched so
  that the car trucks would push the train switch to the opposite
  side, because the train track technology didn't support switching
  the train switch automatically and they had to resort to this
  momentum driven truck to switch it, and the trucks ended up in a
  part of the tracks that no train can visit; like both its sets of
  wheels were on the wrong side of the rail; it would have to be
  manually retrieved later.</p>

<p class=dream>I went up to it to see what I could figure out about
  the technoogy, but I couldn't see anything different and the dream
  switched.</p>


<p class=dream>In a crowded shopping mall area and an old woman asked
  a guy for money and he said, "you'll be okay," and she bowed deeply
  to him and he turned away.  I was like, I want to give you money old
  woman, but she had walked away as well.  When she came back, she
  asked my friend who already had money out and I already had 1000 yen
  note out and gave it to her, and she smiled at me and her faced
  flashed a different striped color; like it changed hue for a moment,
  and I was like, "did you for face just change color?"</p>

<p class=dream>And without looking confused at such a strange
  question, she goes "no."</p>

<p class=dream>Which made me know it had changed color; otherwise she
  would have been "wha?"  So I'm like "yes it did; your face just
  changed color.  You're an alien!"</p>

<p class=dream>And my friend was like, "way to preach the truth" and
  I'm like, "please give me the 1000 yen back" cause I wanted to see
  her face change again, (and I was aware that I wouldn't act this way
  around a non-alien; I was aware I was committing speciesism) and I
  took the 1000 yen from her hand and she made a contorted face
  attempt to not change her face, (like the alien posing as Bruce
  Willis' character in Fifth Element), and then I gave her the 1000
  yen back to see if it changed again, and then I was like, "give me
  all your money" and she was like, "no" and I took it from her and
  she tried to not change and contorted her face in all kinds of ways
  for about 10 seconds before recovering, and I gave her the money
  back and woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>Was in a waterslide type thing that was shaped like a
  staircase and had flat landings where the water turned and then
  ramps that went angled down to the next landing.  I wanted to make
  a pool out of the landing below and basically tried to push all the
  water off the current landing and I was really heartened by Benny
  saying, "I think it's a <em>great</em> idea," and I wanted him to
  watch me and be impressed with the huge pool I made in the lower
  landing, but he had already slid down the slide and I woke as I was
  trying to get his attention.</p>
