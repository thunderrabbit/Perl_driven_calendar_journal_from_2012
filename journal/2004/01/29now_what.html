<p>Now what do I do?  I've just told Carla that I don't need an
  emergency shoulder to cry on.  I'm considering texting Morag to see
  if I can talk to her tonight; and I'm considering just calling Dan,
  and my heart (?) leapt with joy (?) when I thought about texting Íµ
  »Ò, but that just seems so wrong to talk to her immediately.  How
  do I know the difference between following what makes my heart
  joyful and following what makes my heart joyful?</p>

<p>Um, I mean, okay, I have assumed that it's possible to live a life
  that is mostly filled with joy - a life that is primarily living
  for the search and expansion of love and goodness in the world.</p>

<p>I think the way to live that life is to do from moment to moment
  what my heart says is the right thing to do.  If my heart says to
  dance, then dance.  cry, then cry.  paint, then paint.  Call Yuuko,
  then call yuuko.</p>

<p>But then I'm like, eep I shouldn't call her because that would
  just be replacing one woman for another.  One external comfort for
  another. Maybe that's the difference.  Internal versus external
  comforts?  ..  I think it's more subtle than that.</p>

<p>I shall read from the book janette left me: _If Buddha Dated_.</p>
