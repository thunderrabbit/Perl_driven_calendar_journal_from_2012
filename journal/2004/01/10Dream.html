<p class=dream>In a restaurant type thing in Japan with a new kind of
  wasabi being served, that was kinda like soupy wasabi.  I requested
  some so I could taste it and the guy didn't give it to me
  immediately. I assumed he was lookng for a container to put it in
  but he went over and talked to another employee to confer with her
  and while I was waiting for the result, I woke up.</p>
