<p>Fred and I are on the »³¼êÀþ headed toward Akihabara.  I tried to
  find a shortcut from Shibuya there, and I kinda did I think; using
  the mystery line, we passed one station at which the Yamanote line
  stops.</p>

<p>This is the day I specifically asked janette to lock the door and
  soon after we hugged her bye in Tsunashima, I realized I had
  forgotten my phone.  Fred made a cursory (?) search for janette who
  had retained the key while I went back and climbed through the
  kitchen window to get in.  Got in; yay.</p>

<p>Withdrew some dollars and intend to buy a new camera today.  Want
  fly pictures of coasters at Fuji-Q Highland tomorrow.</p>

<p class=date>4:51pm</p>

<p>I'm going to ask Yumi if she wants to meet in Akihabara and help me
  get a camera; that will way reduce how busy I am today.  And she'll
  save money and have a lesson-of-sorts to boot.</p>

<p>Got a camera.  Yumi didn't want to hang with us in Akihabara.
  Don't know why.  I felt bad for therefore cancelling on her, but
  I'm letting it go.  Fred and I met janette at Miho's in
  Tsunashima.  Munched; chatted.   Fun times.</p>

<p>Bed bed bed now; I want to get up way early for Fuji-Q, but they
  don't want to get up as early.  I'm kinda bummed about that, but
  I'll get over it.  I should just fucking go alone sometime if I want
  to go early.  But that shit sure isn't as fun as with a friend,
  cause it seems way unlikely to meet someone in a park here in Japan.
  It's not like my days at Astroworld.  Ah well.  Bed now.</p>
