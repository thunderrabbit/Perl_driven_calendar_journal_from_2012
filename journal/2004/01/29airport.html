<p>Bye bye ¤Ç¤¹¡£</p>

<p>"There's a part of me that feels like by breaking up with you, I am
  now starting my life in Japan. Like <em>now I'm in Japan</em>."</p>

<p>No committment; no obligation.  Except for each of us to take care
  of ourselves in the best way we can.</p>

<p>We ate bentos out on the big balcony overlooking the jets.  I was
  like, "HEY!  HEY!  <em>HEY!!</em>" as a jet roared slowly by.
  "WE'RE TRYING TO EAT HERE!"</p>

<p>We each spilled a bit of food for the birds.  I hope they enjoy
  it.</p>
