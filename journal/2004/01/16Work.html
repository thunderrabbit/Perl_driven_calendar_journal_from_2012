<p>Taught Yuki, who didn't distract me as much as I thought she
  might.  That's good.</p>

<p>Taught level 4 number 13, and two of the students were really
  good, but the other was kinda slacking in the initiation
  department, but otherwise had good comp.  As the last part of the
  lesson, I was like, "aight, where are they?" and it's kindof tricky
  for the students to figure out from the text where the setting is,
  but it is possible to be pretty sure where they are.  At least
  generally.</p>

<p>Told Akina that I was going to Starbucks to meet Morag after
  work.  Wonder if she'll show up.</p>

<p>(she didn't)</p>
