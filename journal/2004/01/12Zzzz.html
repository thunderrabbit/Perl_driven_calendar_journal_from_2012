<p>I'm on the train home now.  I'm glad I'm tired.  janette left for
  here 1.75 hours ago I think.  That means she'll arrive in 12 hours,
  which is not right.  Unless the flight is mysteriously long for some
  reason.  Anyway, I'm tired and I'm glad cause I don't want to spend
  a lot of time awake waiting for her to get here.  That's part of why
  I wanted to go out with Yumi tonight, to distract me this evening
  from thinking about janette not being here.</p>
