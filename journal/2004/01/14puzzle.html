<p>Bill gave Fred a puzzle with 12 pieces.</p>

<p>An email from Fred about it:</p>

<pre>
So I got Bill's 12-piece puzzle together, happening across a few bits
of luck, seeing a few "ah ha"s, and muttering a few "you mother
fucker"s.

Then he hands me two more pieces.  

Of course he knew all about your "18-piece" puzzle, and saw the
12-piece on display somewhere, and the guy says "If you get the
14-piece puzzle, you can hold two back and make the 12-piece one."
That, of course, was just too perfect to pass up.

He assures me fourteen is it, for real this time.  I guess I'll
believe him, since he hasn't relly led me astray yet, just surprised
me.

But I'm going to leave that one alone a while and go back to messing
with yours.

<p>Tonight I was able to figure out the geometry to his 14 piece
  puzzle and I nearly got it together; he helped me tweak a couple of
  pieces' positions and we got it.  Smooth.  I was really glad to
  have been the one to essentially solve it.  Fred hadn't been able
  to solve it (okay, yes, he didn't really try according to the email
  above) so I was happy to get it.  He's the puzzlin' smartypants of
  the family.</p>
