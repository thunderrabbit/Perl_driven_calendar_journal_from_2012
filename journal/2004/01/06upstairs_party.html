<p>Went up to Lubo and Tim's room with Dan and hung out with them and
  the girls from upstairs (Jen, Orivia, Grace (who knows Mandarin,
  Cantonese, English and some French and some Spanish)) for Lubo's
  birthday party.  Mostly the girls just looked at pictures of
  drunken festivities on Lubo's computer, and I'm like, "err?"  I've
  got 3000+ photos of cool shit and they'd rather look at a bunch of
  drunk people?   Well, there it is.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder if ... then I realize no; I like myself better
  this way.</p>
