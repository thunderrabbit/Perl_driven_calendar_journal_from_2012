<p>This morning janette and I will roll up to my Japanese lesson with
  ¤¢¤ä¤Ê and janette will take the lesson while I do the homework
  that I didn't do last week.  I trust that my brain can get
  re-engaged in Japanese.</p>

<p>I wonder if the train we will take will be more crowded than any
  train janette has previously taken.</p>
