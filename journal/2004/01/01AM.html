<p>Woke up around 2pm.  Ate eggs that I cooked and some spinach that
  I bought.  Painted a bit on my painting.</p>

<p>Dan is watching _Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_ which is more
  violent than I remembered and more violent than I want to watch
  right now.</p>

<p>Four more days of no Nova.</p>
