<p>This is the first day that I've gone skating in Japan.  My skates
  arrived in Japan when janette brought them in September.  But the
  first (!) time I tried to put them on, the buckle broke.  That
  sucked.  Twice, Carla and I have planned to go skating (she'll
  bring duct tape; I'll bring my skates) and twice it has rained on
  our scheduled day.</p>

<p>The weather is traditionally clear around New Years in Tokyo and
  today that holds true.  Clear and cold.</p>

<p>As I walked to the train station, with my skates in my big rolling
  suitcase, I noted that in Houston or Dallas I would either drive
  with my skates to a place and skate, or put them on at my residence
  and skate from there.  The latter was usually my preference.  That
  equaled <em>skate <b>now</b></em>.</p>

<p>Got to Carla's around 8:40 and replied to Íµ»Ò's good morning text;
  the first we've talked in 2 days then dinged Carla's intercom.</p>

<p>Duct tape worked just fine to hold my skate on.  I was a bit
  worried at first, but I completely had no problems while skating,
  even doing some jumps and tight turns and all the silly stuff I
  like to do.</p>

<p>Skated around her extended neighborhood, including the edge of
  Chinatown where my mom and Jon and I hung out one night.  She showed
  me where a lot of skate video had been taken and told me that
  Clayton is wanting to edit the video, but doesn't have a fly enough
  computer to do it.  I wonder if my computer could.</p>

<p>(secretly I just want to be in a video / be inspired to make my
  own video / have access to a camera that can take video and relive
  the hilarious fun times that Fred, Pete, Katy and I all did back in
  the day)</p>

<p>On the way down from the backstage of their video lot (which
  completely describes nothing like what someone else would call it) I
  gained some speed and then saw that after I turned a corner I would
  have to descend some big stairs.  "Wuh oh.." but I was able to make
  it down without dying.</p>

<p>We skated near Sakuragicho and near the roller coaster and big
  ferris wheel and World Porters, then near Landmark Tower, next to
  which is a cooooool art thing that looks like a hybrid roller
  coaster / Matrix sentinel / metal snake.  VERY climbable.  (except
  for legal issues)</p>

<p>I left my camera at Carla's house though.  (*)</p>

<p>She showed me graffitti wall and pointed over to a building, "Benny
  lives over there."  Graffitti wall is about 600 meters long maybe
  and has hundreds of sections about 9 square meters that people have
  painted.  Some sections were obviously old with paint peeling, and
  some were new to Carla, so probably within a month or two old.  Many
  sections had the former images still visible along the top, as if
  recent artists don't have chairs to stand on when they paint.</p>

<p>Her favorite image reminded me of tribal face painting of people
  indigenous to the land where I used to live, and reminds her of
  Japan.</p>

<p>My favorite looked like a 1970s disco hip hop hybrid guy with big
  hair and big pants and tiny waist.</p>

<p>We shared stories and yammered about whatever we saw during the
  adventure. Good times.</p>
