<p>goals for today:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>go skating with Carla (in progress; I have on layers of clothes
  cause it's so cold outside, and I have my skates in a suitcase to
  take to her house.  No cool skatebag type thing, whatever that
  might look like, I dunno.)</p></li>

<li><p>write a State of My Life Address</p></li>
