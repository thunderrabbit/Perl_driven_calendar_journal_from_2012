<p>Before I got off the train for work, Carla texted me</p>

<pre>
ITS SNOWN YAAAHOOO!
</pre>

<p>And I was like,</p>

<pre>
WTF?  WHERE?  BRING PROOF!
</pre>

<p>And sure enough, when I was walking from the station to work, I
  saw some flakes flaking down.</p>

<p>When Benny arrived and everyone was like, "it's snowing!" he was
  like, "it's not Snowing; it's nothing if it's not sticking." cause
  he's from Canada and all that.  But when Carla arrived, she was
  like, "It's Snowing!  It's Snowing!  Isn't it Fun???"  And I was
  like "yah, Benny, see?  Carla [Canadian] says it's snowing." and
  gave Carla five.</p>

<p>Work was busy, but didn't stress me out nearly as much as it used
  to on Saturday.  Even when I couldn't find files (only 1 today) I
  was like, "arigh" and no stressed.  I did lesson 13 level 4 twice
  today, listening for specific information about the airplane that's
  landed in New York from London on the way to LA.  I found a good way
  to do that lesson that worked generally well twice.</p>

<p>I had topic voice today, which meant that the schedule had to be
  changed (actually taking a class of four level 6 students away from
  me) because topic voice was not scheduled on the computer.  That's
  another thing to add to the list of Dumb Things About The Way The
  Computer Is Set Up.</p>

<p>Oh, during my first class, Hiroko was in room 9 retrieving four
  students, and I was like "wha?" and after class was over, I
  discovered that Ali hadn't shown up.  Cory said Cory should (as the
  AT) have noticed, but I was like, "meh whateva" although I also
  said, "man, I can't believe that no one noticed."  Meh; whateva.</p>

<p>Bang four tickets that Nova has to eat.</p>
