  and I went to Starbucks to study tonight, but we just gossipped
  after I arrived and got my hot cocoa.</p>

<p>We had our first JAM Session.  By next week I will have called at
  least five numbers to find (or have made an appointment for) a
  therapist here in Tokyo.</p>

<p>She will have sent an email and looked up email addresses for
  three more organizations for her own project.</p>

<p>We gave each other mental hugs and encouragement and wrote down
  our goals.  Sweet.  I'm really glad to have developed this support
  system in J-town.</p>
