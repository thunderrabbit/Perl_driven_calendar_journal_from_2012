<p>Went out with Miki tonight.  Spent nearly 2 hours studying.
  Money.  Learned some good kanji and conjugations:</p>

<p>着る　着た　着ない　着なかった</p>

<p>etc; my brain is too tired to remember them all without my
  flashcards right now.</p>

<p>We watched <em>Bruce Almighty</em>, which left me feeling happy
  and empowered.  I wonder how much I'm really affected by movies.  I
  wonder if I should just rate movies on how good they make me feel.
  After leaving this movie, I felt empowered to change my job and my
  apartment and I felt like I was doing fabulously in Japan.  Thank
  you, movie.</p>

<p>I gave Miki her art thing that I colored some weeks ago.  She
  spent several minutes just looking at it, which makes me really
  happy to think that she likes it that much.  I'm really glad about
  that.</p>

<p>There's a new radio station that broadcast for maybe an hour on
  71.6fm from behind the water fountain at Cinecitta.  Yes, strange
  on my counts.</p>

<p>So, Miki.  I felt friendly with her, and we held hands outside
  walking around, but no real sparks or long term ideas.  Just walked
  around.  I invited her to hang at my apartment, but she wouldn't go
  because Dan might be here.  I'm like, "it's cool; he hangs with
  students too," but she wasn't having it.</p>

<p>We saw some footbags in Tokyo Hans, but I didn't buy one.  I
  wanted to feel them first to check the quality.</p>

<p>I came home to find Dan and Lubo here, both creating art.  Dan was
  painting and Lubo is composing a collage of train tickets into the
  kanji for Japan 日本。 I was in such a good mood I just let Dan use
  my paints and brush (in addition to his that he was already using)
  and it's all great here in the Bell Wistaria Art House.</p>

<p>Oh, ps: while running up the stairs from Azalea to Cinecitta, I
  tripped and kicked the crap out of the steps and stubbed my big toe,
  bruising it quite effectively and bending the nail to make a white
  line on it.  It bled a bit from under the nail.  I don't think I'll
  lose the nail, but I might.</p>

<p>It's interesting to have hit this nail; just yesterday my big toe
  nail poked through a hole in my sock and 裕子 commented on it.  I
  told her I'm saving my pedicure for janette.</p>

<p>'cept I didn't use the word pedicure.</p>
