<p class=date>3:17pm JST Saturday 3 January 2004</p>

<p>I took a delicious nap in the sun by the river; slept about an
  hour it seems, even with people talking sporadically around me and
  trains rumbling loudly by on the bridge every few minutes.</p>

<p>My bicycle slept under my knees, serving as my pillow.  My backpack
  slept between my legs who served as my computer's security guard.
  My phone was having trouble sleeping and woke me up with a message
  from Yuuko saying HI.</p>

<p>I didn't reply and went back to sleep for a while and then was
  woken up by a man singing boldly in Japanese, some traditional
  Japanese ballad (? I have no sense of music vocab) he sang to the
  river.</p>

<p>At that time, though it was still warm, the sun was checking its
  watch to see if it could shut down for the night and I figured I'd
  prefer to wake up while I was warm than while I was cold.  End on a
  high note (sung to the river).</p>

<p>On the way back, I saw Miho (actually she saw me first) on the
  bridge; she was going shopping with her mom.  Nice that she has the
  day off.</p>

<p>Got mad at a guy who got in my way as I picked up speed down the
  other side of the bridge.  Realized I was really just mad at the
  crowded Japanese world.  And maybe mad that saying HI to Miho was
  such a facade of genkiness but no apparent content - no hug, no ...
  anything but HI, but more HI than just "hi" ... it's just the
  Japanese culture.</p>

<p>But the nap was still delicious.</p>
