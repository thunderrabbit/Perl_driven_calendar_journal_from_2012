<p>Fuck this I fucking hate my journal.</p>

<p>Gr.</p>

<p>But I'm thankful that I have the tools to talk about things.</p>

<p>Thankful that I have someone worthy to talk to.</p>

<p>I thought about erasing my entire fucking
  journal.  <em>everything</em>.  Fine you don't like this entry?
  Well how do you like zero entries?  Fuck off.</p>

<p>But I recognized that might not feel like a good idea after doing
  it.  So, instead, we communicated real thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>For well over an hour.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder how any other woman can possibly stand a chance.</p>
