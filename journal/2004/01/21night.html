<p>Met janette near KQ station (and saw a student who I think was the
  high level woman in voice, but couldn't recognize her fo sheezy; she
  was all bundled up) and told janette a bit about my day and then we
  decided to get some hot drinks and watch the water fountains at
  Cinecitta.  Lo, the Pink Panther fountain had just started, which is
  my favorite so we ran the rest of the way to see it.  janette didn't
  agree that it was the best, but she liked it at least as well as
  "Swing swing swing."</p>

<p>We got hot chocolate and hot tea and a strawberry tart from
  Starbucks and though janette was actually just joking about it when
  she asked, we climbed the steps to overlook the fountains from the
  circular wall two stories up.</p>

<p>Just cuddled and chatted and felt the wall vibrate when KQ line
  trains would speed by.  I discovered that by pounding the handrail
  along the wall, a Starbucks cup would dance about in its bag in a
  most entertaining way.  Well, entertainingly enough to do it for
  about a minute.</p>

<p>The next water fountain show came on and janette climbed up onto
  the wall to watch because on the previous one, she had just held
  herself up on the handrail, which became most tiring, I'm sure.</p>

<p>We shared all our stories of the day, including her telling me how
  excruciatingly slow Fred was at getting ready for his international
  flight to go home.  They finally got on the train for a 2 hour ride
  (assuming they don't get lost) with 3 hours til his flight, and
  after the train started Fred was like, "but when will we eat?" and
  janette goes, "let's just get to the airport first" and Fred agreed.
  They took the Narita express from Tokyo station (smart), and asked
  the conductor to make sure at what terminal they should terminate
  their ride (smart) and Fred was whisked to the plane by the ground
  staff 15 minutes before the flight took off.</p>

<p>I'm glad he made it.</p>

<p>It was suddenly 11pm and we headed home.  Once we got to the Nambu
  line, I was all, "do you want to stand [and leave sooner] or sit
  [and leave later]?" and janette was all, "stand," and I'm all, "I
  wanna sit," and we sat.  I acknowledged that I had given her a
  choice but didn't accept her answer.</p>

<p>Home.  janette chatted with Dan while I did email (including an
  email from Marta) and then bed bed bed.</p>
