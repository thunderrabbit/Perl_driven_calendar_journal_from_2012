<p>From <a
  href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/index.cgi/work/essays/dali.html">George
  Orwell's essay on Dali</a>:</p>

<pre>
       Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something
       disgraceful. A man who gives a good account of himself is
       probably lying, since any life when viewed from the inside is
       simply a series of defeats.
</pre>

<p>There are a lot of such lies in my journal and my life.  Wende and
  janette have recognized and told me that I lie most commonly by
  leaving out pertinent details.  Sometimes I outright lie.</p>

<p>Things that are true:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have never done any illegal drugs.</p></li>

<li><p>I have never been drunk.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't stolen anything from a store since I grabbed a deck
  of Playboy playing cards from Astroworld a long time ago.</p>

<p>I specify "from a store" because I take things from work more
  frequently.  Pens and paper and a few pushpins from Nova.  Once I
  gave to a student a copy of the index to the quest book she was
  using.  The index tells what parts of speech each lesson is designed
  to cover.</p>

<p>Above is a lie by inclusion (not ommission). I wrote "a copy of the
  index" which makes the reader think I made a copy of the index and
  gave it to her, but actually I took it right out of the book and
  gave it to her.  I took out the book's copy.</p></li>

<li><p>My biggest consistent lie by ommission surrounds my romantic
  relationships and sex life.  I have at times labeled myself as a sex
  addict, and have attended <a href="http://www.sa.org">12 step
  meetings for sex addiction</a>. (*)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have looked to women to satisfy some basic needs in myself, needs
  to feel loved, to feel valuable.  Also to cover the innate (?)
  negative (?) emotions in my being, I look to love/companionship for
  a way around feeling those; a way to not feel "lonely" and have to
  face these emotions in me.</p>

<p>(*) sidetracked here trying to find the function that tells emacs
  to open the file in an external viewer (to make sure the URL is
  correct).</p>

<p>(( beautiful irony is that I found the command (C-x C-s
  (save-buffer)) because I saved the file after I wrote the above,
  but what I can't figure now is how it doesn't happen so often that
  I already knew that. ))</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I've made many references to women being on or taken off my list.
  It's a list that Morag and I have been talking about; we both have
  our own list.  My list includes most cute women I see.  Ways to get
  on the list: smile, be cute, be funny, appear to be interesting or
  smart, like my jokes, flirt, etc.  Ways to get off the list: smoke,
  drink more than rarely, wear too much makeup, stop flirting with me,
  be not so smart, be emotionally unstable or unavailable, etc.</p>

<p>More things that are true:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I haven't had sex with anyone in Japan except janette.</p></li>

<li><p>I didn't kiss Yuuko at midnight New Year's Eve.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I told janette about my night last night, she asked if there
  were fireworks or what at midnight.  I was like, "yeah there were
  fireworks and lasers and stuff."</p>

<p>"Did you kiss Yuuko?"</p>

<p>"No." <em>I didn't kiss Yuuko at midnight.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday's now declassified entry gives details.</p>

<p class=date>10:42pm</p>

<p>Right now the part of this entry below the - - - - above has not
  been copied to my site.  The entry I referred to as declassified
  has been declassified; I could reclassify it.</p>

<p>Though it's really difficult for me (fuck negative language) -
  though it may seem easier in the short run, I'm choosing to unlie to
  janette for sake of our friendship in the long run.</p>

<p>I'm not sorry that I kissed Yuuko, but I'm sorry that I lied to
  janette.</p>

<p>I'm going to call her now and hash it out.</p>

<p class=date>10:50pm</p>

<p>Dammit; she was still fully asleep; I hope I put her back to bed.
  I want to tell her this before she reads it.</p>

<p>I'm tempted to put a note at the top of the page</p>

<b>janette; talk to me before you read this</b>

<p>but I'm resisting.  I trust that what happens here is in the
  highest good for all involved.</p>
