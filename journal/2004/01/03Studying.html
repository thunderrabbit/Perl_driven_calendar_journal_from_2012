<p>Yesterday in class I wrote hiragana and then kanji + translation
  on the other side of flash cards.  Then on the next flash card the
  ¤Æ form conjugation of the words.  To study today, I'm going to
  write many verbs  plus their many conjugations.  That's where I've
  been getting way stuck in class.  Verb vocab and conjugational
  prowesslessness.</p>
