<p>First five lessons, actually six almost, were man to man.   Nice.
  Best conversation was with people in the voice room.  Funniest and
  best.</p>

<p>¤æ¤­ (sp) is the name of the student who I saw in Tokyo station
  while I was walking around with Íµ»Ò.  Yuki was on her way back
  from dropping off a friend at Narita.  We waved in the station, but
  I couldn't think of her name.  She said HI to me today.</p>

<p>Akina, who had been quite quiet in the voice room (more quiet than
  her ability) told me she saw me on Nambu line a couple days ago
  around 1pm.  She had tried to get my attention, but I was sleepin or
  something.  "Next time, hit me."</p>

<p>Mai works at Dotour (sp) coffee shop in Kawasaki station on
  weekends.  Maybe I'll smurf a hot cocoa from there on Saturday.</p>

<p>Êþ»Ò said HI to me just before I had one class til lunch.  I hoped
  we could hang out, but she was going to eat okonomiyaki somewhere
  with someone.  She asked if I had hung out with Yuuko and I told
  her yah we had seen some movies.</p>

<p>Good to see her.</p>
