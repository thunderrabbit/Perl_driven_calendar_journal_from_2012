<p>Yesterday I worked at KQ with Guy and Brett.  Cory didn't come
  over to say bye (that I noticed) like I thought he would.</p>

<p>My Aries bud Takako was in my second to last class; she's in 7A
  now; yay!  I didn't level her up; I thought she was too slow and
  hesitant to speak.  I taught her first 7A class (and didn't open the
  book) on simple past conjugation.  We told a story about Nova usagi
  and what he did.  Then I had them ask each other questions about
  what he did, so they used past tense and question form past tense.
  Good stuff.</p>

<p>During my last class I taught past perfect.  I think I did a good
  job at that.  Ironically, the student who requested past perfect was
  in my last class of last year, and it was the same lesson that we
  covered (about the ghost in the mansion) then.  That was the lesson
  where I was all, "look; this is really really important" cause some
  of the students were flirting and fucking around and couldn't tell
  the difference between "how long has he been coming here?" and "how
  long has he been here?"</p>

<p>Anyway, this lesson was quite different, and I drew a graph to
  explain past perfect.  I think they got it.</p>

<p>One lesson I taught the usage of "in" "on" and "at" in terms of
  location (not time), at the student's request.  I love it when the
  students tell me what they want to study (and the answer isn't
  "English conversation").</p>
