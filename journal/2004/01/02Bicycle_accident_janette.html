<p>This morning at 6 janette woke me up after having had a bicycle
  accident.  She cut her thumb open and slightly bonked her head.  She
  was crying when she told me and I tried not to visualize the
  scene.</p>

<p>The good thing is she got to ride home with blood dripping, which
is pretty cool.</p>

<p>She'll wear a helmet now when she rides.  I probably still won't.  Why?</p>

<p>She was like, "I'm going to go do it again because I'm scared,"
  referring to doing the same manuever that she just did (which she's
  done many times in the past, but today it was wet) and I was
  like, <em>eeeeee</em>, "I invite you not to do it again.  Do you
  know why?"</p>

<p>"Cause it's still slick?"</p>

<p>"Cause it's still wet, exactly."</p>

<p>I just had a realllly bad feeling about her doing it again.</p>

<p>She wanted to do something; go running maybe.  She decided to do
yoga.</p>

<p>Ah.  That sounds much nicer.</p>

<p>I tried to go back to sleep, but woke up three times thinking
  about writing this.</p>
