<p>When I came home today, janette was all, "okay, close your eyes,"
  and I did <! and she systematically stripped me down to my underwear
  > and she made me lie down on the couch and she put a new quilt on
  me!  She made me a quilt!  Completely awesome with one solid blue
  print on one side and diamondy star patterns and string on the other
  side.  She said she's <em>also</em> working on one with my old
  rally T-shirts..  Ouououououuu wow wow wow.  I'm so so lucky.</p>

<p>And, she's all, "would you rather get presents before you go to
  work or after you come home?"</p>

<p>"<em>More</em> presents????"</p>

<p>"Well, if you were to get any more, from Fred, maybe."</p>

<p>"oh, of course.  Um, after work."</p>

<p>EEEeeeeeeeeee!!!!!</p>
