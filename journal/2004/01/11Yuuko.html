<p>Hung out with 裕子 after work today; we yammered a bit at Starbucks
  and then munched at Big Boy salad bar.  Mostly we yammered in
  English.</p>

<!-- I felt really embarassed when I was like, "I've been to Big Boy
  one time and she goes, "with whom?"  (in Japanese) and I'm like,
  "um.....  (oh shit) it was you!" -->

<p>Walking back toward the station to say byebye she told me that
  tomorrow is the day that 20 year olds celebrate coming of age (when
  they can smoke and drink yippee fuckin doo).  Said that is snowed
  on her coming of age day.</p>

<p>"Snow ですか。"</p>

<p>"Snow です。"</p>

<p>Funnnnny.</p>


<!--
<p>I really wanted to hug and smooch on Yuuko a lot, but completely
  resisted except for holding her hands while sitting across the table
  from her in Starbucks and at Big Boy.  We had a really lovely time
  together and I considered what it would be like to kiss her and get
  really involved.  Probably a really bad idea.  But she said
  something that made me more attracted to her, something like she'd
  rather be American (or anything western, non-Japanese) and she also
  said that she wanted to go to the US to live and I greatly
  encouraged her to do that, including giving her email addresses to さ
  とこ and りえ.</p>

<p>At the very end she was like, "have a good time with janette" and
  I'm like, (eeeeeeee) "yes; absolutely I will" and thinking <em>god I
  just want to be with you</em>.  what is up with that?</p>
