<p>Fuck; the train I've just settled myself onto is ending at the
  next station.  No wonder I got a seat.  Dammit.</p>

<p>Anyway, work was goodish but fucking busy to start because today
  is Coming of Age Day in Japan for those who will turn 20 this year.</p>

<p>Um, Rachel, Carla's roommate saved our ass today because Ali
  called in sick but she came in to cover for him so the schedule
  wasn't made worse.  Also, she taught my last class for me and I got
  to teach voice for her.  I was just like to excited to do another
  class (3 person level 5) as my last class before I see janette; I'm
  like gotta zooooom and stuff.  She covered the class and the money
  thing was she was so cool about it; we didn't ask anyone; just
  changed the class at the end after having said nothing about it
  since lunch.</p>

<p>She goes, "so you wanna do it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah that would be great."</p>

<p>"Files..." and she assumed the drop box.</p>

<p>"yep"</p>

<p>Awesome.  Thank you, Rachel.</p>

<p>I had たかひろ, the smart kid who will sit and pout for the entire
  class if we try to have a normal class with him, so I started
  fucking around telling him all the wrong names for the animals
  (after he wouldn't respond to the option of spelling the animal
  names) and I tried to have a fucked up game of Go Fish where I
  insisted all the wrong names for the inconsistent right animals were
  right, and he didn't quite get into it, but we did have a spider
  batting competition, sliding the spider cards across the table like
  soccer kinda and after he was thoroughly enjoying the chances to
  smack the cards, experimenting with different smacking techniques, I
  made him spell S P I D E R before he got the cards to smack again.
  Once he was spelling spider consistently well, I switched to the
  dog-nope-"too easy"-monkey cards and made him spell M O N K E Y
  before he could have monkey batting practice.</p>

<p>Excellent success: Takahiro spelling spider and monkey.  (but nat
  spider monkey (oh well))</p>

<p>One class was absolute hell with three unsolid 7B students who
  were all super teacher dependent, all looking at me for everything
  and to say everything.  ug.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, my first class included KG みき, and without planning it
  specifically for her, I chose lesson number 50 (cause with one of the
  other students I had done lessons 47, 48, and 49, in that order, so
  I was like, "welp, number 50 is it") cause it was available for all
  three students and it just turned out to be giving directions,
  which みき judges she can't do.  Perfect.</p>

<p>She was clear about that in lesson too.  "I hate this kind of
  question" ("how do I get from ____ to ____?") and I said, "thank
  you.  It's good for me to know that."</p>

<p>I had sortof an epiphany at the end of the lesson, basically
  describing how I give directions: "just take it one little step at a
  time and it's like describing a series of pictures.  So, from right
  here: 'go out of this building' then what? 'go left' then what? 'go
  up the escalators, not down' then what? 'there are ticket machines
  on the right and gates on the left.  get a ticket, go through the
  gates.'  then what?  'there are three lines, one blue, one orange,
  one red' or give the names 'there are three lines, Nambu, Tokaido,
  Kehein Tohoku.  Look for the one on the left, the red line, the
  Kehein Tohoku.  Go down the steps' now what? 'look for Yokohama or
  Tokyo' where do you want to go? let's say Shinagawa 'Okay, go toward
  Tokyo.  Get off at the first stop.' Shinagawa - now what?  where do
  we want to go?  Shibuya? 'go upstairs.  look for Yamanote.  Go down
  the stairs.  Get on the train that says Shibuya.' Bang.  Just a
  series of steps, little pictures."</p>

<p>I really hope it helped.</p>
