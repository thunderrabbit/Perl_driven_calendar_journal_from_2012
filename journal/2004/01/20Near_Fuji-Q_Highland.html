<p>We're the only three customers in a little shop that sells eels and
  noodles for eating purposes.  We've chosen to procure three cooked
  eels for consumption.</p>

<p>Around this building a slanted city spotted with snow piles lies
  within a valley of mountains, including Mt Fuji.  A bus with chains
  on two of its six tires clanked by, leaving a series of claw marked
  trails through the asphalt street.</p>

<p>janette slipped a bit on the ice as she walked beside the street.
  Visions of turtle creek went through my mind.  "Please don't fall,
  janette."</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"See, even us risk taking guys, wait, even we risk taking guys
  aren't doing that."</p>

<p>"Pussies."</p>

<p>Hahahahahaaha.</p>

<p>This is the decided factor, folks.  He can type more easily
  without the gloves.</p>

<p>Today we wandered around the station at the end of this line;
  climbed on snow covered rocks, ate white chocolate, grabbed a pig
  lighter out of the lake (*), and took a ropeway up the mountain to
  where a rabbit was torturing a bear.  I took pictures of the
  posters; I wonder wtf is behind that story.</p>

<p>On the way back, Fred and I kicked snow into a pretty deep culvert
  thing by the side of the road.  It melted almost immediately, so
  when we reached Lawson's, looked down and found two rather ample
  blocks of ice, we decided (I convinced Fred) to throw them into the
  culvert.  I wanted to video it with my new video camera and he's
  like, "<em>yah</em>" and threw his in before I knew he was doing
  it.  I recorded myself throwing mine in, and watched is in the
  culvert for a while (a hardly identifiable speck) and then turned
  the camera off before it fell down the inner waterfall thing
  because I believed it wouldn't be able to fall before it melted
  beyond interestingness.</p>

<p>On the way back, I interviewed Fred, asked him if he thought
  janette bought anything while we were gone.  We settled on the guess
  that she bought hot tea.  We were right.  I can immediately see how
  TV reality shows can be so much fun to record. Probably not as much
  fun to edit, but hey.</p>

<p>Now I want a real video camera that will take better quality
  videos.  Though I don't know how these videos will look once I get
  them on my computer (assuming I can(; it didn't work last night (but
  I haven't installed the software (yet)))).</p>

<p>(*) the lighter turned out to be part of a handle to a fishing
  pole.</p>

<p>Where's janette?  We gotta be on a train soon.</p>

<p class=date>5:37pm</p>

<p>Where's Fred?  We gotta be on a train sooner.</p>

<p>Short version: made it home using a Limited Express which cost 1210
  yen more each, but allowed us big seats facing each other.</p>

<p>Ate at a restaurant with challenging service in Tsunashima.</p>

<p>My iPhoto can't import photos now after I installed the Canon
  software.  Poop.  (Without Canon software, I couldn't import
  movies)</p>
