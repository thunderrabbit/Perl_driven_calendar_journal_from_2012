<p>Slept a bit late today.  Helped janette work on the quilt she's
  made for me; cutting the little strings that will turn into fuzzy
  balls over the years.</p>

<p>We both chatted with Dan; had kindof a family hang out after he
  got home from kindergarten and showed off the suit and mask he made
  with the kids for some festival or ceremony they'll do soon.</p>

<p>Sad to see janette go soon.</p>

<p>I have to admire janette for shifting from my room (with only me)
  to the living room so we could include Dan in the final
  conversations.  I was being.. selfish but didn't even realize it.
  Or more like I was just being wherever janette was and thereby
  unthinkingly not including Dan.  I'm glad she noticed and moved.</p>
