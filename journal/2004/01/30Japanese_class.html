<p>Today before my lesson with Ayana, I saw a busload of little
  school girls, none in school uniforms.  There was a western looking
  woman with them, sitting kinda in the aisle with all these yapping
  happy girls scattered throughout the bus, talking in all
  directions.  Like a busload of puppies.</p>

<p>I marveled at the... horror.. no, the energy of the busload, and
  happened to make eye contact with the woman who was well aware of
  her charge, yet also aware of the surrounding area, including me.
  I waved at her and made this smiling face like, "holy shit that's
  quite a litter you've got there," and she agreed.</p>

<p>That was on the way to the bank near Shibuya.  I now know where a
  branch of my bank is around that station.  I didn't before.  Got
  20,000 yen out, 12,000 of which went to Ayana today.  She wouldn't
  take money for the first lesson with janette.  I was like, "but it
  wasn't like you gained a student."  She said, "it was my pleasure."
  Fair enough.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>My lesson went back over the て form of conjugations and then the
  short form and the whatever form and something else.  She says
  basically my conjugation is fine; it's just my vocab that's
  slacking.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, more importantly, she asked me why I broke up with janette,
  and I explained that I was keeping myself from learning Japanese; I
  was calling janette each night instead of learning Japanese, and I
  needed to break that requirement.  Ayana suggested I get a Japanese
  girlfriend. I go, "だれ？" and she's like, "I don't know."</p>

<p>"Yeah; me too."</p>
