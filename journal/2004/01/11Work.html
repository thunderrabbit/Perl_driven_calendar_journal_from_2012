<p>At work I had Takako twice; she's my Aries bud at work.  But we're
  not buds outside of work; just at work.  She explained that she
  didn't have any chances to speak English during the break and has
  therefore forgotten a lot and I explained that I understood; I had
  done the same thing when my girlfriend came to Japan.</p>

<p>Told her to buck up buttercup and trust that she's doing well.  But
  oh, but most importantly, she told me about her job and about some
  of the tribulations she has there; she works in a nursing home,
  which in itself is like wow I think.  She told me a story about a
  patient who spent 2 hours asking her why he couldn't go home and an
  hour walking around his room looking for the door and she worked to
  pacify him and wow wow wow; that seems like really intense work.
  Far more difficult than teaching.</p>

<p>In the previous lesson (where she far exceeded the other student's
  abilities), we had made sentences like, "he is a doctor; he works in
  a hospital; his job is important." and stuff like that.  At the end
  of the second lesson I was like, "your job is important."</p>

<p>She is the first student (I think) that after I've given a
  compliment, has said simply, "thank you."  Aries bond.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>A kid (junior named Sara) could spell dog, cat, cow, lion, tiger,
  duck, frog, gorilla, and monkey, and maybe a couple others.  Then I
  taught her how to spell chicken, cheetah, and elephant.</p>

<p>Then I drilled her by spelling animals and having her tell me what
  animal name I had spelled.  She was money.</p>

<p>Oh, at the end of the lesson, I remembered that I thought it would
  be a good idea if she knew how to convert from Japanese hiragana to
  romanji and I started her off with A I U E O KA KI KU and the bell
  rang and she was like, "homework?" and I'm like <em>fuck</em>
  because we are not supposed to teach using Japanese, but I wasn't
  teaching using Japanese, just teaching her how to translate into
  romanji Japanese words/sounds but I'm like, "yeah, homework" but now
  I realize the next teacher that has her might not know how to
  properly transcribe つ　し　いろいろ or any of them really, so I
  hope it doesn't fuck her up.  But she's a brilliant resilient kid; I
  know she'll be okay.</p>
