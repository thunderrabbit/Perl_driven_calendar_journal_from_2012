<p class=date>9:27pm JST Saturday 10 January 2004</p>

<p>Super busy at first.  Four students, then four students then 2 or
  3 and it got easier after work but then I had two students suddenly
  added to my last class and I couldn't find one of the files so I
  couldn't plan the lesson properly and I ended up just chatting with
  each of them, which is kinda bad because one of the students is new
  to ¿Ó∫Í, a level 6 doctor from Kyushu.</p>

<p>I hung out talking to Erik about computer stuff (giving him advice
  on internet access for his new (used) laptop) and then kept on
  hanging out to wait for Morag to finish her lessons.</p>

<p>I pointed out Õµª“ to Morag <!-- "she's the one I kissed." --> and
then we rode the bus home.</p>

<p>Ate and now I'm going to bed bed bed.</p>

<p>I'll call janette real quick.</p>
