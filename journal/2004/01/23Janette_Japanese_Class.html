<p>I'm beside janette who is studying with Ayana.  janette now has
  covered (and nearly learned) all the shit that I have learned.  She
  blew me (and Ayana) away by knowing the TE form of conjugations last
  week... and this week, though it's a packed lesson, Ayana will have
  presented janette with the most advanced stuff that I've
  learned.</p>

<p>It's a little like, dammmmm  how am I so slow?  But I think it's
  really that janette has just been working her ass off.  That's
  sweet; I'm really pleased slash impressed with her.</p>
