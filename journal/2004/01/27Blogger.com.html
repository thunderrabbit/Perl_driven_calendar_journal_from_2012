Hello,

You may want to try to sign out of Blogger and try logging back in.  This
should resolve your problem.  If you continue to receive an error, you may
want to try to clear the cookies in your browser or use a different
browser.

Sincerely,
Kimmy

I got the BloggerBuzz email from earlier today and decided to log in.  Had
forgotten my password so I used the forgot password link on
http://new.blogger.com where it sent me an email with a link so I could
type a new password on page http://new.blogger.com/pwd-change.g

I typed the new password and therby believed I was logged in to the
system, but when I tried to enter a new entry, I got this:

There were errors:
004 dk.eos.net.FtpError: Login incorrect.

I didn't "log in" as in directly enter my username and password;   I
*felt* like I logged in implicitly by blogger knowing who I was (username)
and by giving blogger my new password.

I think Blogger says I'm logged in.  On this page
(http://new.blogger.com/user_problem_new.pyra) where I'm typing now, it
filled in my username and email address.

SO, blogger makes me think I'm logged in, but blogger thinks I'm not.

You can easily reply "well, log in like normal" but that's not the point. 
I did something (change password) that makes me think I should be logged
in, and blogger seems to act like I'm logged in, but I'm actually not.

Because I think Blogger is cool, I will reply.

I know how to log in.  If you want Blogger to be more awesome, I encourage you to more carefully read my message.

This is from the last paragraph of the original message:

"I did something (changed password) that makes me *think* I should be
logged in, and blogger seems to *act* like I'm logged in, but I'm
actually not."

(This is bad for average users.)
