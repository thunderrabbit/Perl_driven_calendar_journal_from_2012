<p>I'm sooo tired.  I'm going to take a nap.</p>

<p class=date>11:23pm JST Friday 2 January 2004</p>

<p class=dream>I was looking for a place to live, oh I was nearing my
  one year annivesary in Japan and I had been playing ultimate here
  for a year with the guys and somehow I was also new to their group
  here and their slightly new game, but I was still part of the group
  and we were putting things away after the game and I was watching to
  see how it was done; every thing has a specific protocol in Japan.
  I felt happy to be rejoined with the ultimate group.</p>

<p class=dream>I was riding my bicycle on some variety of concrete
  walking areas in the middle of a supermarket type place, SAMs esque
  in Japan.  Japanese were crowded patiently in line and made good
  obstacles to not hit while I was riding slowly through this
  building with slopes and dips as they were all waiting in line
  before 10am to enter the store's opening (not grand open (as they
  call it here)) but just a daily opening.  Popular place.</p>

<p class=dream>I was then wearing skates and needed to go down an
  escalator with cardboard boxes on it making it really slick and I'm
  like "cool" and went down the escalator partially backwards, and
  partially stopped sideways to not hit people and then backwards
  again and then stop to not wipe out on the cardboard, but then at
  the bottom I picked up some good speed and turned left around the
  escalator's corner as it went outside into the bright sunlight of
  morning.</p>

<p class=dream>There was more space outside and I skated near a skate
  park kinda thing with a shallow graffittied pool on my right and I
  engaged a corner of the pool, and then I decided to get some more
  speed and had to get out of the way of a bicyclist about to hit me,
  wait he was on skates toa and I turned and he turned and we didn't
  hit as we were on parallel antitangential turns slowly going away
  from each other and then I was like ready to engage the pool and I
  got some speed and was conscious that I was not wearing a helmet so
  I would have to be careful (and get my helmet next time so I could
  do some fucked up stuff) and I went down this pool and up a not so
  steep part and jumped into the air a little bit and landed safely
  away from the pool.  Nice.</p>
