<p>janette is making me breakfast today (because I asked her to).  I
  just wrote all the journal entries from yesterday except for AM.</p>

<p>I'm tired.  Headache from sinuses.  (oh, I was sneezing a lot
yesterday)</p>

<p>Oh my god, janette's culinary skills are absolutely incredible.
  She should be on Iron Chef With No Ingredients To Start With.</p>
