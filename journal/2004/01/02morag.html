<p>Morag and I hung out by the river and gossipped and chilled in the
  lovely weather.  A little kid came up behind us twice and when we
  acknowledged him, he ran away both times.</p>

<p>We've just studied at my apartment for about 2 hours.  Good
stuff.</p>

<p>As she was leaving, I'm like, "aight, say something funny."</p>

<p>"I'm not good at saying funny stuff."  I got about 1/2 way through
  quoting her when she said, "and you're not allowed to write
  that."</p>

<p>Hugged her and kept hugging her, "I'm going to hug you for a
  little longer," and she broke the hug with a laugh like I was being
  silly, but really I was just settling into it.  I have hugged men
  in my I-group for longer than I hugged her.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I like Morag.</p>

<p>Oh, it was nice to get "you're hardcore dude" comment from her
  when I told her what I wrote in my journal, including stuff that
  could compromise my job.</p>
