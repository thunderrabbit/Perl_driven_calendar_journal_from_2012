<p>Slept as long as possible, and now I'm doing stuff with Project
  Builder on my Mac.  I wonder why I keep specifiying Mac (but not OS
  X.3?) weird.</p>

<p>Anyway, got an update downloaded that fixed the shiznit that wasn't
  working last night and just a moment ago it did some stable shit as
  I had three projects open and then abruptly moved the source files
  to two of the projects (into ~/java/) while the third project's
  classes were being indexed.  I went back to project builder and it's
  like, "wa! where'd the shit go?" and I told it to chill and close
  the old projects and once they were closed, I found the indexing was
  still happening no problem.  Nice.  (Money.)  That means it had
  three projects open, and they are all unrelated enough that it can
  fuck with each of them at the same time and have problems with some
  and not lose it all.</p>
