<p>janette and I are playing I spy overlooking the Shinkansen station
  from a window in the restaurant at the top of Yokohama Prince
  Hotel.</p>

<p>Her first target was "something old, gray and many."  I looked
  around for a while and made some guesses.  She added that they are
  markers of sorts.</p>

<p>I still couldn't get it, so she gave me another hint after I asked
  if they were funded by the government.  "They are funded by people
  who never get to see them."  Ah; gravestones.</p>

<p>I probably would have gotten it more quickly if I could have seen
  them.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Me: "I spy something yellow."</p>

<p>"Ummm.  That building?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Ummm, that roof?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Nevermind; it's gone.  It was a taxi."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Now she has spied something of which there are two.  Ah; I see
  them. The trusses on the bridge.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh cool.  A shinkansen just went through the station without
  stopping. It wasn't as fast looking as I hoped it would be.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Me: "I spy something green."</p>

<p>No pause. "The stairs on that building."</p>

<p>"Hai."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>She: "I spy a circle within a square."</p>

<p>No looking.  "The top of that building?"</p>

<p>"Hai."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Me: "I spy that shinkansen.  shit I fucked it up again."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"I spy something white," I said while looking at the white
  plate in front of us on the table.  So sneaky!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>She spied an orange dragon going back and forth.  It was a
  lawnmower thing we think.</p>
