<p>At Shibuya station I decided to explore a bit.  I noticed a hallway
  that I had previously dismissed as disinteresting, but then realized
  it might be interesting, so I walked down it.  There are two moving
  sidewalks; the first is bouncy and the second is like escalator
  steps, but flat.  This hallway leads to what's primarily labeled the
  Saikyu line, and also labeled the Tokaido line, the Rinkai line, and
  the Narita Express line.  I couldn't quite figure out the signage
  for all those lines (or actually any of them really) but now at
  least I have a sense of where that hallway goes, if not how to use
  it (except for the moving sidewalks, which were pretty
  straightforward).</p>
