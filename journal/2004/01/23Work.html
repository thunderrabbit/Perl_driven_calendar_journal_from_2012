<p>As I came in to work today, Hiroko gave me a book that Miho gave to
  me!!  Wow wow wow!  That's actually two things she has given me.
  One is a little charm thing from her dad's shrine, and this is a
  book on the history of Japan.  <em>In Japanese *and* in
  English</em>.  That is completely sweet.</p>

<p>Work went pretty smoothly today; students seemed pretty pleased
  with the lessons, and I was generally pleased with the lessons and
  everyone was happy.</p>

<p>I tried desperately to find out what makes the statue happy, but I
  couldn't find anything that seemed to excite her.  She was just
  like, "I watch TV" and she told me when she calls her friends and
  they ask her what she does she would say she's been watching TV.  I
  gave her homework: to ride her bike for an hour and tell the next
  class about it.</p>

<p>I had Yuki, Xian, and Toshi in my first class; they were in one of
  my last classes yesterday.  We laughed about that a bit, and Toshi
  used some of the language from yesterday's class (awesome (That's
  not the language; that's what using the language (reverse tag
  questions (e.g. "aren't you a genius?")) was. )) in today's class.
  I was able to encourage Xian to reveal an awesome talent of hers;
  she wrote some stuff when she was little that was so money that her
  dad sent it to a newspaper for publishing.</p>

<p>Kathy taught me some Chinese today; I can count to 10 and say my
  name is Rob, and thank you and "no worries mate"</p>
