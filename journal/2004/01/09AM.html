<p>Dan and I had a race this morning to see who would get to use the
  facilities first.  We each claimed that we had to be up earlier than
  the other, citing where we had to be by what time.  Realistically we
  had to be up around the same time.  Dan sleeps through his alarm a
  few times before waking up; I won the race easily.</p>
