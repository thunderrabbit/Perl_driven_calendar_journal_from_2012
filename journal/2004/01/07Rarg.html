<p>Slept till noon.  Stuck on my computer since then.  Though I did
  take a shower.  Haven't been stuck due to pornography (I'm glad
  about that), but I've been miscellaneously trying ways to get more
  photos on my site.  I've whittled it down to some problems:</p>

<p>iPhoto takes too long to allow easy update of comments for images.</p>

<p>bah who cares about this?  I haven't eaten yet today.</p>

<p>Okay, um, I thought of two things:</p>

<p>! I don't 100% care what the filename is for images.  Thanks cause
  people don't care; they want the image, not the name of the image.
  Computer should handle the details of naming.  (but there are some
  issues around this; it's almost like I need a DB of images)</p>

<p>@ I can use my images directory to hold images by topic and my
  journal directory to hold images by date.  I think, though bits are
  cheap, I will only have one copy of the images, and use either a
  symbolic link or make the journal reference images in the /images
  directory.  This is what I'm doing now because my journal text files
  and directories are permission 600 while images and directories are
  644.  I couldn't display the image files unless they are stored in
  a different structure.  OH and that reminds me the symbolic links
  won't work anyway due to permissions, so nevermind.  I'm glad in a
  way because I didn't like even having a link cause it makes the
  structure a bit messy.</p>

<p>But, there's the issue of how to easily tell myself the name of
  the file as I'm writing the journal entry about it.  I wonder if
  homesite has been ported to OS X yet.  I wonder if emacs can know
  how to do it.</p>

<p>Have eaten.  It feels like a lot longer than 2 hours since I last
  wrote.  Poopy mood right about now.  I think I get depressed if I
  sit at home all day.   Maybe there's something to be learned from
  that.</p>

<p>I'm just going to go to sleep now and hope for something better to
  come up.</p>

<p>God where is my energy?</p>
