<p>I slept while janette went out and bought dinner from a deli called
  Eat Healthy or Earth Healthy or something like that next to a
  bakery.  Both times she's been there, the girls behind the counter
  were super friendly like they were delighted she was there.
  Wow.</p>

<p>janette brought me dinner in bed.  Fantastic presentation of a
  variety of morsels from rice to chicken to tomago, to something else
  to another thing too.</p>

<p>Mmmmmmm.</p>
