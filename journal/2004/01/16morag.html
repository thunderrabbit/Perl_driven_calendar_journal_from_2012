<p>Morag and I met at Starbucks and talked.  Saw Hitomi there (I'm
  pretty sure that's her name) but didn't talk to her too much.  Morag
  didn't do her stuff from last weeks JAM session, but she did make
  positive efforts toward it and I called it a Success.  (she got up
  early to send the email, but the address had been left at work)</p>

<p>I set some new goals around writing a little ditty and sending
  pictures to Justin for First Drop (roller coaster) Magazine.  I got
  an issue today with my pictures in it (but not my copy (text)); and
  I want to be published again.  And again and again.</p>
