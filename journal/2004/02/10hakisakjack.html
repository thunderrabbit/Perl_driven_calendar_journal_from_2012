<p>I went to Kawasaki to meet Yuuko after her Nova lessons.  We went
to Starbucks for a drink and then to her house to get her car and she
drove me home.  I taught her the difference between "I'm going home"
and "I'm going home with you."</p>

<p>Dan and I couldn't find Jack the hackey sack, so Yuuko and I
walked to the convenience store to buy another, but the free sack
with a coke promotion was over.  Boo.  Came back home and Dan found
Jack behind the trash cans.</p>

<p>We played and made a game combining hackey sack and push ups and
imaginary gold coins in the bank.  When we do well, we get a gold
coin.  When we do poorly, we have to do pushups or spend some of our
gold coins.  We ended the day with 8 gold coins in the bank, a lot of
pushups completed (we're saving money), and 4 kicks minimum before
pushups are required.  One pushup for each kick less than 4.  8 kicks
deposits a gold coin.  18 kicks is our new world record.</p>

<p>I made a bed for Jack to use until we start kicking him again.</p>
