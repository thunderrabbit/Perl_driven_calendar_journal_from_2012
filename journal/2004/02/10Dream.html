<p class=dream>Was witnessing a tremendous storm or flood or some
such, sitting in a truck (Dad's green Eddie Bauer Explorer) on the
edge of a parking lot overloking a big valley thing with a fence in
front of us, and the water cascading down the other side of the valley
wither forom the ocean or a big storm. I wondered about getting closer
and remaining sfe; wondered if the concrete pilings of the fence would
be safe to tie myself to, for water was beginning to splash up on this
side.  The girl I was with stayed in the truck while I inspected
things.  I got out, with my towel, and got up on one of the pilings,
facing down along the valley, as a wave cycle was at its lowpoint, and
considered ting myself to it with my towel and to the iron fence and I
heard someone desperately screaming my name from the right.  I waved
them off; I could see what waves were coming and I knew I was safe,
but then they screamed again, like they couldn't see that I could see,
or maybe they could see *more* than I could see, so I was like, fine
and got down from the piling and woke up.</p>

<p>I lay in bed for a bit, kinda mad that I woke up from a cool
dream, but wondering if there was a reason I needed to wake up.  I
inspected all my inner processes and everything seemed in order.  It
was still dark outside, so I didn't need to be awake for my
interview; I went back to sleep.</p>

<p class=dream>Dude woke up a tad earlier than me and we were happy
we had chosen to go to bed early, and we checked our phones to see
what time he had sent me the "go to bed" email the previous night and
I thought it was just 30 minutes after he had gone to bed, and he
thought it was a few hours after he had gone to bed, and it turns out
it was about 2.5 hours after he had gone to bed, according to the
timestamps of the messages on the phone.</p>

<p>Right now I'm going to get up for my interview, but I'll mention
that I recently had a dream where I said, "I suspect I'm dreaming"
and I jumped to test, and sure enough, I was and I flew.  Fun.</p>
