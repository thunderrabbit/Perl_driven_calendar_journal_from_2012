<p>Slept a lot last night.   Slept 2 hours and woke up.  Dan was
still awake so we watched Family Guy and he went out and bought me
some Pocari Sweat and some salt for gargling purposes.  I gave him
1000 yen for his efforts (and to pay for the goods).</p>

<p>Slept slept slept slept with two heaters and two blankets and I'm
feeling nominally better this morning, but not 100% genki.</p>

<p>Okay go go go.</p>

<p>My dream from this morning included being a youth advisor again,
but this time with new youth; apparently going *back* to YRUU after a
lapse of some duration (which needn't be very long in YRUU).</p>

<p class=dream>The youth were standing in a grid formation with about
a meter between them side to side and front to back.  A woman advisor
was telling them what she wanted to do and got little or no response.
I was like, "how are you guys?  Are you excited?  Are you bored?" and
one guy raised his hand as/before I was saying "who has an idea of
what to do?  Chris!! what's your idea?"</p>

<p class=dream>And I just straightup knew his name somehow and his
idea did not include the idea the other advisor had suggested, and I
was like, "excellent idea!  how can you get that started?"</p>

<p>It was all quite natural and happy and things just flowed well.
Awesome.</p>
