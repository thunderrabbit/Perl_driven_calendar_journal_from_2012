<p>Some time ago (10 years?) I read most of Dale Carnegie's <em>How to
Win Friends and Influence People</em>.  Here's a cool thing about
Gaba; they gave us each a copy of the book on our second day of
training.   The title of this book I thought weird, but the book is
money.</p>

<p>Today I read chapter one on the train, and I had a vision in my
mind of giving a copy to Steve at Nova who more often criticizes than
praises.  Then I read the quote attributed to Ben Franklin "I will
speak ill of no man ... and speak all the good I know of
everybody."</p>

<p>Four stars.  Plus a 2x4 to my brain: I have spoken a lot of ill of
Steve.  I acknowledge that it may not have been in the best interest
of all involved.</p>

<p>Another four stars on the facing page: "To show you I'm sure that
you'll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Thanks, Dale.</p>

<p>On the train home tonight, a man who spoke pretty good if accented
English asked me where I had purchased my copy of <em>How to Win
Friends and Influence People</em>.  He was reading a Japanese version
of a different Dale Carnegie book, the name of which I seem to have
forgotten.</p>

<p>I gave him a map to Gaba's office as a place he could find out
where they bought the books.</p>
