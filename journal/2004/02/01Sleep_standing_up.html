<p>Today on the train, I fell asleep while standing in tadasana, the
  yoga standing pose I learned from Catherine.  My sleep didn't last
  very long; I jerked awake when the train started moving and I hit
  the girl next to me on the arm.  Oops.  I felt bad at first, but I
  got over it with happy thoughts of how cool it is that I fell asleep
  standing up.</p>
