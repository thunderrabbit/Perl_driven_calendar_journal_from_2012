<p>Counseling with Josephine went well I guess.  I dumped all my
braincells on her as completely as I could.</p>

<p>At the very end, I was like, <em>part of my work is asking for
what I want</em> and I recognized (rationalized?) how a hug is
harmless and even beneficial. "May I have a hug?"</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>I jerked away.  <em>FinefuckyouIhateyou.</em></p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>During the session I gave a summary of my life and she helped me
notice a distinct change in the number of hugs I had been getting in
the US (YRUU, men's group, Bibby crib) vs the number I don't get in
Japan.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the slap of no hugs allowed, I was like, <em>I'm going to
need that number for the male counselor</em>, having judged that a
male counselor would be just like Kim Sawyer or men in my I-group,
and share a hug after (and maybe before) each session.  I recognized
my judgement, wondered how to reframe it.</p>

<p>It seems that I have grown accustomed to hugs.  According to what I
see, it's possible to live without them, or without as many, as these
cats in Japan seem to be hugless creatures.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I want Josephine (counselor) to fall in love with me.  I want her
to see how money I am.  I want her to know how difficult a path I've
chosen for myself.  I want her to know how many directions my brain
thinks at one time.  I want her to pay me to have a chance to peer
inside my mind.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Why have I chosen such a hard path?  To what end do I not smoke and
drink or otherwise have an acceptable addiction to quell my emotions?
What is the fucking point of feeling this emotional pain?</p>

<p>I see people walking down the street, smoking, and I'm like,
"fucking stinking ass fuck" and "you don't even know that you're
smoking right now; your mind is gone; you have no awareness of how
you're affecting your body and the people around you, and you probably
just add your butt to the rest of this disgusting sea of butts all
around us" etc etc and I just really mentally go off on the person,
and part of it is I'm just mad that *my* addiction is not allowed in
polite society.  I'm not allowed to just grab someone and start
shagging. But that's not actually what I want.  I just want a hug.  I
just want some bit of validation that what I'm doing is good.  That
what I am is good.</p>

<p>Sleeptime on the train; my brain is checking out now.</p>
