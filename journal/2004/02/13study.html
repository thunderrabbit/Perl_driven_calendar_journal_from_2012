<p>Kathy and I studied at Starbucks.  She studied Japanese and I read
the training packet given to me by Marvin.  I found approximately
(estimating here) four errors per page.  The shit is as poorly
composed as a rough draft ought to be.  I'm going to give it to him
and tell him to take my ass out to lunch or something for having
corrected it.  Jesus.  A ton of errors.</p>
