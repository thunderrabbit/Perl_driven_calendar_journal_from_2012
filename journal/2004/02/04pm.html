<p>I cobbled together a frame thing (using emacs to process the list
of images into a series of &lt;option&gt; things) that allows easy
viewing of the images in a directory listing online.  Next step is
to write a perl script that will smurf the directory and write the
list of option tags.</p>

<p>With this, I don't have to use the mouse to click each link if I
find an interesting directory of images.  I can just down-arrow to
see the next one.</p>
