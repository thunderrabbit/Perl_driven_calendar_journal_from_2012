<p>D'oh; I just realized I have double booked myself for tonight.  I
have a standing study date with Morag (and Kathy) on Friday nights,
but last night when I called Yuuko to tell her that I couldn't meet
her on Monday, she was like, "how about tomorrow?" and I'm like, "err,
um, okay" and didn't remember I had plans to study with Kathy. (Morag
has friends coming over from Canada)</p>

<p>My choice is to tell Yuuko I already have plans; I want to more
often treat her like a friend than a girlfriend.</p>
