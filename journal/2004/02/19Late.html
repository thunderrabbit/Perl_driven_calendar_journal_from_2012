<p>Tony called me while I was on the train toward Shibuya for
training.   He left a message which I called back but wrong number so
I called back the actual number he called from and got him.  We're
going to meet at TGI Fridays (wow) for lunch.  So glad that I know
right where TGI Fridays is (in terms of El Torito which I visit
almost regularly).</p>

<p>boo being late, yay knowing where TGI Fridays is, yay free lunch at
TGI Fridays.</p>

<p>Was it Christine I talked to when I called that second number
today?  It sounded like her, but I don't know why she would have
answered in Shibuya.  Not that I know where she works each day,
but.</p>

<p>Switching trains now.</p>
