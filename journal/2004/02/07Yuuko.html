<p>Yuuko and I are watching Lord of the Rings on TV; the third movie
comes out in one week.  Somehow I thought we were going to watch it on
DVD at her house, but it's on TV (everywhere) and we're watching at my
apartment.</p>

<p>It's been dubbed over into Japanese.</p>

<p>So.  Wow (12 hours)</p>

<p>So last night Dan came home just as the movie was ending.  Yuuko
had been nodding off toward the end of the movie, and I tickled her
some to keep her awake.  Japanese TV seems to have commercials more
frequently, but for shorter durations than US TV.</p>

<p>Daniel and I talked, then sang, then moved the couch (did a
whirlwind vaccuuming job) back to play hackey sack.  I counted いち、に、
さん、さる、ご、ろく、etc much to Yuuko's amusement.  I let Dan in on
the joke after a while.</p>

<p>We got as high as 11.</p>

<p>I kicked the hackey sack into the kitchen behind the refrigerator
and after footbag recovery we did a whirlwind vaccuuming job to clean
up behind the fridge (including a piece of bread that was not
moldy).</p>

<p>Tim came down during our game and brought me his suit (!) for give
away.  He was wearing his bathrobe and had only one other change of
clothes as he had sent all his other shit to NZ as he'll be on a
plane in 4 hours from right now.  He chatted with us a bit about his
plans and when he left, we all split to our separate beds.  I hugged
Yuuko (twice!) as she left for home.</p>
