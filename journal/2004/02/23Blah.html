<p>Kinda have blah feelings today.  Like why didn't I kiss Abbey more
effectively and why did I say, "if I had remembered you had a tongue
ring, I would have kissed you sooner." ??  stupid stupid.</p>

<p>And further, why do I distract myself so with women?  Why don't I
just do my thing and make something great for the world and then be
fulfilled?  Why do I feel so busy *and* unproductive?</p>

<p>Why do I have to go to work now?</p>
