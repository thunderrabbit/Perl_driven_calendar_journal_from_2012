<p>Today's lesson was pretty cool; ¤¢¤ä¤Ê had me read some of the
conversations from the text.  She says I'm the first student she's
had who tried actively to learn reading and writing kanji.  Cool
beans.</p>

<p>I know the kanji for beans, but I don't know the hiragana for
beans; I was going to write cool beans but beans in kanji.  Maybe
next time.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to Daikaiyama to meet the cats at Gaba.</p>
