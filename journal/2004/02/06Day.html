<p class=date>1:26am JST Saturday 7 February 2004</p>

<p>Woke up early; went to Japanese lesson; did pretty well: my
sentences were approved (pre-checked by Yuuko); my new sentences were
acceptable.</p>

<p>Work included getting talked to by Neil because I'm not likely to
get rehired by Nova unless I write a Letter Of Promise: I hereby
promise to follow Nova's rules blah blah blah.  I told Neil I couldn't
write such a letter in good faith and that if I did write such a
letter it would be all lies and I wouldn't likely change my actions
and he said he understood and suggested therefore that I seek
employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>Carla subsequently encouraged me to not do anything crazy; that
many people like me and she would miss me, and this tugs at my brain,
but on a different hand, she's leaving in not too long anyhow...</p>

<p>sigh.</p>

<p>Went home with Kathy and studied a tidbit of Japanese, but we
mostly ate and talked and then her roommates came home and it was
useless for me to study so I came home where Dan was finishing his
second movie (_Ususual Suspects_) (I came in just as the guy saw the
coffee cup with Kobayashi on it and put it all together just five
seconds too late) and then he went to bed and I watched _Indiana Jones
and The Last Crusade_ pretty focusedly.</p>

<p>And to think that this morning I was like <em>I'm going to
bed <b>early</b> tonight</em>, so I can hang out with Yuuko tomorrow
and watch Lord of the Rings I and II.</p>
