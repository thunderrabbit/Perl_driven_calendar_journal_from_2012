<p>Last night after work, Yuuko picked me up and we went to an
italian restaurant near my house.  Amazingly, Dan was outside on
Bluey (his bicycle) expecting his language exchange person.</p>

<p>She wasn't going to be there for another 30 minutes, so we all met
back at the crib and played hackeysack for about 25 minutes, including
a hand version, including Dan headbutting the sack into the kitchen,
causing a huge racket of all the recycling bottles and stuff, and we
sang hackey sack songs and it was great.</p>

<p>When it was time for Dan to rock out, he frantically ran back and
forth from the front door to his room, forgetting things (hat, keys,
book (*)), as I read _MR Brave_ to Yuuko, helping her understand the
plot.</p>

<p>(*) "It's difficult being me" says Dan.</p>

<p>After the book, I was tired and when I get tired I get more horny
and it was time to either start biting Yuuko's neck or send her home,
so I sent her home.  No need to complicate things right now.  Fuck
that.</p>
