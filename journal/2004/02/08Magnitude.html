<p>Orders of magnitude are interesting.  I imagine that were we in a
base 9 counting system, or base 11, they would be equally interesting,
if slightly less or more dramatic.  But the general idea is the same.
Some things are really big and some are really small.</p>

<p>Right now I'm rambling after wondering why the heck time goes so
slowly when we are living it and so quickly when we read about it.
Just glossing over, or more often completely ignoring generations,
centuries, epochs, eras.  (which are bigger?)</p>

<p>And I note that things that are closer to us, we see more clearly,
with more details seeming relevant.  This is true through spacial
dimensions and time dimensions.  Other dimensions seem likely the
same.</p>

<p>Blah blah blah I had been wondering incessantly, wtf to do from
day to day in order to do something big with my life.  Five orders
of magnitude.  How can we even *compare* them?</p>

<p>Four orders of magnitude, arguably, but still it's a big fucking
difference.</p>
