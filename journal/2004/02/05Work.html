<p>Told level 3 Asuko that when I first met her (in voice) I was glad
that she took care of herself and changed groups.  She had come in and
kinda by default chose the group I was talking to, but it turns out I
was talking to them cause they were not such hot conversationalists
and she was like, "I think I'll join the ladies," and I was
like, <em>that's an excellent idea</em> "cool."</p>

<p>I don't remember anything outstanding in the day.  Not outstanding
in a good way.  My level 3 lesson about the Voyager space probes had
a really good student and really not good student.</p>
