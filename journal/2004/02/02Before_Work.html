<p>Before work, I happened to see Junko at the convenience store as I
got my daily sustenance.  2 liters of Pocari Sweat and some bento.
In line I was like lalala and then "oh shit!  Junkosan, I don't have
any money."</p>

<p>"Nani?"</p>

<p>"watashiwa okane janai"</p>

<p>"nai?"</p>

<p>"Can I borrow some money???"</p>

<p>"iio iio"</p>

<p>"iio janai.  demo arigato ne."</p>

<p>Fuckin' hell I'm glad I remembered while we were in line instead
of when I was at the register, and even moreso I'm glad that Junko
was there at all!!!</p>

<p>I got money and paid her back during my lunch.</p>
