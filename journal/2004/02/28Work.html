<p>Today at work I was not on the schedule and then J-Lo was like,
"well you can do my schedule" which (like everyone else's schedule)
was a packed schedule, while he went off to KQ (easy schedule) to
cover Phil's shift while he's on vacation.  "How convenient for you,
J-Lo," I said.  He agreed.</p>

<p>But, the cool thing is I had some cool students including Midori
(level 2 with cute smile that reminds me of someone cute; I don't
remember who) who was quite capable in the lesson I gave them
(summarize the first three paragraphs of this article on person
trainers in Tokyo (from Metropolis magazine) and now tell me what you
think the fourth paragraph will be about) and who said she may email
me soon.</p>
