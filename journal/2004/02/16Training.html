<p class=date>3:36pm JST Monday 16 February 2004</p>

<p>At the break between the 3rd and 4th (of four) parts of training
today.  I felt like pooh at the beginning and was tempted to opt out
(as if that's a common option).  45 minutes of standing on the train
trying to stay upright and not dissolve onto everyone kinda sucked,
but I made it okay.</p>

<p>Training has been funish.  I was 2 minutes late after longer than I
thought in the restroom at Gaba, but it seems to have been forgiven. I
borrowed 1000 yen from James, former dentist from NZ who has been here
10 days, during lunch.  D'oh!</p>
