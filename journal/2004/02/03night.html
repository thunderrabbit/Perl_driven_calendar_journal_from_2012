<p>The apartment that I viewed was for *sale*, not for rent.
15,000,000 yen, I think.  The price per month (98,500 yen) was for the
equivalent of mortgage payments, I think.</p>

<p>Um... no; I don't think we'll buy it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I <em>fell asleep</em> and was way late meeting Yuuko last night.
I was like dammit, but she didn't seem to care.  I paid for dinner at
TGI Fridays.</p>

<p>In Kawasaki she showed me two suit shops.  The first has new suits
my size for 18,000 yen.  The second had more expensive suits, and I'm
like, "no" to that.</p>

<p>We found a suit shop after a packed train ride to Yokohama.  Also
too expensive for me right now.</p>

<p>Then we went to eat for 2500 yen.  Waiter was good and rememebered
that I wanted no ice in my drink both times he refilled it.  Would
have gotten him a better tip in the US.</p>

<p>Yuuko came over to me and Dan's to show us the annual demon
exorcising festival where we throw beans outside and say "get out
demon" and "come in angels" or something like that, and then eat one
bean for each year old that we are.</p>

<p>Then we played footbag for about an hour and it was suddenly near
too late for Yuuko to get home on the trains.  We went to the station
and she asked the cat if she could get to Kawasaki and he said no.
She asked me if she could stay over and I'm like "yah" and I was
like <em>hmmm</em> in my head.</p>

<p>It turned out alright; she slept on my bed; I slept on the
couch.  No kissing occurred.</p>
