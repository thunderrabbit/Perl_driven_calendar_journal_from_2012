<p>Íµ»Ò stayed over last night after we watched LoR II.  It ended
around 2 am I think.  We were both falling asleep at the end.  My
sleep pattern was designed to keep me awake for the good scenes,
though I missed a couple.  Not as in didn't see them, but didn't have
the same mental/emotional state as the first times I saw them to make
me think <em>wow that was a money scene</em>.</p>

<p>We kissed a lot after she found my passport cause I had been like,
"I'll give you fifty kisses if you find my passport."  She had wanted
to see it last week after I had it out for my Gaba interview and
stuff.</p>

<p>She was like, "if you're not my boyfriend, why do we kiss?" and I
was like, "cause I like to kiss" etc etc and we basically worked it
out to she can choose not to kiss me at any time.</p>
