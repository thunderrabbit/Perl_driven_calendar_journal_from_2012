<p>Weird:  I am certain the sign on the platform said the train was
an express, but the train was a local.  These are realtime signs, and
the train wasn't late.  Weird.</p>

<p>At Jyugaoka, I switched over to the actual express train (and
wondered if maybe the colors for express vs local have been switched)
and the train was <em><b>packed</b></em>.</p>

<p>I was the last person on, and had three (3) pushers working to get
me on the train.  I was holding my backpack and there was no way it
was fitting at thigh level, so I lifted it up above my head as they
were saying "naninani ashi kudasai," and I'm like, <em>oh, 'leg
please'</em> and I pulled my leg in as the doors were trying to close
on/against my arm and finally all my parts were pushed in and the
doors closed.</p>

<p>My bag was still above my head and since I was crushed against the
door, my arm was pressed back in toward the center of the train by
the video display above the door at an uncomfortable angle, but there
was no way I could put it down; it would just end up on peoples'
shoulders at face level. So I bent my arm and put my bag on my head.
<em>Two more train stations until Nakameguro, where the crowd dumps
out,</em> I thought.</p>

<p>I found that if I stood on tip toe, the pressure was less; I got
my hips above the next guys hips.  Ahh.  that's better.</p>

<p>At the next station, the doors on the other side of the train
opened.  Usually they open right up like, "[whoop]; we're open!" but
so many bodies pressing against them made it like, "[eerrgg ggrind
shove] excuseme can we just open please?" and they opened and *no
one* got out.  As expected.  Fortunately no one got in.</p>

<p>As the doors closed, a pusher (or two?) had to push back in those
body parts that had escaped, and I could feel the pressure increase
again.</p>

<p>My legs started shaking after some minutes of tip toe standing but
only one more station to go.   Next station = Nakameguro.  We turned a
corner and the mass of humanity squashed even harder against me.  I
had to try it.   For an instant, I <em>lifted</em> my toes off the
floor.  Just for an instant.  That's how tight we were.</p>

<p>Arrival at Nakameguro.  But I had been wrong; no one got off.  No
one got on, either, so that was cool.  I had lifted my toes.  That was
cooler.  My bag was still on my head.  Cool?  I dunno; but it's
true.</p>

<p>At Shibuya, I watched the doors again to confirm they opened more
slowly than normal.  They did.  Slowly squeezing past all the
bodies.  Most packed train eva.</p>

<p>Then the door opened on my side (I was prepared for this) and I
was the first in the carbonated spam burst.</p>
