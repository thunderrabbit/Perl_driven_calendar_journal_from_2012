<p>Hmm.   Finding an apartment for Dan and I doesn't seem as simple
as I had hoped.  It appears that I'll have an easier time finding a
dormitory style (single room with roommate for 30,000 yen a month, or
private room for 50,000 yen a month; shared toilet / shower / kitchen
/ living area) (*)</p>

<p>(*) doh.</p>
