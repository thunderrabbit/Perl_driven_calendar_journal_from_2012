<p>Today, for the first time in Japan, I called in sick to work.</p>

<p class=date>11:42pm JST Sunday 15 February 2004</p>

<p>I called Yuuko and she came over, brought a thermometer and a
pointable translation book, learned my symptoms, bought medicine, made
me chicken noodle soup.</p>

<p>I slept and felt better and maybe should have sent her home so I
could sleep more, but didn't and we kissed a lot.  I hope she doesn't
get sick.</p>

<p>All clothes remained on.</p>

<p>We practiced lesson 74, any, none, some, every and she did better
by the end.</p>

<p>Dan came home while we were smooching so we quit and she went home
soon as we put in a movie to watch: "Bad Santa" starring Billy Bob
Thornton.</p>
