Quickly: Where can I send you money?

Dont want to tell you Nova doesnt suck cuz it sure does.  But you
picked the one school thats probably WORSE than nova.  Think about it:
1. Unpaid time between lessons.... basically means u sit around and
dont get paid hoping for a lesson.  2. They DONT PAY FOR YOUR TRAIN
PASS!! Fuck dude come on that alone would be enough for me to tell
them to piss off. 3.  1350 per lesson more or less.

Ok now imagination: Rob has a lesson at 11 and another at 1150 then a
break then no lesson then he has two more in the afternoon at 1400 and
1450.  Well were hoping the gaps get filled but there is no
telling..... so it is POSSIBLE that rob will earn a whopping 5600
minus transportation say 200 each way if you live only 2 stops away so
at the end of the day PRE tax rob makes 5200 and after taxes somewhere
around 4900.  So take 4900/5(hours spent at gaba) and you are looking
at a whopping 900 yen an hour! way to go rob! before you say im full
of shit thought you might want to take a look at these:
