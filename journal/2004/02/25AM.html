<p>On the bus to work now.  It came later than I thought it might, but
I think I'll still be well on time for work.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up gently from a dream.  Looked at my alarm and
it said 2 minutes to wake up time.  I was like, "aww yeah" and
thanking my angels when it went off what seemed like only a minute
later.  I wonder how much that was a sleepy-time-contraction
effect.</p>

<p>I have a google news alert set up to tell me if it sees any news
articles on UFOs.  It sent me an article from the <a
href="http://wildcat.arizona.edu/papers/97/103/01_6.html">Arizona
Daily Wildcat</a>, which is not much more interesting than any other
"I saw aliens" story, but it does tell me that we're making steps
toward revealing the truth.</p>

<p>Dan and I sang this morning.  He wanted to wake up and clean up
before some cat named Steve from England moves in today.  I was like,</p>

<pre>
Thank you for cleaning up the house
I feel like such a louse
because I can't help youuuuuu
</pre>

<p>He replied</p>

<pre>
Do not worry Rob, 
it's all my mess
</pre>

<p>me:</p>

<pre>
But I'm still a slob
I must confess
</pre>

<p>etcetera.   Fun stuff.</p>
