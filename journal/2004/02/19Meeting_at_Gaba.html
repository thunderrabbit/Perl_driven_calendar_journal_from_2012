<p>Finished talking with Tony at Gaba in Shibuya.  We listened in on
a lesson with a woman student who is a porn star.  Pics were googled.</p>

<p>Tony said that if he were my manager, there'd be hell to pay for my
being late.  Whew.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Thomas asked a ton of questions, which kinda made me wonder if I
wasn't asking enough, but he asked very few questions that I didn't
know the answer to.  He left a tad earlier than I did so I aksed Tony
a few things, but generally was already settled.</p>

<p>My basic priority now is to get a new apartment.  That's nearly a
priority over working.. as in, it's a priority over working at Gaba
right now, but it's not a priority over working at Nova.  If things
get crunchy, then it will be a priority over Nova as well.</p>

<p>Tony suggested that I just don't move out until I get kicked out,
but that doesn't feel quite right.</p>
