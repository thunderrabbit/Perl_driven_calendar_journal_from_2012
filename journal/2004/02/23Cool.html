<p>Cool.  Today before work I bought tix to LoR III for Wednesday
night.  Got good seats, too.  (assigned seat theaters here)</p>

<p>Had a no show my first lesson and made an appointment for tomorrow
morning to see an apartment in Tamaplaza.  It sounds acceptable, but
it's not on the train line I wanted.  It is on one of the Jiyugaoka
lines, but it's not on Toyoko line.</p>

<p>KG Miki was in my second lesson, her first Level 4 lesson.  She
wouldn't really speak up in the lesson, which kinda made me sad, but
hey.</p>

<p>Miho was in my fourth lesson with some other cat.  Level 3 lesson
so I grabbed MindTrap cards and had them ask yes or no questions to
figure out the puzzles.  The cat split soon after the lesson and I
told Miho I'm rocking out of Nova and she asked for my "address in
America" so I gave her my email address since I'm not leaving big
J.</p>

<p>Went to lunch and called KG Miki to say HI, but she was at work so
we set a hang out time for tomorrow afternoon.  She'll help me look
for an apartment.  I wasn't sure exactly what she could help me with,
but.</p>

<p>Back to Nova with my lunch and called another apartment place -
*this* one sounds perfect, location-wise.  It's in Motosumiyoshi
(only a local station, but it's cool) on the Toyoko line (yay) and
it's two stops closer to Jiyugaoka than Tsunashima.  yay yay!</p>

<p>So I'll have Miki go there with me (one stop from where we're
meeting (Musashi Kosugi)) and translate if necessary.  Yahoo.</p>
