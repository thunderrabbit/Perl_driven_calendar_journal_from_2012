<p>So I now have a meeting scheduled with Neil.  I called him a bit
ago and told him the Gaba interview was money and I'm out.  He was
like, "how much notice are you going to give?"  and I go "I don't
know," meaning I'll talk to him soon and give him the details.  I'm
requesting two days off next week: Monday and Thursday and if he
can't help me get them, then I'll give less notice.  If he helps me
get them off, or at least says anything <em>except</em> something
like, "I'm sorry, but if you had given more notice..." then I'll be
more likely to keep working weekends for 30 days, etc and make them
legit shift swaps.</p>

<p>That went well.  Neil was quite helpful; even knew I had 2 paid
holidays available and I'll be able to use them to take the days
off.  Sweet.  I said bye to the peeps in the teachers room and to
some of the cool students who I saw.  HS Miki, Takuya, Yuki.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to give to Yuki Bryn's email address like I wanted;
Yuki is going to London the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>Filled out four forms: Cancel insurance, Cancel housing, Cancel
job, Holiday request for Monday and Thursday.  I trust they will all
go through no problems.</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised at the support I got from people around the
place.  Guy and Ali were like, "good job {Rob | snoops}" and Rich
especially was like, "I'm really glad for you; I'm glad you had the
balls to do it.  I've got a little bit of jealously that I didn't do
it when I had only been here a year.  Now I can't do it; the paycut
would just kill me." He's got a wife and kid now, too.</p>

<p>I'm on the train toward home to tell Dan all about it and then go
back and say HI to Yuuko.</p>
