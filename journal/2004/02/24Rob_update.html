Hello, fellow earthlings!

I've been in Japan almost 11 months, and have just today put a deposit 
on a new apartment close to my new job.  It looks like I'm settling in
for another year of Japanese festivities.

I'm in a quality good mood today; I feel like I'm really taking
control of my life instead of just letting external situations drive
where I go and what I do.

For my new job I'll still be teaching English, but I'll be teaching
one-on-one lessons instead of group lessons.  I think this will be
much better for me because I far prefer this style of teaching (what
we call man to man lessons, regardless of genders); I think it's much
better for the students; I can actually *teach* something this way!

This new job allows me to choose my own schedule; I can take off
whatever days I want (we turn in our schedules on the 15th of the
previous month) and I can work long hours if I want to make lotsa
money.

The new apartment is 20% less expensive than my current apartment, and
is way closer to my new work than my current situation.  The apartment
building somehow reminds me of some of the old buildings in Hawaii.
It looks like a house crossed with a corrugated steel tool shed.

When I first arrived to see the place, a friendly guy named Ricky
introduced himself in flawless American English.  My friend Miki was
with me and she said his Japanese was perfect as well.  I look forward
to hear more about his story.

I don't have the new address yet; I'll probably get it on March 2nd
when I move in.

I hope you're well.
   - Rob!
