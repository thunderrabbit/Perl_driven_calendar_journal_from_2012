<p>I went to lesson this morning and felt pretty genki to begin my day
but felt pooey by the end of my lesson and nearly slept in … ¿Ó
station waiting for the train and then when I arrived in ¿Ó∫Í (after
checking to see what time I could buy tickets for LoR (spelled "LOAD
OF THE RINGS" on the flyer) for Wednesday, and saying HI to √Êª≥ the
monk who stands outside the station and who would not accept money
from me today) I told Hiroko that I didn't want to work today so
Steve closed my schedule and I went home after one hour.</p>

<p>Watched 2 episodes of Family Guy and 1 episode of Futurama with Dan
and now I'm going to sleeeeep.</p>
