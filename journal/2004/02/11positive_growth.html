<p>So Timeline was kinda inspiring in a way that say I can do whatever
the heck I want to do and make my own destiny.  Brought to my mind the
idea that time travel in itself doesn't matter about causality because
if I kill myself, or my ancestors before I was born, then it's just a
different future.  It doesn't mean I didn't exist to kill them (or
myself); they and/or I'm dead to prove I existed.  Causality only
matters if we are tied to the existence of <em>this</em> perceived
reality.</p>

<p>An idea is forming that includes me stepping forward to do what I
want to do.  This feeling does not include a sense of loneliness or
fear of loneliness.  It includes a feeling of destiny, and of the
universe providing what I need and ask for.  It includes a feeling
that I can do what I want, and don't need to worry much about what
other people think.  I have my own conscious that will pretty much
keep me from killing anyone or intentionally hurting them, so I'm not
too worried about that.  It's like, a feeling that if I am clear in my
actions and tell everyone straight up what I am about and what I want
to do, then those who are with me will help, and those who are against
me will be against me and I still go ahead and do what I want to
do.</p>

<p>This feeling does not include a need to bite Miki and Yuuko; it
might include an idea of telling them about each other, but maybe
not; I'm not kissing or fucking either one, which brings me to the
next thing that is not included in this feeling; it does not include
a need to kiss and fuck to validate myself, or to get that orgasmic
feeling to which in the past I have felt addicted.</p>

<p>I climbed stairs today, not riding the escalator with Tomoko and Mr
Sumida.  I was like, "whatever; I'm preparing to climb mount Fuji."
And I kinda made light of it, not in a way that says I'm better than
you, but like, "I'm choosing to climb the stairs and not the
escalator."</p>

<p>Then a bit later, I climbed the stairs instead of the elevator.
Bang; climb.  No big deal.  I even learned the Japanese for climb
today.  登る = のぼる = noboru.  I like to climb things.  I like to
ride my bike.  I don't like to watch TV.  I like to write in my
journal.  I judge that I like to do the things that bring me pleasure
and that I won't get pleasure by doing things that hurt people, so I
should just do whatever the fuck I want to do and be done with it.  Do
it and go.  Not too many worries about what people will think, or what
I *should* do.  Just do what I want to do.</p>

<p>This idea has been closely brought by reading parts of _If The
Buddha Dated_ and by my conversation with Josephine the therapist and
_The Way of The Peaceful Warrior_ comes to mind as a source, but I
can't cite it exactly.</p>

<p>Love each moment for what it is and then release.</p>
