<p>Things at Gaba went smoothly; I briefly met with Christine and then
Marvin and got all the papers signed and shit.  I found some
inaccuracies or otherwise weirdness in the contracts and shit and told
Marvin and he basically agreed and said they (Gaba) would not fuck
with me.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>I'll see him on Monday for training.</p>

<p>I will probably work at Jiyogaoka.  Which is cool because the
limited express train stops there.</p>

<p>Blah blah.  Oh</p>

<p>I had a 7B lesson and was kinda taken by this young woman who just
smiiilled and smiled at me and tried <em>really</em> hard to speak,
and smiled and smiled and though it was our first lesson and she is
7B, and there were two other students in the lesson, I gave her my
email address.  Here's a funny thing: the other two students didn't
notice me giving her my address.  I had written down what they said
wrong and then corrected it and they were reading what I had written
while I was writing my address for this girl and gave it to her.
Wow.</p>
