<p>Asuka was in the room next to me in a &gt;M&lt; with Rich as I had
a kid class with a senior kid who could just about read "I'M HUNGRY"
and "I WISH I HAD A HAMBURGER"</p>

<p>They talked about this being Asuka's <em>last</em> lesson; I'm glad
I got to witness it, but I had to really work to keep myself from
flirting too much with her when I saw her outside the school.  I had
to keep thinking <em>she smokes she smokes she smokes</em> so I
wouldn't try to hang out with her.</p>

<p>Neal was going to lunch so I went with him to a curry place and
chatted about whatever, focusing on gaijin houses and his experiences
from living in one.</p>

<p>Now I'm on a slow bus (fast bus, slow traffic) back to
Tsunashima.</p>

<p>I'm really pretty pleased with the idea of living in this apartment
in Motosumiyoshi.  I'll be on the right line, still close to Kawasaki,
and closer still to Jiyugaoka.  Private room with free internet.
Awesome.</p>
