<p><em>Bad Santa</em> was pretty bad, but good in a way - had its
funny parts.</p>

<p>Then somehow we watched not one or two, but three episodes of _The
Family Guy_ which I had never previously seen; they were really
funny.  Now it's most definitely bed bed bedtime.</p>

<p>Got to be in Ginza at 9am for orientation.  With suit and tie on.</p>
