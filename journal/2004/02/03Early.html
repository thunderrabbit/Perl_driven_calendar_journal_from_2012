<p class=date>10:10am JST Tuesday 3 February 2004</p>

<p>This morning I did *not* want to get up.</p>

<p>The air around my bed just felt so COLD that I couldn't bear to
bare myself to it.</p>

<p>I didn't want to be late more than I didn't want to be cold, so I
got up with 15 minutes left to get ready and catch the train (which is
6 or 10 minutes away (by bike or foot) from our apartment).</p>

<p>Up, out of my room.  "Dan,"</p>

<p>"Rob,"</p>

<p>"why is it so cold??"</p>

<p>He assured me it had been colder, which I figured was just cause
he's gotten used to it; he had only been awake 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Dan left soon thereafter and I got ready without delay (and without
eating) then rode my bike to the station.</p>

<p>Caught the local train before the express train that I had planned to
catch.  Local train (with a view out the front) to Jiyugaoka and
hopped (*) on the express train, which by that time had caught up to
the local.</p>

<p>Silently rode to Shibuya with my nose pressed against the door
(this is not an exaggeration) and when the doors opened, burst forth
from the train as the first morsel of the carbonated spam
explosion.</p>

<p>"I'm a balla, shot calla, twenty inch blades on my impalla"</p>

<p>For some reason this burst forth from my memory, packed in there
by Jason Fricke.</p>

<p>Put my tickets in the machine and it got mad, but I rammed through
because the ticket was legit.  I checked it and noted that the ticket
had not been properly processed the previous night, actually from 2
days ago because (!!) that's when I last used it, coming home from
Yokohama.  Oh well.  I have a theory to explain what happened; the
ticket machine that I used two nights ago wasn't able to process my
teiki and the ticket at the same time; it just saw the teiki and said,
"cool," but didn't tell the other ticket that I (it) was now out of
the system.</p>

<p>Anyway, got on the Ginza line, followed the instructions to walk
to TELL, found the green iron gate on my left, recognized how I had
misremembered the meaning of the instructions I had written down and
remembered what I had been thinking when I wrote them, found the
door, went in.</p>

<p>Filled in the first visit form and then the woman who had just
recently arrived was like, "I believe your appointment is for
eleven."</p>

<p>[blink]</p>

<p>"Unless it's been changed recently..."</p>

<p>"I'm Rob Nugen; I talked to ah, Rhonda" <em>shit that's not
right.</em></p>

<p>"Ramona"</p>

<p>"Thank you,"</p>

<p>"yes [I know all this]"</p>

<p>"I wrote down ten," and pulled out my book to verify.</p>

<p>"I don't think she'll be here,"</p>

<p>"I wrote down <em>eleven</em>(!)"</p>

<p>"You're welcome to stay,"</p>

<p>"Nah; I'll just get something to eat..."</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Wow.  I could have been in bed for another hour.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>(*) by hopped I mean crammed my way into a packed train.  I had to
stand kind of at an angle because my footspace wasn't directly below
my torso space.  Had to pull my coat in from between the doors after
they closed on it.</p>

<p>(!!) the friends of the guy with an Irish accent have just arrived
and he told them he had been there since 9:30.  He accepts that he
had arrived too early.  An hour early.</p>
