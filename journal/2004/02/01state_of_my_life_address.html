<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type=A>
<li><p>janette and I had a lovely time while she was here last
month.  <em>She brought Fred!!</em>  We went to Fujikyu Highland (my
second time to go) and I took pictures with the intention of being
published in First Drop, the coaster magazine for the European Coaster
Club.</p>

<p>I was quite impressed with janette's ability to get around Tokyo;
she had big fun seeing, shopping, eating, and more.  We went to a
couple parties with people from my work (to Masayo's apartment off the
Keikyu line and to Cory and Janis' all night bye-bye party thing in
Shibuya), and she went to Japanese lesson with Ayana twice.  Good
times.</p>

<p>In the end, however, I needed to cut the romantic tie that we had;
I need/want to focus more fully on myself within Japan, instead of
myself in Japan with a direct link back to the US.</p></li>

<li><p>I can speak some Japanese, though I haven't been studying a lot
lately.  I'm kinda getting back into it; the desire comes in
waves.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Bell Wistaria, Tsunashima, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.
Have lived here for 10 months and 4 days or so.  Have worked at Nova
for 10 months.  I'm considering changing jobs soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I have an orientation / interview with gaba on Tuesday.  Only
negative is I have to wear a suit.  Morag pointed out today that
wearing a suit is a silly reason to not take a job if everything else
is cool.  I'm thankful for that input.</p></li>

<li><p>Dan is my roommate here in Bell Wistaria.  We are considering
moving to a new location, getting out of the expensive housing
provided to us by Nova.</p></li>

<li><p>The Tokyu Toyoko line changed dramatically at Yokohama station
yesterday.  Yesterday was the first day that the platform is 5 levels
below ground; the day before, the platform was 1 story above ground.
That they made the change in four hours amazes me.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't yet ridden on the みなとみらい線。 (name of new train
line that replaces the Tokyu line past Yokohama station)</p></li>

<li><p>Wow.  I have just visited the gaba website, and I'm suddenly
more likely to want to work for them.  The negative part is their
website has some grammatical errors, but I think it's sloppiness not
dumbness.  Anyway, the site says they use computers to keep track of
students' progress, which is like bang on brilliant I think.  And yes,
man to man lessons.  Okay enough about that in the SoML, but I just
wanted to say wow.</li>

<li><p>I have a new digital camera.  It's the one I bought in
Akihabara with Fred's accompanyment while he and janette were in
Japan.  I've rather liked it.  Canon IXY 30 (only available here, I
think).</p></li>

<li><p>I have been learning a little bit of Mandarin from Kathy at
work.  She's taught me how to count to 10, say "thank you" "no
worries" "what's up" and a couple others that I've forgotten.  With
her direct help, I can get a 4+ (out of 5) on pronunciation of one
through ten, but my pronunciation goes down without her pre-loading my
brain.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't know where I'll be living or working in 2
months.</p></li>

<li><p>In my right wrist, I've been getting a bit of what feels like
what I called carpal tunnel syndrome in my left wrist when I worked at
FSD.  I've been on my computer a lot, but I've been writing a lot
more; I wonder if writing is aggravating my wrist.  I wonder how much
is related to my quick umbrella-powered dismount from my
bike.</p></li>

<li><p>On Tuesday I meet with Josephine, who may become my counselor
in Japan.  I would like to get back into personal growth work; I plan
to successfully grow past the desire to seek comfort from women.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been really happy with the new battery on my computer.  My
computer is my original PowerBook G4 667 MHz 30Gig HD, that I bought
in June 2002 (wow, that long ago??? (yes)) that has been upgraded to
OS 10.3.  512 MB ram now (from 256).  5.8 gigs free on HD.</p></li>

<li><p>Morag and I are working at KQ on Sundays with Ali this month.
I like Morag; we've been studying kinda frequently together, and have
started doing JAM sessions like Heather and I did back back back in
the day.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been reading two different books: <em>If The Buddha
Dated</em> by Charlotte Kasl (given to me by janette),
and <em>History of Japan</em> a bilingual version, given to me by
Miho, level four student from Kawasaki.</p></li>

<li><p>In my Japanese studies, I'm at a point where I'm kinda
balanced between "I've learned enough" "I'll never finish" "I'm not
making any progress" "I've just got to get over this hump" "Maybe it
will be mo better to learn Chinese" "がんばって" (you can do it,
rah rah rah) "it will get better soon" and "I look forward to great
progress!"</p></li>

<li><p>Dan just got home; said we have a new roommate scheduled to
move in.  Some cat named Steve from England.  Dan and I agree that we
don't need/want another roommate.  I go, "dog, we gotta get outta
here.  Before any cat name Steve moves in, we gotta rock."</p>

<p>Laughter ensued.</p></li>
