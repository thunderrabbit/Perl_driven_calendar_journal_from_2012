<p>This morning I woke up with a dream that would have easily taken
an hour to write all the details.  My old old dog Jedi was in the
dream, getting him water by stealing a dish from Walgreens, being in
trouble with the principal or the cops at school for not having
followed some regulation...  it was all there, set in good ol'
Tomball, but now it's mostly faded..</p>
