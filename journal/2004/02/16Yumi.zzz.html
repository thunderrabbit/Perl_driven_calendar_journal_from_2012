<p>Last lesson with Yumi was today.  I'm not as distraught this time
as I was the last time we had our last lesson; I've kinda fallen out
of love with her and I know she may choose to study with me again.</p>

<p>My nose was snotty during lesson; I stuffed a bit of TP up there
(after swiping a roll from the bathroom, much to Yumi's surprise
(paralyze) and I taught her the use of the word resources as in "good
use of resources"</p>

<p>I'm at home; it's bed bed bedtime.  I finished reading the Gaba
training manual and making a bunch of changes to it.  I hope my
snotty nose behaves itself tomorrow.</p>
