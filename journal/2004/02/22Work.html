<p>Aw that's crap.  Morag had a free as her first lesson but then got
scooted over to Kawasaki because Guy can't teach a CAT lesson over
here.  Why doesn't Guy get sent over to Kawasaki?  Weird.  Of course,
I just want to gossip with Morag.</p>

<p>Benny is somehow amazing.  I'm not sure how he can act like a jerk
and still people like him.  Is it his pin striped suit pants?</p>

<p>Holy fuck have I been here 5 hours?  Morag and I gossipped a bit
during lunch; good stuff.  I put Eminem's "Without Me" on repeat in
the front desk area while I was helping Junko stamp our address on
flyers and envelopes.  I took out the trash first thing during this
free and now I'm just goofin' on my computer.</p>
