<p>Work today was pretty good.  I had my first two Gaba clients
(clients, not students) and both lessons went well.  I talked to a
cat named Alex who has worked for Gaba for four months and is already
helping train new teachers.  That says something about the growth of
the company.</p>

<p>I got confirmation that I'll be working at the Jiyogaoka office,
although I still am not sure how to spell that name.</p>

<p>Said bye to Miranda, who reminded me of Laura Douglas, and
reminded Keddins of Drew Barrymore, (and me too after he mentioned
it) which may explain why I had a bit of a crush on her. I wonder
if/when I'll see her again.</p>

<p>Okay, bedtime for real.</p>
