<p>Hmm.  On first glance, it appears I might be able to transition
slowly into working at Gaba.   Schedules are flexible; contracts are
four months at a time.  With short contracts, I wonder if they hook
up visas for us.  With flexible schedules, I wonder if I can work at
Nova and at Gaba part time and see which I like better.</p>

<p>There is a computer in each gaba cubicle thing.  And I am
connected via airport here in the cube.  I just filled out the
pre-screening application thing.</p>

<p class=date>11:40am</p>

<p>The orientation went swimmingly; the rumors that we have to wear a
Gaba Suit are erroneous; the rumors that we have to make sales are
errorneous.  The rumors that we can hang out with students are
erroneous as well; I wonder how strictly that is enforced.</p>

<p>On one level, who fuckin' cares; I've got "plenty" of student, er
Japanese friends now via Nova.</p>

<p>The schedule is uber flexible so I can just work a few lessons per
week to start and see how I like it.</p>

<p>I was offered a followup interview; I imagine everyone was, but
who can tell.</p>

<p>Oh!  There was a _something_ being filmed in the classroom area; a
Japanese woman and American man bumping into each other and dropping
books and "excuse me; I am sorry.  I did not mean to.." "no, I'm
sorry; it's my fault," over and over about 5 times,, and I'm
like, <em>wow</em>, cause it makes me think *I* could be that cat
being filmed; baby I'm a star!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So, um, oh - student progress is tracked on computer during last
five minutes the lesson is reviewed and summarized good and bad points
and vocabulary learned (which the student can look up later, including
pronunciation) next suggested topics, etc; and I'm like, "wow."</p>

<p>The students can look up all of their lessons, what they learned
and what they need to work on, etc, ... students can and "are
encouraged to" provide feedback, and for every perfect lesson 5 of 5
on content, 5 of 5 on me, I get 1000 extra yen.  That is money, money
dude.</p>

<p>3.5 days training is paid after my 200th lesson taught.
Interesting..</p>

<p>Ummmmmmmm they don't hook up my visa unless I sign a year contract;
they don't hook up my housing; they don't pay for train passes.</p>

<p>Unbooked lessons are not paid, but no-show lessons are paid.
Lessons are quiet during the day and packed on nights and weekends;
"there is plenty to go around on nights and weekends."</p>

<p>Christine says she chose Gaba for the professionalism (that she
didn't find at Nova).  I didn't ask her at which branch she taught,
but she was trained at Kawasaki 3.5 years ago.</p>

<p>My next followup interview with Marvin is at 12:15.  11:51am now.</p>

<p class=date>1:35pm JST Tuesday 10 February 2004</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I'm pumped.  I'm thrilled!  I'm likely to have my training next
week (Monday through Thursday), which means I'll need to bang out
some shift swaps.  I'll tell Neil straight up that I'm rocking the
fuck out of Nova.  The more I think about it, the more sure I
become.  I just need to get new housing and I'm golden.</p>

<p>What was the turning point?  Meeting Marvin somehow locked
everything in place.  Was it his demeanor?  Did he say something?
Did he make a calculated sale on me that I didn't notice?  Or is it
because he invited me to join his radio show "anytime" on Sundays
from 1-5?? Fuckin' hell that is sweet; this job at Gaba may give me
an in to radio in Japan.</p>

<p>Was it that he said, "we'll hook up your visa no problem; you have
to sign a year contract, but we're not gonna....  you set your own
hours."</p>

<p>Was it the "aight peace" and three way handshake out the door?
Man; I was floating out of the office.</p>

<p>I called Yuuko; I called Morag; I emailed Dan.</p>

<p>I'm goin'; that's all there is to it; I'm fuckin' goin'</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Hmmm; have a shift swap I'm supposed to cover for Carla on the
25th.  I think the schedule will look like me sliding off the Nova
schedule.  I'll shift swap to get a couple days next week (for the
training) and work weekends only maybe for February.  I wonder if that
would let me still work at KQ with Morag and Ali.  That would be
sweet.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>He said, "we're growing; we need teachers right now.  The sooner
the better." and "and if down the line you think you want to get back
into computers, we have openings in our IT department; just let your
manager know." and "if you wanna work in Shibuya, Shinjuku, Yokohama
- these branches are really busy [and you'll likely have few
non-booked (non paid) lessons]."</p>
