<p>Called Íµ»Ò and she came over to help me look for apartments.
Well, we kinda talked about where I might find a room for relatively
cheap.  I should be able to find one for less than I'm paying now, but
I don't know about finding a private place this big for the same
price.  And, realistically, I'm paying this amount and have two
roommates, not a private place.  Hmmm; this makes me think a quick
State Of My Life is in order.</p>
