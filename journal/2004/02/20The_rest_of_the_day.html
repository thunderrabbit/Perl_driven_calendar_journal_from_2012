<p>Slept maybe 3 or 4 hours and I've been up for 5 watching cartoons
with Dan, oh and I downloaded mplayer to watch .divx files.  Worked
well.</p>

<p>Dan and I rode his bike to the conveni and me and Dan rode it
back.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh Masayo called me today after I had called in sick.  She
certainly had no obligation to call me; I felt a bit like, "aru?" not
knowing what to say; I've never had that type of phone call before.
Strange in a good way.</p>

<p>I wrote to David Pogue, the columnist for NY Times who said that
his recent column got a slew of flaming negative responses which
required thick skin to withstand.  I wrote him basically "wow; not as
cushy a job as I had assumed; keep up the good work."
Interesting.</p>

<p>Speaking of martinis, the Family Guy episode where they were coated
in nuclear waste and Brian the dog acquired astonishing speed was
funny when three successive martinis were poured and he flashed by and
sucked each of them down.</p>
