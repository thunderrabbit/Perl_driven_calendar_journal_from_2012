<br>I've gotta admit it. Growing up with YRUU does get you addicted to that physical contact, that validation. It really is a drug in itself, and it's unfortunate that society doesn't accept it as easily as alcohol or nicotine or all these other chemicals we use to make ourselves feel....good. <br>

It's good seeing you Rob.
