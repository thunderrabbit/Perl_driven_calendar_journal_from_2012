<p>Happy Valentine's Day.</p>

<p>I'm sick.  Sinuses are clear, as in I can breathe through one
nostril.  But snot is orange, and the roof of my throat is sore.</p>

<p>I almost passed out while peeing.</p>

<p>I just took some oscillococcinum (Anas barbariae hepatis et cordis
extractum 200CK HPUS) by Boiron.</p>

<p class=date>6:20am</p>

<p>I drew a rune: "Movement <em>reversed</em>."  Pretty clear.  I
called Nova personel to call in sick, but they didn't answer.</p>

<p>I feel sadness when I think about not going, or rather, when I
think about breaking my perfect attendance record.  I feel sadness
when thinking about telling Yuuko I can't go out with her tonight.</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep some more and see what happens next.</p>

<p class=date>8:07am</p>

<p>I called them twice again and no answer so I'm like fuckit I'm
going.</p>
