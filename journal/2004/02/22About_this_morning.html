<p>This morning I actually woke up not feeling completely nackahd (as
Dan says ("nackered" (whatever that means) he means) when he's tired)
like I thought I might.  Maybe I got exactly one single sleep
cycle.  裕子 drove me to work.  Nice.  We're going to meet tonight
(as previously planned (last night was unplanned)) but I told her
10pm is おやすみ time.</p>
