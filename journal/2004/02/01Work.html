<p>Today was the first day at Nova with the new CAT technique of
  teaching.  It's more like the CAT technique of evaluating students'
  levels, because I haven't been trained in the new teaching (or
  evaluation) method, and lots of people have been rumoring about the
  new evaluation method.  Anyway, I was at KQ and therefore didn't see
  a lot of the disruption that Ali reported went on at big school.  Ah
  whatever; I'll be more concerned about learning it when I get some
  actual training.  Not that that's likely to happen; Nova doesn't
  spend a lot of time/money training its employees properly.  It's a
  viscious cycle of crap training => high turnover => what's the point
  of training?</p>

<p>Today Morag was at KQ with me and Ali.  Cool.</p>
