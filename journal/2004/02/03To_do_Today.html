<p>I have two more things to do today.  One is write to Justin about
roller coasters and shit.  I've mostly written it, but I have
judgements against how awesome it is.</p>

<p>The other is to call apartment places to begin me an' Dan's search
for a new apartment.  It's become me an' Dan's search.  I wonder what
that means about me moving out?  Or him moving out?  Hmmmmmmmm.  Do
we have to move out together?  Hmmmmmm.</p>

<p>I imagine if I call an apartment place, they'll be like, "come on
over and have a look," and I will be tempted to come over right now
like I owe it to them or to myself to go look.  But I've got to write
today or I'm going to kill myself with guilt that I've not written
about coasters, but if I write *first*, I'll get stuck on the
computer.</p>

<p>Okay:  Call two places; schedule two appointments to look.
