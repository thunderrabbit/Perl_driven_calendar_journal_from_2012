<p>Yumi and I met for only an hour cause her stomach was upset due to
her finding out today that she would have to pay 100,000 yen or so to
change her flight and homestay plans in Australia.  Damm that sucks
dude.  That's a lotta money.  She went to the doctor today cause her
eye was still irritated and the doctor said she shouldn't go to OZ in
5 days.  Her eye had been way inflamed during the week and she had
gone to the Dr, etc, but just today he said she shouldn't go to OZ.
$1000 bang.</p>

<p>Yumi hates butterflies.  But she would prefer the following, in
this order:</p>

<p>10 butterflies on her head
<br>seppuku
<br>riding a roller coaster
<br>bunjee jumping
<br>sky diving</p>

<p>Today I taught her "I would never go sky diving" and "never say
never."</p>

<p>She has been parasailing (7 times in one day (*)) and rather
enjoyed it.</p>

<p>(*) she originally said, "I went parasailing 7 times a day."</p>

<p>She said that Gaba is reportedly a better company than Nova.</p>
