<p class=dream>Being forced off a small boat on a winding river
beside an old residential area.  My friend was on the boat and knew I
would be okay.  He goes, "where?" meaning "where shall I meet you?"
and I go "yellow slide" which was the next bright easily identified
landmark, a yellow plastic slide that kids apparently used to deposit
themselves into the river.</p>

<p class=dream>The maniacal captain gave me "two seconds" to leap
from the ship and he dramatically was all, "and <b>one</b>" after i
jumped in and sank to the bottom to hide from him.  "And <b>two!</b>"
as he kept the boat there, waiting for me to jump out and I'm
like, <em>jack; I'm under water here; hurry up and realize I'm
gone.</em> "two and a <b>half!</b>" <em>oh geez</em> I thought and I
splashed the water and screamed help help etc and he was satisfied
and went on his way.</p>

<p class=dream>I challenged myself to climb out of the water, up the
slide and along the variety of obstacles in the yard and reach the
front (back?) door, all without touching the ground.</p>

<p class=dream>Climbing over old jungle gyms as handily as a chimp, I
enjoyed the challenge, swinging from ring to ring to bar to anything
I could grab..</p>

<p class=dream>Successful in my endeavor, I arrived at the door but
realized there was no doorbell as such; I had bypassed all the normal
ports of entry; by the time a normal non-chimp reached this door;
they would be escorted by someone within the home.  I presumed,
therefore that these doors were not actually locked and, correct in
my assumption, went inside.</p>

<p class=dream>"Hello?"  The place was quite less than recently lived
in.  I walked about the living room for a while and remained calm
when things started moving by themselves.  Two large heart shaped
wire frames were lifted and moved over near where I was standing.  A
bit further away some leaves were swept into a pile and then the pile
splayed to bits to the sound of a woman crying.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, "hello?  why are you crying?" having a
good idea of what genre of stories must have happened.</p>

<p class=dream>"oh it's all my fault," she sobbed. "I should never
have let her cut the cake; oh there's blood <em>everywhere</em>"
Wailing tears.</p>

<p class=dream>Looking around, it seemed to me there had been no fresh
blood here (except my own, which was enclosed carefully in my body)
for tens of years.</p>

<p class=dream>"What's your name?"  I asked the woman.</p>

<p class=dream>She replied and I thought it was a pretty (although
dated) name.</p>

<p class=dream>"My name is Rob. Will you let me see you?"</p>

<p class=dream>"You can't see me?"</p>

<p class=dream>I smiled; "I'm sorry, but I don't think so."  I looked
over at Wende {where'd she come from?} who agreed.</p>

<p class=dream>I began to see the form of a young woman with dark
bouncy-spring curled hair.  She wore a fancy sundress, dark blue with
little white flowers, and a white lacy collar on top.</p>

<p class=dream>"Hello.  You're wearing such a pretty dress."</p>

<p class=dream>She smiled and became more visible and more solid.</p>

<p class=dream>I smiled and began to fall in love with her, my first
ghost (and a cute young girl ghost at that!) friend.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked over at Wende as I hugged the ghost who was
sitting in my lap.  Wende knew my curiosity in all things new, plus
she knew that I knew this new relationship shouldn't last much
longer.</p>

<p class=dream>"Guess what?" I asked my new cute friend.</p>

<p class=dream>"What?" She expected a to hear what her beliefs had
been telling her for who knows how many years.  That this tragedy,
whatever it had been with a knife and a cake - a party gone horribly
wrong - was somehow this young spirit's entire fault.  At the same
time, there was a glimmer of hopeful expectancy; maybe something
*different* was about to happen; this type of strange visitor didn't
seem to come around here very often.  Could it be?</p>

<p class=dream>"You don't have to stay here."</p>

<p class=dream>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Close your eyes."</p>

<p class=dream>She did this and I noticed her body relax a little.</p>

<p class=dream>"Now, notice your friends around you.  They are here to
take you home."  The audio tape featuring Robert Monroe and the voice
of a soul as perceived by a medium came to guide my words.  "Go to the
light.  Your friends are waiting for you."</p>

<p>best dream ever.</p>
