<p>Work was pretty cool after lunch.  I had a level 2 student named
Midori who learned English from 7A to 3 in Nova's Yokohama Honko
school.  Wow.  I was flipping through her file as she worked on
puzzles from MindTrap.  She only wanted to do the shorter ones.  She
said, "I can't concentrate long enough to read the long ones," and I
go "reallly..." and she's like, "well I can.." and I finished, "you
just choose not to."  "yeah."</p>

<p>She went to Canada for a year or two and was placed in level 2
when she came back to Nova.</p>

<p>I hesitated about giving her my email address, but when she said
she was quitting Nova soon, that flipped my brain and I was like,
"wow; me too" and I gave her my address.  She was like, "cool!" as
opposed to "what's this?"</p>
