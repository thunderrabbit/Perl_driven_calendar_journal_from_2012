<p>My computer is sick.  I'm using Daniel's computer to write this entry.</p>

<p>Yuuko came with me to Ginza today when I took my computer to see if
they could fix it.  A woman named Sawako worked on it, but determined
that the motherboard needed to be replaced.  Sigh.</p>

<p>It should be fixed by Tuesday.</p>

<p>I trust that the hard drive will remain genki and that my email
will remain intact.  There are about 20 messages (not counting the
500+ backlog) that I got recently that I want to process.</p>

<p>After Ginza, we went toward Shibuya and munched sushi at a kaitein
sushi shop where a cute-nosed French speaking girl was eating sushi,
left, came back with her friend.</p>

<p>I enjoyed climbing on some playground equipment that was set up in
the median of the street in Shibuya.  Walked up and down the slide
without using my hands, walked up and kinda through the monkey bars
without using my hands (and had a kinda flash, a vision, burnt across
the sky, that said, "having a huge set of monkeybars, including kindof
a set of tunnels through them that we could walk through quickly, or
all the normal squares we could snake through like playing sewer; that
would be money."</p>

<p>Just like that.</p>

<p>Then we saw Hachiko shrouded in construction fences, then we saw a
cat <em>zonked</em> out on the train when it arrived in Shibuya and
everyone got off and everyone (we) got on and he slept through it all.
Funny.</p>

<p>Yuuko got off at Musashi Kosugi.  Watched 3 Family Guys with Dan
and now it's sleepy time.</p>
