<p>Dan and I are at the Italian restaurant where Yuuko and I went
yesterday (and where Dan and ひろ) went yesterday.  Interestingly, 
ひろ is here now, and she came over for a second.  She's talking to
some cats from OZ in the smoking section now.</p>

<p>Oh, my computer is tough because I just kinda dropped it on the
table with a loud crash, but it's A-okay.</p>

<p>Today I mostly stayed in my room all day, doing email, sleeping and
looking at porn. I am working on a perl script to make it easy to view
images that are in an otherwise unindexed directory online.  It will
smurf the directory and put all the file names into a drop down list.
Choose a file (a simple down arrow will do) and the lower frame is
updated with the new picture.  It's a lot easier to just hit down
arrow than to click back, move the mouse precisely and click on the
next image.</p>

<p>Before that, rode bikes around with Dan (abusing his bicycle by
trying to drive over the kickstand thing), bought Japanese cartoon
toilet paper, mailed Dan's package to England (he was late for work),
dropped my suit off at the cleaners, ate lunch, and did three loads of
laundry.</p>
