I went to Fujikyu Highland in Tokyo recently.  The lines were quite(!)
short compared to when I went during the summer.  The park is open
from 9 to 5 these days (winter).  I went to Fujiyama first.  It's the
best coaster I've found around Tokyo.

Fujiyama (my fourth time to ride it) still proved to be a great ride.
From the fantastic view of Mt Fuji while clicking up the slow lift, to
the first drop (79 meters), to the last ending manuevers, it's smooth,
fast, beautiful.  And really packed into a small space; the bars look
so *close* to my hands thrown in the air.

Fujiyama offers like 7 seconds of total freefall time for the back car
(*) and does the final close-to-the-ground curve to go back to the
beginning REALLY fast. Why? Cause it's not over! 3 more crazy
shake-a-brain humps back and forth like a skater in a halfpipe and
then it's over.  WHOAH no it's not! one more crazy hump and Wow. NOW
it's over - What a ride!!

I also rode Dodonpa, the new air propulsion ride by S&amp;S.

Dodonpa is really really fast.  0 to 172 km/h in 2 seconds.  The ride
operators disallow anything that could fly off: gloves, scarves, hats,
earrings, glasses.  (I'm pretty blind without my glasses; I wonder if
the experience would have been better if I could see.)  Overall, I
felt unimpressed with the ride.  It has all this speed and just zooms
out and back then over a single hump.  Granted, the track goes
vertical on both sides of the hump, but it's quite anti-climatic.

After waiting for nearly an hour for this 60 second ride, I was
unimpressed.  Good props to S&amp;S for the speed, but now let's see a
ride that actually uses that speed for some cool manuevers.

(*) In the parks I've visited in Tokyo, riders may not wait for or
request a specific car.  Next available car from the front is your
car.
