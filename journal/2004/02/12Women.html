<p>Yesterday I saw level 4 Miho who I have not really talked to all
that many times, but who always smiles when we see each other in the
halls.  I was sitting by her in the seats outside the classrooms and
wanted to give her my email address, but didn't know if I'd have a
chance, so as the bell was ringing for class, I told her that Mieko
(with whom Miho would soon have a class) had my email address.</p>

<p>I think that was just as I was stepping into the voice room and lo,
it was a man to man voice with Tomoko who I had just been hanging out
with all day the previous day.  We discussed our plans for Monday (At
the time I didn't know if Yumi would be able to change our lesson to
Tuesday, (She (Yumi) subsequently emailed me that she could not.)
which would allow me to hang with Tomoko, Mr Sumida, and Yuuko to eat
¤ª¤Ç¤ó on Monday night.) and shared hospital stories because I found
my X-ray in the voice room.  Tomoko <em>recounted</em> her menengitis
story and how being stuck between the <em>vertebra</em> to sample
her <em>spinal fluid</em> was the worst pain ever.  (<em>3 vocab words
from voice</em>)</p>

<p>I invited Tomoko to go to lunch with me after voice and when she
asked where we should meet, I was like, "we can just meet in front of
the elevators" and again recounted the time we first met and how I had
just told Dan the previous night about how I was giving repeated fives
to that kid with the glasses (name has escaped me) while Tomoko was
writing down her email address.. and expressed how I knew
I <em>had</em> to try and give Tomoko my email address so we could go
ride rollercoasters together.  "I <em>love</em> it."</p>

<p>We ended up not meeting there, but I saw Miho in the hallway toward
the restrooms (as Carla was speaking in code (I think) to Asuka (the
level 3 student who I've only had in voice once, and haven't really
talked to her (but who smokes so is off the list anyway) though she is
really cute) about something) and I gave her my email address there.
She said she would email me.</p>

<p>I went downstairs and didn't find Tomoko outside either, so I
called her and was like, "where you at jack?" but in Japanese so in
case she was still in the branch, it would sound hopefully like a
non-teacher she was talking to, and she said she was in the elevator
so I turned back around and who should come out, but Mieko, Kathy, and
Tomoko.</p>

<p>I didn't want to go to lunch with everyone, but I didn't want to
offend anyone (and this goes against my policy of just do whatever I
want) so I didn't directly say "Tomoko and I" but just "I" when Kathy
asked where I was going to eat.  (I subsequently told Mieko (via email
last night) that I didn't know if Tomoko wanted another party, which
is why I wasn't direct with Mieko, and I apologized for that.  I
didn't tell her that <em>I</em> didn't want another party; I was too
embarassed to tell her that over email; so I blamed it on Tomoko, and
Mieko said she understood my quandry.)</p>

<p>Kathy and I went down the steps (not escalator to Azalea), and
turned around to wait for Tomoko (and not Mieko, apparently; she went
off elsewhere) and then she arrived and we headed toward Vie de France
and then <em>bang</em> there was Akina who I *really* want to talk to
and clear things up for not having met her on that night so long ago
(even before janette and Fred arrived), but I was able to stay on
track and not try to juggle another relationship on the way to lunch,
and she got my attention (by patting my arm (which I told her to do
next time she wants my attention in public and I don't notice her,
"grab me, 'hey Rob'") and saying "Rob") and I was like, "HI!" and it
was so fast that I couldn't even think of her name before she was gone
up the escalators.  I hoped she was on her way to Nova (though I had
already looked for her name on the schedule and it wasn't there) and I
even considered writing a note to her during lunch to give her if I
saw her, but she was not at Nova when I arrived after lunch.</p>

<p>Kathy didn't stay for lunch at the shop; Tomoko and I drank coffee
and ate, respectively, and chatted about whatever we chatted
about.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After work, after talking to Neil, Ryan, Kathy, Clayton, and Shaune
(who just finished OJT yesterday) on the Nambu line, after cramming
onto the Tokyu line with Kathy, (leaving Neil, Ryan, and Shaune who
weren't willing to cram on (and Clayton who stayed on Nambu at Musashi
Kosugi)), I got a page from Carla (and it was all I could do to hold
my bag with my knees as pulled my phone out of my pocket to see who it
was; no way I could reply at that time (I couldn't pull my other arm
up to type)) asking if I had gotten another job and if I had been
leaving her out of the [gossip] loop.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Called Carla after I got home (walked with Shaune, though I had
been on my bike, cause he lives in the same building) (and held the
phone kinda in front of me instead of at my ear to talk to her) and
told her that I hadn't talked to her because I had wanted to have that
heart to heart discussion when I was like, "I'll call you afta work"
one day after she had texted me like, "don't make any rash decisions
[about a new job]" and I never called her (for I had been too busy
hanging out with Yuuko) and stuff just started to happen so quickly
and I just never took a chance to tell her a short version because I
wanted that heart to heart with Carla.</p>

<p>She understood and I was really surprised at how sad she seemed to
be at the idea of me leaving, "everyone will miss you, bud" and I'm
like, <em>aru? (*)</em> cause I have never really felt that close to
what I judge to be her core group of Clayton, Cory, Benny (but maybe
cause Cory is gone...) (cause damn; she and Clayton are planning to
quit and go travel overseas together) but she was like, "this
is <b>sad</b> news" etc etc and I'm like, "I hear you" and "but part
of the decision was seeded by your comment, that I don't even know if
you remember specifically saying to me, but you said you say it all
the time, 'if someone doesn't like their situation, they should change
it.'" and she was like, "yeah, and I still stick by that" and her
manner changed to more supportive and more accepting.</p>

<p>I will definitely miss Carla and Morag from work.</p>

<p>(*) Scooby Doo "wtf?"</p>
