<p>Cool. emacs knew what time it is before Finder did.</p>

<p>Work went pretty quickly, I must say.  I think it helps me to have
a good first lesson.  My lesson was with Haruna, a new genki 7A with
cool glasses.</p>

<p>I don't remember her demographics, but I like her.</p>

<p>In the teachers room, Carla was looking for kids' cards (as she
always does on Saturday), "does anyone have any clothes out?"</p>

<p>Eric goes, "I have clothes <em>out</em>."</p>

<p>Eric usually says nothing super funny like that.  It wasn't all
that super funny, but it was funny and it came from Eric, the mild
manneredest cat at work.</p>

<p>Today I was finally able to break up more with Asuka, who keeps
having man to man lessons with everyone but poor little me.  She's
only 19.  Ooh that helps a lot.</p>

<p>Morag made her hair blonder.  I like it (I like most things about
Morag), but she doesn't cause it's a bit orange.  I'll agree that
it's a bit orange.  I still like it.</p>

<p>I got a money afternoon instead of a shit one because J-Lo called
in sick, which I somehow find quite ironic since he was pimping the
virtues of good attendance.  Result: Eric had to take J-Lo's Eiken
lessons and I got to take Eric's Topic Voice (on Reduce, Reuse,
Recycle), which he had already planned, making it way way easy for
me. A blip in my brain suggests that I can write a topic voice out for
Eric, but I doubt I will.</p>

<p>Today was my first day to ride the bus to work and home from
work.  Intentionally.</p>
