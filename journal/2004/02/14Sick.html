<p>Felt better-ish and went to work.  Got progressively worse
throughout the day, but still went to Odaiba with Yuuko.  Maybe I
"shouldn't" have done that, but I had cancelled two other things on
her recently, so I decided to stick with this one.  I've just arrived
home; I'm going to take a hot bath/shower and go to bed bed bed.</p>
