<p>Work went pretty quickly today.  My first two lessons included 朋子,
who was quite surprised to see me.  (And I her, but somehow I was less
surprised; I guess cause she knows I don't usually work in the AM (or
at all on Wednesdays).</p>

<p>I gave her LU2 to level 3 in the first lesson, and in the second
lesson practiced some of the role plays that she'll have to do to get
to level 3.</p>

<p>Neil commented on my having found an apartment in Motosumiyoshi.  I
assume that means he actively reads my journal, since I hadn't told
many peeps at work.</p>

<p>Did my fun lesson 13 in level 4: "where are they?" in where the
students have to determine that a plane is on the ground on the east
coast of the US given what the pilot said on intercom about London and
LA and such.</p>

<p>Tomoko did quite well with this, and the other three students did
quite poorly with it.  I don't know if I ought to revamp the way I
present it.  Not much time for that kinda thing.  I may never teach it
again.</p>

<p>Saw 裕子 in a room today and was all HI to her and "see you
[tonight]."</p>

<p>In voice, I played MindTrap with the three students in there.  They
got two of the questions correct.  Takuya was really tired today
though he was wearing a super fly outfit.  That cat is like the
epitome of Tokyo fashion.  He had on a snug purple T-shirt, a looser
orange/tan T-shirt, an unbuttoned white shirt with colorful spots,
crushed velvet purple pants, VANS style white slip on shoes with
purple paisleys, a red and orange flannel bathrobe ("now it's my
coat"), and a black top hat with chain around the top.  I shoulda
gotten a picture of him.</p>

<p>My last lesson was with a girl who works in a suit shop.  She had
trouble with a long number so I was like "for today's lesson, we're
going to read numbers," and taught her how to quickly read numbers
like 48,503,232,324,233 and more common numbers such as 54,000 and
12,400.</p>

<p>By the end of it, she was like, "it's easy!"  Hell yeah.</p>

<p>I was in the voice room talking to Koji (only student in there)
after my last lesson.  He was expressing how he doesn't want to be
left behind if Takuya zips along to level 4.  I was like "get outta
here; go to Australia" and Morag came in and concurred (but with
Canada), and he was like, "but I like Japan," and I was like, "aight
stay in Japan and come to Nova."  At the very end I was like, 
"がんばって" and gave him five.</p>

<p>"Sorry Morag, for interrupting your well-planned voice topic," I
teased her.</p>
