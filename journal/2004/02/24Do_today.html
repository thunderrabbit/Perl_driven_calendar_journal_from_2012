</pre>

<p>Those are the scheduled points.</p>

<p>I've finished the first, and I'm well on time for the second.
Enough time to eat breakfast.</p>

<p class=date>1:03pm JST Tuesday 24 February 2004</p>

<p>The apartment at Tama Plaza is plain but adequate.  I don't think I
wanna live there though because the bicycle parking is not optimal (I
can't easily lock my bike <em>to</em> something, and there's not
internet access in every room (although non-access might be a good
thing to keep me offline so much (but I think it's preferable to allow
myself to choose to not be online, instead of enforced offline
(whatever))), and it's not particularly close to Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>I met Josephine at TELL for what is probably the last time.  I
didn't really feel rapport with her, and wasn't even willing to tell
her that much.  Blamed the sub-items of not feeling comfortable in
the space.  She gave me contact information for different counselors,
including male counselors.</p>

<p>I'm well on time to meet KG Miki at Musashi Kosugi.</p>

<p>These jeans that I'm wearing are comfy and nice except for one
detail.  The zipper keeps coming unzipped.</p>

<p class=date>3:00pm JST Tuesday 24 February 2004</p>

<p>I've eaten ramen with Miki and now we're outside the apartment
place in Motosumiyoshi waiting for the owner.  I'm not real impressed
with the timing, but in a way I'm like, "cool" cause it's a laid back
environment.  When we came in a cat named Ricky was like, "wazzah" and
spoke good English (to me) and good Japanese (to Miki).  He was late
for work so zoomed off on his motorcycle.  Heh.</p>

<p>Unless something goes way wacky with this place, I'm going to live
here.</p>

<p class=date>3:42pm JST Tuesday 24 February 2004</p>

<p>Money.</p>

<p>I just put down 10,000 yen deposit on the place.  I already have
the key, too, which seems surprising, but cool.  I'll be in room 20.
There's a Techniques (sp) turntable poster on the inside of the door.
Rene said he would leave it there for me.</p>

<p>Oh, and my room 20 has a solid (*) wireless internet
connection.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Miki for helping me get to the place and asking
all the necessary Japanese questions and bringing the slippers to the
next room when I left them.</p>

<p>Whooohooo!  New apartment!  And it's just perfect ¤Ç¤·¤ç¤¦¡£</p>

<p>(*) solid as in strong.</p>

<p class=date>5:37pm JST Tuesday 24 February 2004</p>

<p>Miki and I hung out at my house, including taking a short nap and
having a short tickle fight, and then it became time for me to go
meet Íµ»Ò et al.</p>

<p class=date>10:47pm JST Tuesday 24 February 2004</p>

<p>Arrived in Asakusa a tad late, (but not as late as Íµ»Ò) and had
some hot cocoa with Sumida and Tomoko at Starbucks while we waited.
They had been there for an hour, playing Solitaire on Sumida's new
Mac.  I was like, "wow; Mac!"  Seems they got it because I expressed
such a love for my Mac.</p>

<p>Taxi to a pretty old ¤ª¤Ç¤ó shop in the area in a small narrow
building nearly dwarfed by the buildings around it.  In the taxi on
the way there, I could understand just enough Japanese to get one of
the jokes they made. We were in Asakusa and Yuko had never been there,
though it's a popular tourist destination.  (The joke was funnier in
Japanese)</p>

<p>Êþ»Ò said my Japanese comprehension is getting a lot better.  Yay.
:-)</p>

<p>Chowed a ton of odin, which is basically various types of seafood
and vegetables in a hot water broth.  Minced and pressed shrimp,
rolled seaweed, potato, radish, ¤¤¤í¤¤¤í¡£ Good stuff, and I was able
to understand about 1/2 of the conversation.  Maybe 1/3rd.</p>

<p>Next Sumida suggested either coffee or karaoke, so we flipped a
coin and it came up coffee.  Hopped in a taxi and went to karaoke, 
¤¢¤ì¤Ã¡©  I don't know how that happened, but we had big fun at the
karaoke box.</p>

<p>Karaoke in Japan does not include performing in front of a bunch of
strangers.  It's like singing karaoke at home.  Each group hangs out
in a smallish booth/room for four to maybe 10 people and a karaoke
machine.  Far preferable for people who don't like to sing for
crowds.</p>

<p>They had me start us off, so I chose Eminem's "Without Me" which I
was vaguely able to do.  This place didn't have "Rabbit Run," which
I'd be able to do quite well I think.</p>

<p>I did worse with MC Hammer's "Can't Touch This" and far better
with Bangel's "Walk Like An Egyptian."</p>

<p>They sang a song by SMAP, yeah that one that was way overplayed
when I first arrived here last year, and 2 other songs I had heard
before.  I was barely vaguely able to sing some of those, after
extensive repetition and reading the hiragana/furigana.  I could read
a few kanji.  I think karaoke would be a great way for me to learn
Japanese in a fun environment.  Especially if I just want to sing to
people on the streets.</p>

<p>As I was settling in for several more songs, it was time to go.
Sumida paid for everything, which is a huge blessing for us, and we
headed over to Asakusa station.</p>

<p>I piggybacked Íµ»Ò for a bit as if I would take her home (since she
was wearing my backpack) and then dropped her off before the ticket
booth.  They headed off together and I jumped on the train I'm on now,
which starts at Asakusa and ends in Shibuya.  Perfect.  Or, easy
enough.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Aight.  Sleepy time until we arrive at Shibuya.  Then hopefully
I'll easily get a seat on the train home.</p>

<p>With Dan I watched an episode of Futurama and an episode of Family
Guy.  Bed around 2am.</p>
