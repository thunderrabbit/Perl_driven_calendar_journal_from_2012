<p>Kicked it with Tomoko and her umfriend for the afternoon.  He paid
for everything which is definitely a sweet deal.  Said my Japanese has
gotten better since I last saw him.  Also sweet.  We ate okonomiyaki
at a restaurant and I just had this huge desire to be hanging out here
with my dad, showing him how they cook okonomiyaki; I think he would
just love it.  I wonder if he'll ever make it out to Japan.</p>

<p>After okonomiyaki, we went to Tokyo dome City to ride Thunder
Dolphin while her man went to akihabara to buy a watch, and for some
readson i got the idea that they had been fighting just before we
separated.  I'm not sure what that was about, and I'm not even sure
the were actually fighting, but it's just a sense that i got.  I
broke the tension that I felt by telling Tomoko about the first time
that I knew I wanted (not that there were two times) the first time I
was like bang; I wanna hang out with her.  (In the voice room one
time and when I asked, "do you like riding roller caoseters" she was
like, "I love it" in a way that is just burned into my memory,
almost, I imagine, like it might be if that *moment* was a signnal to
wake up my sleeping conscious brain to remember an old soul friend in
this lifetime.  Very weird.</p>

<p>She rembered the time as well, though I don't know if with the
same clarity.  Tokyo domce City was way way too crowded (today is a
holiday) for us to want to go tride anything.  So we were like no way
jose, and called her man again and met him in Akihabara. there he did
not find a watch, and I did not find iPhoto software that I want and
so we went to ginza to the Apple Store and I got the software and
tried asking the guys in the Genius Bar for a way to unsplit the
libraries that i split when I installed iPhoto Buddy, but therew's no
good way that they know of.</p>

<p>So.. oh so I bougt the software and thtat was all fine and I was
like ahh whatever about the rest blah blah brain is gone.</p>

<p>Movies I want to see Lord Of The rings III.   somethng with Ben
Affleck, Uma Thurman.  Paycheck</p>

<p>So then we got his watch and oh, we decided to climb mount fuji
together.  Ooh I wanna watch Spiderman II.  Wow great scene with the
car kiss thing.</p>

<p>She needs to know if he has kissed someone else. yah, I know that
trick.</p>

<p>So we decided to watch ちかう、watch じゃない、 decided
to <em>climb</em> Mt Fuji in the summer.  And we'll invite Tomoko and
Yuuko.</p>
