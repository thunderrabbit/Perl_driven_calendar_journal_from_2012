<p class=date>6:44pm JST Monday 2 February 2004</p>

<p>Work dragged today.  I had some comfortable students that I often
have on Monday mornings, but it wasn't as fun as I wanted it to be.
Just kinda blahy.</p>

<p>Part of it is cause my right hand/wrist/arm hurts.  That sucks,
dude.  I wrote a lot less today than I used it.  I was going to say
usually do, but I might have just changed my style of teaching.</p>

<p>Usually I write everything for Yumi, but tonight we'll see what
happens.</p>

<p>The new CAT system of filling files is a bit wack; I don't feel
really comfortable with my calibre of comments.  Partially, now this
could just be a wild guess, but it quite possibly could be because
I've received no training about them.  Just grasping at non-existant
straws here.</p>

<p>To a large extent I'm like good; fuck off, training; I don't want
you anyway.  This is not as much <em>sour grapes</em> as sick of Nova
and don't really want to do a good job for Nova anymore.  Unless
something really fucked up happens at the Gaba orientation (or if I'm
not offered that job), I'm leaving Nova soooon.</p>

<p>Yumi is here.</p>
