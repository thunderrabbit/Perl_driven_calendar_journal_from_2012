<p>My computer is still at the doctor.  Last couple of days at work
have been .... challenging for me to care.  I've used the book less
than ever, and I've given some pretty awesome lessons.  Today I helped
a guy learn how to use "it must be" and the difference between "it
possibly isn't" and "it isn't possible."  I was able to figure out a
way to show him how those are different.</p>

<p>I'm moving tomorrow.  Well, tomorrow is the first day that I'm
supposed to have access to my apartment (I've had a key since I put
the deposit down last week).  I've been kinda sorta packing
tonight.</p>

<p>I got an email from Midori (level 2 and cute as a button) couple
days ago; replied tonight.</p>

<p>Um, there's more, but I can't really remember.</p>
