<p>Yesterday Yuuko was in a lesson next to my man to man kids class.
My lesson was on animal noises so I got to be kinda loud and silly
with him.  When we made dog noises, I did the same noise that Yuuko
and I do for dogs when we hang out.</p>

<p>I had a Chatty McChat lesson with level 3 Miho, who gave me the
bilingual history of Japan book.  Mostly went over vocabulary with
her.</p>

<p>One lesson with two schoolgirl types who were shy and I taught
them, "don't take life too seriously" - loosen up in Nova; just chat
as much as possible; it's good for you.</p>

<p>Said HI to Kaori and Yutaka and KG Miki between classes.  Saw
Takuya but didn't remember his name until later.</p>

<p>Called KG Miki and then Yuuko to see if either of them could play
after work, but they were both at home by then.  Miki was about to
cook dinner for her dad and Yuuko had been sleeping.  She called me
back and subsequently confirmed she had heard the dog howls.</p>
