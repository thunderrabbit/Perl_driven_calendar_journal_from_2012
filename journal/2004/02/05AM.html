<p>Am at the suit place that Yuuko showed me.  Buying a new suit for
14,000 yen.  Pretty much an excellent deal compared to the one I
bought in LA.  If I don't take into consideration brand names and
quality (?).</p>

<p>This suit is stretchy-ish fabric, charcoal gray.  :-) It's being
tailored (cuffs) now.  15 minutes.</p>

<p>It took a bit for us to communicate across the languages, but I
think we got it all sorted out on the length of the cuffs and
stuffs.</p>
