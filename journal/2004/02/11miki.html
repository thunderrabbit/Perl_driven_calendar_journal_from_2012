<p>Now I'm in the theater with みきちゃん.  We just ate at a pretty
expensive (for me) restaurant for 5880 yen for both uf us.  And now
we're about to watch um, I forgot. Oh yeah Timeline.</p>

<pre>Here are the movies I want to see, given the previews here:

haunted mansion with Miki

The day after (opens in 114 days, dammit)

wtf is  Van Helsing?
</pre>

<p>Hmmm; not a lot of movies that I want to watch after those
previews.</p>

<p>After the movie, I felt like, <em>I can do this; I can live in
Japan.  I'm doing this.  I am living in Japan.</em> and I walked her
out of Cinecitta area with her arm on mine and we were just walking
and I was just there experiencing the joy and not falling in love
with her, but just loving the moment.  Loving the situation and
releasing it.</p>

<p>Gave Miki a big hug and did not sing "Oh Miki what a pity you
don't understand; you take me by the heart when you take me by the
hand" after we parted.</p>
