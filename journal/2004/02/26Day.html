<p>Was delighted to see Akina come in while I was in the voice room.
I invited her out to Olivia's byebye party tonight.</p>

<p>When Akina called me tonight I didn't know who it was but I knew
she could speak Japanese better than English.  When she was like,
"where are you?"  I gave the phone to Aiko across the table, "where
are we?" and she's like, "who is it?" and I'm like, "I don't
know!"  Funny business, that.</p>
