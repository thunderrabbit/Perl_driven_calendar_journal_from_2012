<p class=dream>Jennifer Nunnally was driving; we had just been driving
through the countryside roads of Tomball area and for some reason had
to turn around, but she looped around instead of turned directly
around and was driving really slowly to find her way back to the road
we had been on. I hadn't been paying attention and was more interested
in trying to rewind the LP on the dashboard to find the spot where the
woman's voice had been a piercing loud high note, but each (both)
times I tried to spin the record backwards, it distracted Jennifer's
ability to see where she was going and that was dangerous cause it had
been raining.  I suddenly noticed a two or three inch puddle across
the street in front of us and warned her and she slowed right down;
she hadn't seen it until I pointed it out to her.  As we turned right
around a corner, I noticed a zebra beside the road and an old man with
a BB gun came angrily out of his house, pumped the BB gun and shot
near and shouted at the zebra, who didn't move. Then we drove by and
he apparently hit the zebra who ran past us and I leaned out of the
way to let it go by, then the zebra was out of sight and I heard the
man shoot again and I imagined I felt a hit in the leg and I whirled
around in anger, "you do *not* shoot while someone is standing there;
that zebra was long gone before you shot" and the old man denied my
claim, "no man shoots another man in the ass!  are you calling me
gay?"  kinda thing and there was lots of guys taking pictures our
there; a bunch of his men apparently for after one of them said, "hey
you are bleeding," "really?"  and I confirmed it for myself; he had
hit me in the back of the thigh; one of the guys like was, "hey hey,
listen here's what we'll do," trying to pacify the situation, and I
was like, "hmm" thinking how much money I could get to shut up, and I
remembered Mr Bandecca's story and I was like, 5000 dollars, but the
dream was already fading...</p>

<p>- - - - previous dream</p>

<p class=dream>In Hawaii treading water with big big waves coming due
to a storm, there was the safety of some sharp lava rocks to my right
as the waves were dumping over them and it was all I could do to stay
on top of each successive wave; I couldn't get back toward the rocks,
as the waves were dumping over those rocks from the other side of
them, and I just trusted I would be able to tread water long enough to
find something solid again, and I was also holding something above my
head (out of the water) though I was using two hands to tread water.
I eventually did find something solid on which to stand; a walkway
over a city street and the water all drained away and I was walking,
but not too sure where I was now, though there were some other cats
from Nova (Mike (who also quit Kawasaki branch recently)) and I was
walking back over the walkway to find my home and I had to get ready
for work at the same time; I had my work clothes on..</p>
