<p>Fuckin students</p>

<p>Okay, so I didn't see the not in the Every Lesson window "ATTN
101562, arrange to swap" sorry.  Build into the system a way to block
instructors.  I fuckin pour my heart into these lessons.  "Client felt
there were unneccessary pauses in lesson.  Instructor said 'good' but
didn't explain the mistake.  Please correct all mistakes."</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, if I said "good," there <em>was no</em>
mistake.</p>

<p>I've added a note in my student tracker that I will definitely see
and definitely not teach the student again.  Even though I remember
being impressed by her.  If she doesn't like me, then fine.  fuck
off.</p>

<p>Second student, who is studying and doing his homework well, blew
away the lesson he was supposed to do next, so I merged the target
language of the scheduled lesson "he is Lukas" with the target
language of the next lesson "he has brown hair," and we covered two
lessons in one period.  Got 4 of 5 stars.  Fine, waste your money and
we'll do just one lesson at a time.  Okay, maybe by giving me 4 of 5
he meant he liked the lesson.  But 4 is not perfect.</p>
