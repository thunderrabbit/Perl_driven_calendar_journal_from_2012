<p>Today, class was pretty good; I whipped out a few sentences before
class and those, plus what I had previously written in my diary held
most of the time in the lesson.  Somehow I have a goal of not learning
anymore grammar, but just talking about what I've learned so far.  New
grammar can come later.</p>
