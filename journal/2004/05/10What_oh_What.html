<p>What am I doing?</p>

<p>Is this valuable for the world?</p>

<p>Is it valuable to me?  Will I think, <em>good work, mate</em> when
all this is finished?</p>

<p>All what?  All this <em>living</em> stuff.  Living in Japan.
Working at Gaba; writing a student remembererer; wondering who/if/when
I should get married; wondering if I shoulda married Wende when I had
the chance..  what is it all about?</p>

<p>There's a part of me that just wants my entire life recorded;
every thought to be dumped onto this site.  I've considered buying
voice recognition software so I could just yammer and have all the
text appear online.  I've wondered what it would be like to not have
to do anything but live and have it all recorded.  Like The Truman
Show.</p>

<p>One interesting point about keeping a journal is that part of the
life is spent keeping the journal.  Journals can range from "over the
last six months I've done a lot of great stuff and didn't have time to
write" resulting in a lot worth reading but nothing to read to "I just
wrote 'Journals can range from 'over the last six months I've done a
lot of great stuff and didn't have time to write' resulting in a lot
worth reading but nothing to read to 'I just wrote 'Journals can range
from 'over the last six months I've done a lot of great stuff and
didn't have time to write' resulting in a lot worth reading but
nothing to read to 'I just wrote nothing worth reading" resulting in
nothing worth reading and too much to read.</p>

<p>When I reach a point where I'm like, <em>aight, how can I earn a
living in a fulfilling way?</em>, my brain seems to think of a few
ideas and then want to check out with some sort of brain candy:
programming, sex, food.  Is there a pattern there worth exploring?</p>

<p>Ought I train myself to jump back to that brainwave that got
sidetracked to wanting brain candy?  Is it my brain's way of jumping
off track when things get scary?  Are things scary when they're on
target, when they're approaching that grandest part of me?</p>

<p>"Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure" or
something like that.. is it true?  Does that fear kick my brain to
seek brain candy instead of seeking ways to manifest my greatness?</p>

<p>Even <em>right now</em> I'm like, fuck this I wanna work on the
program.  How am I to discern what is important?</p>

<p>I'm supposed to be at work in 3 hours.  My work experience will be
easier if I have this bit of program done, but I don't think I can
get it done before I have to (get ready and) leave for work.</p>

<p>I've challenged myself to learn Japanese.  My flirting with
Japanese women will be easier if I know Japanese, but I don't think I
can really learn Japanese before I go nuts hating being alone in this
country.  So I jump on every opportunity to hang out with women now.
Does this help me?  Am I hurting myself by seeking external "input?"
(egad I'm a geek)</p>

<p>Maggie suggested that there's a difference between something and
something else; shit what was it that she said.  Something about
getting love from external vs internal sources.  Really eloquent.
And now I'm thinking of spending time looking for that specific email
which could take a long time, and I jump to wondering if gmail with
its proposed amazing search skillz is available yet (but I "know"
it's not; I'm on their mailing list to let me know when it's ready
for public consumption) and even if it were, Maggie's message is on
*my* computer, not their computers, so I'd have to find a way to
export my messages to their servers, resulting ultimately in *not*
feeling like I'd done anything productive this day, *and* not even
'finishing' this entry, which would have been a lot quicker in the
first place if I could just say it instead of type it.</p>

<p>Fuck.  So even now there seems to have been no net motion except
to dump a bunch more crap onto my journal, and I've got to start my
day (eat, shower) and go to work.</p>

<p>And I haven't even written all that I could write.</p>
