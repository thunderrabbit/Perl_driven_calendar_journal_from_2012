<p>I had to drag myself away from the TV tonight; Episode II of Star
Wars came on at 1am as I was just about to go to bed.  I had
considered turning off the TV as soon as everyone else went to bed,
but I chose not to get up from where I was working on adding a new
query to my student rememberer.  Changing Lanes had just gone off and
then bang Star Wars and I was like <em>if Queen Amidala is on, I'm
watching</em>, but it was only Senator Amidala, so she didn't have
that lip thing going on, so I was more easily able to break away.</p>
