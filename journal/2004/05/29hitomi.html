<p>Hitomi went fishing on Saturday with her friend Hitomi.  They
invited me to eat fish with them after work.  Awesome.  Delicious.</p>

<p>I was a bit nervous at first going over there; having never met her
and still having in my head all these ideas about appropriate behavior
being far more strict in Japanese homes than in the US.  But it was
all good; I just remembered a few points about how to place my shoes
at the door and to not serve myself any food or drinks.  Easy
squeezy.</p>

<p>They had gone fishing out by Hakkejima Sea Paradise, and caught 8
fish or something.  They tag teamed to get them clean; Hitomi didn't
like to skin the fish and Hitomi didn't like to gut the fish.  I
didn't understand which Hitomi didn't like which, but I understood
"tag team clean."</p>

<p>Hitomi lives really close to a train station switch yard.  Cool to
see all those trains lined up.</p>
