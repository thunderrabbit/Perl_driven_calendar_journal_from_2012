When I'm reading an article, and decide I want to click one of the
pictures, I don't want to have to think about it.  In every other
website in the known universe, we just click the picture.  By making
me think, I lose track of my train of thought reading the article.
I'm like, wtf?  why didn't the picture open?  Oh yeah, on NY Times I
have to look for the answer, a tiny bit of text.  If there are 3
pictures, this could take a week to read the article: clicking on the
picture, wondering why it didn't open, losing my train of thought,
looking for the answer, reading different text, moving my mouse off
the picture I want to enlarge onto the magical text that enlarges the
picture, clicking the text, clicking again after adjusting the precise
position of the mouse cursor because I missed it the first time,
successfully opening the picture, wondering where I was in the
article.

Let us just click the picture!
