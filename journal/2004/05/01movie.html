<p class=date>8:38pm JST Saturday 1 May 2004</p>

<p>I'm on the Nambu line now, having basically run out of work as soon
as the bell rang; I had hung up my suit jacket, and swapped to my
casual shoes during the last lesson.  Told the student that I needed
to meet my friend in Kawasaki at 9, and she was like, "cool, bro; no
problem."</p>

<p>Meeting KG Miki, by the way.</p>

<p class=date>12:26am</p>

<p>Movie was good.  Predictable, but of course being surprised isn't
why I saw the movie.  I just wanted to check out the money showmanship
of the bands.</p>

<p>"Hit 'em with a little <em>Flight of the Bumblebee</em>"</p>

<p>Hahahaha.</p>

<p>Before the movie I grabbed a chicken burrito from Freshness Burger
and ate 2/3rds of it before showtime.  The rest watched the movie from
the cup holder and then I ate it while sitting with Miki at Kawasaki
station under the central clock.  She checked my Japanese sentences
and fixed the errors.</p>

<p>I'll miss Kawasaki a little bit when I leave Japan.  I'll miss
Shibuya a lot more.  I'll miss Miki a lot more than that.</p>
