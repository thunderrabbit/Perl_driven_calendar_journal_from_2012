<p>Didn't take my computer to work this past weekend, as part of my
back-healing process.  It has generally felt a lot better.  Plus, on
Saturday morning (or Friday night) I had ¤Þ¤¤¤³ close all my lessons
that hadn't been filled, leaving me with 10 lessons on Saturday and 9
on Sunday.  The breaks in between helped me have time to stretch.  I
have found exactly what (I think) caused the problem.  I was correct
in my guess that it had to do with sitting at work, but I found myself
kinda hunched over sideways to write, and I was like, <em>ooh; that's
it</em> [that's the somewhat spine wrenching position that I do] and
remained mindful to not write that way.  I'll look for alternatives
that will help keep my back intact, jack.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone at work who asked after my back.</p>
