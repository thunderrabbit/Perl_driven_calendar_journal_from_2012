<p>Long day at work yesterday.  When I met with Yasuko, we didn't get
all the way through her project, so I invited her to request my 10 and
10:45am lessons in the morning, which hadn't been filled.  "It will be
a great start for my day!"  I'd prefer to have a great ending to my
day, but it will still be great.</p>

<p>I had a great ending to my day.  The lessons that had been
scheduled with some of the challenging students had all been replaced
(except for one) so it was all good.  My last lesson of the day was
actually a double header with a really genki funny girl named Sawako.
She's a system engineer, but assures me she's not very smart; she just
acts busy so her boss will think she's smart.  Heh; that's funny.</p>

<p>After work, we went to Eric's byebye party.  This is approximately
what I wrote to janette about it:</p>

I have just arrived home (1:05am now) after hanging with peeps from
work at Eric and Natsumi and Maiko's byebye party.  Eric and Maiko
were promoted to different schools, and Natsumi has been moved to a
different school.  Gaba seems to have a habit of shifting its human
resources around.

The party was fun.  We met in [Musashikosugi], which is, as you
know, near my house.  It's near Eric and Jesse's houses as well.
Jesse's girlfriend Tomoko came to hang with us and she spoke Japanese
with me a lot.  (I'm beginning to be able to have small simple
conversations in Japanese!)  After all the non-local people left to
catch last train, Eric, Jesse, Tomoko and I hung out and ate the
remaining food (Jesse and I ate the food) and chatted without the
stinky smokers there.

I mean, they're nice and all, but ugh!

I can see that I far prefer to have a few close relationships than
many non-close relationships.
