<p>I have eight needles in my back now.  There's a chiropractor quite
close to my house, and he accupunctured me and used incense to do some
sort of heat treatment stuff on my back.  Not as hot as I thought it
might be.</p>

<p>Got 8 little needles in my back now.  They'll stay for up to 2
weeks.</p>
