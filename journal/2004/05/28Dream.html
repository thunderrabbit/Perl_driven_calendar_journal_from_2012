paper roll projects.  I was like, "oh; sorry for forgetting; I keep

the house, and I watched the swarm squeal by like a huge undulating
flying serpent.</p>

<p class=dream>I took some pictures, and some of them turned out
really well, capturing individual insects in flight, but still giving
an overview of the hoarde.</p>
