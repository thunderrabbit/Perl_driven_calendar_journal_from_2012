<p>Oh my god what a disgusting way to spend 2400 yen. (*) <em>The
Passion of Christ</em> in no way describes the passion of Jesus.  It
was two hours of relentless savagery; even now I feel woozy thinking
about it, and the movie ended 2 hours ago. They beat the fucking hell
out of this cat to the point where, even though I <em>wasn't
watching</em>, with my head turned from the horror, I was passing out
from the abject violence.</p>

<p>Don't go see it.  Yes; he suffered.  No point in making me suffer
through this movie.</p>

<p>(*) Premier showing price with a free popcorn and reclining
seats.</p>
