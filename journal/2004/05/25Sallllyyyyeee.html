<p>Sally sent me an email today, asking for info about teaching ESL
in Japan!!!</p>

<p>OH MY GOD!</p>

<p>I have to watch my internals carefully; I want her here right now!
It's challenging for me to speak from a higher place, "yes; do the
research; check your options; do what's best for you" <em>especially
if it involves coming to Tokyo right now!!</em></p>
