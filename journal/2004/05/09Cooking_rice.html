<p>Last night I bought rice and asked Kaori how to use the rice
cooker.  It's pretty easy.  The only trick that I wouldn't have easily
known is that I have to rinse the rice first.  (I don't know why
though.)  I also wouldn't have known how much rice and water to start
with to make the amount I wanted in the end.</p>

<p>It takes 30 minutes for the rice cooker to cook the rice.  I was
like, "30 <em>minutes??</em>  I'm an American; I can't wait that
long!"</p>

<p>This morning I woke up early to cook rice for breakfast/lunch.</p>
