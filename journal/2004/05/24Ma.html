Live Oak UU Church voted 90 plus to 1 to call me as
their second minister!

The one vote against amuses me--will keep me humble!

Now the fun begins! I'm still not sure whether I begin
officially July 1 or June 1 (as some were hoping), but
I have preliminary orientation to do anyway--learning
about the church building, getting keys, moving into
an office, etc. I might go up once a week for regular
office hours, or by appointment. We'll see!

Love to all,

KE/Ma/Mom

<p>Yay, Ma!!!!</p>
