<h1>Linear Gale</h1>

<p>Call me snobby, but I don't like this ride.  The line is too long
for too short of a ride.  It's a suspended ski-lift type ride, but it
has basically no manuevers.  It's just a squared-U shape |___| with
the platform in the middle.  Magnet-induced launch hurls us forward,
we go up, then down and backwards and faster through the bottom then
up, then down and forwards and not faster through the bottom then up,
then down and and backwards and not faster through the bottom then up,
then down and forwards and slower then up, then down and stop.</p>

<p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh done.  [yawn]</p>
