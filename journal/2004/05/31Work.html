<p>Just had two cool students at work.  Pretty high levels, both.  The
second guy was quickly correctly answering the different questions,
"how many employees are in ANA?" vs "how many employees does ANA
have?"  (given the numbers written in the book)</p>

<p>During the second lesson, over my student's shoulder, I saw Chris
leaving Jiyugaoka for basically the last time.  He finally got his
transfer request to Shibuya.</p>

<p>Next lesson I have Makiko, one of my favorite students who is super
genki with bright eyes and smile.</p>

<p>After that, some student I don't know and then Yasuko, although she
didn't select my lesson this time; I wonder what she'll want to talk
about.</p>

align="left" /> Wow.  What a blessing from Makiko.  She asked me if I
was okay after having been out of work last week.  Although I didn't
know it at the time, she was one of the students who had chosen me and
whose lesson with me was cancelled when I took a couple days off due
to my back being fucked up.  I was like, "oh; did the staff call you?"
She confirmed that they had, and I told her the status of my
back. (much better)</p>

<p>She was like, "I wanted to have the lesson with you so I can get
my picture taken with you."</p>

<p>It was her Level Up Test and she had chosen me!  Just so she could
have our picture taken together for her certificate of having passed
the book.  She apparently studied her ass off; she got 97% correct
(and Robert Dawkins (who did her test) is at least as nit picky as I).
Awesome work!</p>

<p>I was so completely like, "thank you thank you thank you; that is
such a blessing."</p>

<p>I pulled out my cell phone and took our picture together.  She did
the same with her cellie.</p>
