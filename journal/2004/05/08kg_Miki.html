<p>Called KG Miki after work today on the assumption that she would be
in Motosumiyoshi.  She was, so we hung out at a pastry/coffee shop for
a bit to chat.  I offered to exchange computer lessons for Japanese
lessons from her.  She'll let me know if it's cool with her parents to
have me come over to her house.  [[ Japanese "children" in Japan
(Tokyo) often live with their parentals until they get married,
because it's so expensive to move out. ]]  This idea is a bit weird
for me still, having to ask parents, but hey.</p>

<p>I told her, more than anything, I wanted for her to feel
self-empowered.  Miki claims that she can't speak English, read a
map, nor use a computer.  I'm not desperately tied to the results,
but I'd like to help if possible.</p>
