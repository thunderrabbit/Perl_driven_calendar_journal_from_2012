<p>At the same time that I say I dislike being alone, I say I need to
learn how to be alone, and I also pack my schedule with things to do
do do.</p>

<p>Have just spent 45 minutes practicing Japanese with Hitomi,
explaining why I'm such a debacle in relationships.</p>

<p>Have just scheduled myself to practice Japanese with Miki tomorrow
before work.</p>

<p>Have just offered Shufen her choice of Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday morning next week to trade Mandarin for English.</p>

<p>C'mon, me.  Get a backbone and be alone for a little while.</p>
