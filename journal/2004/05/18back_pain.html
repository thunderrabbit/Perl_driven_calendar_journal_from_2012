<p>On the way to work my back was killing me.  Crippling pain forced
me nearly (*) to my knees while walking to the train station.  Something
is fucked up in my lower back.</p>

<p>This happened twice on the way to work and once on the way back.
I called Tomoko to see about her coming to my house tomorrow instead
of me going to her house, and we talked about the possibility of me
going to a chiropractor in the morning instead of us meeting.</p>

<p>I've got a heat thing on my back, and it's been feeling better.
If it feels fine in the morning then I'm not going to go to a
chiropractor right now.</p>

<p>(*) I would have been on my hands and knees except that I was
wearing a suit and didn't want to rip the knees.</p>
