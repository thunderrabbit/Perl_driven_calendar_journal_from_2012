<p>KG Miki came over around 7:30pm tonight to be here when Olivia
arrived.  This might be the only day Miki is able to chat with Liv;
Miki is leaving for Sydney on Sunday, and will be back the day Liv
leaves for London.</p>

<p>We took a nap for a bit while waiting and engaged in a small
tickle fight near the end.</p>

<p>Went to Motosumiyoshi to get Olivia (she had never been to this
apartment before) and arrived just as she was coming through the gates
at the bottom of the stairs.  She came up to hug me and then went back
down to get her stuff; I wanted to help, but simply couldn't with my
back.</p>

<p>The girls' normal walking speed was a bit too fast for my
preference, but I kept up with them.</p>

<p>Chatty chat chat for about an hour before Miki had to go back home.
Olivia walked her to the station, and bought me a bento on the way
back, and then chatachat chat with Olivia until we fell asleep.</p>
