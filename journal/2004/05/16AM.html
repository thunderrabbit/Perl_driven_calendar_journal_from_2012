<p>I had a dream that my glasses broke, and the eye doctor was joking
with me about "do they fit now?" and smashing them up against my
face, knowing that they didn't fit.</p>

<p>No hot water in the shower this morning equals no shower.  Fuck
cold water.</p>

<p>Not electricity in the kitchen equals cook rice in the living
room.  I bet the kitchen and cold shower are related issues.</p>

<p>I got my reminders working again; I had fucked up a query and
rewrote it as two queries.</p>
