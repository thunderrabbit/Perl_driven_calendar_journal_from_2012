<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>My bicycle is still AWOL.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Nakaharaku, near Tokyo, Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>I work for Gaba full time, and have no other sources of
income.</p></li>

<li><p>It takes me about 20 minutes to get to work, including a 7
minute walk.</p></li>

<li><p>I still have and love my Apple Powerbook G4 667MHz with 30G HD
and 512M RAM.</p></li>

<li><p>I have no pets except my cat Spot who is happily living with
Jennifer in Houston.  Each time we email each other (me and Jennifer;
not me and Spot), we mention Spot.  Recently, he found a new box that
he likes to sleep in.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have a car.  (I have an aversion to learning to drive
in Japan; I don't plan to be here forever and I don't want to learn
how to drive on the left hand side of the road. (For this logic to
work, it means I plan to go back to the US, and not settle in OZ or
left-hand-driving European countries.) Fuck messing up my driving
skills in the US.)</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have a girlfriend or even a female friend with
benefits. I'm no longer kissing on Yuuko.  But we're still friends;
she and I are going to a movie tomorrow.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently I asked Sally if she'd like to visit me in Japan (as
part of her graduation celebration) and she didn't seem adverse to the
idea.  I wondered if she and I would hook up if/while she's here, and
I even wondered about me settling with her in sunny Southern
California.  But since the first couple of emails after my invitation,
she hasn't emailed me back.  I know she's super busy finalizing her
thesis and stuff, but there's still a part of me that's like <em>hey
man, why haven't you written me back?</em></p></li>

<li><p>I've got no credit card debt, but I owe like (!)</p>

<p class=date>5:39pm</p>

<p class=date>6:48pm</p>

<p>(!) I got the good idea to shift my finances a bit.  I've got just
over 1000 dollars in my account in the US, but it's below the minimum
balance allowed before they charge 9 dollars per month for the benefit
of their great service.  SO, since I basically don't use that money,
given that all my CC debt is paid, I'm going to transfer 1000 dollars
to whom I'm indebted and move the just over part to my free bank
account (no minimum balance, no fees, <a
href="http://www.wamu.com">Washington Mutual</a>) where I can use it
to pay for my cellphone in Japan.</p>

<p>This idea feels good; it feels right.</p>

<p>Yay.</p></li>

<li><p>Today is/was my first day off work after a 12 day stretch, the
end of which included working during Golden Week, a week with 4
Japanese national holidays, during which many Japanese take the week
off from work.  I hoped a lot of them would take some time to brush up
on their English.  Many did, but not as many as I thought; it's all
good though; I was pretty fuckin' tired on a lot of those days (given
that I didn't really change my sleep schedule to accomodate longer
working hours).</p></li>

<li><p>I've had hints of feelings in my mind about this overall Japan
experience like, <em>okay, this is boring</em> suggesting a desire to
get out of here, and when I thought about going to China, to do the
same thing, but in Mandarin, I was like, <em>oh man; I don't want to
go through all this again..</em></p></li>

<li><p>And as a result of that brainwave in my brain, I had a glimpse
of life-pattern recognition.  Like I realized that if I run off to
China, I'd just be trying to run away from "boringness" here, which
is really a result of what I create, so it would be me running away
from myself.</p>

<p>That's when I started thinking that I need to take more
risks.. not to just make things less boring or more exciting, but to
*do* something.. I can't quite articulate it.  Like in order to do
something amazing for the world, I need to meet more people, get out
and do things that I like to do; find my thing; generate some
positive momentum.</p>

<p>But it need not be (needs <em>not</em> to be) a frantic maelestrom (?)
of activity, but guided, thoughtful actions toward some better
something, that I haven't figured out what that something is yet.  So
how do I get there?</p>

<p>Or, how do I figure out what it is I want to do?</p></li>

<li><p>This past week I didn't really study a lot of Japanese.  I
worked on my student tracker for most of my time off work (and got it
working pretty well), so I didn't really give myself a lot of time to
work.  I hung out with Hitomi for a night and got some practice in
that way.  Overall, my Japanese skill is definitely going
up.</p></li>

<li><p>Jesse and I have been playing hackeysack during many of our
shared breaks at work.  His hackeysack name is Turbo Stall.  Mine is
Dr Kick.</p></li>

<li><p>Carla, my favorite teacher at Kawasaki Nova, is no longer in
Japan, but on a round-the-world trip starting with Beijing. Clayton
went with her for the first part of the trip. I'm really excited for
them.  She was pretty much my last contact with Nova social events, so
I may not go to any more of those.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently I've seen the movies <em>Appleseed</em> (with Jimmy,
great graphics, but not a great story), <em>Kill Bill 2</em> (with
Jimmy, excellent movie), and <em>Drumline</em> (with KG Miki, okay
movie; good drum stuff).</p></li>
