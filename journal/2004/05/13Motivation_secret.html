<p>Yesterday at Miki's house, I noticed there were no beds.  They've
got four people who live in a 3 bedroom house, with one room allocated
for piano and desk.  The other two rooms were void of
furniture. (living room had furniture)</p>

<p>I was like, "where do you sleep?"</p>

<p>Turns out they get out their futons every night and put them away
every morning.  Seeing my astonishment, Miki was like, "it's just
like making beds in America."</p>

<p><em>Making beds, you say?  Very interesting concept.</em></p>

<p>Miki saw my brainwaves and knew what I was thinking.  She goes,
"you're just lazy" and giggled.</p>

<p>This morning, I put my futon away (*).</p>

<p>(*) after vacuuming out the closet.</p>
