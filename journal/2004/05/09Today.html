<p class=date>11:50pm JST Sunday 9 May 2004</p>

<p>Good day at work today.  Had Kozue and Noriko and Mieko and
Masami, four awesome students.   Had 7 other students as well, 2 of
whom were on their last day at Gaba.</p>

<p>After work I worked on my student reminderer, adding a new
dimension of functionality (allowing it to process data that will
describe which students chose my lessons)</p>
