<p>So far today I've made a list of things to do, done laundry,
written 7 mandarin kanji from memory.  Nice.</p>

<p>Next I'll write a ÆüËÜ¸ì diary entry.</p>

<p>Diary was great; I wrote a lot; wrote several sentences that I
didn't really want to write; I personified my hand in the sentences
for use as "he" verb conjugations to describe what I want to do and
what I don't want to do, and what he wants to do and what he doesn't
want to do, and then I wrote all the same sentences in the past, what
I wanted and didn't want to do and what he wanted and didn't want to
do.  Good stuff, hand personification.</p>
