<p>Wow.  I was really surprised and really thrilled to receive a phone
call from Hitomi!  She has arrived safely in Seattle, and was spending
the night alone in a hotel room because her friend has to work
tomorrow or something that I didn't quite understand.  She's
jet-lagged (and therefore awake at 2am Seattle time) and said she
called since she had no one else to talk to at the hotel alone.</p>

<p>What a great surprise.  :-)</p>
