<p>According to David Pogue (as of March 2004), the coolest voice
transcription software is NaturallySpeaking.  I'm looking into buy
that and have found a recorder with the software bundled for about
$120 including shipping to a US address.  The only detail is I would
have to buy a computer that runs windows to use it.  Hmmm.</p>
