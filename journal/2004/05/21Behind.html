<p>Wow; so much to write!</p>

<p>Secrets of success according to Brent, the cat behind <a
href="http://www.tokyoflash.com">www.tokyoflash.com</a>: (!) Think of
a unique idea (@) do it and stick with it.  He suggests that it takes
4 or 5 years, and most people give up at 2 or 3 years.  (#) the big
companies aren't as big as you think, and ($) whether or not they're
big, they're just people, too.</p>

<p>He gave (*) me a good book idea, one that I covet so much that I won't
write about it here until I have something going for it first.</p>

<p>(*) dammit; I broke rule one right there. I didn't think of this
idea.</p>

<p>I went to class today feeling slow, but I'm feeling better now.  My
back isn't hurting as much.</p>
