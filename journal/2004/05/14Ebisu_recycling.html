<p>I decided to walk to Ebisu from Shibuya.  Had never done that
before, but it's only one station on the Yamanote Line so I figured I
wouldn't get lost.</p>

<p>I spent 45 minutes watching guys at a paper recycling place recycle
paper.  I was just enraptured by the imprecise sorting.  Seriously,
for my brain, that's just unheard of.  Incomplete sorting?  Pretty
good sorting?</p>

<p>Coolest thing was watching the forklift driver.  He
was <em>good</em>.  He could adjust the span of the forks, drive the
forklift through any space, and he could *rotate* the forks to dump
stuff into their recycling thing.</p>

<p>Strangest thing is they would dump a load of paper into the hole
with a conveyor belt at the bottom, pull out the inappropriate paper
and put it in appropriate bins.  Okay, that's not strange, but *then*,
as soon all the paper was past the magic slot, they dumped onto the
conveyor the paper they had just pulled off the conveyor!  They must
have had some different bins behind the scenes that were being used to
collect the different types of paper.  It was amazing.</p>

<p>I'm tired.  As I type this it's actually 1am on Saturday
morning.</p>
