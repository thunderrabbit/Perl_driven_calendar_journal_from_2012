<p>Thanks to Fred's input ("You're still trying to write regexes that
wade through HTML.  Stop that."), I'm learning how to use
HTML::PullParser; I need to smurf the source code of one of the
reports at work to correctly input the data, but it's a big hairy
table, with data in one row that labels subsequent rows, and I need
those labels to correctly store the data in subsequent rows.</p>
