<p>Work was pretty good.  10 lessons, though none of my very favorite
students.  Still some nice ones though.  No difficult students.</p>

<p>During lunch, Jesse was like, "let's go," and I came, thinking that
we'd be hooking up a game of Hackey Sack J, but upon arrival outside,
we met his girl instead of play.  Woah.  I wasn't prepared to pay in
money, so I directed us toward a pastry cafe, where I got a single
pastry thing for 120 yen.  Actually Jesse paid for it and I reimbursed
him.</p>

<p>During the meal, I kept agreeing with Takako on different things
like if she said "the" in a sentence, and something else that was more
against Jesse like why would he 'yell' at her about that, but then I
toned it down cause I realized they've got their own pattern down for
the past couple of years; I don't need to disrupt it until I know a
bit more about it.</p>
