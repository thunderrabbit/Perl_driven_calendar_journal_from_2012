<p>I came straight home last night and cried myself to sleep; I felt
really sad after receiving an email from Hitomi that she sent after
reading my long blathering entry that I wrote yesterday, where I felt
like my life is a big load of uninspiring poo.</p>

<p>Very eloquently, she said, "you should change your behavior!"</p>

<p>Yes.  I agree.</p>
