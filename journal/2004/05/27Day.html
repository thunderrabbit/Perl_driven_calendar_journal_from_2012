<p>Tired.</p>

<p>Big fun at Olivia's bye-bye party.  She came back to Japan and will
be leaving soon.  Sat by Dan most of the night.  Enjoyed singing with
him.  I wasn't drunk (but I did drink 3 fruit sours), but I was louder
than normal.  Dan is great fun.</p>

<p>Caught the last train home at 1:03am.</p>

<p>Got home and read this long <a
href="http://www.moveon.org/pac/gore-rumsfeld-transcript.html">article
by Al Gore</a>. there are a few typos, but it's pretty good
overall.  Thanks to Josephine for sending it to me.</p>
