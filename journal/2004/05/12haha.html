<p>I went to 美貴 (KG Miki)'s house to exchange Japanese tutoring for
computer tutoring.  She did quite well with learning how to open
windows, resize them, and switch between windows using the whatsit at
the bottom of the screen.  How interesting for me to see someone so
interested in seeing the technology for the first time.</p>

<p>For some reason, their Internet Explorer doesn't have a location
bar toolbar at the top.  I looked through all the menus (and had her
read (and translate some of) them) in Japanese, fucked around with
dragging the toolbars around, but couldn't get the location bar to
appear.  I resorted to Ctrl-O to pop up a location bar window.  She
said her dad and sister didn't know how to do the location bar either,
so hopefully she can show them something new when they come back
home.</p>

<p>After our tutoring sessions, I stepped outside to look for a
wireless internet signal around the apartment building while she
prepared to leave the apartment.  While walking near the elevators, a
Japanese woman was like, "こんにちは"</p>

<p>and I was like, "HI こんにちは" wondering why suddenly someone
should be so nice to me after 14 months of being ignored by
strangers.</p>

<p>and then she goes, "ロブさんですか。"</p>

<p>and I'm like, "はい。" all surprised that she knew me</p>

<p>and she goes, "ハハです。"</p>

<p>and I'm like "?" and then "美貴のハハですか。"</p>

<p>as she said, "美貴のハハです。"</p>

<p>and I'm like, "そう！" and then "びくりした。"</p>

<p>and I got all nervous until she goes, "はじめまして"</p>

<p>and I go, "はじめまして"</p>

<p>and then she asked me "美貴は"</p>

<p>and then it got a bit difficult, "um,..今美貴は。。"</p>

<p>but she knew the answer and finished my sentence, just as Miki was
coming outside.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>
