<p>I'm on my way to Shinjuku to take my first Mandarin lesson.  I
don't have my computer (because my back still hurts a bit) so I'm
writing this on a scrap of paper to transcribe later.  This is when I
think, <em>wouldn't it be cool to have a recorder that could record my
spoken thoughts and then have them transcribed?</em>  I want to get a
recorder with removable memory so I can record tons (and possibly not
even *have* my computer for weeks (the horror!) and still end up with
a well-filled journal at the end) without running out of memory.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time with Hitomi recently, which was not exactly
on my schedule originally, but we had fun and talked a lot.  I told
her a thing that my dad told me, using trees as explanation.  My dad
drew a picture of two trees; I used kanji.  It described
relationships: if I'm in a relationship like a tree leaning on another
tree, if the first tree leaves (as trees are want to do) (no pun
intended) then the other tree will fall.</p>

<p>That leaning tree is how I used to be in relationship with
Christine, back in my college days.  Now I'm in Japan, leaning away
from all other trees, sorta kinda.</p>

<p>Today, though a bit late after all that talkin', I was
like <em>fuckit, I still got time to do shit</em> and I wrote to Carla
and Colleen, bought a notepad for my Mandarin studies (the notepad
says "when you put the pen nib on this pad,you find out an advantage
of it." (including no space after the comma) which I thought was
perfect to prove that bad Mandarin is better than no Mandarin.  And
researched getting iListen software so I can record and transcribe
instead of type.</p>
