<p>Yesterday, <em>three people</em> asked me for advice on buying a
new computer.  Hiromi, Hitomi, and Lindsey (or was it Rene?).  Hiromi
was my second student at Gaba yesterday; she's been choosing my
lessons for the past couple of weeks now.  Hitomi is a student at KQ
Kawasaki Nova; we've recently been in touch, though I gave her my
email a long time ago.  Lindsey is a new tall cat from OZ (Melbourne)
whose first day at Gaba was yesterday.  Rene has been at Gaba for
longer than me.</p>

<p>Anyway, Hitomi later texted me that she bought a powerbook!  I
called her back, and because she said she had no idea how to use it, I
offered to show her.  If my work schedule is clear this afternoon,
I'll meet her and we'll hook that up.</p>
