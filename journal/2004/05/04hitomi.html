<p>Have been hanging out with Hitomi basically since I got off work.
Showed her some basics on using her computer, basically until the
battery ran down to the red zone (still had 20% charge).  We grabbed
some drinks at 7-11 and have been hanging out in my room since
then.</p>

<p>I was really surprised to find out that she's the same age as me!
And not only that; her birthday is tomorrow (today 5 May), so I made
her a card/letter/note thing including a picture of a black cat trying
to get some grub because (after wondering what in the heck that noise
was) we watched a cat outside trying to get into the garbage for a
tasty snack.</p>
