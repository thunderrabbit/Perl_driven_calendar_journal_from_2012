<p>Aw man, nightmare at work: my student rememberer thing didn't
remember that I had a student, and *I* trusted that it was correct so
I was like, "My name is Rob," and she's like, "I know; we had a
lesson together; don't you remember?"</p>

<p>Oh fuckin' fuck.  The lesson was still cool; I wrote her an
apologizing postcard afterward.</p>

<p>It was actually a double lesson (and she chose me for each).</p>

<p>Two other lessons, both of which showed up correctly as having been
met before.  One of them included "make plans to meet your instructor
tomorrow," as a suggested activity, and kept thinking about Akina and
how she thought we had made plans to meet and I didn't show up because
I had no idea our discussion included making plans.  Anyway, this one
was de-fused; after we made the plans I was like, "I gotta work
tomorrow."</p>
