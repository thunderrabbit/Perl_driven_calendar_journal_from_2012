<p>As part of my plan to *not* worry about messing with my site's
navigation to accomodate new material, I'm just adding a directory for
<a href="/travel/Carla/worldtour2004/">Carla's World Tour</a>.</p>

<p>Carla was my favorite teacher in Kawasaki; the genkiest person
I've ever met.  She's in India now, volunteering at a something
something place.</p>
