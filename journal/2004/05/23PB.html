<p>Oh My God I just applied for PB last night!  Well, I
emailed them to send me an application.  (They need volunteers to
teach English.) They're a non profit organization promoting
sustainable development by visiting communities around the world on a
big cruise ship!  WOW!  I can hardly think of a cooler thing.  I
looked for some bad press on them, but didn't find anything (with a
quick search)...  They cruise around the world in 3 months, stopping
at different countries (many cities that I've never heard
of)...  WOW!!</p>

<p>I'm applying for their 47th Global Voyage</a>.  ¤¹¤´¤¤ special
thanks to Dan for showing me the link!</p>

<p>I will keep applying until I get on one of their adventures.
WOWWWW!!</p>
