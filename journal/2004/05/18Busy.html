<p>Have not written much in the past couple days (written some TR
stories, but not in my journal), so I'm writing.</p>

<p>On the train to hang with Miki for a bit; yesterday at work I had
4 classes in the evening and then James called me and asked if I
would work some classes in the afternoon and then go to Roppongi to
work 3 classes there.  I was like yah no problem cause that's the
kinda guy I am; can't say no.</p>

<p>So he gave me 2 classes at Jiyugaoka in the afternoon (woulda given
me 3, but the last one was at 5:30, and that would leave only 50
minutes between classes (assuming exact stop and start times) to get
to Roppongi, a station I'm not particularly familiar with) and then 3
classes at Roppongi starting at 7:00.  Cool.  Swap a few and turn 4
classes into 5.  Fine.</p>

<p>But *then*, as I was leaving for the day I went to check if I got
any more classes in Jiyugaoka between 2:30 and 5:25, but the 2 classes
had been reduced to 1 class.  Fuck.  Fuckin' hell where did my class
go?</p>

<p>Do I complain?  Will it "help" to complain?  Should I just deal
with what I have and do with it the best I can?  I think that's the
best option, karmically speaking.  (And here's the thing; it's not
easy to tell *who* changed the class; there is someone at every branch
who is able to fuck with the schedule.  I assume it was James or
Tetsuya, but I don't know.)  So I went to Tetsuya and was like "close
my shit out; I'm not coming in [to Jiyugaoka]" so he did, leaving me
with three classes in Roppongi starting at 7pm.</p>

<p>So, I suddenly had my *entire* day free to play (that's today), so
the first thing I did was see who I can hang out with.. Like I'm
desperate for friends.  I texted Miki to see if she wanted to hang out
and help me study Japanese, cause I know I've not done that in a while
(basically since I met with her last Wednesday (not including class
on Friday)), and she texted me back pretty quickly and we coordinated
to meet at 11am.</p>

<p>*Then* I saw that Hitomi is back at home and I want to talk to her
about stuff and things, so I actually would have preferred to spend
the time with her, and I considered trying to either (!) cancel with
Miki or (@) hang with Hitomi after hanging with Miki, but before
work.</p>

<p>Somehow I chose to not try and busy my schedule further; I called
Hitomi and chatted with her for 40 minutes.  I think she's un-angry at
me.  But seriously, this is a fuckin' nightmare that I try so hard to
keep everyone happy with me.  I need some more Slim Shady in me.  Not
too much, but a bit.</p>
