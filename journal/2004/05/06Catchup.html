<p class=date>9:27am JST Thursday 6 May 2004</p>

<p>I'm off today; my first day off after 12 days of working.  After
the very last lesson, for a moment I thought, <em>that wasn't so
bad.</em>  Then, <em>hey man, what are you <b>thinking?</b></em></p>

<p>Thanks to wearing <em>shoes</em> in Japan a lot, I've got
atheletes foot on my right little toe.  Ouch.  When I was barefoot
all the time, that *never* happened.  Silly shod society.  Hitomi
(with her phone (of course)) sent me a picture of what medicine I
should buy for it; I'm thankful for her help.</p>

<p>Jesse and I are supposed to play racquetball today.  I'm looking
forward to it; I haven't run around and played for a long time.  No
ultimate in Japan.</p>

<p>I've got my student tracking program working well enough for me to
clearly benefit from it.  And my 12 day run is up, but it will be
useful starting on Saturday.</p>
