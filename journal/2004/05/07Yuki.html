<p>On the way to meet Íµ»Ò, I saw ¤æ¤­ just as she got on the up
escalator.  I was like, "HI" and motioned for her to come chat.  She
looked different; casual clothes instead of work clothes plus wire
frame glasses.  We asked what we were doing in Kawasaki (shopping and
watching a movie), and I said I would email her, which, this time, I
did.</p>
