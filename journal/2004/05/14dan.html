<p>Fun with Dan tonight.  He invited me to play Hackey Sack Jack with
him; I hadn't in a while (and I had inadvertantly neglected to mention
him in my Rob Update,) so I was glad to have a chance to play.  Dan is
hilarious!  We were doing all sorts of funny stuff, various types of
hits and silliness.  I don't even remember what all.</p>

<p>We tied our world record of 18 hits tonight, and when we played
carefully, being sure to pass back and forth instead of hogging, plus
playing literally closer together, we did a lot better than our
average of 2 or 3 hits.</p>

<p>Around 10:15 we went to the conveni to grab a meal and sat in the
park for a bit enjoying the warm air of Spring.  A kid and her dad
walked through the park, and she climbed on the James Bond rolling
slider thing a bit and Dan was like, "I'd like to have a go at
that." </p>

<p>"Yah, me too; tell that girl to get off of there; we want to
play."</p>
