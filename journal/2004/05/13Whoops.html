<p>On the way walking to work, I realized I had forgotten to grab a
tie.  Usually I use my 5 point method to make sure I have everything,
but Miki texted me and I got sidetracked.  Decided not to go back and
get it; there are extra ties at work that I can use.</p>

<p>Got all the way to the station and realized I was wearing my
sandals.  Checking my shoes is not part of my 5 point method; I've
never forgotten them before.  Usually I leave my shoes at work anyway
so I can just change from whatever I'm wearing to my work shoes when I
get there.  But I forgot to take them off last time I left work and
forgot to put them on last time (this time when) I left home.</p>

<p>I'm glad I live pretty close to the station and that I left in
plenty of time to get to work.  Went back; grabbed my tie and shoes
and came back to the station.  Barely missed a train and am waiting
for the next local train now.</p>

<p>Wow; trains going away from Shibuya right now are frequent and
full.</p>
