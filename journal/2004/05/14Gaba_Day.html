<p>Gaba Day was big fun.  We went to a bar called Zest in Ebisu, where
there's a mechanical bull and several Texas license plates and old
signs and shit, just like janette uses to decorate restaurants.</p>

<p>"Tex Mex" buffet for 3 hours including all our Japanese-Mex
favorites.  Baked whole fish on rice, tiny buffalo wings, little
drumsticks and smokeys, then pineapple and chocolate cake for
dessert.</p>

<p>One thing that I realllly like was a layer cake that was like
really thin layers of like crepe it seemed and then whipped cream or
so holding them all togheter.  REally nummy; I grabbed as much of that
as I could find after my initial foray to the dessert tray.</p>

<p>Keddins was there; he and I had the same orientation and training
for Gaba , and we chatted a lot.  He's working on a presentation thing
for an author or some such; I don't know all the details, but there
will be a party on June 5th 8pm to 5am.  I may got to half or more of
that.</p>

<p>I told him about my rollercoaster book idea and got some positive
vibes in return; I can do this thing.</p>


<p>Marvin DAngerfield (awesome name) the Gaba guy / radio DJ on
InterFM "MCed" the event tonight, getting peoples attention and shit
fto say we would have mechanical bull rides at 4pm.  Those never
happened; the bull was reported as broken around 3:55.  Interesting
that this detail wasn't known previiously.  I wandered a bit and was
surprised that I didn't immediately go whoah an Astros shirt when I
saw a guy wearing an Astros shirt.  I was like, "Mm. Astros." then
"Hey man, *Astros!!!"

<p>He said he was wearing it because he liked the colors.  Fair enough.</p>
