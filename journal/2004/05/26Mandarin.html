<p>Met Shufen.  Went to a cafe on 7th floor of Lumine1 in Shinjuku.
Yammered mostly in English and then she showed me the 4 tones of
Mandarin (plus 1 shortened "tone") and about 5 sentences including 8
kanji.</p>

<p>I recognize some of the kanji from Japanese.</p>

<p>I don't yet know 1) how to type the Chinese kanji on here, and 2)
how to tell my website how to tell web browsers in what language the
characters are encoded.</p>
