<p>13 lessons is tough.</p>

<p>I gave my email address to Chiaki.  I won't have her in any future
lessons; she has 8 lessons left and I'm not scheduled for any of them.
I wonder if we'll hang out.</p>

<p>After work, I rode the train back with Michael, and it turns out he
lives in the building next to mine.  We stopped by the sushi shop to
get 30% off sushi and then the conveni where he got two beers and I
got a liter of OJ.  Pretty cool that he lives next to me.</p>
