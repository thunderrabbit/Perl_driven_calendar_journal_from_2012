<p>Today during my lunch break, I sought the same internet signal
that Dan and I found a couple days ago, and that I found this morning
before work, but it didn't seem to be there.</p>

<p>Wandered about, focusing my search toward apartment buildings and
found a signal within about 20 minutes.  Felt pretty conspicuous with
my laptop out, but here in Japan no one reacts to any weird thing that
anyone does, long as it's not directly detrimental to self or
others.</p>

<p>During lunch I was able to tweak my code enough to get the
add-a-note code working for my student reminder project.  It didn't
work perfectly because the reminders wouldn't show up on subsequent
edits, but I verified they were being saved to the DB.  Good enough to
start.</p>

<p>I wrote little notes to myself for each student I've had recently,
so I can remember a bit of our history, and hopefully remember their
face so I can say HI [name] instead of just HI and duck away.</p>
