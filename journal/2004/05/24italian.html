<p>Went to a pretty nice Italian restaurant with Jimmy tonight.  He
and I talked about my writing and different stories; I told him an
hour long version of the pink elephant joke, and 1 minute versions of
the kid who loved to do dishes, the green golf ball joke, and 7
brothers and 7 sisters joke.  Ten minute version of the koosh
joke.</p>

<p>All this led to a discussion about all the stories in my brain, and
how to most effectively get them written.  Voice recognition
software.</p>

<p>In a ramble about whether it's better to spend time redoing my
website to hold all this new material, or if it's better to buy new
software to redo my website, I decided it was better to just write,
make some dollars, and then use that money to mess with my site.</p>
