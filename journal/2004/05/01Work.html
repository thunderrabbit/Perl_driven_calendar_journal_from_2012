<p>Work was long today.  But I taught 10 lessons, and Jesse and I
hackeysacked to a small audience today.  Awesome.  We've gotten
significantly better than we were when we first started.</p>

<p>He didn't kick the sack onto the roof this time, but he did kick it
onto the awning of the nearby bike shop.  I had several uncontrolled
kicks that put the sack into the pedestrians.  Far more bad kicks than
"usual."</p>

<p>Today before work I set up Jesse and Jimmy with access to the new
student reminder, but Jesse wasn't able to log in. I don't know why;
maybe I mistyped (twice) the password that he wanted to use.</p>
