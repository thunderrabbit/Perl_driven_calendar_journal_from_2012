<p>I woke up still feeling a bit depressed, but better.  I had walked
home last night wanting to scream and hit a telephone pole with my
umbrella and just block the sad feelings.  I didn't even eat last
night; even so, I'm not hungry now.</p>

<p>I felt a bit betrayed by my journal; another case of laying my
truth out into the ether and then being bitten.  Oh well; it's all
part of the process.</p>

<p>Tim wrote me an email saying that my journal helps him.  I hoped
he meant it helps him realize that he's not alone with his own
issues.  Actually, he just meant it keeps him from being bored.  I
guess that's part of the process, too.</p>

<p>Anyfuckingway, I also woke up with the advice (that wasn't even
being delivered as advice; she was just telling me how she made
everyday choices) I received a long time ago from my friend Christina
Branum-Martin.  Basically she said she looks at each decision and
asks if it will bring her more or less happiness in the long run.  At
least that's my memory of what she said; it was probably 8 years ago
that she told me.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, I shall write about Thunder Dolphin.</p>
