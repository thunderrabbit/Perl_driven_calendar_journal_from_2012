<p>This morning I woke up and tried to get up to date on my
finances.  Called Vodafone (cellphone company) about changing my
billing information so they will take funds from a different (Gaba)
bank account.</p>

<p>God bless this woman for speaking English.  But there was still a
disconnect of sorts.  The funniest parts of the conversation,
paraphrased:</p>

<p>me: "I have a new bank, so I need to change my bank information."</p>

<p>she: "May I have your new account information?"</p>

<p>me: new account information, etc</p>

<p>she: "Okay, it takes 1 or 2 months to make the change" (thanks to
Japanese love of processing things meticulously)</p>

<p>me: "Okay."</p>

<p>she: "so until the change, we will still take money out of your
old account."</p>

<p>me: "there is no money in my old account."</p>

<p>she: "in that case, I will send you a bill with payment coupon so
you can pay it in a convenience store or Vodafone shop."</p>

<p>me: "excellent."</p>

<p>she: "can I help with anything else?"</p>

<p>me: "yes; what is the current balance on my account?"</p>

<p>she: "let's see... it looks like we couldn't confirm payment for
your account in April."</p>

<p>me: "Yes; there is no money in that bank account."</p>

<p>she: "and the next bill will be drawn on June 3rd."</p>

<p>me: "there is no money in that bank account."</p>

<p>she: "is there anything else I can help you with?"</p>

<p>me: "no; that's okay."  aka Yes, what is my current balance??</p>
