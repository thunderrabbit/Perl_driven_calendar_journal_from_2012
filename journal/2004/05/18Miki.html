<p>Good fun with Miki.  We met at Cinecitta and noticed several TV
camera stands around and other AV equipment, so we hung out a bit and
ended up being on TV as part of the small audience for two Japanese
men, one wearing a tuxedo, singing some Italian opera-type song with
the other playing amplified accoustic guitar.</p>

dress woman came was filmed coming down the steps to meet them and she
did her interview, of which I understood "San Francisco," and then
they performed for 5 minutes and then were interviewed and greeted by
some other NHK staff-types for a few minutes.  During the last minute,
they had two people holding up flash cards every 10 seconds, counting
down the time.  The one guy was also wearing a big analog clock over
his shoulder, one that was listening to the atomic clock signal being
broadcast from somewhere.</p>

<p>(In the background of the picture, Miki and I are visible above the
final 'a' and 't' of 'citta' on the window.)</p>

align="left"></a>I considered talking to him to see about getting a
job at NHK, but figured realistically he had no time/desire to hire
some random cat off the street so I didn't even pursue it.  Plus, I
don't apparently *really* want a job at NHK or I would have already
put forth some more effort toward that end.</p>

<p>So Miki and I said thanks to him and asked him what was up with the
clock (that had a digital readout in it as well) and he told her about
it.  (I was like, "uh, yeah.")</p>

<p>Grabbed some grub from Circle K and ate outside Starbucks.  Welcome
to Tokyo, eh?  When she was like, "what do you want to do," I was
like, "I just want to hug you until 1:30." (when she had to leave)</p>

<p>Miki corrected some of my diary and helped me practice it.  She
sent some good energy to my lower back which has been really
stabbingly pained for the past day-ish.</p>
