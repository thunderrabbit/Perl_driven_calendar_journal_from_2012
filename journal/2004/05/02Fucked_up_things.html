<p>1) On the way back to get dressed after my shower, I saw the news
about treatment of Iraqi prisoners.  That is a fuckin' nightmare.
Incredibly embarassing, disheartening, ghastly, fucked up behavior.
It made me way not proud to be an American.  What must those soldiers
have gone through to do something so profoundly stupid?</p>

<p>2) I went to the convenience store to get a stamp.  I showed the
cat the letter and said "stamp" in English because I couldn't think of
the word "¤­¤Ã¤Æ" in Japanese.  He proceeded to show me a map of the
address to which the letter was intended.  Dude.  Just give me a
stamp.  I know where the shit's going.</p>
