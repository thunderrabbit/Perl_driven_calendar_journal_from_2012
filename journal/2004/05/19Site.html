<p>I got a link from Ben Batschelet to <a
href="http://www.midaregami.net/weblog/">a website</a> with a pretty
cool interface.  I'm inspired to redesign my site again, adding
functionality by making it db driven.  I've considered putting my
pictures <a
href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/05/07/iphoto_perl.html">in
a database</a>, and now I'm considering putting my journal entries and
other writings in a db as well.  It would make for more complicated
copying to my site (I think), but the extra functionality would be
pretty cool.</p>

<p>That would solve Tim's complaint (and my own) about not being able
to easily navigate my images.</p>

<p>If I do this, I would probably incorporate an actual login for
people to leave comments that aren't anonymous.  I might (!) write an
email verifier thing, but I can probably find one that's already been
written.</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>So it seems this cat's site is powered by Movabletype, a blogging
platform.  My amazement of the site has suddenly gone down from the
perspective of "wow; this guy can write prose *and* code."  I'm not
saying he can't write code, but I'm *guessing* that he didn't write
most of the functionality of the site.</p>

<p>What is my point?  I have prided myself in that I have had a
journal online since before it was cool to do so.  I didn't have a
<em>domain</em> since before it was cool to have one (was it ever not
cool? or just not possible?) but I had a journal online.  [[ it
*might* just be that I had a journal online before *I* knew how cool
it was.  In my mind, this is just as acceptable.  ((I made up the name
Thunder Rabbit on my own, though other people have done the same;
there's a whole game or something that uses that name.  I don't chide
myself for stealing the idea from someone else and then coveting it as
my own; I honestly made it up myself.  (but I didn't make up the words
themselves, dammit))) But I don't think livejournal or deadjournal or
any other blog-helpful software was around before I started.  I don't
think the word "blog" was around before I started. ]]  I like knowing
I wrote all this myself.  (but even that's not true; my brother Fred
wrote a lot of mysterious-to-me regex stuff that makes the indexing
possible on my journal (<em>and</em> where would I be without perl,
written by LW (I'm not putting his name here because I'm not trying
to drop names like I know anything about him; I don't, except that
he's the cat who wrote perl) and the http itself by TBL?)</p>

<p>I didn't write emacs, perl, linux, but I use them as givens.  I
didn't write "I have only succeeded because I've stood on the
shoulders of giants." (or whatever that quote is)</p>

<p>(I *did* write, "It takes longer to live a biography than to read
one.")</p>

<p>Again, what is my point?  Kim Sawyer did a personality test on me
and one of the results suggested that I like to (and am able to) build
my own structure, my own organization of things.  I don't like having
to use an already existing structure.  I guess this, like most things,
has its limits.  I'm happy to use http, emacs, linux, OS X, and I
pretty much have no idea how *any* of them work.  My point seems to be
that I'm hesitant to mold myself to the structure of MovableType
(*).</p>

<p>(*) though from the faq I get that I will have access to the
source code; that makes it more acceptable to me.</p>

<p>I'm going to go cook eggs and rice with spinach, none of which I
made, using pans and stuff that I also didn't make.</p>

<p>It's something ubiquitous like this that I want to make for the
world.</p>
