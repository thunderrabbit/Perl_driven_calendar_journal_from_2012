<p>I lay in bed letting my back heal itself, half sleeping, half
checking the clock for 9am to call Tomoko and be all, "um; no" about
meeting her today.  I called the chiropractor that Jimmy told me about
starting at about 6am.  They apparently open at 10am.  I have an
appointment for 6pm.</p>

<p>Took a hot shower and practiced some yoga poses to stretch my back,
starting with tadasana, the standing pose.  Those seemed to help my
back release some.  Maybe I'll get back into doing those.</p>

<p>My back seemed to get worse after carrying my laundry upstairs and
hanging it up.  Maybe I'll stop doing that.</p>
