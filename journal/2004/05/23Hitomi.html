<p>Been hanging out with Hitomi a lot this weekend.  We watched _Love
Actually_ on Friday night on video.  I thought the movie was a bit
strange for some reason, but also cute and moving at the end.  I was
like, <em>yeah right</em> at the reaction to the kid running through
the airport.  Good plot device with the anonymous passenger helping
that kid get through.  Who was that character?  I don't remember if
they knew each other or not.</p>
