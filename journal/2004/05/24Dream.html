<p>First dream</p>

<p class=dream>I had watched the video before but apparently not very
closely; this time I more carefully watched the the video made in a
car of Hethre, Meg, and Kate, with Susie driving.  In the back seat,
the girls performed music / poetry / heartfelt story telling, and the
camera was sitting in the front passenger seat, alternately watching
them and watching Susie's reaction while she drove.  The girls poured
their hearts into their performances; I was moved to tears.</p>

<p>Second dream</p>

<p class=dream>Sam Malone was broadcasting from outside on a makeshift
soccer field, and pulled together a final call-in contest for the last
pairs of tickets to some super popular show.  The callers had to
simply recite some phrase like, "KRBE has supplied the most S tickets
of any station," and if they said the phrase correctly on the first
try, they got the tickets, and if they didn't, they didn't.  I had
been in Japan, and hadn't heard the phrase before, but it sounded
wrong, like the acronym didn't stand for the right words, so I raised
my hand and was like, "hey Sam; the acronym isn't right" or something,
and he was like, "yeah it is," and it turned out (due to words
changing in dreams,) he was right and I was wrong (but I didn't catch
that I was dreaming).</p>

<p class=dream>I was on the sidelines as the soccer game started, and
I cheered the kids playing.  One kicked a shot that almost made it
into the goal where Sam Malone was goalie, but the ball went over the
net goal.  After a bit, the ball went out of bounds near me, and a
player ran off the field and tagged me into the game as a sub.  I
grabbed the ball and threw it back into the game (both feet on the
ground, two hands over my head) and then joined the fun.  I didn't
know which team he had been on, and if I had known, I wouldn't have
known which direction his team was going anyway, so I just kicked the
ball toward the masses of players to let them play and sort out such
details.  Eventually there came a point where it was important to
know, so I stopped the game to ask, but no one could give me a clear
answer, so I rephrased my questions.  I asked one player which way she
was trying to go, and then asked the masses who was on her team.  This
got a better answer, but when I wanted to kick there was a big tall
net in front of me, over which I had to kick the ball (for some reason
around was not an option), but I was like, "bollocks"(*) and kicked
the ball to one side where it could be kicked past that net.  There
were several such obstacles on the field now, and when we finally got
the ball down to the other goal, the dog (german shepherd, I think)
caught the ball with a bag in its teeth and then brought the ball out
onto the field where I was like, "good dog!  drop it, drop it" until
s/he let go.  We were setting up for another kick or something and I
woke up.</p>

<p>(*) I didn't actually say "bollocks" (or anything) in my dream, but
just now I was going to write "fuck kicking the ball <em>over</em> the
net" and decided not to use the word "fuck."  This is the first time
I've ever used "bollocks," a word I've picked up from the Brits over
here.</p>
