<h1>Thunder Dolphin</h1>

<p>Imagine my surprise; as I stood silently watching the neverending
houses and buildings of Tokyo go by, I saw a glimpse of something that
looked like a roller coaster.  I was like, <em>wtf?</em> and doubted
it could be true.  Waited for the next building to pass for clearer
view.  Holy moly there's an amusement park in the middle of downtown
Tokyo.</p>

<p>I was on my way to meet my friend Andrew, so I chose not to just
jump out and go.  Just; <em>I hope I can go there</em>.  Then I
realized I should put the relevant information in my head: on the way
to Akihabara on the Sobu line, there's a roller coaster.</p>

<p>I got my chance to go some time later, with Tomoko, one of my
students at Nova.</p>

<p>Thunder Dolphin is really cool.  Due to the cramped nature of
downtown Tokyo, space is rarely wasted.  Thunder Dolphin, eager to
have as much track as possible, starts immediately up the lift out of
the station.  (Look left and wave for the camera before reaching the
lift.)  The lift is wonderfully silent, using a cable to pull us up,
and no clanking ratchets.  Wave to people on the nearby ferris wheel
on the way up.  About half the time, they wave back.  At the top, hold
on to your camera, I mean lapbar, for the whooosh and then rocket up
and <em>onto</em> the nearby building!</p>

<p>We course along its length and whoosh down (through a hole in the
facing of the building for effect) and then up and *through* the
previously mentioned ferris wheel!  No time to wave to them now; we
gotta get ready for the *second* picture!  Look right while on the low
fast stretch before we streak back up the building for a second run
along it.  We leap off the building and come abruptly to a halt in the
braking section before rolling back into the station for a round of
applause from the staff and many of the eager riders.</p>

<p><em>Wow; gotta ride that again</em>.</p>

<p>But first, go check out the pictures downstairs.  In another
(genius) space saving technique, the two photos have been merged for
our viewing (and purchasing) pleasure!  The photo attendants put
little tags like "Best Couple" or "Great Smile!" on their favorite
pictures.  Go ride again and think of some funny way to pose for two
cameras on one ride!</p>
