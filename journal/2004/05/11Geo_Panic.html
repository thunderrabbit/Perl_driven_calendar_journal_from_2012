<h1>Geo Panic</h1>

<p>Geo Panic is the underdog of the coasters at Tokyo Dome City.  It's
not immediately visible upon entering the park, and is available only
from the underground complex of attractions, so the line is usually
short.  Two or three trains run at a time, with six seats per
train.</p>

<p>Standing in the middle of the room-could-be-dancefloor, we see two
rather large ducts emerging from, and re-entering the wall near the
ceiling.  <em>Are these part of some futuristic ventilation system?
Why is there a huge hole in that duct?  Are they- hey what's that
rumbling noise?</em>  Suddenly and comically, a chorus of screams
echoes through the room as the coaster rumbles through the duct and
disappears back into the wall.  <em>That's hilarious!</em></p>

<p>We arrive quickly at the front of the line and to our assigned
seats. There's no seatbelt, just a big (and heavy) over-the-shoulder
harness to keep us in place.</p>

<p>Immediately into darkness we plunge and are swept up a lift with
little Christmas lights slowly gleaming, barely adequate to illuminate
the track.  The lights stop and we fall down the first hill.</p>

<p>The ride would be a kiddie ride except that it's almost completely
dark, nearly guaranteeing a few unexpected jostles against the
headrests.  There are a few trick lights and don't forget that we'll
be squealing through the ductwork momentarily.</p>

<p>For such a short line, this ride is great.</p>
