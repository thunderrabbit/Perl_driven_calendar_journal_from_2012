<h1>Fujiyama</h1>

<p>Fujikyu Highland is not the prettiest park in the world, and hardly
the biggest, but it does have the best view of Mt Fuji of any park in
the world, and it has one great coaster: Fujiyama.  In Japanese, Yama
means mountain, and Fuji means... Fuji.  This coaster definitely lives
up to its name.</p>

<p>Waiting in line beside this coaster offers a closeup view of
Fujiyama and a decent view of Mt Fuji behind the park.</p>

<p>In 1996, Fujiyama was hailed as the world's tallest coaster by the
Guiness Book, a boast displayed proudly at the base of the steps up to
Fujiyama's platform.  As we progress up the ramps to victory, we have
a nice view of Dondonpa's speedy launch as it comes blasting out of
the station tunnel for its short journey around the track.</p>

<p>We reach the top of the ramps and find no hidden line; we're next;
this is it!  Throw your junk in the lockers, pile into the seats;
We're ready to fly.</p>

<p>Along the way up the initial lift, signs count our way up to the
top at 79 meters (250 feet?) as we enjoy a grander view of the park
and Mt Fuji off to the left.</p>

<p>The first drop is a slight fake before the real one.  Zoom down and
then way back up all the way to the edge of the park with a fabulous
view of Mt Fuji to the right then down back into the mix for near 90
seconds of thrills.</p>

<p>The coaster offers like 7 seconds of total freefall time for the
back car.  When we near the end, and do the final close-to-the-ground
curve to go back to the beginning, it's REALLY fast. Why? Cause IT'S NOT
OVER! 3 more crazy shake-a-brain humps back and forth like a skater in
a halfpipe and then it's over WHOAH no it's not! one more crazy hump
and Wow. NOW it's over - What a ride!!</p>

<p>Fujiyama is worth the wait.  It's easily worth a two hour wait,
and nearly worth three hours.  I would probably ride it 20 times in a
row if there were no line.  It's a 20 nert (*) ride.</p>

<p>(*) nert - Number of Exclusive Ride Times you would ride the
coaster before becoming bored.</p>
