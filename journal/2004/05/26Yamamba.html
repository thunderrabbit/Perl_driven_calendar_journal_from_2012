<p>Sigh.  I was too nervous/shy to ask the yamamba girl *anything* -
for her picture or HI or anything.  I didn't want to hang out with
her; I just wanted her pic.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I had walked from Mandarin lesson to Yoyogi station by way of the
bookstore where we will meet next week to find a Mandarin book (and I
looked for the げんき 1 workbook (they had げんき 2, but not 1), and
looked at some of the computer books; chose not to buy anything,
including not any of the how-to-be-successful books that I happened
across at the end) and then got off the train at Harajuku cause I
haven't walked from Harajuku to Shibuya in a while.</p>

<p>Due to 'perfect' timing, I saw the most yamamabastic yamamba girl
I've ever seen up close.  I kinda stalked her while she was walking
the same direction as I on the way home; I would keep walking ahead
and then stopping so I could watch her go by.  It's the face that's so
made up; dark skin, white lips, whitely dusted nose, dark mascara with
white around it.  The white around her dark mascara was little dots,
about 50 under each eye.  Turns out she went to my same train line, so
I stood by her in the carriage.</p>

<p>She was picking at a wound on her hand; I chided myself later that
I could have asked her what happened to her hand, and maybe just
maybe that would have made her day brighter so she could talk about
the pain she was enduring.   Or maybe not.</p>

<p>I have her image in my mind; that will have to do.  Oh, the white
dots under her eyes were <em>hearts</em>.  So かわいい。</p>
