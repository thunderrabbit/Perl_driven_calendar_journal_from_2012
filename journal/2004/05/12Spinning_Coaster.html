<h1>Spinning Coaster</h1>

<p>Aptly named, the spinning coaster is a variant of wild mouse traps
that I've ridden before. Each car has two seats back to back, and the
whole assembly spins according to weight distribution while going
around the hairpin turns.</p>

<p>The line is usually short, and is worth about a five to ten minute
wait.  On one occassion, there was *no* line, and I rode it about 5
times in a row.</p>
