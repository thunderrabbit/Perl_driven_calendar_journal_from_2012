<p>Racquetball was really quite fun today.  Fun enough that I think
I'll get a membership at the gym.  It's even pretty close to my house;
maybe a 8 minute walk.  I've never wanted a gym membership because
"working out" is boring as fuck, far as I'm concerned.  But the pickup
game of racquetball we played today was great.</p>

<p>When Jesse invited me, I had assumed it would be just me and him
playing.  (Like I had always done in the US.  Not that I had played a
lot; I think the last time I played was with Maggie near the end of
our college days which would make it 1993 or 1994.)  When we got to
the place, there were all these <em>people</em> there (*) and I was
like, <em>yipes; what do I say?  how do I act?</em> with just a vague
overview of all the rules of Japanese social customs scattered about
my head.  Just before we went into the court where three men were
playing, I was like, "Jesse, tell me the rules not the rules about the
game but about social interaction here," and he was like, "no," and
started to go inside.  Then he was like, "just follow me and stay
quiet."</p>

<p><em>Fucker</em>, I thought, but his advice was pretty much
perfect; I had just been scared for that instant.</p>

<p>Subsequently, I figured out why.  I don't remember ever having
played a game with more than one person in the court.  Once I figured
out the extra rules, it was easy.  The extra rules were easy: line up
in the back of the court and stay out of the way of the ball.  Two
players at the front of the line play one point.  Loser goes to the
end of the line.  Winner serves against the next person in line.</p>

<p>(*) quoting kT, but it's exactly what I thought</p>

<p>The social interactions were even easier.  I don't think Jesse
knows the names of any of the guys who were there.</p>
