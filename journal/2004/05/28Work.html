<p>I had one lesson at work at 2:30 (Shoko, who I've had once before
in March or so) and then a big fat break so I closed all those
lessons, went to Shibuya, and bought the workbook for Genki Japanese
vol I.  And I went ahead and bought the book and workbook for volume
dos.</p>

<p>During the rest of the break, I finished the first 1.5 chapters of
workbook I.  Tomoko checked my answers and made some corrections.</p>

<p>Taught Masashi's last class; I was honored that he said he wanted
me to be his private teacher.  He knows that it's not allowed
though.</p>
