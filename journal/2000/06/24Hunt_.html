<p>Wende and I are on I-10 West at mile marker 751

<p>We passed 631 cars by using the HOV lane.  Awww yeah.

<p>Wende described scenes from the movie <em>Seven</em>.  Ewww.

<p class=date>4:02 pm - mile marker 677</p>

<p>I just wrote a 3 page letter to Bender, my favorite character on Futurama.  Yes, he is a cartoon <em>and</em> a robot, making him twice non-human, but I still asked for an autographed portrait.

<p class=date>5:48pm - mile marker 561</p>

<p>We just passed the car dealership "Red McCombs" !!!  Back in the day, when I was ten or eleven, my parents took Fred and I there to buy a car.  We were in the parking lot and this balding guy came out.  I said quietly, "If that's Red, he doesn't need m'combs!"  My first pun!  My parents were impressed and groaned appropriately.

<p class=date>8:05pm</p>

<p>We have arrived at Sundown Carriage House in Hunt, Texas.  Apollo, the big golden retriever greeted us, expecting and getting lots of lovin'.  Sandra (human), greeted us and introduced herself and Apollo and Hawthorne, their huge great dane.  She showed us around, showed us our room.  Very beautiful overlooking the river.  I wanna swim tonight.  

<p>Before dinner, Wende and I played on the trampoline!   I did relatively great for having not been on one for over a year I think. I did 10 consecutive front flips (from my back to my back), like I used to do in gymnastics.

<p class=date>8:24pm (downtown Hunt)</p>

<p>Shelton is our waiter at Elaine's Table.  Our table overlooks the river.

<p class=date>9:30pm</p>

<p>I ordered chicken and mushrooms something and Wende had steak.

<p>As we were leaving, we saw someone who looked like she might be Elaine.

<p>"Are you Elaine?"  I inquired.

<p>"Did you like your food?"

<p>"Yes."

<p>"then I'm Elaine!"

<p>Upon request, she described the story of the name of the restaurant:  She went to a restaurant and her table was reserved with a sign, "Elaine's Table"  She decided it was a great name for a restaurant!  

<p>(Her version of the story was a bit longer)

<p class=date>later that day</p>

<p>Wende and I lay on lounge chairs on the rock dock gazing up at the stars.  We saw a couple of shooting stars.  She commented about how amazing it must have been to live back in the day and know all the constellations and tell time from the stars.  I told her the stars back then were brighter because there was less pollution, not to mention they were newer back then.

<p>Nice joke, but Wende was too tired to get it.  I explained what I have heard about the ages of stars and the sun and that a few thousand years usually wasn't much time in terms of stars changing brightness.  'cept of course for variables stars, pulsars, and novae.
