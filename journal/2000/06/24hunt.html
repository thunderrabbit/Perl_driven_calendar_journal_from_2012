<p>Right after waking up, I swam across the river, which was pretty freezing at first.. I'm guessing 60 feet across and clamboured up on the rocks.  I walked along the bottom of the cliff which I was unable to climb.  No snakes or spiders, but met one wasp/bee thing who buzzed menacingly near me, but didn't attack me.

<p>While standing on top of a tall rock, ignoring visions of the rock tumbling out from underneath me, I looked for wende across the river.  I didn't see her, so started walking back down.  Soon as I got to shore, she got to the other shore.

<p>Swam across and had breakfast met the peeps and their kids and stuff. 

<p>After breakfast, Wende and I took a nap (otherwise she didn't feel like it was a vacation) and she pointed out we had never taken a vacation together.

<p>Now packing our stuff to go drive around lookin' for places to get married after we jump on the trampoline some.

<p class=date>12:11pm</p>

<p>I did 11 front flips.

<p>At checkout, we talked to Al and Sandra randomly.  He told me about his kids and Wende paid the bill.  $145 including tax for the night.  We asked them about locations of different lodges that may host a wedding.  One place charges $10,000 just for the site, not counting anything extra.

<p>We just reserved all the cabins of a lodge on the river!  This is where Wende's family reunion was held a couple of years ago.

<p>Now that our mission is accomplished, we can go play!!

<p>Rob just cleaned the windshield, intentionally trying to spray the car behind us.  At first, it seemed that it wasn't working but just when we were ready to give up, they switched lanes and turned their wiper blades on.  "It's working, it's working!" Rob cried.  Victory.</p>

<p class=date>9:33pm - 251 miles traveled</p>

<p>We stopped for dinner at Sonic in Colombus - talked about all the small-town-hanging-out that Rob didn't do in Tomball.  We just passed a small truck very much on fire.  Called 911 but they already knew about it.</p>

<p>Home safely around 10:30pm
