<p class=note>(dream)

<p class=dream>Christine showed up in my dream; she had just gotten
married (*) and just wanted to say HI to me.  I had just gotten my
snail mail and was looking through information from the youth office,
including the Con Con mugbook, which we should have recieved some
months ago.
