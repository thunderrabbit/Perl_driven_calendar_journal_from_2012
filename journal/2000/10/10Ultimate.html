<p>I'm out at the ultimate field.  Actually it's called Lawrence Park, but
it's where we played ultimate on Wednesday nights for a long while.  Now
we've been booted from Wednesdays by some people who play softball.  I dno't
know how they get to reserve it more than a week in advance, but apparently
they do.

<p>Right now there's two distinct groups of young men playing soccer.  I
don't know how long they would play without outside influence.   I don't
know if anyone else will show up to play ultimate, either.  Meek and Mike
indicated they would.  But I doubt three people would be reason to kick all
40 people off the field who are currently there.

<p>As I've been writing this entry there is an incessant music box of a
truck tinkling bell soundiing noises with duck quacks and a woman's voice
saying "hello" between the music portions.  It lasts about 15 seconds total.
It's 7:46 pm now so I've heard it that many times already.  There's one
more.

<p>It's like an ice cream van, but it's selling tacos.

<p>Yay!  The van is leaving!  Wait.. it just parked behind me.. doh!

<p class=date>7:49 pm

<p>Yay!  She just left for real.

<p class=date>7:54 pm

<p>nap time

<p class=date>8:32 pm

<p>Voices beside me woke me up.  Bill and Mike talking and James in the car.
