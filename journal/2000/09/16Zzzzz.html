<p>Oh my gosh how can it be 2:12?

<p>I've been transcribing more entries from 1992.  Go look if you want
to read a ridiculous amount about a horny college kid.  I left out all
the juicy details (pun intended) so it's not that exciting.

<p>Wende is <em>pissed</em> (slamming doors) because I'm typing.  She
insists that the typing keeps her awake.  She had been sleeping just
fine with all the doors open, then said, "Peter!  Robbie!  what are
you doing?"

<p>It's cute because Peter is one of our cats.  I'm going to bed now.
