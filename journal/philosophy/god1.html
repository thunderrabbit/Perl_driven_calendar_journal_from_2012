<p>I still have a problem with the proposed nature of
God.  I believe God does not change.  I can change in
relationship to God, but God is perfectly eternal
and loving to me.  God's relationship to me never
changes.

<p>I think it's the same for Adam and Eve.  Actually I
don't think any of that original sin consequences
could have happened with an eternally perfect and
loving god.  I believe God cannot diss anyone, cannot
reject anyone, cannot be mad at anyone, cannot even be
sad for anyone because God knows.

<p>God knows that we humans are each experiencing life
and once we croak, we will leave our pain and
suffering behind.  If we experience pain, the joy
will be that much greater upon completion of life.

<p>Can God make a rock so heavy that God cannot move
it?  Yes.  God says "Okay, here is a rock that is so
heavy that I cannot move it."  We all push and tug
on the rock, and sure enough, it doesn't move.  God
watches.  The rock doesn't move.  God pushes the rock.
 It does not move.
  
<p>Then we say, "God, will you move this rock?"  Yes. 
God moves the rock.  God creates reality with God's
intention. 

<p>This is the same question as the light particle
thing.  Where is the light wave?  It's wherever you
look.

<p>Is the rock too heavy to move or is it not too
heavy to move?  Yes.

<p>So if God intends that we are all perfect, then we
are all perfect.  If God loves us, then God loves us. 


<p>The dichotomy is that on earth, in this life,
in these bodies, we have free will to do anything we
want.  We can play, fight, kill, conceive, create,
destroy.

<p>In the next life, we have free will to do anything
we want.  When we slowly strip down all the outsides,
all the physical body, all the emotional baggage, all
the fear and sadness and anger, we feel more and more
joy; we merge with God.  God loves us and we are one
with God, just as God plans.
