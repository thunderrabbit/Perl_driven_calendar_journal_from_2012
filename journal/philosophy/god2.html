<p>I started reading the bible not to become a
believer, but to see what all the fuss is about.
Marcel encouraged me to read it. A bunch of people
quote from it. And in religious debates, I'm at a
disadvantage if I don't know what other people are
working with.

<p>But as I'm reading, I haven't been impressed yet.  
Of course, I'm only at Exodus 19 or 20...

<p>The whole concept of the Israelites (did I spell
that correctly?) being God's chosen people is silly to
me.  That statement in the book is a big alarm that
the whole thing is anti- everything I believe about
God.

<p>Freedom of choice is actually simple to explain. 
It depends on the viewpoint:

<p>We can see the present (actually we have an
impression of what happened .05 nanoseconds ago) and
we remember the past.  We choose not to see the
future.

<p>God sees the present, the past, the future.  If God
is omnipotent, then God must see everything.  Not only
must God see everything, God must know the location of
every electron, quark, boulder, thought wave, light
particle, etc etc etc and knows their velocity, their
spin, and knows where they ever were, knows where they
ever will go, etc etc etc.

<p>We have our senses filtered so that we don't have
sensory overload.  We just can walk around and
remember things and feel our emotions and talk and
stuff.  Very simple life.  We have freedom to choose
and God knows what our choise is. God doesn't affect
our choice.
