<p>I actually literally believe there is no sin.  

<p>oooooooh  I just realized something. 

<p>Okay.  I actually literally believe that God will
always love us and welcome us no matter what we have
done or not done.

<p>This can be rewritten as  "when we die, we will go
to heaven even if we did 'evil' things on earth."

<p>or even "Everyone, no matter what goes to Heaven."

<p>This belief is a result of be believing that God
loves us all 100% forever and ever amen.

At the same time, I believe that we can choose things
that are more helpful in our lives than other things. 
I can choose to go to work each day and give all my
money away.  I can choose to throw my computer monitor
out the window.  I could have chosen to jump from the
9th floor.  I can choose to drive on the wrong side of
the road, go purchase ice cream, give all my lovin' to
Wende, count days instead of years, kick the dog and
step on the cat, listen to Maraih Carey, ride my
unicycle to work, stretch, eat cereal, bite my nails,
write journal entries.

<p>Some of the things in the list above will help
guide my life experiences to a more love filled and
happy place.  Some of the choices above would bring
negative feelings into my life.  I mostly choose to do
the things that bring happiness into my life.  Often,
I choose the things that bring instant gratification
happiness into my life.

<p>It is my belief that we can choose to do anything. 
No matter what, God loves us.  However, our experience
can be more love filled if we choose certain things
over other things.

<p>This gets into a whole karma discussion.  Do our
deeds add up?  Do they multiply and come back to us 3
times greater?  10 times greater?  Some say yes.  I'm
not sure.

<p>But I would imagine the construct something like
this.  If we do things that make us truly happy and
love-filled, then we emit joyful energy and other
joyful energy is attracted to us.   I consciously
choose to hang out around Molly because she is joy
filled and I want to be joy filled.  If I allow
myself to be joyfully energized by the Infinite
Universe, by God, then my joy glows around me,
attracting other joy around me.

<p>This can explain how good deeds come back to us. 
Good deed equals joy equals happy things come back.

<p>I don't know enough to speak about Jesus.  I
believe he was a joy filled man and others followed
him.  I certainly believe that he did not intend to
create a religion.  I have believed for years that
religion develops when people try to emulate someone
who is spiritually connected.

<p>They might say "Oh my gosh, that person is so
peaceful and great.  I'll do what that person doing." 
 That person does many things we can *see*, but what
we do not physically see is the positive energy flow
from the Universe into the peaceful and great person. 
The person is peaceful and great because the person is
infinitely filled with love and energy from the
universe and therefore does all this great stuff.  

<p>A frantic effort of actions in a hope to be like
that person by doing stuff doesn't necessarily allow
that flow of Infinite love to enter one's being.

<p>I can certainly believe that the Jews were all "Rah
Rah us!!  Go God!!!"  if they were on a winning
streak.  I don't believe that God maliciously 
brought plagues to the Egyptians.  The plagues may
have come, but I cannot believe that God is ever
malicious.  I more easily believe that space aliens
from elsewhere caused the plague.  Space aliens could
have egos and be malicious. Not God.

<p>I can certainly believe that people believed they
might be unclean if they hang out with certain people.
 We believe that now in this culture.  Don't
hang out with the druggies, or the _______, you might
end up like them. 

<p>*Do* hang out with winners and successful people. 
You might end up like them.
