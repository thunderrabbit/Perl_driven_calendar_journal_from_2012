<title>Almost out</title>

       5am Wednesday 12 March 1997
<p>
While reading, I fell asleep physically at about midnight with the light on.
At about 3:30 I woke up, turned off the light and listened to my Focus 10 audio
tape.  (Focus 10 is the state of physically sleeping, while the mind is awake.)
I fell entirely asleep during quiet portions of the tape, and my brain woke up
when Robert Monroe's voice was on the tape.  My brain began to wake up more and
more until I was fully conscious as my physical body was asleep.  I had fully
reached Focus 10.  Yay!
<p>

I could feel my astral body gently lifting itself out of my physical body. 
The sensation was something like I was fully conscious, but somewhat losing
sensory input from my physical body.  I also felt the tingly vibrational 
feeling that I've learned to associate with projection.  Each time, I thought
"wow!" and then the sensation would subside as my astral body gently rejoined 
my physical.
<p>

I did not get any further than that, but the experience represents a great
step along the way to full projections....
