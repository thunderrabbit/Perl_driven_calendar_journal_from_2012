<title>Legs above head</title>

         8 March 1997
<p>

This experience happened after my sleep schedule had gotten pretty crazy after
I stayed awake most of the weekend.  This is transcribed out of my diary.
<p>

4AM Monday 10 February 1997
<p>

I just now almost astral projected.  I was dreaming about my apartment, but
not this building and people outside that I did not really care to talk to.
I was floating around my apartment, circling around it and then I may have
kinda noticed I was dreaming, but I don't think so.  Then I mentally said,
"protect this apartment" and I began to seal it in a mental protection in
my dream.   Then I heard something in reality and partially woke up, thinking,
"okay- where am I?"  I knew I was in my apartment, so I silently tried to
remember what it should look like when I woke up and then I suddenly noticed
my legs were bent at the waist and were pointing straight up above my head.
<p>

My consciousness tried to grapple with this reality, and I felt like something
was not right.  But absolutely, positively, my legs were way above my head.
I was scared, wondering how to get them to go back down, when suddenly I
realized I was doing it.  My astral legs had projected out of my physical body!
<p>

I was excited, yet tried to remain calm so I wouldn't wake up all the way.
<p>

I pushed a bit, moving my legs further out of my body until my torso was mostly
out.  Vibrational rushing sound/sensations became more intense throughout my 
body as I pushed.   I basically was entirely out of my body, except my head
was stuck.  Hmmm.   
<p>

I relaxed a bit, and my astral body drifted back toward my physical.  I tried
to squirm out again, but again, my head seemed stuck.
<p>

Then I noticed that my physical teeth seemed to be biting the inside of my 
mouth.  Hmm.   So I moved my physical mouth, thinking this may be why I
couldn't get my head out.  
<p>

By moving my physical mouth, the experience gently ended.  I could feel my 
astral body snuggle safely inside my physical body, all of which felt tingly 
all over.  
<p>

Happiness.  I had done it.  
<p>

The proof to me is that it felt so *real*.  My legs were above my head.
No one can convince me otherwise.  The other thing is that the transition in
consciousness from astral projection to physical reality was smooth.  My
thought patterns were continuous with no missing gaps.
<p>

Yay!
