<title>Jump into Suzanne</title>

<p>

My first astral projection that I remember occurred on Monday 12 June 1995.
I only know the date because it's in my diary.  This story is transcribed 
from what I wrote immediately after my experience.
<p>

3:10AM Monday 12 June 1995
<p>

I dreamt I drove into my driveway and I looked behind me and my other car
was there where I had just been.  I was scared at first, then thought this
must be a dream.  I put the car in park and it said '&X' or something where
it should say 'P'.  I turned the ignition off, wondering if this was important
in dreams.  I totally knew it was a dream when part of my brain tried to tell
me it was real, and that I shouldn't test my dream state.  So I tried to fly
and I almost did but didn't.<br>
Then I put the car in park and took my seat belt off, and it unclicked on 
both sides and I climbed up to Suzanne's (my neighbor) and tried to knock
on the window and call her name.  But I couldn't so I reared back and did a 
leaping leap through her wall and landed in a heap on her bed.  She stirred
a little and then I was by her feet and I turned around and dove into her
body.
<p>

I saw her skull as a fell into her body, then, for an instant, I saw eternity-
I was aware of the entire cosmos, and it scared the crap out of me.
<p>

I shoooped back into physical reality, calling in a deep deep voice (resulting
from my physical body being perfectly relaxed) "oh my god oh my god" and I 
woke up in my body, and could feel that I had not moved a muscle.
<p>

My legs were amazingly tingly, a sensation that went away after a few moments
while I mentally rewound the experience to make sure I would not forget it
when I tried to write it down.
