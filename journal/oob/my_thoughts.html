<title>Rob's thoughts on OOBEs</title>

I believe there is more to this existence than going to work, watching TV, 
eating junk food, and trying to accumulate wealth.  In fact, I believe
there is more to this existence than the entire physical cosmos as we know it.
I believe that we each have a latent ability to access other planes of 
existence besides this physical plane.
<p>
I believe that dreams sometimes (not always) result from our non-physical 
selves leaving our physical bodies and hanging out with other non-physical 
bodies and beings.
<p>

I further believe that properly trained, we can consciously safely leave our 
physical bodies and consciously interact with others in such non-physical 
planes of existence.
<p>

Some years ago, I decided that by seeing the world from a different perspective
(like the square seeing Flatland from a 3rd spacial dimension) I would have a 
greater insight on what I am supposed to be doing here on earth.
<p>

At that point, Out Of Body Experiences (OOBEs) seemed like such a nirvana to 
me- the ultimate in the coolest of the greatest things in the world, er.. 
out of this world.
<p>

A friend of mine carefully listened to my enthusiasm, and replied gently,
"you will achieve astral projection; in fact you will even find it to be
'ho hum, not such a big deal.'  However, what I see now is that you need
to be patient."
<p>

Patience has not always been one of my most outstanding qualities.
<p>

In March 1997, on the week including my birthday, I attended a class
called <i>Gateway Voyage</i> at 
<a href = http://www.monroe-inst.com>The Monroe Institute</a> in Virginia, which specializes 
in helping people achieve altered states of consciousness, including (not 
guaranteeing) out of body travel.  They do this without the use of drugs,
using only sounds and verbal suggestion as tools.
<p>
I attended the class <em>expecting</em> to experience astral projection, which is exactly what did not happen.
<p>
Patience.
