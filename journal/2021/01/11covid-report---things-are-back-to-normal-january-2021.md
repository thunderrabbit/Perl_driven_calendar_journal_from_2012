Though Tokyo is officially in a lockdown, a certain retailer with
cafeteria is open and busy as ever.  There are some platic sheets between
some tables, and free plastic gloves and alcohol available to keep
things clean, but hundreds of people eating all around me.

Lin and I came out to buy a couch for her room because the current
"couch" (foldable futon bed thing) makes it "too hard to stand up."

I wonder how long it will be until the new couch makes it too hard to
have a bed in the room.
