A couple days ago I saw an article about how to write my own text editor ["kilo" in just 1000 lines of C](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/).

Fully knowing that it's not something that I really want to focus on, it's something that I focused on yesterday (late last night).  It was fun!  I got through the first page and most second page, setting up all of the flags that enable Raw Mode... Basically turning off interrupts and stuff, by catching all of the control key combinations.

The next section was a bit too confusing for my sleepy brain to understand last night, so I might look at it later.
