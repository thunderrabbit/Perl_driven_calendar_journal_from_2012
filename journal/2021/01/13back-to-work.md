I'm headed to JB School today for the first time in a month.  Looking forward to seeing everyone and to the excited Happy New Year energy.

I just checked my bank account and see I'm $1300 (130,000 yen) behind on my bills for this month.

Probably need to get busy doing both AB and more workshop promotion.

I'm happy I just now perfectly caught the train I wanted after leaving my house late.
