SOGO was officially cancelled today so I invited a few people to join,
including Anuj and Lin, both of whom attended today!

Anuj was on time while Lin and I were 10 minutes late, arriving at
10:10am in Yoyogi Park.  We got started shortly thereafter, doing a
variety platter of exercises for 30 or 45 seconds each with short
breaks in between to think of the next exercise.

Julien, Mariia, Larry, and Naruto joined after a while and amped up
our game a bit by stacking up three exercises at a time to do before
thinking of the next set of three.

At 11:20am we decided to go for 10
more minutes before Lin, Naruto, and I stopped for a snack while the
rest of them went for a run around the perimeter of Yoyogi Park!  Anuj
and Mariia did one lap then joined us for a seat.  Julien and Larry
did two laps!

Fasting today, Anuj went home while the rest of us walked to Kaffir
Lime, a Thai restaurant in Harajuku near Cat Street.  Nice convos
about travel in Japan and hiking / skiing trips.  Julien said he can
hook me up with friends and family price on Columbia Sportswear for my
walk to Niigata.  Super great to receive such a nice gift!

We headed out and ate chocolate in B1F of a building with MOMA Store
on 4F, then went up to 5F of the building to see the cafe above MOMA
Store.  Nice view over Omotesando street, but quite chilly.

##### 14:31

Julien had to go so we said bye the Lin and I jumped on the train via
the first Meijijingu Mae entrance.  Super glad to hear her and Naruto
planning to join SOGO next week!!

##### 15:43

We got to our station before I realized I had left my jacket in the
Thai restaurant.  Lin headed home and I headed back to pick it up.

##### 16:22

Nearly back at Noborito now, so a bit over a 1 hour round trip.  Great
time to write in my diary!
