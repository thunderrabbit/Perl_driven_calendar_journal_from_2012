<p class='dream'>We went into the church and they had scaffolding
inside as part of the support structure and I saw one of my friends go
in but then I couldn't find her.</p>

<p class='dream'>I went up to another area and also looked for her but
didn't find her and then went outside the entire church and up on top
of a rocky cliff way and on the way back down crossing some railroad
tracks.</p>

<p class='dream'>A train started coming and the railroad crossing
guard went down so I looked for the train and waited for it to come
by.  It was coming from the left before I crossed the tracks and I
just crossed the tracks and turn around look to the right and I waved
to the train guy and he whizzed by very quickly and quietly.</p>

<p class='dream'>I went the rest of the way down the hill and back
into the building turn left to go back into the building and they were
taking down the scaffolding from the bottom and I went to my friend
and asked if I could help and if there was any rhyme or reason or just
take everything down.</p>

<p class='dream'>She said "go with your heart; it will all work out."</p>
