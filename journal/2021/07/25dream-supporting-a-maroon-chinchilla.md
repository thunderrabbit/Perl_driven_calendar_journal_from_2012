<p class="dream">
I was in school in a new class and talked to a man about Mankind
Project and there was another student in the class who had done
Mankind Project so I invited him over to talk about the
organization. The second man mentioned some good things but then a
young man came over and had had a less good experience and I didn't
understand the details but I could tell he felt sad and then someone
laughed while listening to his story so I said "let's give him some
space" but then the teacher came into the class so we had to
prioritize the class. Instead of attending the class, I offered to
listen to the young man outside to support him and by the time we got
outside he was a small maroon animal like a chinchilla.  He didn't
tell me much of the story but he cried and I just had one hand on his
shoulder while he was crying. We were there for quite some time and
another man came out presumably after the class was finished and he
saw me.  He held space and was there to support me if necessary and
then the maroon chinchilla was saying he wanted to stay with me and I
said he needed to go home tonight but I didn't know where his home was
so he said he normally slept on a shelf and if he could find a shelf
it would be great so I took him to a shelf and he immediately began
purring sleeping and I was completely crying that I didn't really know
how else to support him besides just giving him the space to talk and
share as needed. I left him there sleeping and purring so I could talk
to the other man who had come out and as I begin to tell him what
happened I woke up.
