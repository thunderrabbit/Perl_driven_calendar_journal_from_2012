Nice nice nice

Tonight I got my old journal code working under the same username as
now runs my robnugen.com site.

As of now, my old journal setup may be seen at
https://temp.robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl

Also as of now, the final few entries were written in markdown, so
the journal.pl code does not know how to display them.

I found https://web-stage.metacpan.org/pod/Markdent::Parser which is
up to date, but I am too tired now to figure out how to install it,
much less use it.
