About 9 years ago, my journal (and website) looked like this

[![2021 july got old journal
working](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2021/thumbs/2021_july_got_old_journal_working.png)](//b.robnugen.com/journal/2021/2021_july_got_old_journal_working.png)

I love the calendar on the left hand side.

It's time to get that calendar working again.
