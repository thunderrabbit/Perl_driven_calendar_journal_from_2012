I don't think I wrote about this last night.

While walking, I met Martin for the first time.  He has lived in our neighborhood for over 20 years.  I haven't even been in Japan that long.

We talked for about 5 to 10 minutes and at one point on the live stream I saw 2,200 people watching.  That's certainly a new record for me, so it was quite interesting.

Then after I continued walking a bit, I saw Yoko, who I have met before a few times.  She took a few of my cards to give to her peeps.

Headed home after that and signed off along the way.
