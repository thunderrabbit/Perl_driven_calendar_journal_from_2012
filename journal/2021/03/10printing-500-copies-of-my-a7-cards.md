I am at Kinko's in Kawasaki where the guy just helped me lay out the
cards that David made.  8 per page and printing 500 cards total for
about 10,000 yen.  After the printing started, he mentioned that an
online printer would be less expensive LOLOLOL thank you for letting
me know!  But anyway, I am excited to have the cards and start handing
them out.

When I got on Nambu Line there was one seat so I sat down and
recognized the person to my right was not Japanese so I greeted him
and pulled out my cards, "I just printed these..." and thereby met
Kumar, who is *writing two books* about suicide prevention!!

So inspiring that he said he was inspired to finish his books after
meeting me.  We got photos together and I told him his work is **so**
important.  Thank you Kumar for supporting this important work!
