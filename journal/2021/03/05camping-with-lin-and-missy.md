Sitting under our tent awning with fire crackling in front of me, feet
resting on a slice of dry log facing the fire, I'm happily sitting
between Lin and Missy as I write this entry.

They are joking about Blair Witch movie compared to us sitting here
with an electric outlet behind me, toilets with heated seats about 200
feet away.

It feels to be about 5 degrees C to me.  Sky is nearly dark but not
completely so.

Earlier today I did a bit of a livestream on /r/whereintheworld via
RPAN.
