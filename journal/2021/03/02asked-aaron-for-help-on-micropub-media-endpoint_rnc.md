    HI Aaron
    
    I have set up Quill (with changes [0]) at
    https://quill.plasticaddy.com/ which can post to my journal on
    robnugen.com [1]
    
    I want help getting my media endpoint working.  If you are willing, I
    can send some money your way for your time.
    
    I was able to get an image embedded in a post via Quill, but instead
    of saving the media in my website's otherwise-all-text git repo [2]  +
    journal entries [3], I want to save images on my dedicated server [4].
    
    * I am using Hugo to generate my site.
    * I am hosting my images on a separate server [4].
    * I like human readable image file names [5] and want to continue doing so with Quill / Micropub (media endpoint)
    
    Could you spend some time looking at it with me via Zoom or
    something? We can ssh to my servers together (given your public
    key).
    
    If you can do it, I will spend time with you to answer questions and
    show you the current setup.  Maybe it's a quick small fix!
    
    I am writing to you because I have been banging my head on this for a
    bit and want to get it done before April 15th.  At that time I will
    start posting pictures from the road during a pilgrimage I will be
    taking [6].
    
    Thank you for Micropub and Quill; thank you for your time reading.
    
    If this sounds good or intriguing, please let me know your
    availability or find a time on my calendar
    https://calendly.com/robnugen 
    I live in Japan, so if there are no good times on my Calendly, I
    will adjust to your schedule.
    
    blessings
    Rob
