<p class='dream'>I started walking after packing for my walk and once I got to the train station, I realized I forgot my tent so I had to go back and get it but wasn't sure if I would have time to make my train after getting the tent.</p>

<p class='dream'>I wrapped a velcro strap around everything to hold it all together and was able to get the velcro to just reach around.</p>
