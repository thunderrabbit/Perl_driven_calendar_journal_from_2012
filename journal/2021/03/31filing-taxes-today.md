Last year I had to wait until July to file.  This year they got the shit sorted.  I arrived today unannounced and just had to wait 15 minutes before they let me in to this maze of corridors created with standing partitions and plastic sheeting hanging above.

No one else in the few chairs near me, but plenty of voices around; I can hear about three or four conversations happening, including someone on a phone call.

Now standing at a table, ready for my supportive volunteer tax person.

Headed home to sort my expenses by categories.

Back with my computer and expenses sorted by category.  Also good to have my computer to calculate how much I can claim for my computer.

Headed back home again to get my medical receipts but apparently I threw them away.  Came back empty handed but quickly finished my tax filing in Japan. Yay!
