Although I haven't updated the route in a couple of days, it's all but complete on my localhost dev site.

after plotting several relatively short days through the mountains I needed to catch up the mileage and ended up having to add an extra stop near the end because I ended up with a 30 km day after walking through the mountains.

(Is that even a sentence?)

I had to move back the last two reservations by one day each.  The last one is Hotel Googoo, which I just had to use because of its funny name.
