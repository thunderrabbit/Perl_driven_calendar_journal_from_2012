Last night Missy came to our place to chill and celebrate Babychan's
birthday!

On the way home from SCC, I bought six pens from a ファミマ near SCC
and six scoops of ice cream from サーチィワン (sp).  The ice cream
went over well, but when she saw the pens, Babychan was like "what's
this?"

Haha I guess when she said なつかしい and "wow it writes so
smoothly!" when she saw the one I got.. did *not* mean she might
actually want one for herself.

Great time talking until late.
