These are from 24 March, adapted from LINE conversation with a friend.

#### 13:34pm Wednesday 24 March 2021

Looking for my computer in kawasaki.
I put my bag down somewhere after leaving an Italian restaurant.

We left the Italian restaurant and I left it in the restaurant. As we were leaving the waitress brought me the bag.

We went from the first floor up to the second floor via elevator and the restrooms are not there so we went out to the third floor I took the stairs because it's only one more floor.

Lin has apparently checked the stairs but I might go back and check as well.

On the third floor there's a restroom; I went to the restroom and don't remember having it when I came back out but 99% sure I must have had it when I went in.

I checked all the restroom stalls and don't see it in there.  After the restroom we walked a curvy sidewalk root in Cinecitta from the third floor to the ground floor and we said bye-bye to Lin's aunt near a pet shop and escalators and I just asked to pet shop but they don't have it.

I've already talked to the local security of the Cinecitta. They did not apparently have one for the specific building.

It was less than 10 minute time. So I'm 99% sure it was in the bathroom.

Lin and I went to a police box and Lin filed a report there while I went back and retraced my steps again even more carefully.

#### 14:32

Lin came back to help me look, and called the number of Cinecitta security.  It was there in their lost and found.

Lin and I are going to get coffee now.
