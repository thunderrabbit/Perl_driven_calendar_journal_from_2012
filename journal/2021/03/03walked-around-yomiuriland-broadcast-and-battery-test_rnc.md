Getting back into walking after the chili winter I walked near the local amusement park and actually did a live stream on Reddit to test the battery on my phone I was able to livestream for 1 hour and 40 minutes I think ðŸ¤”

That was 30 minutes for the first live stream 25 minutes for a zoom meeting and then 45 minutes for the next Reddit live stream.

I'm posting this with quill and have 4% battery on my phone at this point it's 8:54 a.m. right now and I'm walking back home for me at 10:00 a.m.

One of the next tests I'll do is to have fully charged phone and fully charged portable battery to see how long we can live stream under those circumstances.

In tests I've seen the battery charge the phone fully twice plus some left over but I've never done it all in one day so that'll be interesting.  Also interesting to know how quickly that battery itself can be recharged.
