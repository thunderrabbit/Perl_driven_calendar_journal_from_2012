In preparation for my walk, I've been doing live streams on Reddit.

https://www.reddit.com/u/robnugen

I've been doing them just about every morning from around 6:00 a.m. to 7:30 a.m.

during my walk which will start April 16th, I plan to do longer live streams from like 8:00 a.m. until lunch time, pending battery life for my phone.

so I'll probably do a long live stream tomorrow while walking maybe from here toward Shinjuku.  Dunno how far I'll make it.
