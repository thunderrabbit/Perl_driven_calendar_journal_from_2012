In seven minutes, my Tlon onboarding session should start.  I
scheduled it over a month ago, and they created a planet for me as of
48 minutes before the meeting is scheduled to start.

I am logged on to the planet in Landscape, and everything seems fine.
Just started this journal entry to keep track of what I learn.

(PS, I asked them if I can use the planet I already own but no answer
on that yet.)

I forgot to come back to this to write notes.

The onboarding was quite smooth, with three attendees, and some
prefilled invites to message boards and a community-made directory
