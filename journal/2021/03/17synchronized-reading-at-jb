Completely unknown to my students, today is St Patrick's Day in some
parts of the world.

Four lessons today at JB included a page of text with two sections:

    My father is wearing a polka-dot tie,
    a striped shirt, and black pants.

    Missy is wearing a yellow skirt,
    plaid socks, and black shoes.

Because there were only two sections of text, and we had generally
whizzed through stuff too quickly before, I had my six students each
read a single word in sequence.  This required them to pay attention,
read each word, pronounce each word multiple times.

By the time our hour was up, they were just about able to do the whole
thing with no mistakes.  Nice!
