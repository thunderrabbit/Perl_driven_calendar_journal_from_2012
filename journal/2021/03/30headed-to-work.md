Since lockdown is over I have a lesson in the afternoon on Tuesdays.  It takes up way too much of my time to be very happy about it but for some reason I just can't seem to bear to tell my boss to find someone else.

I believe the school has been having a hard time finding teachers, and I don't want to add to that burden.

I know in my brain this is a false judgment that doesn't serve me but I still can't shake the feeling.

If I give two or three months notice I think that should be fine.
