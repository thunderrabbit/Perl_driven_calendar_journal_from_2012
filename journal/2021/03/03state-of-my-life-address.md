1. I plan to walk to Niigata from Yokohama over 23 days starting April
16th.
2. Support has been flowing in, from money, to card design, to
translation work, to all my hotels being paid by anonymous donor.
3. I emailed aaronpk to see if he will help me tweak Micropub.  If he
does not reply by Friday, I will probably look on IRC.
4. We have mice in our house.  A guy cut holes in the ceiling so they
can put sticky paper down to catch the rats.  I am sad they will
likely die and wish Lin and her mom would agree to other ways (ignore them
/ use live traps)
5. I forgot my socks when leaving for JB today so I bought socks on
the way from Kawasaki station.
6. I broadcast 75 minutes' worth of livestream on RPAN today in two
segments, separated by my 7:30am meeting (Design Your Day)
7. The second broadcast featured me walking around the back side of
Yomiuriland, back near Crazy Hyuuuuu Stonnnnn and the bunjee jump.  I
was able to get all the way back to the front of the park before
needing to hang up due to low battery.
8. With 4% battery, I wrote a couple of journal entries with Quill and
Micropub, but I did not publish them.
9. Today was the first day in a year without Aoi or Ayaka in the
lessons.
10. Today I taught three boys (one of whom is rowdy) in first lesson, then taught
4 girls and 2 boys (one of whom was rowdy) in the secnnd lesson.
11. I look forward to not doing the lessons, but have not put much
energy to not doing them.
12. I think I will talk to Missy about helping promote Weekly
Alignments and maybe the morning sessions and/or Bold Life
Brotherhood.
13. Two nights ago, at 3:30am, Jennie got into a fight with a cat
outside our window.  We went out to break it up and kept her inside
the rest of the night and last night.  I wish I could explain to her
that she could stay outside if she stays quiet.
14. Lin and I are going camping in a couple days with a mutual friend
who plans to bring BBQ meat.  Should be a fun time.  Oh I hope I
remember to bring Francois.
15. Lin and I have been doing quite well recently, seemingly affected
by my being more loving: telling bedtime stories, offering verbal
appreciations.
16. It takes time though, so that is something I think about.
17. Two people have let me know they could not donate to my
GoGetFunding campaign because of some "Liability Shift" problem
declining the cards.  Very annoying to not know how to fix it.
18. Fifteen people attended the walking meditation this past
Saturday.  Wow!!
19. Before the walking meditation, I got on mic and two cameras in
Shibuya talking a bit about my trip.  Completely impromptu and great
synchronicity.
20. I have not created my event for Weekly Alignments for tomorrow.  I
hope I do it tonight.
21. I just typed all the above in Noborito waiting area next to Nambu
Line.  How going to head the rest of the way home.
22. Oh that reminds me, I have begun retiring my Macbook Pro 2012.
Now using my System76 Lemur 2020 as my full time machine.  Much
lighter (and smaller and plasticker) and Linuxer (Pop!_OS)
23. Home now features two nicely made holes in our downstairs
ceilings.
