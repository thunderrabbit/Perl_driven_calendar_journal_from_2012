Today I had plans to sort out my taxes so I can take them tomorrow, but ended up taking a big ol' nap instead.

I also considered doing some work for AB, but couldn't really get my brain in gear to do that.

I am, however, on the train now headed to an event hosted by a friend of mine.

Emico also does healing work and is doing something related to chakras tonight, so I was like "I'll have some of that!"

My intention is that it helps me sort out my energy and priorities for tomorrow.

oh, that reminds me, I also need to get a piece of glass out of my foot.  Lin wasn't able to remove it because it's too deep I guess.
