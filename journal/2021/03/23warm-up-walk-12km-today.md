Today I intended to walk 19 kilometers to work today but I basically ran out of time after walking about 12 km.

12 km is good enough for one half of one day of walking during my long walk so I'm pretty happy about that.

If I can walk 10 or 12 km then take a break and walk another 10 or 12 km I will be able to successfully complete all the legs of my walk as they're currently planned.

I just bathed at a public bath 13 minutes walk from my work and I'm actually wearing shoes to walk the rest of the way to work because my feet are a bit sore to be honest.

If I had maybe another hour for them to chill out I think I could walk another 10 km.

So, all in all, I believe the walk will be quite doable.
