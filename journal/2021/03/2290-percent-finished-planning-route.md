Yesterday I got the final 8 days of the walk re-routed along a flat river valley instead of climbing over mountains again.  I did that because up to that point, I had several short segments in the mountains, to help ensure I can find a way around the tunnels through which I cannot safely walk (as they have no sidewalks in them).

In one case, there are Google Street View photos of trails going around the tunnels.  In the case north of there, there is another tunnel just beyond Lodge Montoze.  Street View shows paths near ski slopes to the "left" (west) of the tunnel, so I suspect I can use those to get around the tunnels.
