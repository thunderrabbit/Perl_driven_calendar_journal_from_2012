Last night I slept by about midnight? and woke up sorta by 9am.
Hopefully I can get more sleep on most nights of the walk..  Not more
sleep, but more downtime so I can keep website updated, etc.

After writing this, I'll do a final packing of my bag (using Lin's
hiking bag) and base box (bought yesterday), then walk to
[Yomiuriland for our second kickoff event](/events/2021/04/17start-walking-to-niigata-kickoff-party/),
apparently featuring rain!

Shraddhan's friend Steve jumped onto the morning DYD call just as I
was jumping off.  I subsequently dreamt he had invited a bunch of
people who were interested in potentially joining the morning
meetings.
