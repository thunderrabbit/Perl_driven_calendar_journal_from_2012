I split Day Eleven of my walk into 4 segments today.  

The first segment includes a little stopover at an "art gallery" consisting of carefully landscaped plants that resolve into a recognizable form when viewed from an appropriate distance.

The second segment ends at a little rest area just before a tunnel through the mountain.  Fortunately this tunnel has a bit of sidewalk inside so I can presumably walk through it.

There are some trails over the mountain if necessary.

Next segment ends at a ramen shop and the last segment ends a Yumotokan, my accomodation for the night!
