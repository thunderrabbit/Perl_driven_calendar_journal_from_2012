Today one of my to do items is to allow me to post from here on Quill to send updates during my walk to Niigata on an ad-hoc basis.

I just removed the stuff that counts the number of characters and hoping that I can edit this thing without having to erase from the end.

Curiously enough, that didn't work but I'm still going to keep the Twitter count removed because I don't care about it for journal entries.

Curiously enough maybe it DID work..  yep it seems fine now so let me commit this change.

Update: the textarea is not fixed.  I will keep removing stuff from
the page in hopes I can get it to work..  Maybe I should try a plain
ol' textarea and see if it's my *phone* with the problem.  Here.  I
will put one here.

<form>
<textarea></textarea>
</form>

Edits in the textarea above worked fine on my phone.  I found some
more code that was messing with the textarea.  Now I apparently will
lose my edits, but I can use Notes or a local solution that need not
be baked into the page.
