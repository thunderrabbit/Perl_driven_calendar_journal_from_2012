After [walking around outside barefoot for nearly two hours on concrete, asphalt, and forest, over rocks, grates, sticks, steps..](https://www.reddit.com/rpan/r/whereintheworld/mlli0b) (1)

I stubbed my toe while getting into the shower.

It didn't really hurt, but was enough to crack the nail and free some blood.

Lin said this was no time for photos. Hahahaha ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

On the train on the way to work, I uploaded the photos and wrote the above entry.

Here's an "after" picture, taken in Kawasaki after I super glued the injury at home.

PS: the bruise at the cuticle is from an injury in February.
