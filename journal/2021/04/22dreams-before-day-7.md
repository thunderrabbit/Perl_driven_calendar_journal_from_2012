<p class='dream'>Some young men were working in a iron smelting factory and using low grade coal to light the fire and a very highly experienced woman was making suggestions like use real coal to mix it up and she was able to hold the hot spike thing cause she her hand was wet and she drove a nail into it and cleaned off the outer slag and in the next scene they were well trained splitting with precision the edge of a crystal into two pieces that would split apart into useful pieces</p>

<p class='dream'>Just now dreamed I was in an elevator witnessing Japanese go into the office for night shift and I asked him what you said instead of good morning and he said いろございます in my dream, but I guess that is not correct.</p>

<p class='dream'>In the third dream there was a game being played with two shapes that were related by the outer boundaries be fixed topologically but not geometrically, having lights placed around the outer edge and the lights could move in and out as the players were on one side and then something to act like scissors was on the other half of the game field so whereas the scissors would cut in half the shape on one side the side with the players on it would get cut into different shapes because the lights were in different positions and the game was to stay intact as long as possible. I was able to fly around to stay above the intact side and ultimately won the game by putting my foot back onto the small last extant piece.</p>

<p class='dream'>And another dream I came into a classroom fashionably late and waved to Colleen as I came in and she waved back that's it on the front row and some people needed some paper so I went back to see if Colleen had any and had to climb hundreds of steps to get to her which I was able to do but it was quite difficult because they got very steep.</p>

<p class='dream'>There was a chihuahua on a box I'm tied to some bushes and I didn't know if the Chihuahua had been forgotten or abandoned so I picked up the box and looked for the owner and when we found the owner he was stretching that Chihuahua into different shapes which I said was abuse but he said he was just checking for damage.  I couldn't bear to watch so I left.
