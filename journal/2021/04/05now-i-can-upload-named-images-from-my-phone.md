Using my version of
[Bulletproof](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/bulletproof/tree/2e5594138f96a5e25a7b6631af1ea6f347041357)
and accompanying [server
code](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/badmin.robnugen.com/tree/d6eb75117806915bcc1e6feb230fc626d9fca2ef),
I can now upload named images and put them into subdirectories of one
of three different base directories.

This is basically so I can upload images with date-labeled
human-readable filenames into topic-specific human-readable
directories, using my phone.

This will come in super handy during my walk.

So far, I can upload the images, but not yet easily embed them into my
Hugo website.  (I embedded the above image with help from Firefox, BASH,
ssh, and Emacs on my computer.)
