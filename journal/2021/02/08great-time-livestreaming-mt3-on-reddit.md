I like the wide format of streaming on YouTube, but the community on Reddit is far superior with easily 20 times the viewers and questions in chat.

I am testing this embed to see if it creates an image, but it does not.  Hmm.  I wonder how I can import data to marbletrack3.com to keep track of the number of hours spent.
