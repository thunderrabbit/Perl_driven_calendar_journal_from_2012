Lin and I are going to a sportswear outlet store for employees (and their friends (and whoever can get their hands on a coupon)) to find some goodies for my walk.

I'm hoping to find 

* Wide brim hat
* Waterproof ðŸ‘– pants
* Sweat-wicking unders
* Underwear
* Thick ðŸ§¦ socks
* waterproofing spray
* Whistle?
* Reflective vest
