This was gonna be a blog entry but for now just a journal.

Last night was when I let M say "I have a charge against X Y and Z, and I don't want to look at it."

I know the charge is about M, not them, so no worries.

I learned it's important to have M verbally confirm *he* knows it's about him, not them.

Woulda "saved" 60 or 70 minutes haha.
