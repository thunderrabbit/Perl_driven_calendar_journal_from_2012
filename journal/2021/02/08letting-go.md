Steps to create events on my site

6. find event date
7. type event title
8. type event tags
9. type event location
10 type event description
1. find image
2. upload image
3. create thumb
4. get url of uploaded version
5. put image source URL on entry

I have done all the above with Emacs, web browser, search engine, copy
paste, bash scripts.

I've been thinking about ways to optimize the URL juggling aspects,
and keep it within my workflow..
