Beginning to think about how to fund my walk and at least cover costs
of the walk, I am starting to sell a book, temporarily titled

_Coast to Coast Barefoot (over the mountians)_

Stretch goals on my campaign:

* 100 happily walking,
* 500 livestreams from the road,
* 1000 postcards from the road,
* 3000 letters from the road,
* 5000 daily showers,
* 10000 professionally printed book,
* 30000 hardcover book
