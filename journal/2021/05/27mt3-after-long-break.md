It's been over a month since I worked on the marble track and is taking a picture of it before continuing.

I haven't updated this site for a while but I've been broadcasting on Reddit and I'm not able yet to post those live streams on this site.  I guess I have done something like 20 hours of live streams on Reddit, plus or minus 5 hours..
