Massive Mistakes Men Make that keep them Frustrated Fighting and Alone

* Solve, not listen
  Jump to action
  Assume women want them to do something and not just
  listen. Okay. They immediately jump into service, trying to solve
  the problems that they hear.

* Hold it in
  Be manly
  thinking they can't express emotions. They have to hold everything
  in and be strong for the people around them.  Whereas, actually, by
  being a full human, they will be more respected. Whatever it is.

* work is life
  They tend to, like work all the time, and don't take time for
  themselves to do their own self care.

* ignore family
  They should take care of the family because there's a lot of love
  within the family. But if they just ignore their family in terms of
  like, working all the time, that's not actually long term, taking
  care of the family. The family needs attention and fatherhood, a
  father figure who's a real hero, and they're not just a robot,

* show it off
  outward appearance
  professional success is often all up in the head, and therefore, the
  inner work is ignored by, by consequence, because they're not within
  their body noticing what's happening downstairs.

* me me me
  taking things personally, when stuff happens, and it has nothing to
  do with them as an individual.   Whether good or bad seems to
  result, don't take it personally.

* know it all
  Thinking everyone thinks the way I do, or the people the same thing
  that I do.  This happens because it's more comforting to believe
  that I know what's going on. That I have everything figured out. And
  to accept your own ignorance. Yes, that I actually literally know
  0.0% of what's going on.

* ignore myself
  Trying to please everyone else, instead of at the experience of
  their own joy.

* overwork
  work as virtue
  Thinking I gotta work, I gotta work, you got to do to take care of
  the family, it's all external, without taking care of the self.

* ignore emotions
  Refusing to grieve loss.  Like one of one of my mates had a family
  member die. And he basically refused to acknowledge the death. He is
  still trying to live up to what he thinks the family member would
  have wanted.  Like trying to fill the role of the family member who
  died, as opposed to taking care of his own life.

* Yes yes yes
  Not willing to set boundaries (just say no)

* material man
  Trying to show off with material, well think focusing on material
  wealth, to show their success?  We have the phrase, American English
  things keeping up with the Joneses. Why is that a phrase mean?
  Because people want to look good among their peers. And so what is
  looked good mean is like, it's the outward appearance. That's the
  most easily assessed, oh, they have a cooler car, therefore, they
  must be more successful.

* who, you?
  continuous competition
  Comparisons: money, intelligence, like which school did you go to?
  appearance in terms of like a certain watch or clothing or How hot
  is your wife, your girlfriend? kind of thing? Okay. The title on
  your business card like mine says president yours says bookkeeper

  keep them frustrated because competition like that is never fuckin
  ending. And it's not going to like help anything. But for five
  minutes like Oh, I got the car cool. And then Okay, now what?

* shame in the game
  should all over yourself
  not accept yourself as you are
