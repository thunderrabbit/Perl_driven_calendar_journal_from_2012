    Hi Gracie
    
    Thank you for your nice message.
    
    I feel grateful living in Japan regarding the covid situation.  We
    haven't had any real strong lockdowns, and everyone pretty much
    wears a mask most of the time.
    
    You asked about fun things I've done today.  I'm not sure if this
    counts as fun, but my wife and I took a nice long siesta in the
    afternoon and woke up in the evening.
    
    Recently I led a walking meditation in Yoyogi Park in Tokyo.  That
    was on June 5th and five people attended.  I plan to lead another
    one on June 20th, one day before summer solstice in the northern
    hemisphere.
    
    Tomorrow I will attend the first of seven classes in a course
    describing how to strengthen and improve the use of our chakras.
    I'm looking forward to that as the instructor has said it's a very
    practical course.
    
    Thank you for your reminder about self care; I agree it's very
    important, particularly in the summer.
    
    Blessings to you and yours
      Rob
