<p class='dream'>This morning my dream was related to the chakra course; I was studying the material and reviewing my notes and sharing my notes with some friends.</p>

<p class='dream'>In my dream notes:
There are twelve chemicals (?) in the human body which are balanced with twelve physical chakras (?) in the human body.</p>

<p class='dream'>While I was studying, I saw some drawings of the green bug I pulled from my body in the previous dream, and was excited like "yes! That's exactly the bug I pulled out of my body in that dream!". I was excited to get confirmation of my experience.</p>

<p class='dream'>Then I woke up. üòÅ</p>
