A couple days ago I discovered a beginner guide (3 part video series)
on how to easily experience astral projection.  I plan to do it
tomorrow morning.

After reading a lot of the messages, I realize I have some shared
experiences...  As a kid I used to stare up at bright lights and
subsequently feel my body oscillating backwards as if I was rotating
backwards *into* the floor.  I thought it was just a neat experience
and after some time it stopped happening (or I stopped staring up at
lights because I had less unstructured time).

If I have been super active and excited while my body is hella tired,
I immediately feel vibrations or buzzy in my body when I allow it to
rest.  I have always chalked it up to something physiological, but now
I wonder.

I'm curious about lucid dreams being generated by my mind and
"blocking" my view of the real astral world.  I read something like
that somewhere but now don't see it.  Oh wait, am I dreaming??
