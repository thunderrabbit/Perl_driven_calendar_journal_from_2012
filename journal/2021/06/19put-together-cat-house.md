This morning I woke up at 3:30 a.m. and put together our new cat house
after having glued chopsticks to the edges of the wood so that the
pieces would kind of fit together and lock themselves in place.

That took about an hour and I just took pictures.

I just wrote to ask Fred if he can help with renaming photos.

(photos coming soon I guess)
