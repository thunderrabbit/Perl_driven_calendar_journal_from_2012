Happy Summer Solstice!

Happy Rick and  Morty Season 5 Day!!

Sitting now on Odakyu Line as it whisks me toward Yoyogi Uehara, I
write these words trying not to use the verb "to be" or any of its
variants.

AB expects me to arrive at 4pm, and I expect we will have about an
hour or two hour meeting to discuss the recent restructuring that
allows me to bill AB directly instead of going through Nate and
Alfonzo.

I have written a document to prepare for the meeting.  It spans 6
pages as I have six main topics to discuss.  Approximately half of
each page has printed content while the other half can be used for
notes.

I look forward to the meeting and feel optimistic it will go well.

I want to leave the meeting able to bill them 6000 yen per hour.

And that's how you write an entry that is E*prime.
