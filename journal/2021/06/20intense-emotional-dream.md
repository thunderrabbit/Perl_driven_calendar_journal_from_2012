<p class='dream'>I just woke from a very emotional dream: </p>

<p class='dream'>I was climbing a tree and super happy in joy and even was able to move between trees for more joy!</p>

<p class='dream'>Then I realized the tree had some weak spots with old wood that could easily break and fall.  I broke some of the old wood and then felt shocked when I realized I had accidentally broken a small old wooden shrine that had been built up in the tree.</p>

<p class='dream'>I was afraid to be caught so I climbed down the tree hoping to not get caught.</p>

<p class='dream'>When I reached the bottom of the tree, the tree shook and a small glass jar from the shrine fell and broke into several pieces on the ground.  I tried to see where she the pieces fell. The owners of the tree were there and my wife Lin was there saying I had to fix it.  She was angry at me and not helping me fix it.  I cried not having her support then tried to find a replacement jar by researching "Japanese tree shrine" or something.</p>

<p class='dream'>Lin started belittling me for having asked for help and being sad, and I was growing increasingly angry and she kept shaming me publicly (as we were walking in public) and I was begging her to stop shaming me.  She kept going and my anger peaked as I said "now I want to divorce you in this moment but I know it's temporary because I'm angry" ðŸ˜¡. Her reaction seemed to be happy that I was so angry.</p>

<p class='dream'>During that time, I felt something hug my legs as I walked, and it was a little girl who looked up at me silently and pulled me toward her daddy who was lying on the ground.</p>

<p class='dream'>I immediately switched my focus from fight with wife to man on ground and began to speak to him, checking that he was okay.  He woke, and was able to move properly so he and his daughter walked away.  I found something he had dropped, which looked like a pair of new watch batteries in plastic. I followed him to return them.   I  caught up with the man, and his older daughter accepted the batteries from me.  I noticed the batteries were actually empty shells of batteries.</p>

<p class='dream'>A different man saw my interaction with the man on the ground. He spoke up to me, saying that I looked really nice.</p>

<p class='dream'>I thanked him then said "you have no idea how angry I felt at my wife."</p>

<p class='dream'>Speaking so Lin could hear, I explained to him that I had just been fighting with her. Lin walked up, completely calm and relaxed happy that I was talking to him. </p>

<p class='dream'>Lin said told the man my men's group was really great and the man should join if he was interested.</p>

<p class='dream'>I asked the man about his story in Japan and he looked very sad.  I guessed it involved kids and divorce... and the man nodded yes.</p>

<p class='dream'>I began listening to his story as I woke up.</p>
