I woke up at 3:30 for an hour then went back to bed with the intention
of having experience in the astral plane.  I didn't feel as large
vibrations as I ever have before, but I felt some vibrations and
visualize myself looking into the bathroom mirror trying to imagine
the cold sink in front of me and really feel the experience of being
in front of the mirror, but I seemed to stay in my body.

At some point, I thought I was in front of a mirror and looking into
it and began to see white light growing.  I suspected I might be
opening my physical eyes a bit and letting in light in the physical,
but I am not sure.

At some points I recognized I was lucid dreaming and I enjoyed that as
its own success.  This is also the first time that I remember hearing
myself snoring and the sound was incorporated into my lucid dream.

I'm really happy to have found this community and know that I have
been super close to being fully conscious in the astral.  At some
point while reading over this subreddit, I saw the idea I understand
to be

*During lucid dreaming, recognize your mind is generating the
dream... and "deactivate"(?) the dream to find your perception clearly
in the astral* (without the veil of the dream blocking my perception.)
