I am pleased to report I can barely recall everything from today; it
has been like a generally happy blur.  Lucid dreams this morning, one
new person on DYD call, paid Kisses to Lin for not watching TV; went
to get TJ Bike's brakes fixed and did not have to wait in line.
Walked to the park where I plan to do walking meditation on Friday
July 16th, met a woman who showed me a lookout from which we can see
Mt Fuji on a clear day, took a huge dump in the squat toilet in the
park, worked on Wealth Through Workshops book by Callan Rush, asked
for support to bounce ideas for workshop book, walked back to get TJ
Bike, quite happy with service and price on TJ Bike repair (less than
4000 yen to replace rear brake cable and pads), bought a cookie for
Lin, paid at conveni for my backpack that Lin bought, got 一万 yen in
the mail, watched a spirit science episode, signed up for their 7 day
course, confirmed Planio can wipe our old projects, ate some granola,
added pictures to event for 16 July, wrote this entry, and now about
to talk to Yuta regarding workshop stuff.
