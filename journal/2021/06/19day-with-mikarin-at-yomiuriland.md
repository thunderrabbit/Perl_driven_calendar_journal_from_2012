It was sprinkling while I walked to Yomiuriland this morning, arriving
right at 10:30 to meet Mikarin. Sprinkly rain continued until a couple
hours later, and rain kept Bandit from running, but also kept the
crowds away.

Essentially zero lines on any of the rides, and got to ride/do most
everything available except the haunted house.  She said it was too
scary to have to walk through it.

We met Kona, Ryuta, Rio, and Sakura in a group at the Petracycles, and
ended up riding Looping Coaster with them, and later rode Looping
Starship with the boys as Sakura and Rio watched and took photos and
videos.

Mikarin and I rode her favorite spinning rocking ride, and then I rode
it with Kona, Ryuta, Rio, and Sakura while Mikarin watched.  Kona and
I shouted "Mikako!!" repeatedly when we could see her from the
ride. She smiled, then laughed, then ignored us.

We headed to Shakey's to meet Lin for buffet of pizza etc and now
home, feeling very full.
