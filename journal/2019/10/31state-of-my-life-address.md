(started 13:16 Thursday 31 October 2019 JST)

1. Today is October 31st.  I do not plan to do anything Halloweenie for Halloween
2. I just scheduled my 3rd [Eye Gazing workshop, to be held November
   30th at In Gallery](https://www.facebook.com/events/263911317865803/) Mikako's [art gallery](http://www.ingallery.info/) space near Jiyugaoka.
3. I have not yet put a version up on Meetup, but I plan to do so
   under my
   [Tokyo Sōl meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-S%C5%8Dl-barefoot-more/).
17. I created Tokyo Sōl with the idea for multiple meanings of the
    second word.  Starting with Sole, for being barefoot.  Next will
    be Soul for heart to heart connections.  Then will be Sol for
    getting out into the sun a bit.  I also want to include circle
    games *cought* Silent Football *cough* but have not thought of a
    word meaning that kind of game, and pronounced "sol"  Hmm.  The
    three letters are contained in Silent fOotbalL.  That's a good step.
4. Today one of my friends from Houston attended my online men's
   group.  He said he enjoyed the format; hopefully he got some
   value from attending.
19. In the men's circle, I ended up with affirmations "I do what I
    want" and "I accept myself".  These came after I started feeling
    into my fear of doing workshops and stuff.  Right after the group
    I posted my 3rd eye gazing workshop.
5. Right now I am headed to Toshiba to teach at their science museum.
   It's basically my favorite set of lessons, but in the lowest price
   range.  I gotta get that up to my standard rate.
6. My standard rate is 8000 yen per hour now.
7. I just got ~rabsef-linmyn connected again on Urbit.  At first I had
   problems because I forgot that
   all the files in the tarball have to be together in order for it to
   work.  Emailing support at urbit.org got it sorted out.
8. I own the Urbit star ~wanbus and the DNS domain wanb.us, but I have not
   really done anything with either.
9. Lin and I got back on the 20th from our honeymoon in Hawaii.  We
   were there for 4.5 days, on the Hilo side of big island, living in
   Robert and Konrad's guest house near Pahoa.
10. Oh snap I need to create an invoice for a new client.  I gotta get
    a better system for this than just trying to remember who/what/いくら
11. I am not quite ready to say I have been lighting candles as part
    of a process to invoke astral energies in a positive, protective
    type way.  I have had a candle burning for 48 hours now; it looks
    like it will go for 3 days total.
12. Last night was the fifth Wednesday of the month so there were no
    lessons at JB.  Certainly makes the long Wednesday easier if it's
    not so long!
13. Lin has been working long hours and might be making herself sick.
    It is hard for me to witness, feeling helpless to "make her
    stop".
14. It's my intention that I make enough money with workshops and
    facilitation that she can feel comfortable doing only the work she
    wants to do.
15. I am thinking about doing ShadowWork practice on some Monday
    nights, and possibly opening up a monthly event to practice
    ShadowWork, probably on Friday nights.
16. I just recently got logged in to ふれあいネット, which will allow
    me to reserve rooms near my station to do study sessions.
18. Jiaii Rin has been out of town for over a month.  Her group did
    not do an end-of-October workshop.  This is good modeling for me;
    I can say NO to things and the world still goes around.
20. 2pm Halloween 2019:  Train is arriving in Kawasaki now.  Lessons
    from 14:30 to 16:30, then head to Akihabara for lesson with GG
    from 18:30 to 19:30.	
21. I forgot to schedule a language exchange with Akiko.  I wonder
    when she will be available next.
22. 17:40 Halloween 2019: Lessons at Toshiba were fine.  Azusa was
    apparently too busy to study.  As a student, I can understand.  As
    a teacher, I am like "do you know how much studying will help?"
	Naoko apparently knows how much studying helps; she has progressed
    fantastically.  Liliko was not present today. 
23. I am in Family Mart in 秋葉原, near GG lesson.  I had planned to
    eat my bento lunch, but apparently I left it at home.  Dang,
    because I was looking forward to it.  But I do
    not really need food right now, so yay?
24. There are tons of tourists in Tokyo this year.
25. Lesson with GG was attended only by Mayumi and I.  She was going
    to leave 15 minutes early so she could eat dinner before 12 hour
    cut-off before medical check, but ended up staying the whole
    lesson as I assured her it's possible to not eat dinner for a night.
26. After the lesson, I met Akiko for language exchange.  She helped
    me navigate a website that allows for renting various rooms or
    fields, all for quite low rates.  2 hours for a softball field was
    just 2000 yen!
27. After testing the system, I have currently reserved three rooms,
    two of which are for the same timeslot.  I will cancel one, two,
    or three of these reservations.  They must be cancelled at least 3
    days before the event, so I still have over two weeks for all of them.
28. I plan to go check the rooms tomorrow, make a decision about their
    usability, cancel the ones I don't want.
29. Oh, on the way to meeting Akiko in 神田駅, I met a man nicknamed
    Man who helped me get to the station.  Turns out he is from Chiang
    Mai, and I thanked him for such a beautiful culture.
30. 22:37 Halloween 2019: I am on the train now, waiting to leave
    Shinjuku, headed back toward home.

I will leave the above though it got a bit detailed for an SOML

1. Lin and I live in 神奈川県川崎市麻生区 in the house we bought a few
   years ago.
2. We have no kids, but Jennie is our cat
3. We just had our first official honeymoon, in Hawaii
4. TJ Bike is still my bicycle, since before I broke my shoulder in
Hakone
5. surgery.robnugen.com no longer points to the page regarding that accident
6. I updated my site to take over robnugen.com instead of
   new.robnugen.com and now those images are all stranded on the
   Dreamhost server
7. I should probably just hire someone to bring all those over to my
existing site
8. I am thinking about putting ~wanbus on a vultr server
