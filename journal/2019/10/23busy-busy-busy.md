I arrived at my morning lesson today with souvenirs from Hawaii, some
of which were specifically requested by specific people.  None of the
requesters were present in the lesson.  It reminded me of my blog
entry [I can do anything and no one cares](/blog/2019/09/18/i-can-choose-to-do-anything-and-no-one-really-cares/).
