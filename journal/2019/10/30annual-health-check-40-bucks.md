Today I got my lungs x-rayed, my stomach etc x-rayed, blood test, pee
test, poo test, all for 4100 yen.

It took two hours, most of which was spent waiting for my name to be
called for each different station.  Waiting wasn't all that fun, but
good to get it all done.

They will mail results next week or so.
