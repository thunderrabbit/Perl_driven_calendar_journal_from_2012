I just had lunch with Tomoko near her office near Sotetsu Line.  I
have not used this line many times.  星川 station is under
construction and has temporary walkways kinda outside the station
while they fix up the bit in the middle.

We sat outside in the shade, enjoying an apparently famous view of a
shallow pool which she said is a fountain.  We exchanged souvenirs
from our respective trips and caught up on everything.
