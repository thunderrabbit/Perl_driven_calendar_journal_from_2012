Today I knocked AB's admin site offline when I tried to set up a
test admin site on the same server.  It ended up doing repeated
redirects until the browsers said enough is enough.

I kept thinking I must be close to fixing it and ended up taking 30
minutes before I gave up and went back to original configuration.

Client was understanding, but it really ain't good for a live system.
On the bright side, I can correctly describe the situation as "ironic"
as I was setting up a test system so I would not risk breaking the
live system,.. so I got that goin fqor me, which is nice.
