Today after my alarm woke me up at 5am, I turned it off and then
thought "oops I should have snoozed it" and promptly fell asleep again
until 6am.

Fortunately, I had not planned to leave until 6:00am, so I was within
tolerances of leaving on time.

On Wednesday mornings I wake up early so I can sit on a train that
begins from 登戸 station at 6:57am.  The train arrives in 登戸 at 6:27
am and chills for an hour, offering something like 450 seats to people
who are willing to sit for half an hour before departing.

Today, though I arrived in Noborito at 6:40, I was still able to get a
seat on that train. Yay!
