TJ Bike's rear gear set decided to be stuck in top gear, so I cannot
easily go up hills without the chain skipping gears.  While trying to
get started moving again, I started to lose balance and my sandal(*) got
stuck on the pedal so I could not put my foot down in time to catch
myself before my little toe got banged into the curb and ripped off
the front corner of skin.

(*) yes, I wear sandals while riding TJ Bike because I don't want to
wear shoes, but the pedals are too painful to go barefoot.  Plus, the
sandals are just a bit of protection during any small mishaps.
