I gotta head to TY today; I think I might quit working there.  It's
not paying enough to be worth it.. hmmm

Messing around with GDScript at the moment.  Trying to use the concept
of dependency injection to send all the values through instead of
assuming stuff.  This comes from what I learned from
http://mlaphp.com/

I meditated for 15 minutes this morning after Lughn reminded me the
value of meditating daily.  Two days in a row so far!

Oh, and I started using https://complice.co again.
