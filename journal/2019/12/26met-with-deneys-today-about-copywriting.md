Deneys had great questions for me to help get the proverbial juices
flowing as I struggle with the idea of how to explain what I do in my
business.  He gave me the suggestion to just bang it out, which now
sounds weird, but it worked.  I spent a bit over an hour speaking what
I didn't want to write out by hand.  I will do a pass over it first to
account for mistranscriptions, but hereby promise not to do any major
editing of this
