Hmmm the date is 12/12 and nearly a full moon.  If not today, then the
full moon is tomorrow *Friday the 13th*!

I got TJ Bike fixed; すみれさん replaced the shift cable for the back
gear for 2500 yen.  It's nice that he's usually not busy and can just
fix things like boom.

Now I am headed to SCC for two hours of work and then to BP for two
hours of work.  Then hang with Akiko for two hours of language exchange.

SCC was fun; Naoko practiced her presentation on liquid nitrogen for
70 minutes.  Then Azusa practiced her presentation on historical
products, including practicing saying "tubes" for about 10 minutes.
She kept saying "tuブス"

BP was fun.  This was the second lesson in their 12 lesson series.  I
was a bit rushed to present all the material in two hours.  I buzzed
through it in favor of having the practice their presentations.

Language exchange with Akiko was fun.  She carefully looked at several
of the drawings I made some years ago but never named.  She came up
with excellent names for four of them!  I am curious as to how I might
be able to find dates for them.  It would be easiest to do an image
search, but I don't know what software can do that on my local
machine.

Okay, well, I just searched for .jpg images and went from 2013
to 2007.  I found sibling art from early 2008, so I will use that date
for the pieces.

I found lottttts of pictures that I wanted to put in my journal one
day.  I guess that day has not come yet, but maybe maybe soon??
