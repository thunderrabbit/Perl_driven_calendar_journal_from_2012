We are in Okayama tonight, staying in a hotel near the station.

We went shopping for some art supplies for me, and I bought a pad of
30 A4 pages, which I plan to make a series of pieces that bleed into
each other, so like the top page will have some lines with dots that
bleed through to the next page which will use those dots as guides for
lines which subsequently bleed into the next page.

I am not sure how it will go, but sounds fun!

Right now I am at the stage of too tired to write consistently and yet
I keep wanting to finish the entry in my head.

I am likely to install Monica, available from https://monicahq.com because I
keep thinking I want a way to recall who I have invited to my
workshops this coming year.

Oh, so far, so good with https://complice.co; I have been using it for about a
week now, I guess.
