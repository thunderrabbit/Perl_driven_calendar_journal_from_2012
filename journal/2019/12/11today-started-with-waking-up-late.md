I got to work on time and traded contact details with students who
wanted to do homework over the holidays.

Chatted with Joanna, who I had met at Rin's animalistic yoga event.
We seem to have similar calendaring systems; i.e. we use them and
follow them.  We set up a meeting for mid January 2020.

Worked a bit on AB, but I could not do as much as I wanted because the
wifi at the internet cafe (DiCE) was not working properly.  I did not
want to download a bunch of stuff via my phone, so I worked on
preparing a list of my websites for my friend Deneys to look at in
terms of doing copywriting.  I composed this email to send him
tomorrow once his schedule settles.

Hi Deneys

There are several different projects that I judge could use some help in promotions.

1. promoting my workshops as Barefoot Rob
2. promoting my art (Marble Track 3 animation)
3. promoting my art (drawings)
4. promoting MKP Japan
5. promoting my art (mazes)

I don't know if copywriting is part of promoting, but if there is a match here, I would love your guidance and help.   In order of need (1 being the highest), if any of these speak to you, let's talk about how I can make them better.

### 1. these are for my workshops as Barefoot Rob ###

Basically then headed in to work at JB and talked about the lesson for
BP tomorrow.  I made several corrections to the lesson plan and Eriko
made the fixes.  Super grateful for her making the lesson plans;
relatively easy for me to go in and do the teaching part.

A good idea popped into my brain for the kids lesson at 15:30.  We have
worked on "what's your name?" enough that the know to parrot back "my
name is ______."   To help them with pronouns (and eventually reported
speech), I ask "what's her name?" or "what's his name?" or "what's my
name?"

They like to play velcro ping pong ball darts, and this is where the
brainstorm came.  I used the same pattern to ask about scores.
"What's your score?" "What's her score?" etc.  We went through about 8
sets of having the kids ask each other the question and write scores
on the whiteboard.  *Then* went to "What's your total score?" but I
did not emphasize the word 'total'..  I just gave them a chance to
practice adding up numbers.
