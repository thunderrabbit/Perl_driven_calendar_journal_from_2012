Today I woke up late, possibly because my covers were too warm.

I arrived late to SOGO, but apparently they started late so I only
missed the beginning of the warmup.

During the core workout, I met Ting, from China, who helped me
remember how to count in Mandarin.

During the pair workout, Valeriya taught me the first five numbers in
Russian  (here is what I remember)

* ar
*
* triter
* proky
* ted

hmm that's pretty bad.  Internet says:

* a'deen
* dva
* tri
* chetyre
* pyat'

Anyway, good workout and good lunch at the Mexican place with
Dominique and everyone.  I sat next to Dmitri; we mostly talked to the
peeps across from us, one of whom grew up in California after her
Japanese family lived there during WWII.  She is in the process of
getting a long term stay visa, by virtue of her heritage.

Got home then took TJ Bike to the shop; his back tire was completely
flat this morning!  The guy at the shop gave me a new tube because I
had just bought a new tube and tire from him a couple weeks ago.

Then I updated two of the pages for my recent art:
