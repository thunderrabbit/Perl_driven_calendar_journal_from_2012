Rin came to Jonathan's to chat with me; we had not had a chance to
catch up since our trips starting in October!  She was able to hang
out with her grandmother and chocolate covered coffee.  Sounds like
quite an experience!

We each have changed a lot since October; I am allowing more abundance
into my life, and she is meeting lots of cool people who live here and
beyond!
