I did some programming today to help me post images of my
[art on my wiki](https://art.robnugen.com/art).  Basically for each
piece I need to create text like this


<br />
        [[File:Lincoln Number, 2019.jpg|900px|Lincoln Number, 2019]]<br />
        [[File:Lincoln Number, back.jpg|thumb|Lincoln Number back]]<br />
        <br />
        An experiment in how many times lines could pass under and over one another, I started this in approximately 2019.<br />
        <br />
        &lt;permalink/&gt;<br />
        <br />
        [[Category:Marker]]<br />
        [[Category:Shikishi]]<br />
        [[Category:24cm x 27cm]]<br />
        [[Category:2019]]<br />
        [[Category:art_pages]]<br />

For a mythical piece named "Lincoln Number" based on the name
"[Linking Number](https://art.robnugen.com/LN10).

And wiki text for the images themselves, front and back.

Anyway, it's not *difficult*; it's just annoying to remember the
syntax and/or cut-paste-replace-replace-replace-cut-paste, then wonder
if I got all the right bits done, realize I got the wrong categories
etc etc blah blah.

Soon it will just be visit https://arty.robnugen.com/arty enter some
deets and submit.  Then copy and paste each one *once*.
