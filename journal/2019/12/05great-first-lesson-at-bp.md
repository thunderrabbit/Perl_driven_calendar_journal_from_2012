Today was the first of 12 lessons at BP.  John, Yoko, Daisuke were
there in the last session.  This time there are 9 others.

Just enough time to create 4 teams of 3 at the end of the lesson; I
had planned to do it but forgot about it until the end.  It worked out
perfectly though because it created some excitement and great energy
for the students.

The team names are "42", "Yes", "Upper", and "Booster"

I am really excited for how it's turning out.
