An alarm just went off on my phone.  Get off your comptuer and go to
sleep, it says.  Good idea.

I was not actually on my computer at the moment; Lin and I were
watching Blade Runner 2049.  I paused it halfway through (after he is
told he has 48 hours to get back on track).

I have been creating sigils to create positive results, doing
multiples at a time so I don't recall which is which or even the
specifics of all of them.
