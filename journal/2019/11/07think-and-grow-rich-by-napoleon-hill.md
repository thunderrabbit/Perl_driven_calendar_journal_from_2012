I sent this to the LINE support portion of my men's group today.

    Men,
    
    Yesterday I started listening to Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon
    Hill (*) (after Mark recommended the book to me).
    
    By the 31st day of December 2020, I will have 5 million yen in the
    bank.  It will come to me in varying amounts as I offer the
    services of facilitation and enjoying life through creative play.
    
    I have held 5 million yen cash before in my life on many occasions
    (as a cash runner for horse betting in Yokohama); I know what it
    feels like in my hands.
    
    My task by the end of tomorrow is to write this out by hand and
    begin implanting it in my subconscious with passionate repetition,
    as I begin moving forward to the best of my ability on my tasks.
