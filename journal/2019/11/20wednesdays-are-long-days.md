I love having our laser printer.  I was able to print 80 pages
(doublesided, don't worry) for [ShadowWork](https://shadowwork.com/)
carpet training which I will be able to lead starting early next year.
I am practicing now. Greatly looking forward to bringing this training
to Japan.

Chatted with Jimmy for a bit before I took a nap on the train from 登戸 to 川崎

Now I am at Shukoh for lesson which officially started 8 minutes ago
now (at 7:50), but no one else has arrived yet.

Starting with Ayano at 8am, Sayuri, Yuta, and Ai attended today.

#### 9:44am

I am at DiCE, an internet cafe near Cinecitta.  I finished my stretch
from last night, and have invited several people to my eye gazing
workshop on Nov 30th.
