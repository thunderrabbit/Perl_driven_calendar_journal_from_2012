Wow wow 9 people joined the barefoot walkshop today!

We started in [Hikarie](http://www.hikarie.jp/en/) 2F, which was great
because the originally planned spot was taken up with a huge queueing
area for people going to see the recently (yesterday) opened building,
[Shibuya Scramble Square](https://shibuya-scramble-square.com/en/)
(which is poorly named because Shibuya Scramble is on the other
side!).

Though I was barefoot the entire time, the rest of the group joined me
in barefootedness as we looked out over the Shibuya "river", next to
another new building, [Shibuya Stream](https://shibuyastream.jp).
