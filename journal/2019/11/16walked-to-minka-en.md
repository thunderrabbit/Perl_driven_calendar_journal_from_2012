Super great time walking to the Japanese Folk Houses area near
Mukogaoka-yuen station.  It's a beautiful area with lots of Japanese
houses from 17th - 19th centuries!  Most amazing that they are all
made without fasteners (nails) as with most western buildings.  Lots
of the houses have naturally curved beams that add character and proof
of the care used to put everything together.

This is the only place (that I know of) in Japan where we can see all
sorts of homes from all around the country.. all in one park!

Great fun talking to the volunteer guides who share a love of the
history and craftmanship of the homes.  I am beginning to learn the
stories and characters of the different homes.  So much to see and
learn.
