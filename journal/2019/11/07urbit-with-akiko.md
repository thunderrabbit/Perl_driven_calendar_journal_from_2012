I spent 1.6 hours during our two hour language exchange, happily
explaining to the best of my abiliyt and answering questions from
Akiko about Urbit, the operating function currently branded as your
last computer.

Akiko had some great ideas for who might need to use it, so long as we
get the right answers for two questions (so far, not including the
third one I just thought of related to the second below):

2. How does a star vet its planet owners to be good people?
1. Can a star snoop on its planet's private traffic?
3. Does a log of all planets' (encrypted) data get stacked up in their star?
