[Connect and Swipe](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi), which I previously called ConSwi, is a game Tariq
and I designed several years ago, as sortof a cross between Tetris and
Bejeweled.  Like Tetris, pieces come down to be placed by the player.
But unlike Tetris, they come down a single tile at a time.  Like
Bejeweled, we have to swipe consecutive pieces.  Unlike Bejeweled, we
may have to swipe certain shapes in order to pass levels.

Anyway, I'm licensing the code under the GNU General Public License so
people can share the love of games and make it better.
