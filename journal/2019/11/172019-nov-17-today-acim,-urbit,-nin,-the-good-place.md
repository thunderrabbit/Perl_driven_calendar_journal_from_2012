Today I skipped SOGO to attend a meetup for A Course In Miracles.  The
meetup was fine, but not really enough for me to want to skip SOGO
again for it.  Happily, the next one will be on a Saturday.

I posted an entry called
"[Marble Track 3 in a post](http://rabsef-linmyn.arvo.network/~publish/~rabsef-linmyn/marble-track-3-construction/marble-track-3-in-a-post)"
on urbit, the title being an homage to "life in a post" on Reddit.  I
don't know if you can see that URL without being actually on Urbit.
If that is in fact the case, I do not yet know how to post a page that
doesn't require logging in.

I played a game with Lin today. "Is this song by Nine Inch Nails?"
while going through a playlist of songs similar to NIN.  I think that
would make a good website, but I do not think I could successfully
make it successful with my current interest and skillset.

I watched the penultimate episode of The Good Place.  It was pretty
great; I have enjoyed them all, tbh.

Oh, and I finally figured out why I had not been able to get hardlinks
to work on my machine.  Turns out my editor was breaking the link by
unlinking and relinking the file (or something).

Thanks to https://superuser.com/a/302083

In my case, I set `backup-by-coping-when-linked` to non-nil.
