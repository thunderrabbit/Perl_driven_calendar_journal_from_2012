#### Barefoot 1: walking

    Will you carry your shoes?
    How will you carry them?
    Do you need to wash your feet? Where will you do that?
    How will you wash them?
    What if you get injured?
    Do you have a helper to remove splinters or glass?
    Do you need to bring socks?
    Where will you walk?
    Can you abort in the middle?
    Is it likely safe?
    What's the temperature?
    
    Let's walk!  How does it feel?
    Is it like you expected?
    What did you expect?
    Flex your toes. How do they feel?
    Do different surfaces feel different?
    Are there differences you didn't expect?
    How about different materials? Textures? Colors?
	   (White paint and black asphalt are quite different temperatures in the summer!)
    
Some surfaces can have surprises, so keep a close watch where you are
walking, at least until you are comfortable with the area.  Some
surfaces (flat black tile along Roppongi Dori) can be surprisingly hot
in summer.

Some are sharper than they look.  Pebbles missing from pebble-paved
area?  Yeouch!

Grassy areas are not always nice!  There can be hidden pointy things
like thorns, thistles, dry stalks, all of which will readily pierce or
scrape skin!


#### Barefoot 2: grounding

Now that you've gotten some experience walking barefoot, how does it feel in shoes versus
without?  Ground yourself into your body, starting with your feet.
Feel your soles touching the ground. Find your body connected to your
feet.  Feel energy coming up from your feet into your legs.

Allow this energy to continue upwards.  Feel the energy in your è…¹
coming up from your legs.  Breathe into your stomach, using your
diaphragm. Imagine allowing the grounded energy to fill your stomach
and lungs as you breathe.

After a few slow deep breaths, let your breathing go back to normal.
Allow the idea of grounding to allow awareness of your breath.  Notice
how you breathe.  Notice your thinking while you notice your
breathing.  Can you stay connected with the grounded feeling?  Try
standing barefoot meditation.

Notice your energy while you sit.  Notice your energy while you
stand.  Are they different?

How about your thinking while you sit or stand.  Are they different?

Notice your energy mindfully for fifteen minutes max each day.  Notice
old messages and new ideas in your mind.  Write down new messages.

Write down everything at first. Stream of consicousness writing.  Let
your pen go and let the words flow.  Or let your fingers go and ignore
any typo.   Might try writing with your non-dominant hand.  This
allows easier access to learning and awareness.

Notice if you can detect multiple sources for the inspiration of
writing.  Are there different tones to the langauge at different
times?  For me, there are at least two voices.  One is my nagging
spell-checking inner bully,

The other is from a different space
altogether.  There is no need to make the leap that it comes from
God.  It could be sufficiently advanced science.  In any case, there
is a voice I can become aware of which is always available, always
genki, always on tak, always speaking positively always in the present
moment.  (see my other course on the Ever Present Present)

This other voice is always available, and always ready.  I am not
always able to hear it, but I can if I try.  It's this voice that
holds the key to level 3 and beyond.

##### Dealing with pain

Pain can be addressed in any number of ways.  Here are a couple that
have worked for me.

Allow myself to notice the sensation of pain as distinctly as
possible.  Imagine becoming really small and getting inside the
painful tissue.  Be an investigator at a factory watching how the
workers deal with this situation.

Of course, if there is blood leaving your body, get it fixed on a
physical level, not just with mental awareness.  Stop the bleeding and
go to a clinic!

#### Barefoot 3: inspiration

Write down new messages while meditating.  Write down new messages
while walking.  Notice messages while barefoot vs while shod.

Start a list of these notes of inspiration in a notebook you can keep
with you, or on your phone.  Move the icon to that game to a back page
and put the icon for your sparks note taking app in its place on the
front screen of your phone.

Do you hear them more or less at different times of your day?
Different phases of your energy/activity?

Open your sparks notebook each day to review entries and see which
ones are coming to fruition.

What is the overall thrust of the income messages?  Are there enough
messages in one general direction to call it a project?  Are you excited
about moving it forward?  If yes, go for it!

What's a step you can do toward accomplishing the project?  What
scares you about moving forward to accomplish it?  (If nothing, it's
probably not .)


What support do you need to do the step?

#### Barefoot 4: creation

You are in charge of the quantity of your creative output.  Some of
what you produce may look terrible to you.  Keep producing.

Have you seen paintings from the Blue Period of Picasso?  They were
not accepted by the public at the time, but he kept painting and kept
going and now they have their own Wikipedia entry!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso%27s_Blue_Period

Take the next step. And the next. Allocate some time to take more
steps.  Keep on stepping forward.
