Today Naoko worked on the English version of her liquid nitrogen
science show.  Cool to see the double-walled beaker that is
topologically a sphere with a beaker shape, and vacuum inside to keep
heat from entering readily.

Talked to Liliko and gave her a marble (she chose light blue) in honor
of her hard work and opportunity to go to OZ in January.

Today I got to meet Takano, who asked for my support in helping one of
the guides improve.
