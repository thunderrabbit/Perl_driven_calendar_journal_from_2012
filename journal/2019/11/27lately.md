* Sunday I went to SOGO and found it had been cancelled due to rain!
  The rain had stopped, and at least four others attended long enough
  to take a photo.  I headed home and they went for a walk in the
  autumn leaves.

* Sunday after no-SOGO, Lin and I went to a car dealership to look at
  a car she has been ~coveting~ wanting for a while.  It's a teeny bit
  shorter than her current vehicle, which I have said is too long/big
  for me to happily drive it in Tokyo, especially backwards when
  parking at home.

* On Monday, three potential co-facilitators attended my introduction to
  ShadowWorkÂ®.  https://shadowwork.com/  So far, two have expressed
  interest in practicing further.  Yay!

* Monday night I heard from Kevin that his website had gone down after
  he switched to DreamPress.  Uh oh.  The DreamHost guys were able to
  sort it out pretty quickly.  An .htaccess file hadn't gotten copied
  over, and I was using a non-standard directory name for the admin
  directory.  Super grateful to Kevin for switching to DreamPress (so
  I have the DH support to ask if there are problems), and super
  grateful to DH support for their support with problems!

* On Tuesday, I spent 4.5 hours working on [Marble Track 3](https://www.marbletrack3.com/).  I will
  probably start spending more time on it; I love the project so much!

* Tuesday evening at men's group, Mark facilitated me as I dug down
  into sadness I felt as a boy for having felt ridiculed for smiling.
  I had a great smile when talking about Marble Track 3, so I am
  carrying a marble with me this week as a reminder.

* Today after Shukoh, I will head to Mikako's to look at her website
  and finalize details for my 3rd Eye Gazing Workshop to be held this
  Saturday.
