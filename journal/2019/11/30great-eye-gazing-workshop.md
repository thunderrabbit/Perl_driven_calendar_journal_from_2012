Today was my third eye gazing workshop.  We ended up having to cancel
it because everyone but Rin cancelled due to work or being sick.  Lin
and I went to Mikako's to hang out with her and show my art (and give
them a piece!)

Lughn showed up for the workshop unexpectedly so I did four eye gazing
sessions with her.  I offered her some of my art; she chose [Debugging
Notes](https://art.robnugen.com/DN) and
[Silo](https://art.robnugen.com/a)!  She said she would frame them and
put them in her house.  I signed them and we took pictures with each!
So happy to have a happy home for them both.
