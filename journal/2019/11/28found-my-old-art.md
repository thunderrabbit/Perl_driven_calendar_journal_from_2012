I found my old art in a box in my closet.  I knew it was there, but I
had forgotten what size some of the pieces where.  (many of them had
become larger in my memory and were so small when I pulled them out of
the box!)

### Well, what is "old" exactly?

I found some pieces that are labeled with http://robnugen.com/art:

Inner Space Set, with 6 pieces.  They are all 12cm by 13.6cm.  (4.7 x
5.3 inches)

I am sure I have scanned them before, but if I cannot find the
pictures quickly at https://art.robnugen.com/art, I will scan them again now.

Ah yes,
[Inner Space Set of Six - 11 March 2009](https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Art:Inner_Space_Set_of_Six_-_11_March_2009)
and they have a shortlink on art.robnugen.com
https://art.robnugen.com/iss09

This is the first set I have pulled out of a box in my closet; I do
not know what other URLs I will find that do not match the current
convention of art.robnugen.com/art (where the second art is specific
to the piece(s)).  Therefore I am not yet ready to write their latest
URL on the back.  (10+ years after they were finished) At this point,
I think I will write it only if their future new owner wants it
written.

And I just realized a good way to validate editors on the wiki.  If
they send me a photo of the date and the image and their preferred
username, I can create the username for them.  I am thinking I should
require minimum length passwords...  I just want to make sure minimum
garbage ends up on the wiki.

I scanned the backs of
[Inner Space Set](https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Art:Inner_Space_Set_of_Six_-_11_March_2009),
and created a permalink for a piece I called
[Old School](https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Art:Old_School_-_24_April_2010).

Mohammed asked me for an explantion of Inner Space Set, and I created
the story about electron microscope at the top of the page.
