Sometimes I end up with several itty bitty entries with more meta data
and title than content.  This entry is designed to be used all day.
As of this writing, the title does not include the date, so I will add
that. brb.  Hmm that reads weirdly, but not too bad.

#### Hoon 101

This morning I said hello on Hoon 101 chat board on an Urbit planet,
and just now got sidetracked reading the messages about people excited
to join and just how to join the notebook.  Urbit is not yet meant for
the masses, and it's hella fun to be with other explorers in the
optimism of creativity as opposed to the whatever of FB.

#### early lesson

I am on the train from 登戸 to 川崎 stations.  I sit on a train that
departs from Noborito, which offers me an extra 30 minutes to sleep,
or in this case play on Urbit and write journal entries

#### barefoot course

I wrote a draft last night of my barefoot course.  I am planning to
work on it for 2 hours this week.

#### chat with Mo

3pm Mohammed asked if I had done astral projection.  He found a video
online explaining one way to do it, but it invokes helper spirits,
which violates the rules of his religion.  I suggested it was only
white magic because it did not violate anyone else's free will.

#### late work

5:40pm I have just finished two lessons for kids.  First with
Ryunoske, Ryosuke, Ranka, Ayana, and Haruna.  Then with Toshiro and
Kanta.  In the first class we practiced counting dates of the month to
practice ordinals, which are useful in saying what grade they are in,
and the order in which the classes were held.  In the second class, we
practiced making variants of "when (person) wants to (verb), s/he goes
to (location)."

#### later work

Hide came at 6pm and tbh I was distracted with an email I had gotten
from AB.  He stayed for 7pm lesson, and we actually had a full house.
Hide, Akiko, Yutaro, Shoichi.   We each told our latest stories.
Akiko mentioned some kinda posture-fixing footwear which Yutaro
explained how it works in Japanese.

#### zzzz

0:29am next morning but still awake, dealing with client stuff and
then playing with Urbit.
