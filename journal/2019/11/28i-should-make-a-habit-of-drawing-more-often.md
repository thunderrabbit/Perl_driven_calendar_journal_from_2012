I got kinda overwhelmed with all the scanning and archiving part which
I imagine is part of why I put it all in the closet.  The scanning and
archiving will become a lot more useful when people know each page has
its own permalink!

Just the little bit of drawing I did yesterday reminds me of how much
I enjoy it, so I hereby consider encouraging myself to engage in the
creation of hand-drawn art on a regular basis.

In other news, I set up a one-touch scan on my scanner which posts
images on my server. <!-- at b DOT robnugenã€‚
com/art/drawing/2019/scanned_not_renamed/ which I do not want scraped
but if you find it, feel free to have a peak.  -->
