Today Naoko practiced the English version of her science show starring
liquid nitrogen.  Standing across the table from her, facing a 1.5
liter beaker of liquid nitrogen was somewhat distracting for me.  It
was close enough (and deep enough) that I *could* have dunked my whole
hand into it.

I want to play with it and see how different things react.  Will my
pen shatter if I put it inside and then smush it?  How about paper?

Naoko predicted the pen might shatter, but that paper would be largely
unaffected unless it is already wet.

Though the plan had been to work with her for 2 hours, we only had 45
minutes because of a surprise tour, she had to do a real presentation
of the show (in Japanese).

Pics next time.
