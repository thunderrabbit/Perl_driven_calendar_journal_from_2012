Gotta run!

##### 12:00

Class was good / fine, with two and a half other students (one was
pretty late) and two and a half teachers (one was pretty late).
Introductions ended up taking a lot of time and there was not much
time for the actual grammar point the teacher wanted to present.  Next
week, a different teacher will present.
