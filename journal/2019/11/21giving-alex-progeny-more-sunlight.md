Alex is the name I gave a plant that was given to me by Kana, before
she moved away from where Soness used to live in Chigasaki.  I believe
I was still living there at the time, but dating Lin and gave the
plant to Lin soon after I got it.

Anyway it grew into a big strong plant, for some values of big and
strong.  I rooted 4 baby Alex plants and they are growing in their own
containers.  Good thing, because the original Alex froze maybe two
years ago now in a winter that was beyond his pay grade.

We now have three decent sized versions and an itty bitty little one
that I had planted out front, but today I realized it was no getting
enough sunlight to be really planty.

Today I used the square 酒 cup from Christine and Erik's wedding as a
planter for this littlest of Alex's progeny.  It's hanging from a
hanger I made from earphone wires.  And this time, it is hanging
*inside*, in the sunroom behind Mama's room.

For some reason, I did not take pics of the creation process, but it
was pretty simple.  There are two drain holes in the bottom of the 酒
cup.  Five(?) large-ish white gravel stones line the bottom, and then
a layer of small-ish black rocks are on those.  Then I scooped some
dirt from our front bushes and put the Littlest Alex on that.
