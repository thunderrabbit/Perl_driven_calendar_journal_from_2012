Yay wow wow yay omg nice!

I went to Mika's to help with her website, and some internet stuff.
Also to see their
[art gallery space InGallery.info](http://www.ingallery.info/).  I am
excited about the idea of hanging some of my art there!  I will bring
some pieces on Saturday for the eye gazing workshop.

As I write this, I am headed to Kawasaki station for lessons at JB.  I
have some time, so I will stop by the art supply area in Atre and buy
some supplies so I can draw a couple pieces before the ~show~ event.

Mika had seen some of my pieces before, but when she saw the
thumbnails at http://art.robnugen.com/art she was like oh wow there's
a lot! and wanted to see some of them up close again.
