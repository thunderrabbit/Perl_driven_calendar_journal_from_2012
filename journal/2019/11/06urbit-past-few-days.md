For a lot of Sunday - Tuesday I was playing with urbit again.  I got
my planet ~rabsef-linmyn working on a Vultr server.  I considered
writing up an article on how to do that since they give server credit
for such articles.  No guarantee of payment, though, so it's a bit of
a shot in the dark.

I got dns set up on the server, but Landscape is just showing a black
screen and no content.  I have not gotten a fix for that yet.  I plan
to join the Hoon 101 class, so that will be interesting.
