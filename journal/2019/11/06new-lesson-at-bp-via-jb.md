I just wrote to
[TED-style event speaker coach Soness](https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/),
to thank her for all the speaking skills she has taught me over the
years!

I have been asked to give some students
[help with their English presentations](https://yourspeakingjourney.as.me/),
and I know just who to ask for help on that.  Soness!!

Soness helped me with my
[Pecha Kucha presentation on Soleful Living](https://www.pechakucha.com/presentations/soleful-living),
which went awesomely well.

<!-- from 
so Hi. My name is Rob. As you may have noticed, I like to walk around
barefoot. I like to feel connected to the earth. It's like that movie
grounded, but I've been barefoot and since way before that movie. It
all started in halcyon days of university, where we had nothing better
to do than watch paint dry work fast. No, I'm just kidding.

But we
studied a lot and when we got tired, we went to the House of Pies. Was a
great place to connect with good friends on campus. I also carried a
Frisbee. I was known as the barefoot frisbee guy. This picture was
on the newspaper, UH, all in the hall. All in all, I was barefoot in
Texas for about seven years in Japan. I've been barefoot now for five
years.

one day, while I was minding my own business, arriving back
in the airport, these guys came up a TV cameras a Hey, man, where do
you do in Japan? Why are you barefoot? I told the story and actually
ended up on TV. I was a lot of fun. That was ridiculous. But I haven't
always been barefoot. When I first started, I felt two things very,
very clearly. First I felt fear. I was afraid on campus. I actually
curled my toes so people wouldn't notice that I was barefoot. I also
felt my feet walking on sharp rocks or even rough gravel can be really
painful for beginning barefoot. But being connected to the earth was
worth it. For me being barefoot, being true to myself was more
important than social mores. So I kept going walking on this tough
things I could. It was great. Yeah, raises my rock hopping days. Don't
even I don't know what this was taken, but yeah, good times. Because
of the connection, the connection was worth it. So, yeah. Speaking of
connection, my wife and I have a heart and soul and soul
connection. Both times that we celebrated our marriage. I was barefoot
and she even joined me the second time. So, like bare footing,
marriage is full of surprises. One day my wife looked upset and I
said, Oh, what's wrong? She said, Everything's fine. Great. Now we can
live happily ever after her success. So we're living along happily
ever after hiking through the woods, living life. Everything was
great. We had a nice place to live, had food, water and Internet. Just
like she said. Everything was great until one day it wasn't. Stop the
tow. Lose a sale. I lost my job. Say something that I didn't mean to
say. People can get upset, so yeah, pain happens. So what happened?
Looks like I wasn't watching where I was going. Maybe a theme in my
life. Yeah. I wasn't watching where I was going or in this case. So
what? I was saying and somebody else got hurt. So how do we deal with
that hurt, though? Do we hide behind a mountain of paperwork? Do we
hide behind? I'm fine. Well, what if we can feel the emotion and still
talk to people? What if we can feel the emotion and still go out and
engage the world? Be present in your body, be present with your
emotions? It's a very liberating experience. This is Sun's out, guns
out Yoyogi Park every Sunday. Uh, what was next? Oh, yeah. Take
another step. Use your emotions. Creates the mart, share your heart
and creates a Marte. There's a painting called Anita's Anger is like
bad red paint everywhere. So this is painting in progress, all right,
I was at the train station and the guy was like, Watch your step. I
look down. It's like everything seems fine even took a picture on and
then I looked up. Oh, he's not toss talking to me. He's talking to all
of us. He wants all of us to notice the world around us. And what I'm
suggesting is that we notice the world around us and feel the emotions
that come up be able to express them if necessary, because things
happen. Life isn't always was where everything's fine. We're not
happily ever after. People get upset with my wife and I get into a
fight. We talk about it, we deal with it in real time, and we're much
closer for it. If I see glass in the street, I might I feel angry, but
I can't really talk about it. Just feel the emotion. So I wanted a
safe place that I could express anything I needed to, and I created
that space, a circle of my peers. When we can sit in a circle of men,
talk about anything we need to talk about. Get that shit off our
chests. Whatever it is, doesn't matter. And we're there for each
other. So notice the world around. You feel the emotions that come up
and express yourself. And if you want to yell and scream, come see
me. Thank you very much. -->
