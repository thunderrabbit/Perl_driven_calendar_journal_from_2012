Yesterday at work I got a new super fast modem for my computer at home.  56k!!!!
<p>
My excitement is fake.  I currently have an ISDN line that work will no longer pay for.  I am slowly being weaned off the internet.. (??)
<p>
I'm using ISDN now.  We'll see if installation of this new modem is as easy as the box says.
<p>
I wonder if I can connect using ISDN and modem at the same time.</p>
