<p>Last night Janette called around 10pm.  I had already gone to
sleep, and had earplugs in (to keep me sleeping while Matty and Frank
are still awake) so it took me a bit to notice, wake up, answer.</p>

<p>Wow.  Good to hear from Janette; I just wanted to cry at times,
which I couldn't do for some reason; maybe cause really I was just
talking to a voice on the phone and not a real live Janette.</p>

<p>Expressed to her the angst I'm going through in this transition
from US to Japanese life - internet connectivity.  I've got to wean
myself off email and it's killing me - I don't want to "let my friends
down" ... which I know is a concern not completely based in truth, but
it's still there.  I'm afraid to be alone; that's one of my deepest
fears - afraid to lose my friends.  Afraid that my ex-YRUUers will
think I've forgotten about them, when really they still show up in my
dreams (Jason called me last night in a dream (or maybe I called
him)).</p>

<p>I wondered if this is a natural..  no it's natural for me, so it's
natural..  i wonder if this is common, or predictable.  I've got to
release; oops my brain is in overdrive on tangents now.</p>

<p>* grand irony <em>I've got to release <b>right now</b></em> when
struggle only causes tightening</p>

<p>* I've got <em>fans</em> that I've never met!  This is *exactly*
what I've wanted, and I'm like shit!  How do I keep them??? please
don't leave!  And I want to send everyone an email "thanks for reading
my site; I really appreciate it!  you're the best!!" but I can't
realistically spend time doing that cause then I won't be living my
dream, learning Japanese, traveling around, making my site
<em>worth</em> reading in the first place!</p>

<p>((A friend of mine published a web zine called The Texas Gazette (I
dunno if it's still around) but at one point she got featured as a
site of the month on some high traffic site and *BANG* she got a
million emails and she tried to respond to all of the <em>emails</em>
instead of focusing on her publication.  I'll never forget that story
even though parts of me are tempted to tiptoe down that path.))</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>I read and <em>appreciate</em> every non-spam non-forward email I
get.  Some of the forwards are good too.  Right now my time is
shredded by work, walking everywhere my bike won't seem to take me,
practicing Japanese</p>

<p>Grrrrrrrrrr  why am i making excuses?</p>

<p>I choose not to respond to all the emails I get.  I still love
you.</p>
