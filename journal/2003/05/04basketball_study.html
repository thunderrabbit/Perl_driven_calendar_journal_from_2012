<p>Frank is watching recently recorded basketball games recorded and
sent by his mom.  He knows the outcome of all the games, but hasn't
seen the actual games.</p>

<p>I've been mostly studying, or maybe mostly watching, but pretty
close to half and half overall.  I've got the concept of particles in
my head.  Like ‚Í and ‚ğ and ‚É and one more that I've forgotten.
There are many of these, which basically specify how nouns are being used in sentences.</p>

<p>I can say shit like ‚Ú‚­‚Í@‚¶‚å‚¤‚¢‚¶‚É@NOVA‚ğ@‚¢‚«‚Ü‚·, which I think
means "I will go to Nova at 10" and breaks down as I (subject) 10 (at)
Nova (object) go.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly not exactly right, but I certainly hope
it's at least close enough that a native speaker could figure out what
I'm trying to say.</p>
