<p>Welp, unless something quite surprising happens, I won't be
attending either of the Eminem concerts in Japan this month.  Just
today two things happened:</p>

<p>(one) Jon offered to work any Friday for me.</p>

<p>(two) I was told I have training on the Friday of the first Eminem
concert.</p>

<p>I don't know that I could get out of the training since I normally
work on Fridays, but....  it sure seemed like an interesting cusp of
possibilities.</p>

<p>I got to work early and Masahiro, Yuki, Sumika all helped me with
my Japanese skillz.  I helped Masahiro with a couple of English
words.</p>

<p>Happy mother's day to all you mothers and your mothers.</p>
