<p>Man, stupid Mac iPhoto is dumb.  I'm only using it cause it's fast,
but it's wack the way it put together this photo album for Hakone.
It's like as good as a beta version of the software, with inconsistent
links and crap like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I remember, there will be images of hakone on my site by
the time this entry is up.  Click on japan above and look for hakone
pics.</p>
