<p>The bullet trains are *so* fast.  Shit they're just amazingly fast
and when I ride to work along the river, I go underneath a bullet
train track.</p>

<p>Tonight, as I approached the tracks...  it's just like
whhhoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooommmmm and then it's
gone.  Always 16 white cars with a pointy snout and pointy tail.
Maybe I'll take an mpeg of it with my camera sometime.  It's just sooo
fucking <em>fast!</em></p>

<p>The vantage point I have from the river doesn't put me right beside
the tracks, but about five feet below the actual track level..  BUT
there's a wall that nearly blocks the whole thing from my view when
I'm close to the tracks.  I look forward to having a clear close view
of those trains screaming by like aircraft.</p>

<p>That's how fast it seems.  It might as well fly.</p>
