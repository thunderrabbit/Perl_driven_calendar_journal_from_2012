I am trying to read this book, "The Field" by Lynne McTaggart, but every few paragraphs or so give me the energy (or "light" as the book would call it) to trip out on an idea. An example is that it was talking about how, in quantum physics, things seem to only exist when they are observed. (Like subatomic particles) It's like the consciousness of the observer brings the observed into being. Ok. This got me wondering if it is the *imagination* of the observer that creates "things"... for example.... Does "The Planet Jupiter" have any relationship with the person it was "discovered" ? <br>
The guy had to expect to find something right?<br>
Maybe the person who discovered cancer was a deep down cynic.<br>

""" words words words<br>

LOVE,<br>
