<p>Called kT tonight!  She's kickin' it at a law firm up in New
England, which she's doing because she remembered the people there (at
the law firm) were nice, but now she's remembering the people there
(in Brooklyn) are not nice in general, so she has no friends.</p>

<p>Other than that, and the shooting at City Hall, everything is
fine.</p>
