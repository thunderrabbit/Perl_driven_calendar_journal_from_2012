<p>Today at work during my last lesson I had a pleasant attractive
single female man to man.  Told her I had a girlfriend so she
shouldn't try anything sneaky.  But she did ask me what I like and I
tried to tell her but couldn't help but laugh a bit because I had this
little sketch by Brak in my head, where the climax goes, "Hello, My
name is Bongo, I like to climb on things, can I have a banana?  Eeek
eeek."</p>

<p>I carefully explained it to her and she thought it was funny.</p>

<p>The man to man prior to that was with a super shy super quiet super
low 7C 12 year old girl.  I finally got her to name colors on some
animal flash cards I had brought as backup in case the warnings in her
file proved true.</p>

<p>Cracked out a little Japanese to break through to her.</p>

<p>The four man lesson with all men was pretty good; I had them
querying each other about this woman's photo album in level 7A.
Several variants like, "what could she do when she was 12?" and "when
could she ride a horse?" and then a level 6 structure: "what was she
doing when this picture was taken?"</p>

<p>Didn't have any of my girlfriends today.</p>
