<p>I forgot how to use a fork.  Tonight while eating dinner with Shin,
I forked my front tooth really hard like "conk!" and I was like "oh
shit" cause it felt really wierd and I was worried I might have
chipped it.  But I didn't.  Shin asked the waitress for chopsticks.
This is an unexpected anti-culture shock!  How will I eat in the
US?</p>
