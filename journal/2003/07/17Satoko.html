<p>I had a man to man lesson with Satoko today.  She and I have been
emailing each other occassionally for a couple weeks.  We haven't
talked about hanging out outside of Nova, but it will probably happen.
I'm being super careful because I've got janette, and because chillin'
with students is officially disallowed.</p>

<p>She told me about a tour she took around Tokyo area, including
Tokyo Tower and Asakusa and the Imperial Palace and other Japanese
names that I don't remember.</p>
