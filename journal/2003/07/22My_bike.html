<p>I miss my bike, but I'm getting pretty good on Koko's mom's bike.
I'm kinda thrashing it a bit too hard; I think I'll need to buy her a
new one instead of giving this one back.   The back wheel is slightly
dented out of shape.  Just a slight lateral warp is all.</p>

<p>Just now a train went by just as I got off our street; still a
hundred meters from the bridge.  Previously, I have been on the bridge
while passed by a train and I've caught the next train.  This time I
was 100 meters further back.</p>

<p><em>I wonder if I can catch the next train.</em></p>

<p>I was (am) on the edge of late to meet Fumi, so I decided to go for
it.  This involved hauling butt (it's gotta be more than 100 meters)
to the bridge and up the slight incline, looking back over my shoulder
for cars trying to run me over.  Nothing beside me as I merged into
the bigger street (instead of onto the sidewalk like slow people do)
but a bus in front of me and two cars in front of it, trying to turn
left across my sidewalk, but they were blocked by the slow people
going across their street onto the bridge.  (remember these cats in
Japan drive on the left side of the road)</p>

<p>SO, I zoomed around the stopped bus between it and the next lane of
traffic (traveling the same direction as me), and past the two
vehicles just as the first one could turn left.  <em>zoom zoom
zoom</em> pushing hard up the bridge with a bus somewhere behind me
approaching soon.  head down butt up, passing the people on the
sidewalk as if they were <em>walking</em>, and crested the ascent and
then began my plan of attack on the intersection below.</p>

<p>80 meters past the bridge there's a traffic light at which I must
turn left to park my bike and visit the train station.  Usually there
are cars backed up at that light.  Sometimes there's enough space on
their left to pass along the curb, but most times that is blocked by a
scooter or the edge of a bus.  In those cases, I will usually slow
down and engage the sidewalk, if it's clear enough.  Other times, I
will slow down behind the scooter or whatever.  Rarely, I will zoom
around the right hand side of the cars and turn left in front of them,
carefully engaging traffic on the cross street and people possibly
going across the crosswalk.</p>

<p>This time, however, the curb side was clear and I hauled down it,
down the slope between the cars and guard rail (and small plant) and
checked the cross traffic, but had to stop instead of zoom into the
lane.  I zipped instead of zoomed and then accelerated to the bike
parking area and engaged the sidewalk without hitting anyone or
getting hit by anything.  Nice.</p>

<p>I tossed my bike up on the rack (4 feet up on the top row) and
scooted toward the station.  I made it before the next train came.</p>

<p>But, it was a Limited Express, and therefore didn't stop at
Tsunashima.  So I took the next train (Local train (stops at every
station)) and then transferred to the Express train at a station
called Jiugyaku or something.</p>

<p>Got a tiny bit lost by going out of Shibuya station on a different
exit than normal, but I made it to Hachiko <em>just</em> on time.</p>
