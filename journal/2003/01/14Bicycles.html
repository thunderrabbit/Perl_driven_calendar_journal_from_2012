<p>Janette and I rode bikes to the bank, the library, and the grocery
store.  From the library we got _Stranger in a Strange Land_ so I can
continue reading it to her.  From grocery we got spaghetti making
items for dinner tonight.</p>

<p>Before the ride, something was bugging her; I don't know if it was
me or not.  She felt some better during the ride, but not 100% better
as she went back out alone to the park.</p>

<p>I hope she'll talk to me soon if it was something I did.</p>
