<p>Whooo hooo!!!  Guess what Maggie did?????</p>

<p>She got a call from Colleen who had called Janette and got Maggie's
number to tell me that I would be allowed to stay through closing
circle!!</p>

<p>Colleenie Beanie, you're my hero!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ohhhhhh so much better.</p>

best!!</p>

<p>Great dinner with Maggie, Molly, Kerry, Billy, David, Daniel, &
Alfred at Ugo's.  Billy is apparently a reporter (with bad spelling),
and asked us questions in the form, "what do you guys think about
________ ?" and filled in the blank with light rail, revitalizing
downtown Houston, cameras at intersections, etc.</p>

<p>On the way there Molly rode with me and told me Anna stories,
including how she has teeth and likes to bite people and the dog, who
is good natured about it.  So awesome.</p>

<p>This is all so short because I'm at the church, and very excited.</p>
