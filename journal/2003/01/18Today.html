<p>This morning Janette sewed on patches on the elbows of my hoodie
and I cooked breakfast - scrambled eggs with mushrooms, oregano, and a
dash of poultry seasoning.  Yummy.</p>

<p>I then read two chapters of <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> to
her - the two where Jubal verbally shreds Captain Heinrich while Mike
is watching a Fosterite service and trying to grok religion, and then
when Heinrich and his men come to arrest Jubal et. al. and Mike tilts
them all out of existence.</p>

<p>Now I'm about to take a shower and drive to Houston.  Hang out with
Maggie and then attend the rally.</p>
