<p>My big help with cleaning up Sean's room was picking through his
huge quantity of Legos, removing all non-Lego items.  About a quart of
non Lego stuff in three gallons worth of Legos.  Maybe only two
gallons.  Jack and Janette helped me get through the final bit of
sorting after dinner.  Then Janette vaccuumed the room; I lifted the
futon while she vaccuumed underneath it.</p>
