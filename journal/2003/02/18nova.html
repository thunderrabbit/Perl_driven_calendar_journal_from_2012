Dear Robert,

We hope your preparations for Japan are going well.

You recently received a letter from our office requesting that you
provide us with flight information by February 25, 2003. We have yet to
receive this information and ask that you contact us about your
status.

Your immediate attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. We
look forward to speaking with you soon.

Regards,

Nova Group

Hi guys

I am in Hawaii now and will be back in Dallas by February 20.  I will
schedule my flight and let you know the dates.

Can you check to verify that the letter was sent to my address in
Dallas?  If the letter was not sent there, then please let me know via
email what paramaters are allowable for my flight.

I'll call you guys when I get back if there are any problems.

	Thanks!
	- Rob
