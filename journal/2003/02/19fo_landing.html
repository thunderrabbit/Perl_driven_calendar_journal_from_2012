<p>The landing was like <em>WHAM</em> when we touched down.  No
bounce, but definitely hard hit.</p>

<p>Charles to my left had been looking out the window and then jerked
to safe crashlanding arms blocking face/torso position.  Jan and I simply
bounced and were like, "wow."  Jan said their friend in the other
aisle of seats looked all scared.  Good times.</p>

<p>Charles knew this was the pilot's first flight as FO (First
Officer) for Southwest Airlines.</p>

<p>The flight attendant was all, "ladies and gentlemen, please give a
round of applause for our FO's first landing!"</p>

<p>We all clapped and Jan was all, "if you can talk about it, it was a
good landing."</p>

<p>How true.</p>
