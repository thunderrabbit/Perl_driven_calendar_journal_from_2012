<br>I like the part about the Highways. It is very odd when you drive a section of freeway that you usually go under, or vicversa. I've been tolds that most modren skyscrapers are disigned to be viewed from the highway vooming by at 70 mph as appose to the old ones which are disigned to be viewed from street level.<br>
