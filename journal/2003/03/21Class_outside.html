<p>We're outside for Fred's 3pm class talking about logarithms.  He's
showing them how to multiple log base 2 of 6 X log 4 base 6.  Turns
out that it's log 4 over log 2.</p>

<p>We've eaten lunch and such, oh and he told me that he's decided to
buckledown and study for the qualifiers and pass them and be accepted
into the PhD program here at UT.  yay Fred!!</p>
