<p>Went for a walk with Colleen and Richard today.  Richard spent $10
on a MGD / Miller Lite round raft for Colleen (actually she paid him
back) and I got a fifty cent picture looking up through a high tension
tower for powerlines.  Free with $10 purchase.  :-P</p>

<p>Janette and I went for a walk to the lake and I showed her where I
jumped and hit the nail with my rib last night.  Also showed her all
the things Joel and I climbed on at the park last night.  Fun
stuff.</p>

<p>Rich showed me a flash animation parody of LoR 2 on <a
href="http://www.newgrounds.com">newgrounds.com</a>  It's called One
Ring to Rule Them All 2 I think.  Silly funny.</p>

<p>Now I'm likely to add some pictures to my website.</p>
