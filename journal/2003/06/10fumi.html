<p>‚Ó‚Ý is so great!  She said my journal is ‚½‚Ì‚µ‚Ý for her.  I

<p>‚Ó‚Ý seems to be quite a good student.  She may inspire me to begin
studying Japanese more effectively.  And she says she uses my journal
as a study resource!  I assured her some of the language on my site is
not polite, but I'm honored/happy to have some multi-lingual
readers!</p>
