<p>The opposite of Rar is Grar.</p>

<p>Koko didn't come to teach me today; her mom came instead.  I
understand Koko's reasons; she's working on a thesis and doesn't have
time to come chitchat with me about bullshit.  That's all fine and
good but I wish I had known so I could be mentally ready for the
change. But oh well fuckit.  I actually learned a lot more with her
mom cause her mom has been teaching for a long time now.  I must say
that *now* I am taking 3 Japanese classes.  Before it was 2 classes
and a chat.  So I've been presented a third "curriculum," a third
style of teaching, which seems more suited for little kids.</p>

<p>A car tried to run me over on the way home. (*)</p>

<p>I got my thing from Lloyd's so I can send money home.  Nick the
Lloyd's guy who helped me sign up for the service told me that the
intermediary bank in US would charge $10 for the transfer.  I'm glad
he told me cause I woulda been pissed to find out later. . . . . . So
I got my book today and there's 100 yen and 105 yen charges in it, but
maybe they aren't charges, but if they are fuckin' why didn't he tell
me about them?  Why am I so mad about stupid 205 yen?  That's pennies.
It's nothing.  I buy nearly that much orange juice each night.  In
Japan every little thing is charged.  It's annoying (I think Fred
would hate it more than me) but someone explained that's why things
*work* in Japan.  But they really don't always work; sometimes vending
machines will be out of service at the train station, etc. Sigh.  Get
over it or get mad each time.</p>

<p>I'm so contrary.  When Yahoo peeps couldn't tell me wtf a 2800 yen
charge was for I'm like meh whatever.  But this 205 yen has got me
hot. And I don't mean turned on. It's just so GRRR to me that Lloyd's
seems to have such a monopoly on sending cash home.  Maybe I will
snail mail it to janette.</p>

<p>I just ate all the cookies and now I feel a little sick.</p>

<p>(*) not really but I had the right of way.</p>
