<h1>State of my Life</h1>

<ol type="i">
<li><p>I've been in Japan for nearly two and a half months.</p></li>

<li><p>I've just started teaching private students this week.  The
first was fumi, who I helped for 2 hours in Shibuya
yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p>Second and third will be Aki this afternoon in Tsunashima and
Shin tonight in Kikuna.</p></li>

<li><p>Between tutoring Aki and Shin, I'm going to see The Matrix
Reloaded with Cory and Janis in Kawasaki!  It'll be my first time to
attend a movie in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>I went through a two week period of not studying Japanese well
at all.  I'm focusing myself back toward studying.</p></li>

<li><p>There are 25 email messages in my inbox.  I've been working
toward keeping that number down (by responding to messages I've
received instead of just letting them rot).</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't found an official Mankind Project group in Tokyo, but
when Frank gets back in town, I'll ask him if he knows of any (through
AA).</p></li>
