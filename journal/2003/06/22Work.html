<p>Much better day at work today than yesterday.  I didn't extract a
quote of the day, but there were a few doozies during voice when this
guy was totally ....  strange.</p>

<p>He totally domintated the conversation though he didn't seem to be
jiving with anything the other students' concepts of anything.  They
were all "wtf are you talking about?" all while being quite polite, as
Japanese are prone to be.  One guy, a level four, was all quiet,
saying he had no idea what the conversation was about.  I don't quite
believe that, but whatever.</p>

<p>Cory basically challenged me into going to lunch with him and two
other guys and I'm glad he did.  I went at the expense of spending
time trying to think of what to write in students' files, which always
vexes me, so I just didn't think and either wrote nothing (one of my
preferences on the weekend) or scribbled some shit down, which is
certainly just as useful as making some shit up.</p>

<p>"You guys go on without me; I have to write these files; it will
take me about a month."</p>

<p>"Nah mate, I'll see you downstaihs in <em>two</em> minutes."</p>
