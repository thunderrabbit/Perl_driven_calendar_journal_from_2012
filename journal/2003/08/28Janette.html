<p>Talked to janette this morning. From happy to crushed to stable
again.  Don't want to go to work right about now.</p>

<p>Thankful for janette's continued love and support.  Afraid to break
up with her.  Never want to let her go.  Have to.  For some fucked up
reason (self depricating) I have to.</p>

<p>What is the lesson?  Fuck smart ass answerers.</p>

<p>How can I break away from adoration?</p>
