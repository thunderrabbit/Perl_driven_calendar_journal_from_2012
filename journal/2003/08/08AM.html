<p>Woke up.  Worked on redoing my navigation.  Internet connectivity
slowed.  Took a nap.  janette called to say HI.  HI!  She's calling
Maggie now.  I'm glad they're connecting.</p>

<p>After some hours of work spread over a couple weeks or more, I have
released the new navigation system on my site.  I like it.</p>
