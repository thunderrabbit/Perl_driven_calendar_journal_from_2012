<p>Work included now free lessons today.  Man, a busier day at KQ than
some days at Kawasaki.  Got to say HI to Chie a bit after 9pm; she was
still hanging around for a bit and I told her in Japanese something
simple, like, oh how long I've been in Japan and how much longer I'll
be there.  She wasn't too engaged with the conversation, but.  Oh
well.</p>

<p>Haven't heard from Nami in a while; I'll email her now.</p>
