<p>The madness in my mind wonders if I've been fired by janette.  I
called twice, and the guilty conscious of mine knows that I wrote what
previously had only been spoken, so when she didn't answer, and hasn't
emailed me recently, I wonder if I'm in trouble.</p>

<p>I hope not; for selfish reasons, I don't want her visit here to
suck; the madness has considered paying her back for an imperfect trip
to Japan.  For positive reasons, I want to remain close; I don't want
to have angered my friend.</p>
