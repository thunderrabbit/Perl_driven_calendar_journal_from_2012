<p>We got earthquaked today!  It pretty much rocked.  I could actually
feel a relatively high frequency vibration (like 20 hz) for a moment
before the quake hit full on.   I've felt such vibrations before and
dismissed them since there was no apparent earthquake.  From now on
I'll more likely believe they <em>are</em> the earthquake!</p>

<p>The big part of the quake lasted like 5 seconds plus residual
building rocking.  Pretty fun overall.</p>
