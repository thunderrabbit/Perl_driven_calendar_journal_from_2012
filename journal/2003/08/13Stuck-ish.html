<p>I seem to be stuck; I want some cheerleading.  I've called janette
three times in the past 12 hours with no response and I'm like wtf did
I get fired again?  I don't know what I could have done.  I called
Wende this morning and left a message.  Maybe I'll call Maggie, but I
don't want to whine to her while she's at work.</p>

<p>I called Mags at home and left a message.</p>

<p>Okay.  Fuck this.  I persevere.  I'm getting up and getting on with
my day.</p>
