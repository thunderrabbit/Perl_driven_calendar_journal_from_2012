<p class=date>4:45am JST Sunday 10 August 2003</p>

<p>I slept after work, and have just spent 2 hours (!) ???  writing 2
emails and being WAY sidetracked on this thing called Dashboard that
looks pretty cool, but is hardly ready for consumer consumption.</p>

<p>Sally is interested in the source of my journal, and I'm tempted to
run through and pull together a "releaseable" version ("releaseable" =
"here's some shit that works for me, good luck!"), but that would be
another tangent, I fear.  Do I have more pressing issues?</p>

<p>Mmmmmmm...   my room is a disaster area.  argh.</p>

<p>Get up get up; check the status of important things in my life.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Ah.  Need to see about getting shit reserved for when janette comes
and confirm meeting with Yukiji.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Emailed yukiji.  I need to stop waiting for Yasuko to respond with
train schedule information.  Fuck!</p>

<p>My server is responding too slowly for me to navigate around and
fuck with source code, so I'm not going to do that now.</p>

<p>Back to sleeep.</p>

<p>I would just stay up today and sleep crazy long tonight after work,
but I'm going to see T3 with Nami tonight after work!</p>
