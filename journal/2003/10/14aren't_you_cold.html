<li><p>I just had a realization that I could come back from Japan knowing
this much Japanese and feel okay about it.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm feeling like pooh mentally here in Japan.   Like there's no point
to me being here.   And I don't want to wait a week until Kim gets
back from Florida to talk to him.   I want answers now.  Fuck this
Japanese stupid shit.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't think you can easily turn it in to insurance if she was not
insured / not licensed.   That's definitely a consideration supporting
getting her licensed sooner than later.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm listening to NIN right now in little pansy earphone things.
Better than my computer's speakers, but not really enough to get the
full effect.  I'm listening to the songs in alphabetical order, so
each new song sounds out of place (not in the order on the albums)</p></li>

<li><p>Right now, "you are the perfect drug" is on.</p></li>

<li><p>Still.</p></li>

<li><p>I seem to be very good at conceiving new projects and maybe
starting them, but quickly growing weary of continuing, and loathe to
finish.</p></li>

<li><p>My latest idea is to ride all the roller coasters in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>If I can't fucking learn Japanese, then I can still say I did
something cool in Japan.   "yeah, I rode all the rollercoasters in
Japan.  It was pretty fun."</p></li>

<li><p>I'll probably say "it was awesome."</p></li>

<li><p>Am I destined to be forgotten as a piece of human flotsam in
the tide?</p></li>
