<p>Yumiko is really cute.</p>

<p>I quite quickly recognized the futility of repeating the same old
patterns.  cute - stalk - acquire - release - pain.  For one reason or
another I was blind to the pattern.  Do I see now (have I learned the
lesson), or am I just in a place of strength, feeling happy in Japan,
where engaging the pattern is clearly unfruitful?  Meh; whatever;
oughtn't analyze everything to death.</p>

<p>Speaking of meh, I wonder how Jackie is doing.  And Josephine.  And
good god there's a rally going on, actually falling to sleep right now
in little puppy piles in San Antonio.  I didn't call last night cause
I figured there'd be no one there who knew me.  Though I wonder if
Mike and Ben woulda been there, oh and Rich and Ed.  Shoulda
called.</p>
