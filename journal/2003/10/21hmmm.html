<p>Okay.   I've just been chillin' and realized the following things:</p>

<p>I'm not really happy in Japan.</p>

<p>I could be playing/working with janette all the time instead.</p>

<p>I would miss people here.</p>

<p>Would I?  True friends will last no matter what.</p>

<p>I could blow this popsicle stand (who coined that) and work with
janette and sell art and read to her in bed</p>

<p>Why am I here?</p>

<p>There's a fear that if I leave here, I won't be able to come back.</p>

<p>Shit has got to get happier here or I'm leaving.</p>

<p>I can change my situation (housing, job), or change my attitude
(release the pressure to learn Japanese)</p>

<p>What about taking pictures of all the coasters in Japan?</p>

<p>Need piles of fat cash to do that.   (this is an assumption; I
haven't looked into it really)</p>

<p>Often I try to do everything alone (even though my greatest fear is
being alone).   I wonder why this is.   I wonder if they're inexorably
intertwined.</p>

<p>I'm going to meet Cory to go skate in 27 minutes.</p>
