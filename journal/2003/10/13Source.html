<p>There is a point inside my head from which thoughts originate.
Different than my ego's thoughts.</p>

<p>I have considered this point my connection with my angels, my inner
voice.. my true guidance.</p>

<p>This voice gives me the answers almost before the questions are
generated.  Like the thought form is formed, but before it is even
translated into English, the answer comes and *the answer* can be
translated before the question is translated.</p>

<p>Almost feels like I can see the thoughts come into my mind.</p>

<p>It seems to have been a year since I've connected with this voice.
I am thankful for its guidance.</p>
