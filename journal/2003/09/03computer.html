<p>This weekend I spent a lot of time messing with my website, most
notably installing the latest SpamAssassin (v 2.55) and goofing around
with BBST (not to any tangible result).  Wrote to Fred cause I haven't
heard from him in a while and got a couple of lunch meetings set up
with Nova students for next weekend.  Satoko (leaving for CA on 20
September) and Rieko (>M&lt; voice a couple weeks ago).</p>

<p>I'm glad to have these set up; I haven't been able to converse
Japanesely for basically some weeks since I've seen Nami at Fujikyu.
I occassionally get emails from her that she's still working at 6 and
7am, but she'll write to me when she's less busy.  Wow, that's
late.</p>

<p>1am is late enough for me; I'm going to bed.  But I want to play MarbleBlast.</p>

<p>Okay, 2am is late enough for me. bed bed bed now.</p>
