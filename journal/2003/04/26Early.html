<p>For some reason I seem to be up early.  Last night I told myself to
get up the first time I woke up because I knew I couldn't finish two
full sleep cycles before I had to get ready for work and I chose to
experience a gentle transition from sleepin' to awake instead of
shattered out of bed by my alarm.</p>

<p>Then I asked for the blessing of waking up at the exact right
moment.  Here I am, groggy but awake.</p>
