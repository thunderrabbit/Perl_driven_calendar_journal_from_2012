<br>ok  here's how i handle this instead of feeling insecure and jealous.  i says to mineself,i says, "self, you've just been bested!!Holy Crap!!"  no wait, that's not what i say.  i say " hey! hey you! self! take a load off!  there will *always* be girls and women, who are prettier, sexier, funnier, more accomplished or more attractive than me.  but it's the combination of who i am, what i have, that makes me beautiful and worthy.  whether or not rob agrees does not change that. whether or not rob  forsakes me for what might be, is up to him.  there's nothing i can do about that. so just chill, bitch!"  which makes me laugh, cuz i think i'm soo funny, and it's funny when i call myself bitch.<br>
