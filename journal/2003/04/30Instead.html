<p>Often, my students in Nova don't know the word "instead," and I
have not yet worked out a quick way to explain it.  But here are some
examples of its use:</p>

<p>Instead of having my wallet, the police did not have my wallet.</p>

<p>Instead of being open, the bank was closed.</p>

<p>Instead of buying a chain wallet, I did not buy a chain wallet
because instead of having any money, I have no money.</p>

<p>My money locked away in the bank instead of in my hand.</p>

<p>Instead of restraining my emotions as I understand the Japanese do
to prove their integrity of character, I yelled "fuck fuckin' fuck
fuck!" at almost the top of my lungs while outside beside loud traffic
and wind that drowned out my voice.</p>

<p>Now I'm at the International Lounge waiting for Koko.  I really
hoped to do some of this myself.  I shoulda asked Matty or Frank for
some cash, but I turned it down, assuming the bank would be open
today.</p>
