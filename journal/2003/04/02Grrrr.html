<p>ARG</p>

<p>Today was a bit fucked up at work because the lesson that felt the
best where the students had the most fun and talked most with one
another, I got negative feedback on because I hadn't followed the Nova
approved method.  </p>

<p>Fuck that fucked up bullshit.  Are these motherfuckers trying to
learn English and become comfortable speaking it or do they care about
making sure they hit steps 1, 2, 3, 4?  </p>

<p>This was the class after which they thanked me most profusely,
where they spoke the most English..  Grrrrrrrr</p>

<p>But just *one* more day of OJT and then I won't be watched by
hawks, or by the jolly good Steve from England who, bless his heart,
really likes working at Nova.</p>
