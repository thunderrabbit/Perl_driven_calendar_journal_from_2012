<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>Still no phone.  I went back to the store where I imagine I lost
it, but they hadn't seen it.  They suggested I go to the police.</p>

<p>The police!</p>

<p>What an amazing society where the police actually have time to be
concerned over a phone..  In Houston cops can't even keep up with the
number of cars that are stolen each day, much less lost phones!</p>

<p>So I told the police at the local police box I had lost my phone.
They took my information, including the phone number (thank goodness I
had memorized it!!!!) and my address (thank goodness I have it on my
computer cause I have not memorized it!!) and where I work.  I don't
have that number memorized, but thank goodness for phone books so they
can look it up!</p>

<p>Best part was how he told me something that would happen next.  He
was all, "yamma yamma yammera" and I'm like "Erh?" so he drew a
picture.</p>

<p>Aright.</p>

<p>I borrowed his pen and wrote "We will send you a letter." thereby
putting my teaching skills to work in real life.</p>

<p>I'm going to stop by Gera Gera to email Janette and Wende that I'm
phoneless for now.</p>
