<br>Hey to the Rob man, <br>
  I just wanted to take a brief moment to tell you that I met your Mother this past weekend at Spring Con at All Souls Tulsa. What a delightful person. We talked quite a bit and I must say that I was completely taken by her. I can see that you and Fred come by your wonderful ways naturally. Just to repeat myself, what a delightful person. Hope everything continues well in Japan, hope you havent lost your phone again, hope you havnt lost any of your innocents, I think I lost mine but it was pretty small to begin with. Good luck with your great adventure. Love,Bill(thats really bhyllx)
