<p>up:</p>

<p>Grrrreat Voice Room today; we yammered a bit and then I introduced
the Opposite Game with them.   "What is the opposite of red?"
"Green."  "What is the opposite of blue?"  "Yellow."  (close enough)
"What is the opposite of an eraser?"</p>

<p>This is a great game for high level students.  Dammn it's the best
game ever.  Incredible super duper thanks to Wende for inventing it
with me!</p>

<p>I came up with a cheesy one.  What is the opposite of an Air
Conditioner?  Shampoo.  Why?  I added an H before Air.  Terrible pun.
Not even an opposite really.  But whatever; they liked it.</p>

<p>Soon as I got into work Steve was all, "what's going on with your
shoes?" cause I'm wearing some oh-god-say-it-isn't-so!!! light brown
leather shoes.  Man fuck that.  I lied something like, "oh, I didn't
have a chance to get home and change; I chose to be here on time than
to have my other shoes."  Bite me.</p>

<p>On the way home Clayton got on the train with one of his friends.
I tried a little bit of Japanese conversation with him.  Stuff like
what is your phone number and how old are you?</p>

<p>Fuck!</p>

<p>I've been blessed with the opportunity to live without my bike for
an unspecified length of time.</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck!</p>

<p>I went to the cops and they were all, "oh no pahking zone"</p>

<p>WTF???  There's 50 fucking bicycles there right now where I parked
mine this morning and mine got jacked and those all stayed?  What the
fuck is up with that?  No signs?</p>

<p>You mean this isn't a <em>bicycle rack</em> ?????   What the hell
is it then?  A length of pole to sit on?  I don't think so.</p>

<p>I'm quite interested to know what my bike did so differently from
the other bikes.</p>

<p>They gave me a sheet of paper indicating a phone number and
bankers' hours that it's available.  I wonder what adventures are in
store for me and my bike.</p>

<p>And it's not even my bike!!!  Argh!!!!!</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>I got ice cream on the way home to indulge myself.</p>

<p>up:</p>

<p>I arrived home (which took nearly 25 thousand times longer without
a bike!!!!!!!!!!!!!), and found a letter from janette.   :-)</p>
