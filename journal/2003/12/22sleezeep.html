<p>Ugh.  Tired.   I ate raw spinach and Reece's Pieces (that I got
  from janette in the mail today, yay!!!) and got a card from Judy
  Bayley from UH.  Yay!</p>

<p>Part of me could just fall over and sleeeep, but I want to brush
  my toofes and I'll probably take a shower cause that requires less
  brainpower than washing my face only.</p>

<p>Inexplicable but true.</p>
