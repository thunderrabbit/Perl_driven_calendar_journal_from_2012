<p>Saw <em>The Last Samurai</em> tonight.  I'm glad Tom and Taka
  didn't make out; that would have been a ruiner.  Pretty cool
  ending.  Saw it with Morag and her roommate Karen at World Porters
  in さくらぎちょう.</p>

<p>Today I rode my bike to work and took the train home (to the
  movies then home) so I'll get to ride it back tomorrow.  I hope the
  weather stays clear.</p>

<p>I'm hanging out slash calling みき too often to make it easy to not
  see her when janette comes.  Erg.  I think it will be easy enough
  for me but way unfair to her.</p>
