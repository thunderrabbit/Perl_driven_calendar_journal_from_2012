  Miki fired herself by not being willing to try going to Farm Grill
  in Ginza.  I can't hang with someone who chooses to be so helpless.
  I will however, still give her the art thing I made for her.  I
  closed it today; I was going to draw about twice as much, but it
  suddenly appeared finished after I saw it again today.</p>

<p>I want to be more specific about this.  She said, "I can't go to
  Ginza because I have never been there before and I can't read a
  map."</p>
