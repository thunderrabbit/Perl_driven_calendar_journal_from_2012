<p>I have just requested that my webquarry email account be changed
  to the new system so that I have email list capabilities built in.
  My intention is to send out an update, and I don't want to have to
  muck with the list myself so I looked into installing majordomo,
  but that requires root access, so I wondered if webquarry has email
  lists enabled already, and they do, but I have to be migrated to a
  new email server.  I think and hope and trust the process will be
  simple and quick and easy.</p>

<p>I also trust the new email thing will be easy enough for people to
  use that they will actually use it.   Eeek some second thoughts are
  coming, but hey we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>I need to eat.  I bought eggs and spinach yesterday after work;
  I'll have them with Reece's Pieces from janette as I gaze happily
  up at the intricately cut Christmas ornament she made for me.</p>
