<p>Awake.</p>

<p>Warm under blankets I recognize at this moment I don't want to
  leave Carla's house.  I don't want to be the first to leave, to
  break the moment.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity for me to practice doing what I need to do
  and trusting that my (*) resulting happiness will attract to me
  beautiful people and energy and wealth and a positive life.  So I'm
  letting go here and going out into the world. (**)</p>

<p>(*) At this point in my entry, Íµ»Ò invited me to see MIRENARIO
  tonight, a beautiful light display that I've wanted to see.  Oh, but
  I'm meeting ¤æ¤ß tonight at 7.  Hmmm. (***)</p>

<p>(**) here = Carla's house, the world = The Apple Store in Ginza.</p>

<p>(***) we've decided to go see it tomorrow night.</p>
