<p>Went back to the park.  Rode Thunder Dolphin again.  This time I
spent a lot of effort thinking of the BEST thing I could do as one
person and two cameras on the coaster.  Lucky for my sleep schedule, I
don't remember the entire train of thought, but I eventually was like,
"okay, if Fred were here, what would we decide is the best thing we
could do?"  and I came up with it.</p>

<p>As I approached the front of the line, I put my GAP hoodie on
backwards.  Then when I was on the train, I pulled the hoodie up over
my head.  Of course, being backwards, my face was completely covered
by a smooth black layer of cloth.  None of this bunched up around the
drawstrings cover-up.  Smooth.  Flat.  Perfect.  Backwards.</p>

<p>This got some laughs from the crowd.  I raised the roof for them.</p>

<p>So for the first picture (which is taken just before we
ascend the lift hill) I was just flat black.</p>

<p>Soon as we started the ascent, I whipped off my hoodie and placed
it on the seat beside me.  The wind tried to loft it from the seat,
but I was able to get it pretty well tucked under the lap bar while
careening around the track.  For the second picture, I was smiling
bigly, wearing a white (1998 San Antonio Rally) shirt, pointing over
to my friend Mr Nobody wearing a hoodie in the seat next to me.</p>

<p>Due to croppage, the hoodie isn't visible, my arm pointing to the
hoodie is hardly visible, and due to being on a roller coaster, my
expression looked a little weird.</p>

<p>But I still got an honor at the photo purchase area.  The photo
purchasing agent can hang little notes "Best Couple" "Super Scream"
"Best Smile" etc.  I got "Splendid" after the guy saw me seriously
examining the screen and noticed ("wait-a-minute; he's wearing a
different shirt!") or just gave me a note to make me happy.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I bought the pictures and upon further analysis, decided that the
idea itself was flawless, but just a little strained in production.
The dark hoodie didn't show up well at night, and the croppage.  Ah
well.   I would simply have to ride again.</p>

<p>But I couldn't do the same poses again.  How weak would that be?
Had to think of new best ideas.</p>

<p>Came up with two awesome ideas.  One requires two people, and we
simply switch shirts during the ride.  This would be best if they were
simply T-shirts, and not a hoodie, which would mean that we were
shirtless during part of the ride, but nobody can *really* say
anything because there's no direct proof.</p>

<p>The other idea requires only one person, but it requires disabling
the safety device on the coaster or learning a different way to switch
seats during the ride.</p>

<p>So instead I did "I'm squeeshing you" for the first picture and
"hmmmmm" for the second picture.</p>

<p>I got "Hey Nice Guy" <em>and</em> "Splendid!" <em>AND</em> my
picture was featured on the monitor showing the latest great picture!
Wow, what a star for a moment.</p>

<p>Fuuuuuuuuuuk</p>

<p>It's late.  I just imported all the pics from my camera, rotated
those that need to be rotated, and deleted those that need to be
deleted.  Didn't write anything specific about any of them.</p>

<p>The pics are 1600 x 1200 pixels so I'd have to reduce them before
putting them online; gotta be up early tomorrow (for work; I'm
covering for Carla cause she's covering for me on Monday so I can hang
out with ma)</p>

<p>Who knows when I'll get any pics online.</p>

<p>But I haven't written the most disrupting thing about the evening.</p>
