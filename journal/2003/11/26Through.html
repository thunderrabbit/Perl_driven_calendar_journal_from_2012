<p>Man, the titles today could be songs on a nin album</p>

<p>Called janette; pounced on her when I got an email proving she was
  still awake.  She was surprised to hear from me.  More huge
  honesty; I told her that I just want to <em>BITE</em> みき, like a
  vampire just smurf her and be done (*).  But since I can't do that, I'm
  pawing at her, the way I did with inaccessible women while I was in
  Dallas.  <! Chez Pafford, Jackie Purdy></p>

<p>HUGE sadness on the phone.  This was my best cry in Japan so far.
  Reached that point of vibrational connection with my higher spirit;
  a truly cleansing cry.  Close connection with janette; didn't want
  to let her go after that.</p>

<p>(*) smurf has a meaning that I can't explain; I don't have the
  language for it (not even in Japanese).  This is a point that Wende
  didn't understand when I tried to explain it one day.  janette says
  she understands.   interesting, that.</p>

<p>I cried subbingly uncontrollingly; just let it all go in heaving
  gasps "I &lt;sob> can't &lt;sob> do &lt;sob> this."</p>

<p>Once I was in a pattern of two words between sobs; it would be
  good in a movie to see that a few times.  Pretty funny.</p>

<p>Feeling *much* better now.  Even if I'm not any more likely to
  study today.  Except I'll probably practice some with なおみ at
  Tokyo Tower today.</p>

<p>Oh - janette told me that a psychic did my reading and said, "I
  don't know what he's going t to, but whatever he does will be
  magnificent."  Wow.  I have heard this about four timtes from
  different psychics, and Ithis time I was like beyond the need to
  know wtf it is I'm going to do.  I'm just like, "okay' sounds great"
  but I'm just here living my life and we'll see what comes up.
  Trusting that it will come and that these people are right.</p>

<p>janette said she really hated when I pawed back in Dallas.  She
  said I was giving away my power.  I hoped janette was going tosay
  something like, she actually liked it, but that was not the case.
  Oh, she said I really gave away

and I was like I have so much energy, whcih I have explaressed to
  Wende asw well.  So much energy and sometoiemses oftentimes I don't
  know what to do with it all.  I can hardly keep my legs from
  bouncing; I can hardly stand still on an escalator; I can never sit
  on all fours in the classroom in Nova; I am alswas moving always
  running up the stairs.  go go go go go.  Am I chasing or running?
  both?  is that possible?   My train is about to come; gotta jet.</p>

<p>peace</p>
