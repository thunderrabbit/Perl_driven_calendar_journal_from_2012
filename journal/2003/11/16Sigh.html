<p>That went terribly.</p>

<p>Conversing happily with janette and I just had to get it off my
mind that I've been having more fun in Japan (going to Warawara with
Nova peeps, riding roller coasters, beginning to see more progress in
Japanese learnin') and I think I might stay longer than January.</p>

<p>She was like, "I'm cool wit dat, yo" and then I was all, "something
something see myself doing it alone"   I don't even remember what I
said, but the "doing it alone" words rang in my head like an ambulance
stuck in traffic.</p>

<p>mood plummetted.</p>

<p>I'm so sorry.</p>

<p>man, fuck relationships.</p>

<p>fuck being alone.</p>

<p>why oh why</p>

<p>what oh what</p>
