<p>Yesterday I chatted with a woman named Margaret in Yacht Club; I
thought she was a guest speaker, but she is actually an immigration
officer who scoped all our passports to make sure we could legally
visit PNG (Papa New Guinea).  She has four kids, one of whom doesn't
remember his father who died five years ago.  We chatted for well
over an hour, during which time I was scheduled to have an English
lesson with Kiichi, who never showed up.</p>

<p>After that, I met Fantastic Rabbits and Fighting Goats in a
combined party thing because they said they wanted to meet each other.
We did introductions, talked about plans after the voyage, and five
year plans.  9 of my 12 students came: Ann (Akiko), Emily (Chie),
Kelly (Kaoru), George (Koji), Carol (Erika), Sugar (Hiroko), Eye
(Hitomi), Michelle (Satoko), Alice (Sachiko).  No Jerry (Naoko),
Angelina (Tamami), nor Carol (Rie).</p>

<p>After that, I hung out with Eri, who helped me with my speech a
bit, and then we got into a conversation about relationships with
people of very different ages; I said I had labeled some people as
"too young" to date, but she argued that if they are adults, they are
old enough.  I argued that I didn't want to be the first (nor second)
to bruise an unblemished heart.</p>

<p>Met three of my students who are giving speeches (Erika, George,
Alice), then GET Meeting and port orientation, then the long awaited
dinner with GET and CC Girls (I wore my 'sultan costume') then sat
with Eri at the lecture about the history of PB, then walked around
with her on top deck watching stars, talking about our respective
relationship situations.</p>

<p><!-- Instead of trying to kiss her while I was tired, --> I scheduled
meditation time with her on Yacht Club this morning.</p>
