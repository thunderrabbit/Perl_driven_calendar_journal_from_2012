<p>bed now.  Up late with newspaper, though I slept on couches
outside P-cen.  Watched the slideshow for Ozako, the newspaper tanto;
she's a hard workin' well loved boss.  The morning sun just peeped
over the horizon as we finished, and people ran squealing up to top
deck to see it.  I escaped at that time for an hour of sleep,
starting now.</p>
