<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>Today is the last full day of the 52nd PB voyage around the
world; we'll be in Yokohama tomorrow.</p></li>

<li><p>The weather started getting rough yesterday; this big ship is
being tossed gently by the swells.  If not for the experience of
three months, I bet people would be hurling their lunches.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying it, of course.  I went and jumped on top of Yacht
Club, getting some pretty good air at times.  The swells are rather
large and often spray flies up to the top deck.  But the swells
themselves don't reach the top deck.</p></li>

<li><p>In free space there is a "store" set up, where I just chatted
with Slavena and Kremena, the beautiful Bulgarian sisters who I could
suddenly uniquely identify as of about a month ago.  During the whole
49th voyage I couldn't identify each one individually.  During the
first half of this voyage I couldn't either.  But now, bang.  Slavena,
Kremena.</p></li>

<li><p>Also in free space, just talked with Love, from Su-something
Philippines.  Should have written down the city name.  She joined the
ship in July 2005, during the 49th voyage and remembers my face from
that time.  Just asked my name today.</p></li>

<li><p>There's a picture of Eri at that store, from the first day
onboard the ship.  If I were spending money on this voyage, I would
buy it.</p></li>

<li><p>I didn't wake up in time for breakfast; I was up late on GET
Street last night.  Until basically 5am.</p></li>

<li><p>I have now kissed one woman on the ship.  A GET student, but
not one of my students.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't know if Jesse has made a reservation for me to get out
of the country; I need to hook up some internet time to check that.
I wonder if it's faster than molasses right now.</p></li>

<li><p>I have officially spent zero dollars ($0) and zero yen ($±ß)
onboard during this voyage.</p>

<p>In actuality, I have bought two (2) brownies by giving cash to
Carl and putting them on his card.  One brownie was for Rei's 9500th
day.  The other was for Akane's 8000th day, and for being my great
Japanese teacher during the voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't packed shit, but have to be packed within 12
hours.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't know where I'm going to stay when I reach Japan.  I'd
like to ride TJ Bike to Kyoto, but it's fricking COLD in Japan: 12
degrees C.  That's maybe 40 F.  Or, if I remember the formula, it's
about 53.6 F.</p></li>

<li><p>Lunch (breakfast) time now.</p></li>
