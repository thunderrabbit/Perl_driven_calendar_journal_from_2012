<p>Said HI briefly to Eri at 20:35, 5 minutes later than I said I
would meet her, scheduled a 7:30 meditation with her and then went
downstairs to work on writing names for the speech competition
tomorrow.  Tomoe came for a brief bit, then went to Namihei.  I
thought she was going to come back down and say HI, but she didn't.  I
just happened to see her as I was going *up* to tell her I had
finished and was going to bed.  She was like, "aight" and nothing
else; not even a ritual おやすみ.</p>

<p>This is two nights in a row I have not been at the newspaper.
Just flat too busy.</p>
