<p>Happened to see Eri in Yacht Club today; we scheduled a 30 minute
meditation in Sunshine Bar, which today could be called the Raining Cats
and Dogs Bar.</p>

<p>She said Mike said he saw my journal online and I mentioned her
name in Ushuaia, but I don't think I really talked to Eri before
Suva..  Hmmmm.</p>
