<p>Argh.  Talked to Eri a lot tonight; on the day we were in Suva, she
said she has a boyfriend named Mike (she cried when she said how
lonely she has been without being able to see him), so I have been in
"hands off" mode talking to her, but she is just like
so <em>perfect</em>;;; my <em>God</em> how I look forward to having a
partner as cool as her.  How can two parts of my brain be so opposite?
I'm like so jealous of him for having her and so happy for him to have
her and so fucking confuzzled in my head.</p>

<p>What is going on in my crazy mind?</p>

<p>She told me that I wasn't totally wack, but just having normal
desires that everyone has.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>
