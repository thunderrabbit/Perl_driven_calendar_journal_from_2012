<p>Wow!  During lunch today up in Yacht Club, I wish I coulda gotten
it on video, but I couldn't even get my camera out of my shorts pocket
before the staff started cleaning it up, but we had some huge rocking
and an awesomely cool spill:</p>

<p>Picasso was in front of the drink area, where they have three large
plastic dispensers set up for coffee, tea, and water, respectively.
He had just gotten his drink when the boat just went whooooo up like
this and plates started to slide; I lifted our table so it would
remain level; our cups didn't spill.  But the three large drink
containers just came forward, fell off the counter and then when they
hit the floor, the lids popped off and the second stage of the mess
gushed out onto the floor as Picasso danced backwards out of the way,
unscathed.</p>
