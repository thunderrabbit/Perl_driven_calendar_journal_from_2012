<p>Peter (and Peter's Band) brought love, music, light, genkiness,
fun, joyful, beautiful energy to our voyage between Seychelles and
Mombasa.  He and Kumar were shot on 21 March (I believe).  Kumar died
quickly; Peter died some days later.  Today the passengers were
informed about the shooting and Peter's passing.</p>

<p>I just heard a rumor that George (was shot and) died as well.
Wow.</p>
