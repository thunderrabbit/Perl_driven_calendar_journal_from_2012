<p>Nice time diving this morning with Carla and Matt, plus Kellie who
escaped Mark to go snorkeling.  We saw some sharks (3 or 4 small black
fin sharks, and a couple of big lemon sharks) and more fish than I
saw in Acapulco or Seychelles.  This water was way way way hella
clear compared to either of those places.  We were at 80 feet (my new
record) and it was still quite clear.</p>

<p><em>so bummed</em> that my camera battery is dead!  Argh!!!   I
forgot to charge it last night and it simply wouldn't even turn on in
the water.  Crapola.</p>
