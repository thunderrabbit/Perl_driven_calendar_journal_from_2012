<p>Wow.  Long day with no time to write; I'm 40 minutes late for newspaper
meeting now.</p>

<p>Enjoyed watching Emi onstage Emceeing with a guy for this
dance-a-rama dealio; I could tell she was nervous when she was MC, but
not when she was dancing.</p>

<p>I fought with Windows Sucks today: again with shortcuts not
specifying full pathnames, but only relative paths, the most useless
idea in the world.  Also, Excel Sucks couldn't figure out the pattern in
list of sums:</p>

<pre>
=SUM(B1,B2)
=SUM(B1,B3)
=SUM(B1,B4)
=SUM(B1,B5)
=SUM(B1,B6)
=SUM(B1,B7)
=SUM(B1,B8)
=SUM(B1,B9)
=SUM(B1,B10)
</pre>

<p>Seems pretty clear that I want to use B1 each time, right?</p>

<p>I couldn't find a way to keep it from incrementing the B1 each time
I copied the cell formula.  I tried with a macro, but that didn't work
at all; I couldn't even tell *what* it tried to do when I ran it.  I
ended up creating a list of formulas in Microsoft Word Sucks and
importing the list into Excel Sucks.  I'm nearly surprised that
worked.</p>

<p>What *did* work was incrementing times by a specified number of
minutes/seconds (specified in cell B1).  That was a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>We're going to be in Tahiti tomorrow!</p>
