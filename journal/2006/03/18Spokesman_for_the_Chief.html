<p>Today, by semi-jokingly volunteering to be the Chief of the GET
"tribe," I ended up being the spokesperson for the Shizuo, who was
nominated as Chief.  At the cultural exchange, I was given a place
of honor, seated opposite the actual chief of the village who hosted
us as everyone did their dances and such.</p>

<p>They served us cava, which is basically a mixture of dried peppers
(not spicy) and water, which can be prepared to the desired strength
by using more or less water.</p>
