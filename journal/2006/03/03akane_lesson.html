<p>Chowed in Yacht Club once we got back to the ship; Akane came over
for our lesson (which I had forgotten).  We chatted a while and she
worked out my birthdate given my current days old date, and pulled
out the three splinters.</p>

<p>She told me stories about growing up; she was quite a tomboy!</p>

<p>She will be 10,000 days old on 17 September 2011.  She marveled at
the idea of being that old, and I told her the story of having
wondered where I would be in 10 years while gazing out over Houston
traffic, then finding that journal entry almost exactly 10 years
later.  She will probably write a letter to her future self, one for
her 10,000th day, and one for 10 years from now.</p>
