<p>Today I basically recited my Japanese speech from memory; I know
most of it, but still have some trouble with a couple of the new
vocabulary words.  I have really enjoyed studying each day with
Akane.  Today we did Japanese for about 20 minutes and then I gave
her a sneak preview of what I planned to say about Palestine.</p>

<p>After dinner I met Abebe in the hall; I recently met her in the
newspaper, and wanted to talk to her because she is deaf.  Today I
got my chance to say HI to her and found that she knows enough ASL
that we could nearly say more than My Name Is.  She showed all the
signs for the Japanese alphabet, but they are pretty impossible to
pick up quickly.  I'll stick with romanji and ASL.  I told her the
story of how I met Rie in ASL and how we traded language studytime
back in the day.</p>

<p>I also seem to have misplaced my phone (which I use as my handy
pocket watch) this afternoon during the GET Meeting.  I doubt it went
far.</p>

<p>I'm super tired, but am supposed to work on newspaper tonight.</p>

<p>Abebe brought to the newspaper table her diary of a few lines in
English and Japanese; I checked it and returned it to her room.
Their door is decorated with pictures from the voyage augmented with
markers identifying people or making them say various things or
otherwise make them funnier or more interesting.</p>

<p>I drew four small-titles this evening.</p>

<p>Still can't find my phone.</p>
