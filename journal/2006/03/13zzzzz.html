<p>Not many zzzs for me last night; I've been working pretty
diligently on my Palestine presentation.  Or, I have spent a lot of
time wondering wtf I can say in just 1 hour.  Thank goodness it's only
an hour, though; I'm not sure that I could put together a longer
presentation in just a day.  My thing is from 4 to 5pm today.</p>

<p>I slept about 4 hours in GET Room 3 last night.</p>
