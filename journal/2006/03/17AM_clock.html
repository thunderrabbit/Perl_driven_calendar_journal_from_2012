<p>I was surprised last night to find that watching what I thought
was not much of the movie made it suddenly become 2am.   But this
morning I realize I did *not* set my phone clock 23 hours ahead; not
sure how that happened, but when I woke up this morning I was like,
"oh shit!" (*) because I had nearly missed breakfast, plus I had to
write a letter to myself in 10 years.</p>

<p>Got up, wrote it, zipped upstairs and met Funky who checked it for
me while I ate; </p>

<p>(*) "oh shit!" (drawn out and dramatic) is how me-n-Carl greet each
other when we walk into the room, especially when one of us is naked.</p>
