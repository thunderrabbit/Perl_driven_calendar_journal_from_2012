<p>Tony was freestyle rapping with Kentaro playing digeridoo and some
cat with an electronic sampling box-a-ma-jig in the back of Yacht
Club while Eri was helping me with the kanji.  I went over and tried
to bust out a few rhymes.</p>

<pre>
We got Kentaro doin' circular breathin'
I know he didn't learn that shit in one evenin'
</pre>

<p>plus, right after Tony said, "what you got?" and handed me the mic</p>

<pre>
I ain't got nothin
no buns in the oven
cause I been good
not chasin no woman
I been meditatin'
every mornin'
that shit keeps me sane
like the game warden
</pre>

<p>Ridiculous.</p>
