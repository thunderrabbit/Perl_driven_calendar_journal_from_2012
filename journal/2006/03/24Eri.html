<p>Talked with Eri a lot this morning; cried about Peter, meditated,
talked about me chasing women and stuff.  She said I wasn't learning
from my history, which pissed me off because it's true, but I am
getting better.  We talked through that and it's all good.</p>

<p>She's a cool girl. Mike is really lucky.</p>
