<p>Rapa Nui was really nice.  I wouldn't call it my *favorite* port,
necessarily..</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>It was really really really really pretty.</p>

<p>The water is startlingly blue, and quite clear.  It has a small
sandy beach with gentle waves.  It has a lot of rocky dangerous
"beaches" with huge waves.</p>

<p>It's got Moai.  Lots and lots of Moai.</p>

<p>They're just like in the pictures, except real.  And now I can say
I've been there.  Easter Island.  Me.  Francois.  PB.  We did it!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, and in that crystal clear water beach, my underwater camera
wasn't working, so I was shaking it and all sorts of stuff, tried to
take another picture of Francois, and he wasn't there.</p>

<p>Oh shit.</p>

<p>I looked underwater repeatedly, but didn't find him.  I told Carl.
I didn't tell Phil because I was embarassed to say I cared about
Francois that much, plus Phil was having fun pretty far out in the
water.</p>

<p>Petra and Lisa happened by, and I told them to keep an eye out for
Francois.</p>

<p>They were like, "what??  He's gone??"</p>

<p>Carl was all, "hell yeah, Francois saw found himself in the most
beautiful beach in the world and said, 'that's it; I'm stayin' here!'"</p>

<p>I looked and looked, grew weary of holding my breath repeatedly,
submerging and searching, all the while treading water, so I took a
break, floating on my back, having given up and releasing Francois
mentally.</p>

<p>I felt sad about the video team; how was I going to explain to
them / recover a movie after my blunder?</p>

<p>I headed back to shore, continuing to look...</p>

<p>Found him.</p>

<p>"I found him!!"</p>

<p>Wow.  Really happy.</p>

<p>He was flat face down on the sand, not moving; I must have drifted
away from him.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There were some awesome waves on some rocks.  I had to go out and
see them.  I'm really thankful for the opportunity.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There were rumors that four of the GET Ts had posed nakedly on top
of the "mountain" at the Moai quarry.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I ran around barefoot all day, and ended up with three splinters, a
couple of gashes (that did <em>not</em> go deep enough to bleed), and
2 nicks that did bleed.  Well worth a day a foot freedom.</p>
