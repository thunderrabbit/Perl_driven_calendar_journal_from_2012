<p>Breakfast with Hirame this morning; he's the cat who wears cool
glasses and lives on 4th floor.  He told me that Gifu (where he lives)
is famous for mineral water, and the water on the ship is terrible
compared to water back home, but he still has to drink it because it's
too expensive to buy mineral water on the ship.</p>
