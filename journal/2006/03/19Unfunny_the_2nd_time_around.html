<p>My Fantastic Rabbits and Fighting Goats made board games, and I
got Kiichi to laminate them.  He's my Staff GET student and has an A4
sized laminator in room 6002.</p>

<p>Lisa had her classes make some similar games and wanted to get
them laminated, so she goes, "hey Rob, where did you get
laminated? (man, where is my English??)"</p>

<p>"Haha I got laminated in um... room 6002...."</p>

<p>"Really?  What's in <em>there</em>?"</p>

<p>"That's where you can, get.."</p>

<p>she chimed in ".. get laid in there...."</p>

<p>"laminated...  OH!!  Haha, I thought you said <em>laminated!</em>"</p>
