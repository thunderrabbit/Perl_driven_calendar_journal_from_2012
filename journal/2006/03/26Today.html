<p>Graduation ceremony this morning after 30 minute meditation in the
relatively strong wind with Eri on front deck was pretty good.  I was
a bit worried that I wouldn't know what to say, but I winged it pretty
well.  The ceremony didn't last too long in itself, but lots and lots
of photographs taken afterward kept us in there forever....  I went to
lunch with 4 Fighting Goats (Sugar, Ann, Jerry, Eye) (not Emily nor
Carol) in Topaz, and then made origami with Ann in her room until 3pm
when I joined Fantastic Rabbits in Hemmingway for a birthday dessert
session.  Delicious.</p>

<p>During origami, Tomoe from Okinawa popped in for a second as we
were basically unable to figure out how to put the pieces of a ball
together...  I did it in Jerusalem, but couldn't remember how
today.</p>
