<p>Heehee; I like having my days old there.   I'm a palindrome days
old today!</p>

<p>Just finished helping out at the newspaper.  Was given a couple of
new vocabulary words, and perhaps a couple new friends.</p>

<p>Today I wrote a few 小タイトル and filled in the digits and some
shading on my title image that they will use tomorrow.  This brings to
5 the total number of my images in the queue, I think.</p>

<p>I found that two layers of shading makes a neat Lorenz effect, so I
tried to use that in some of the shading, but the shape had already
been filled in some, hiding the effect.  So I used the same two layers
to shade a clock face I've got in one of the 5 queued title images.
It's the one with the rabbit silhouette that タモ cut out last night
when making the title for today.</p>
