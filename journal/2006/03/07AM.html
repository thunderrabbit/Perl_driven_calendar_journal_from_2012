<p>I set my phone clock to 12:something last night when I should have
set it to 00:something.  I still woke up on time, thankfully, and
noticed my error.  Last night I left my computer up in the GET room
that Lisa needs at 8am.  Upstairs now to get it; I'm going to meditate
in my room for 30 minutes now, then chow some breakfast.</p>

<p>I nearly fell asleep a couple times during my meditation, but I
basically made it coherently through 35 minutes.</p>
