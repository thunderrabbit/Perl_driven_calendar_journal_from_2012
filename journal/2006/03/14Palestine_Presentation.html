<p>I did my Palestine Presentation today!  Special thanks to everyone
who encouraged me, and to CCs Yuki and Erika who CCed for me, and to
Petra who loaned me her computer for the presentation.</p>

<p>I didn't get to say nearly as much as I wanted to, but I gave an
overview history from the past 10,000 years, and then told about 2.5
of maybe 5 different things I had planned to talk about.  Had to gloss
over a lot, but still everyone said it was good and many people said
they were interested in hearing more.</p>
