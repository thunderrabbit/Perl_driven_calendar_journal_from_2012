<p class="date">7:35pm HAST Friday 10 March 2006 (day 13134)</p>

<p>Sitting on a bed with Petra in a bungalow in <a
href="http://www.marks-place-paradise.com">Mark's
Place Paradise</a>, a pretty cool place... with bungalows and a BBQ
pit apparently and fun loft-beds with firepoles to get down and up if
one prefers that over ladders...</p>

<p>We just got back from swimming in a huge lagoon (soooooper smooth
water, with waves breaking on some coral(?) off in the distance, but
basically no wave motion where we were) with warm and cold spots,
various color fishies swimmin' around, and various corals growing
various sizes and various degrees of sharpnitude.</p>

<p>We were basically all spread out over a couple acres, and Nick and
I basically agreed (given that we were 60 meters apart) that it would
be a good opportunity to go skinny dipping.  We tried peer pressuring
everyone else into it, and Kazzah was first, Yuuka second, then Matt-o
(way way out toward the sea with his goggles and snorkel) third, and
then most everyone else joined the fun.</p>

<p>I was surprised (and apparently she was too) when Petra swam up to
me and climbed onto me piggyback while I had my trunks in my hand.  We
had clothedly been swimming together around / over various corals
because she was feeling squeamish about the fish sniffing around her
feet.  Hahaha- she's funny!</p>

<p>Everyone is in the communal dining/kitchen area surrounded by beds
with some slow French hiphop on the radio and vegetarians and meat
eaters learning how to cook together and handle everyones' needs.</p>

<p>Yuuka has been forcibly removed from the kitchen more than once
because she's less help(!) <!-- drunk --> than they would prefer.</p>

<p>Mmmmmmm... Petra just gave me some of the fantastic pineapple that
she taught me how to choose today.  (sweet fragrance and easily
plucked leaves)</p>
