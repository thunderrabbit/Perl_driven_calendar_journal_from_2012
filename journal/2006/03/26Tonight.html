<p>In the GET Meeting, we spent some time giving blessings to one
another; it was really a nice exercise, and I learned from a lot of
people that they didn't really know me.  Interesting how I've said
I've felt closer with this group than last voyage, but they don't
know me.</p>

<p>Did the GET Prom tonight; I didn't do a whole lot, but just helped
decorate the Sports Bar.  I'm thankful it wasn't tooo smokey in there
during the event.</p>

<p>Wrote two 小タイトル tonight, and one of them was lost while I
went to top deck to see Michelle perform in some dance troupe.  Some
hip hop style synchronized dance thing.</p>

<p>Saw Rei with Hitomi (Eye) who are now friends (it seems) ever since
Rei killed Hitomi in the 007 game.</p>

<p>Running around trying not to latch onto non-existant waves that
have already passed, and just live in the present moment, doing what I
need to do.  Like the Alphabet Rap with Tony as beat box in Sports
Bar.  I tried a new thing with it, having him say "A" and then do an 8
count beat then "B" and another 8 counts...  it would work pretty well
if we practiced it.  A couple of times, I got synched up so I would
start the corresponding phrase just a half beat after he said the
letter.  Pretty phat.</p>

<p>Then he skipped a letter.  Ooops!</p>
