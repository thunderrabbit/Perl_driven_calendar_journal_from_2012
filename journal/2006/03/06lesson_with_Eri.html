<p>I enjoyed a chance 'lesson' with Eri for about 1.5 hours this
evening, right after my Staff GET with Kiichi.  I had been headed down
to supper in Topaz, but chose to chat with her instead.  She was
studying Spanish up on 7th floor when I happened by; I helped her a
tiny bit with Spanish and we shared some stories in English and
Japanese.  Actually, mostly I shared, and she corrected my Japanese.</p>
