<p>Today has been / was / is being pretty good, I think.  I set up my
computer in GET Room 3 to work on Palestine.  I have set a date for my
Palestine presentation: tomorrow, and then Yuuka was all, "wait;
that's when we have speech contest preparation" which is what I had
already said but people didn't agree, so the thing got moved to the
day after, which is fine with me, cause it gives me another day to
prepare.</p>

<p>The missing element, I decided, was my knowledge of the history of
the region, as in I knew basically nothing.  Looked it up on Encarta,
and Joel gave me some reading material to help.</p>

<p>During Staff GET with Kiichi, I saw Akane, and scheduled to meet
her at 11 in GET Room 3, which is super convenient for me, given that
I will already be there with Fantastic Rabbits' class having just
ended.</p>

<p>Today I put some Fighting Goats' pictures on the network so they
can do show-n-tell tomorrow.</p>

<p>Also today I filled in the gaps on my curriculum from the past 2
weeks; most of which I was able to recreate given the notes I wrote
during class and gave to my students after class.</p>

<p>Today was Indonesia crew day, a cool event put on my Carla and
Laura, and originally the brainchild of Carl and Tony.</p>

<p>Ate dinner between Simon and Thomas, the core of Rhombus, a
up-n-coming musical group from New Zealand.</p>

<p>Gotta call Kiichi to reschedule my lesson with him; I hope I do it
in good time.</p>

<p>Just got back from newspaper where I wrote 2 small-titles, and
noted that one that I drew yesterday was scrapped and redrawn by
someone else.  Ah well.  King (Chieko), who is apparently
super-allergic to mosquitoes, asked about my love life after a
discussion that Funky had described his as "not going well."  I said,
"it's not going well," but I don't know what I mean by that.</p>

<p>I took a phat nap today, but I'm still tired; I'm glad we get an
extra hour tonight; I'm going to go use it now.  Bedtime!</p>
