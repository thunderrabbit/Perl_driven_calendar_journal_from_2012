<p>The pub crawl was pretty well attended; I'm glad about that.  I
went to the sunshine bar, sports bar, and Hemmingway, but escaped
from Hemmingway before that 30 minutes finished; went and hung out
with Emi, wondering how many guys have fallen in love with her, then
went to the newspaper table at 10:30 and filled in the numbers on
Akane's title image, then drew about 4 小タイトルs.</p>

<p>I was unable to solve a 6 piece wooden burr puzzle that a guy
solved.  I got a bit of insight while working on it, but not enough
to eureka.</p>
