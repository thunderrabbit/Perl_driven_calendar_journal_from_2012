<p>Meditated for 30 minutes this morning.  It was hard at times, but
I got through it.  Silence of Body and Silence of Speech meditation.
Not silence of mind.</p>

<p>Studied with Akane for 2+ hours.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Worked on my Palestine presentation.  Good-ish stuff, but didn't
get as much done as I had hoped...  or I didn't hit a very long period
of inspiration.</p>

<p>snagged pictures off my camera.  And Karen's camera for good
measure.  2.65 GB free on my 27.94 GB hard drive now.</p>

<p>Met with Saki.  Confessed that I want to kiss her.  She seemed
unfazed, almost, but understanding.  But unrequiting.  I was like,
"I'm sorry for my thoughts" and she was like, "don't worry; thoughts
in themselves are not bad." and "It's okay, because I won't kiss
you."</p>

<p>I was like, "why not?" and I immediately felt embarassed.  I
cried. I hated that part of my brain that wants to kiss her.  But even
more so hated that part of my brain that asked her why she said she
would not kiss me.</p>

<p>In short, I <em>still</em> have not kissed anyone on the ship, and
my pickin's are lookin' slim.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed nowishly.</p>

<p>And, today is the first of five days in a row where we will set
our clocks back at midnight (or so).</p>
