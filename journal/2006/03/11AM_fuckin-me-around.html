<p>I thought we had a pretty solid plan last night; a few of us are
going diving, and the rest have the option of an island tour.</p>

<p>But Mark, of <a href="http://www.marks-place-paradise.com">Mark's
Place Paradise</a>, has been continually saying we've been fucking him
around by not telling him what we want to do, how many people will
stay, who paid for what, etc etc etc...  to the point that it was
literally the first thing he said to Carla this morning as she was
walking from the main building to the bathroom area.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful area, but I doubt any of us would ever come
back.</p>

<p>Last night I had originally written "I wonder if I'll be able to
get it back," referring to the money, but I changed it to "I
trust..." but now I'm not so sure again.  Wow.</p>

<p>Carla went to support me in talking to Mark.  After I was like,
"Carl ended up not staying here," he interrupted, "I don't know
anything about that; you guys tell me people are staying and he comes
at 9pm and says he's not staying and we have this no refund sign here
and what am I supposed to do? what would you do if you were in my
position?  I do my best to make you guys happy and I no one says thank
you and that girl and her family her parents last night insulting me
and my family; I don't need that; no one needs that; what would you do
if you were in my position? I'm going to call everyone on PB and tell
them not to come here again, because you guys don't
understand, <em>I</em> live in paradise here and you go back to
wherever you live and I live in paradise, so I'm happy to just stay
here but now you're trying to swindle me out of money, and that's not
how you do business; what do you think I should do?  You're the boss,
tell me what to do," Carla did basically all the talking on our side,
which was a very small amount, given that even when Mark said, "I am
listening," he interrupted everything Carla said.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>In the end, he believes he was cheated out of 1800 Francs for
internet (under someone named Jim, who came three times during the
night, but is not from our group), and I think we were cheated out of
2500 Francs for a person who didn't stay.  Carla suggested we call it
even.</p>

<p>She went to get ready for scuba, and I stayed to try and give some
love to Mark in the form of, "I did say thank you; we all said thank
you," etc, but didn't have a chance as he was speaking poorly about us
in French to Roland, who came to take us scuba diving.</p>

<p>I could only wonder about the paradise he's living in his heart
and mind.  Doesn't sound like a very happy place to me.</p>
