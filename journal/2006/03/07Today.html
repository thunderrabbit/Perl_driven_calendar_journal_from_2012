<p>Hmmmm...  It's been a semi-productive day; I discovered the video
team meeting in Yacht Club; I'm reallllly happy to see them taking
this project as their own.  The next step is to import the video onto
some computer, but we've got some hardware difficulties: my disk has
about 2 Gigs free, which I'm pretty sure is *not* enough to edit
video and do a buncha crap like that.  They have computers available,
but not with the input port that came with my video camera.  Hmm;
perhaps Dan has the cable they would need for that.   There are lots
of video cameras on the ship; perhaps we should be asking some other
passengers if we can hook it up on their devices.</p>

<p>English only session with Endo¤µ¤ó was basically a lot of beautiful
photos from Tuvalu, a set of 9 islands that are slowly being swamped
by the Pacific.  The islands are super beautiful, accessible from Fiji
for US$1000, and definitely a place one could find some quiet
time.</p>
