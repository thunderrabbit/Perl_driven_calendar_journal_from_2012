<p>Classes today were pretty good.</p>

<p>I am about to meet with video project team to try and get our video
imported....</p>

<p class="date">3:46pm HST Wednesday 08 March 2006</p>

<p>The meeting was a semi-success: we determined that we were unable
to get my computer to talk to Mutsumi's computer.  Don't know why
exactly, but for some reason the \ key on her computer printed a yen
symbol, and we couldn't find a way around it.  Even cut-n-paste from
the insert symbol table converted the \ to yen.  Doeth.</p>

<p>I didn't try importing it to my computer; I've got 3.6 gigs free,
which is probably enough to import it, but perhaps not enough to edit
it.  I am okay letting them run around with my camera, but not with
my computer, specially since it's not only in English, but in Dvorak,
physically though not logically; ain no way they could very easily
work with my machine.   If they can't find anyone else with a cable
or machine that will work, we can do it on mine; perhaps on the day
after Tahiti.</p>

<p>So I've sent them off to find a body who has a cable that can plug
from my camera to her computer, or find a Mac person with more
storage space on their machine.</p>
