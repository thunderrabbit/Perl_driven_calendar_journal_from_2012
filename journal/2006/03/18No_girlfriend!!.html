<p>I've made this filename show up as an "excited" entry only because
I don't have an "amazing" category.</p>

<p>This morning, laying quietly, following my breathing and wondering
about the significance of the dream, I started to list different
potential girlfriend girls, and thought if my breathing changes,
basically like I "catch my breath" or some physiological change due
to thinking of that woman, I'll know she is of some signficance in my
life.  I listed only women who are on the ship.  Then, for good
measure, I listed Matt, Carl, Dan, and then myself.</p>

<p>The list was about 15 names long probably.  Breathing remained
smooth for all names, including my own.</p>

<p>But:</p>

<p>Just as I thought my name, the overhead speaker PING PONGed its
signal that there was about to be an announcement.  It Ping
Ponged <em>just</em> as I said my name.  I'm taking that as a sign.  I
just need to focus on myself.  Really.  For now, at least.</p>

<p>The ping pong and announcement was the first announcement by
Tokomotosan, the annoyingly slow "soothing" voice of Topaz.  Drives
most GET Ts batty.  But, he's super consistent and probably just what
the Japanese passengers like.  I guess.  But anyway, he *always* ping
pongs and talks right at 7:07 am.  It's just his thing.   This
morning he ping ponged at 6:50 am or so.  Basically there's no way I
could have subconsciously known he was about to ping pong because it
was 7:07.  That shit was magic.</p>
