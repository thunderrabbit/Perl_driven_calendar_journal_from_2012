<p class="dream">Bette Midler was supposed to do an opening act
somewhere, but due to some scheduling opps, she ended up in a hotel;
she talked tothe manager and was able to set up things so she could
use their lobby as the backdrop of her opening.</p>

<p class="dream">Meanwhile, I found two coins, put them into a
machine like at Chuck E Cheese, and got 1270 tickets. I enjoyed
watching them all stack up and turned them all in at the counter; the
prizes were no particularly stellar, but I decided not to donate my
tickts to a ticket collecting charitible organization.</p>
