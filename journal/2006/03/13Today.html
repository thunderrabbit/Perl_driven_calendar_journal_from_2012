<p>Meditated from 6:30ish to 7ish then ate in Yacht Club.</p>

<p>I've just noticed that my computer is set 24 hours forward....</p>

<p>That's better.  Work on Palestine pics now.</p>

<p>IIRC, I didn't work on pictures much, but read a lot of <em>ARABS
&amp; ISRAEL For Beginners</em>, by Ron David and have a bit more
confidence that I can present a presentation worth attending.</p>

<p>It's going to be from 4-5pm tomorrow.</p>

<p>During the day today I heard Carla got the Pre Departure GET for
54th Voyage!!!  So happy for her!  So happy for me to not have to
worry about it; I can just ride TJ Bike around Japan and be free as a
cat on bike.  Maybe this time I will really do it.</p>
