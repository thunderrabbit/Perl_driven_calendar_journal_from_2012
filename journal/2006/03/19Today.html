<p>Busy busy busy busy, but some good shit so far today.  Got the
video imported from my camera to Mutsumi's computer; we were having a
crap of a time getting it without a cable; tried going to Carl's
computer and then exporting, but it was simply not working; for some
reason the initial export failed, and basically the files were too
big.  But we were able to borrow a cable and got it onto her
computer.</p>

<p>Amazingly (?), after we imported it, she was trying to figure out
how to add a text frame (it's going to be a silent movie), Movie
Maker crashed and left NO TRACE of the movie.</p>

<p>Granted, she hadn't saved the project, but, I mean come <b>on</b>,
not even an auto-saved file?  Not even a record of having a project in
progress?  She had to name the project to do the import.  What
happened to <em>that</em>?  Microsoft Windows Sucks.</p>

<p>Met with Akane with the intention of working on my speech, but we
didn't get a private table in Topaz, so we ended up talking to others
at the table.  I met another Îè, which is surprising that she has the
same kanji as Îè who I favored early in the voyage.  (I still like
the idea of Îè, but all hopes have been abandoned.)</p>

<p>Funny how three of the four women I've fancied on the boat are
named Rei, Rie, and Eri.</p>

<p>I've been running around with <em>shoes</em> on (instead of
sandals) because my right sandal is being repaired by the carpenters
on the boat.  I wonder if that means they'll add a big piece of wood
to fix it.....  pretty funny visual there.</p>

<p>Also did a bit of laundry by hand.  My shorts are hanging in the
bathroom, so I put on my other shorts and ripped the shit out of
them, so I tossed them.  I'm wearing my snow pants now.</p>

<p>Been working on speech contest preparations (I'm the tanto for the
contest, not just a participant); by tomorrow we are supposed to have
all the titles.  Actually by the 15th we were supposed to have
collected all the titles, but I don't know what happened to the
days.  It was the 8th, and then suddenly it was the 19th, and I was
like, "oh shit!!!  what happened to the days in between??"</p>

<p>At 5pm-ish, I am supposed to read my letter to self in 10 years.
I wrote it in Japanese; I assume I'll put it in here.</p>
