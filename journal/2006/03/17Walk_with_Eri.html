<p>Wandered around Suva with Eri today.  It basically was overcast but
not rainy while we were out, though it did rain while we hopped online
for a bit.  I sent a message to the cats at the Vippasana meditation
center in Kyoto to see if I can get the meditation registration
situation situated, and sent a brief email to a couple other peeps
(Suzanne, Nihal, Hitomi, Colleen, Fred)</p>

<p>Eri and I sat quietly watching a fountain for a while, then as it
started to rain a bit, I picked a coconut out of the water and
jokingly offered it to her; she refused, as expected; I threw it into
the pool and noted that I nearly hit a toad that had been chillin
until the huge asteroid-coconut nearly dashed his froggy hopes of a
long life.  Looking around the pool, I determined he had no way of
getting out, so I scooped him up and put him on the edge of the
fountain.  He jumped back in, so I figured he must be alright in the
pool.</p>

<p>Rain continued to rain, so we went under a nearby roof thing that
sorta made a public ampitheater for the park.  Wind picked up and
suddenly a decent sized tree branch fell into the fountain!</p>

<p>After the rain went away, we went over to inspect the branch.  It
made a <em>perfect</em> toad-sized bridge out of the pool and onto
dry land.</p>

<p>The universe provides.  The toad remained happily floating in the
water.</p>

<p>Lots more walk walk walking and occassional talk talk talking.
Saw a cool house thing that could be a fort, especially given there
was no easy way to get into it.  Saw several large bats flying,
basically all in one direction like a migration.  Wrote kanji on each
other's backs to see if the recipient could identify them.</p>
