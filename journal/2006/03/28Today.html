<p>Was up too late to meet up with Eri for meditation; I met her at
lunch, though, and she said it was all good; turns out she didn't
even try because we hadn't confirmed a time.</p>

<p>Today is massive cleanup day.  My GET Room roommates have been
cleaning most of the stuff, because I basically had nothing in either
room.</p>

<p>When I went into GET Room 8, I heard a song that brought back a
flood of happy memories and suddenly I was crying.  Sobbing gut
tightening tears; this voyage has been so much fun.</p>

<p>Zoom zoom zooming around trying to get GET rooms cleaned up, turn
in keys, figure out wtf is going on with scheduling: GETs were
presented three times today, meeting at 5:30, Byebye party at 6pm,
formal dinner at 7:45, break, KSB final byebye at 9, 10pm video team
party, 10:30 newspaper, 11:30pm hang with Tomoe, which got pushed back
from 8pm.</p>
