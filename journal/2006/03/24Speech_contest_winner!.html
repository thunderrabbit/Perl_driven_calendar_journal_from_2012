<p class="date">1:33am ChST Saturday 25 March 2006 (day 13149)</p>

<p>Running around crazily near the end of the speech contest, during
which time I presented my speech, which was partially memorized, and
partially forgotten, but I said はるばる and 右往左往 (in the form 
右往左往してしまう事がありました) which I imagine was part of what the
judges described as superior grammar structures.  In short, I won the
best Japanese speech award!!</p>

<p>I was really happy to win, though not particularly surprised
because there were only 4 Japanese speeches, and other people either
didn't memorize or didn't deliver the speech in a semi-natural
manner.</p>

<p>Except that it's 1:41am, and I would like to get up and meditate
tomorrow (at 7:30, but fuckit, I won't because it's only) with the
hopes that えり will be there, though we didn't schedule anything,
now is a pretty good time to transcribe my speech here.</p>
