<p>Classes were pretty good today, though I went a bit long with
Fighting Goats, forgot I had a lesson with Akane at 11, but I gave
them my keys, asked them to lock the door and bring them to me in
Yacht Club.  They took longer than I expected, but it appears they
took the game we had made to Ann's room and then brought the keys.  I
had asked them to bring the game <em>and</em> the keys, so I could get
the game laminated, but I apparently wasn't very clear.</p>

<p>Fantastic Rabbits consisted of working on Peach Boy the whole
time.  They are fantastic!  Got a pretty funny set of pictures to use
for our presentation.  Hint: worst animation ever; we'll just flip
between two static images, each representing the person who is
talking at the time.<p class="dream"></p>
