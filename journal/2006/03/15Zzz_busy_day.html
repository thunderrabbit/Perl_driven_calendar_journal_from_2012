<p>I can barely remember what I did today: two classes went by in a
snap; Akane was sick so no Japanese lesson with her today, but worked
on importing the movie to Carl's computer and then transferring to
Mutsumi's computer, blah blah blah</p>

<p>Hung out with Junko for about 30 minutes; I met her in Chat With
today and we just kept chatting.  Carla's Game Show was tonight, and
I was the answer reader.  I enoyed being silly on the mic, making
noises during the gaps while students conferred, and doing funny
voices to reveal the accuracy of their answers.</p>

<p>Asked Eri if she wanted to wander around with me in Suva, and it
took her awhile to snap that I was actually asking and not just
practicing Japanese or being superficial.  That was sorta funny.  Dan
and I ended up randomly at her table during dinner, so I sat next to
her, though she jokingly said だめです when I asked her if I
could.</p>

<p>_Castaway_ is on cabin TV today, and Dan and I both remember a
different ending: in this version, he just looks down the road toward
the woman's house, but we remember him actually going to her house
and hooking it up with her.</p>

<p>I worked on newspaper today with those newspaper cats, and went to
part of the 1 hour day (with たも), but was highly falling asleep so I
escaped.  She came with, and it almost felt like something could have
been hooked up, but I know nothing good could come of that, so
nothing happened.</p>
