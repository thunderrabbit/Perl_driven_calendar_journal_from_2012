<p>Man.  I'm tired.</p>

<p>Today... today today today, um...  </p>

<p><em>Yesterday</em> I didn't see Eri all day, which seemed a bit
surprising, but when I thought back, there were certainly many days
that I didn't see her before I liked her more than just "she's
pretty."  <em>Today</em> while I was talking to Hiromi and Keiko (I
think those are their names; I met them early in the voyage as the
girls who always asked about Francois.  Their friend Keiko(? (I think
there are two Keikos involved in the trio)) repaired Francois' leg) in
Yacht Club, Eri came through to get water.</p>

<p>I said ひさしぶり, and she sorta smiled I think, but that may be
wishful thinking; she didn't say anything.  Zzing, straight to the
heart; what is going on in my head????</p>

<p>Went downstairs and chilled in GET Room 3, and Kentaro happened
by; we traded namaste-smiles and I said, "I am experiencing a broken
heart," and he was like, "really?  right now?"</p>

<p>"yeah," and I summarized the story, without much context, just:
"she has a boyfriend, which should be the end of the story, but I got
to like her, then today she didn't really acknowledge me, so.."</p>

<p>He smiled; "I think you should just feel those emotions.  I
guess."</p>

<p>"Yeah; that's what I guessed, too."</p>

<p>Heard from the video team: it basically looks like they will be
able to do the movie, and we can just chill out and not worry about
it.  I'm hopin' it will be alllll goood.</p>

<p>We (video team teachers) are super duper fuckin' lucky if the video
team pulls it together with such limited input from us.  Wow.</p>

<p>I repaired my sandal today, but broke a needle in the process.  I
used the piece of dental floss I've been using for a while.  Stabbed
my thumb with the back end of the needle; I had been using some
cardboard as a thimble, but it suddenly stabbed through the cardboard
and into my thumb.  That fuckin' hurt.</p>

<p>Ran around getting Speech Contest titles together.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Met with Akane, but didn't go over my speech; too tired of doing
that, and I'm sure she was getting bored of it.  Talked about random
stuff in Japanese, but didn't really have a "lesson" as such; she went
off to talk to a boy; I don't know details.</p>

<p>GET Meeting was in Sunshine Bar, much to Matt's surprise, and very
short.  </p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Rubbed Kellie's back and shoulders while she sat in front of me on
a deck chair on the pool deck.  We are both horny (can I say that on
here?) and frustrated.  Yargh.</p>

<p>Speedy-chowed Japanese style food in Topaz today; I played the
Topaz Lottery (go in alone and hope to be seated next to someone
interesting) and lost, but go out basically in time to meet Fantastic
Rabbits in Hemmingway at 8pm.  Didn't get dessert in Topaz though.</p>

<p>FRabbits got drinks and we chatted and decided what we would do
for our last class tomorrow; they are going to come visit Fighting
Goats at the end of their class and plan a time for a double-class
party; I hope it will be enteraining for all involved.</p>

<p>Near the end of our chat, Rie (Carol) seemed to be defending
herself against the rest of the class, saying that she didn't like
me, but I don't really know if that was the core of their
discussion.  She did flirt with me a bit.</p>

<p>Goodness knows she's cute, and I've fancied getting close to her,
but I doubt we'd be able to communicate well, and I'm sure I/she would
get tired of her/my abrupt nature when we're annoyed.</p>

<p>Now it's time for the Bulgarian night to begin; I want to see the
beautiful Slavena and Kremena, but I've also got to go to bed, but
I've also got to work on Speech Contest, but I've also said I would
go to newspaper at 10:30.</p>

<p class="date">1:03am MAGT Tuesday 21 March 2006</p>

<p>Bulgarian night was sparsely attended at first, but seemed to pick
up after a bit.  They gave free homemade bread.  I left at 10:30 and
went to newspaper.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Frustration / jealousy at the way they are bypassing the five
perfectly good title images I drew in favor of titles that match a
theme for that particular day.  Jealousy because Akane (my favorite
teacher) was getting to draw the title image for the day after
tomorrow while there is a clear posting: NO MORE TITLE IMAGES; WE
HAVE PLENTY.</p>

<p>I dug into the feelings and recognized that I was taking it to
mean my images weren't good enough.  But I know they are, if only
because I made each of them with lovin' care.  Got a photo of them
and bequeathed them to タモちゃん, who has been instrumental in
getting me involved in the paper at all.</p>

<p>I was getting a bit frustrated at her at first for not accepting
my shoddy work on the 小タイトル today, but then I realized it was at
least as difficult for her to try and explain to me in English how I
should change the image.  She did quite well.</p>

<p>I lost patience again though when she was trying to explain that
though they were good, all my five remaining title images can't be
used because there are only 10 days in the voyage; and she was looking
up words like "compromise" and "consideration" and I was
like, <em>jesus; I fucking understand</em>, but said something like,
"I know these are good; I made them [with love and care].  If you
don't want to use them, that is fine.  I just want to take a picture
of them, and I'll be happy."</p>
