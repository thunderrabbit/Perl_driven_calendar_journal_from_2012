<p>Tonight is the pub crawl from Sunshine Bar at 9pm (oops) to
Hemmingway at 9:30, to Sports Bar at 10pm, then Sunshine Bar again at
10:30 to ??? listening to DJ Tony and someone else spin.</p>

<p>I don't *realllly* want to go, but Carla organized it, so I will
definitely come for the first part.  Except that part which I've
already missed; shit.</p>
