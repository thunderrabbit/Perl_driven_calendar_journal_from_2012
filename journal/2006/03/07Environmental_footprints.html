<p>There's a man named Endo (or maybe it Ono) on the ship; his island
is slowly being overtaken by rising ocean levels, so he's been talking
to people about the environmental cost of plastics and waste.
Everyone has been invited to bring one item that they brought on the
ship but don't need anymore, tell why they needed it, and why they no
longer need it.  I don't know if it will be more than educational;
perhaps a junk swap could be engineered from this.</p>

<p>I recognized something: Until now I had been using the same piece
of dental floss for about a week or 2 weeks at a time before getting a
new one.  (I use Glide, which does not shred, and gets in between
tightly packed teeth.)  I had been embarassed about reusing dental
floss just to save a fraction of a penny, but....  now I realize
there's another good reason to reuse it.  It's better for the
earth.</p>
