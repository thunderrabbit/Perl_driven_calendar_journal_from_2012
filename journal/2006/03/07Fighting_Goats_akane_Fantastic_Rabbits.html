<p>Classes were pretty good today, and I'm glad that Matt came to
Fantastic Rabbits instead of Fighting Goats; the Rabbits didn't get
scared as I think Goats might have.  But Rabbits kept on chattering
and working on stuff, so it was alll good.</p>

<p>Between classes my Japanese lesson with Akane started in Yacht
Club, but moved down to Topaz because she wanted the fish.  She said
her friends and her brother's friends crash over at her (parents)
house all the time, and basically gave me an open invite to do the
same.  Wow!</p>

<p>She lives in Chiba, which is near Tokyo, and means something rude
in the dialect spoken in Western China.</p>
