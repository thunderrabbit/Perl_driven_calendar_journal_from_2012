<p>I was going to call this file something like Summary of my
spiritual thoughts, but Summary comes before Unsettled, the name of
the other file from today, so I thought </p>

<p>fuck all that.</p>

<p>Okay. I believe we have countless lives; I've experienced parts of
about four of my previous lives.  One as a pirate, the first mate on
this pirate ship where we were on a voyage supposed to be our big
payoff, and we got a pile of money and I retired and just lived out my
days in debauchery.  Another as a oaf of a man, whose job was just to
help an old spiritual healer who lived on a mountain.  I couldn't even
ride the donkey, but just walked down the mountain road with it and
the wagon, got supplies on her shopping list, brought it all back.
Third one was in the civil war, where I remember leaving my wife in
tall flowing black hair and flowing white dress and lots of kids on
the porch, having to go to a war I didn't even understand, or know for
what we were expected to fight.  I was killed by a man who stabbed me
with his bayonette in the abdomen, but from behind, on the left side.
I recognized him as Forest, a friend of mine from this lifetime.
Another life was during a more modern war (Vietnam comes to mind)
where my buddy wasn't listening to my instructions, and he got torn
in half by the backblast from the gun he improperly loaded.</p>

<p>Ram Dass is a cat who I admire.  He seems to have done some stuff
that I think I'd like to do.  I've not met him yet, but he's on my list.</p>

<p>I used to think meditation required emptying the brain, but part
of the book I just read (snippet from We're All Doing Time) talked
about body-meditation, where the brain can do any crazy thing it
wants, but we just focus on not moving the body.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  That's totally new to me, so I thought I should write this
before any other new thoughts infect my brain before I've done a data
dump of all my spiritual beliefs.</p>

<p>One reason I've never 'done drugs' is that I want to reach that
amazing point of awareness just through meditation, with no shortcut
methods.</p>

<p>I reject Christianity outright because it doesn't make sense to me.
I don't appreciate a God who will dole infinite punishment for finite
sin.  The idea of Adam and Eve's sin of chowing the apple was only as
bad as an infant not listening to his/her parent.  They hadn't done
anything "wrong" before, they didn't know God as different than a
parent or boss, why should they listen to God?  Why shouldn't they
test their boundaries?  One bite = infinite
punishment.... preposterous.  Unacceptable.</p>

<p>When people ask why I believe I can exist outside my body, I tell
the story about how I found myself with my legs folded over my head.
I thought "my legs are over my head" then I thought, "wait a minute;
my legs can't *do* that!" but they were there, no doubt about it.  I
recognized my legs were out of my body, and I tried to will myself the
rest of the way out, but I seemed stuck at the head.  Eventually my
body floated back down and rejoined my physical body.  Smooth
transition and vibrationally and really fuckin' cool.</p>

<p>If my legs can be outside of me, the rest of me can, too.</p>

<p>Plus, they may officially be just anecdotal, but there's a lot of
stories about NDE that seem to match, and don't include damnation
from other beings.</p>
