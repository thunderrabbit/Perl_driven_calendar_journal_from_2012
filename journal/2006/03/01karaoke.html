<p>Cross Dress Karaoke was tonight.  I escaped earlier than it ended
officially because the sports bar was getting smokey, but really
because I was feeling antsy again, similar to earlier today.  Saki
came through a couple of times and I like locked on to our high five
hello and didn't want to let go, but I did after not too long; what
is the huge attraction?  Accupuncture?  Her smile?  Her height?</p>

<p>Wearing my white gown from Jordan, I was on time to karaoke, but
not nearly as dolled up as Phil and Carl, er Phillipa and Carla, who
stole the show when they walked in an hour+ later wearing dresses and
wigs and lip stick plus mascara.</p>

<p>I can think of every excuse not to stay in Yacht Club; I didn't
feel comfortable wearing my glasses (so I put on my contacts); don't
want to be in the smoke; they don't have any songs I like to sing:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>"Rabbit Run" Eminem</p></li>

<li><p>"Business" Eminem</p></li>

<li><p>"Lose Yourself" Eminem</p></li>

<li><p>anything at all by Eminem</p></li>

<li><p>"Baby Got Back" Sir Mix-A-Lot</p></li>

<li><p>"Paul Revere" Beastie Boys</p></li>

<li><p>"Eggman" Beastie Boys</p></li>

<li><p>"New Style" Beastie Boys</p></li>

<li><p>anything at all by Beastie Boys</p></li>

<li><p>...</p></li>

<li><p>...</p></li>

<li><p>...</p></li>

<li><p>"The Distance" Cake</p></li>
</ol>

<p>They had "Faith" by George Michael, so I sang that.</p>

<p>I want to be the star; I want to be loved; I want I want I want.</p>

<p>So I left, and almost went straight downstairs, but decided to go
up to see if stars were visible from top deck.</p>

<p>Akane was visible in the sports gym, so I went in and said HI to
her; we're going to walk around, practice Japanese and English, (and
scope stars?) in a bit after she finishes her shower.</p>
