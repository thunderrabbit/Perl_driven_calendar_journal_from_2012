<p>Tonight, again, we get an hour back.</p>

<p class="date">11:17pm HAST Wednesday 08 March 2006</p>

<p>Went up to top deck after the GET Meeting; chatted with Rie from
49th, Ann (of Fighting Goats), and Ryo (Ann's roommate).  I was quite
happy for the attention, though I was careful to not (really) flirt
back.</p>

<p>Worked on organizing names of students who will be in the speech
contest, but forgot something, so I ditched it until after going to
top deck to watch No Music No 52nd.</p>

<p>No Music No 52nd was tonight; I went to just part of it; stood up
on the jacuzzi and was pleased when Saki said HI.  Sat with her a bit,
though we didn't say all that much.</p>

<p>Went back down, finished the speech contest things, then went up to
Peace Center and did some of the 小タイトル for the paper this
evening.  About 4 of them, I think.</p>
