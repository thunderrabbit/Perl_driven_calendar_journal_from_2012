<p>Made the corrections, turned in the thing, discovered that I had an
extra hour, chatted with Effie in Reception about the Greek party last
night (I didn't attend because it wasn't free) where she danced on a
table near the end and about ports on upcoming voyages, went back to
Yacht Club and chowed a bit while chatting with Eri.  Her English is
really good; she spent three months in Sydney.  We traded word jokes
and talked about ports and stuff; she seems pretty fun.</p>
