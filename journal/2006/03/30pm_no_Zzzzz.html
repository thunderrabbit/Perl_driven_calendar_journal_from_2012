<p class="date">11:17pm JST Thursday 30 March 2006 (day 13154)</p>

<p>Back in Jesse's house.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Took them forever to get sorted for the immigration interviews,
which literally amounted to them telling me, "here is your visa; it's
good for 90 days."</p>

<p>Ate breakfast while waiting for them, during which time God graced
me with a couple who invited me to stay with them in their cottage
near Mt Fuji, which is basically on the way to Kyoto. Y and K
¾®ÎÓÍÍ¡£ Perfect!</p>

<p>While helping passengers get off the ship, occassionally taking
pictures or hugging as requested, I was blessed with another offer to
stay during my trip, this time from a woman named Nachiko in Odawara,
which (from my experience) is a decent stopping place away from Tokyo
for an easy day ride.</p>

<p>We were stationed at the exit; our job was to take luggage from
the ship to the end of the boarding ramp.  Easy easy easy job today.
So thankful for it instead of hauling boxes out of rooms!!</p>

<p>Lisa, Petra, several staff and I were there.  Lisa and I played a
couple rounds of The Jackie Purdy Game.  I won the round of songs
about war, and she won the round of songs from TV shows.</p>

<p>Around 12pm we were freed from duty and zipped downstairs to chow
lunch.  I sat with Kellie, who didn't stay for the whole meal because
we had to be Off The Boat by 1pm.</p>

<p>I stayed, though I switched tables when Matt was like, "I think we
need to get going," and I jumped up before my dessert, but then found
them still eating so I sat down at their table (Matt, Carl, Carla)
and ate dessert, served by Slavena.  Twice.</p>

<p>Much laughter as we entertained the idea of being called over the
intercom by name to get the hell off the boat, but Carl continued in
all seriousness to say we were all good, citing the scheduled boarding
bridge removal time as 1:30pm.  "That's nearly an hour away."</p>

<p>I bailed and he stayed, as Phil and Tony <em>came in to eat</em>
(though I don't know if they stayed), and Carl was saying, "c'mon
guys, let's see how far we can push it." (or something quite like
that).  <em>Oh Shit, Dawg, You Be Gettin' Kurazyy!!</em></p>

<p>Went down to get my stuff and discovered Carl still had not
finished packing (as in his bags were not packed so he could just run
in, grab them, and run out), grabbed my shit, took a photo, ran
out.</p>

<p>The rest in a blur:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shouted "goodbye _________" to various rooms on my way from the
favela to 7th floor: Topaz, GET Street, Hitomi's room (my only student
on 6th floor), Broadway, Peace Center, Free Space, Winjammer, Sports
Bar, then down to reception</p></li>

<li><p>Turned in my key at reception as Chika was hand signaling to usher us out</p></li>

<li><p>Was surprised to find Eri still on the ship!  I thought she was
getting off in Yokohama, but no.  She gave me a hug and I told her to
email me.</p></li>

<li><p>Got off the boat, remembered my coat in GET office, ran back
to get it.  Yuuka had it out on the chairs next to reception.</p></li>

<li><p>Declared nothing at customs (no lie), but then lied that I had
onward travel booked.</p></li>

<li><p>Found Kellie's husband Go waiting for her, used his cellie,
called Jesse, who said I could probably crash at his crib tonight.</p></li>

<li><p>Found Hitomi waiting patiently; she helped me get my big box
takubined to Jesse's apartment.</p></li>

<li><p>She waited while I ran around hugging and saying Bye to peeps:
Saki, Emi, Akane, Tae &amp; Emi (plus Tae's mom), Yuka, Keiko,
Hiromi, Akiko (I basically forgot their names during the voyage, but I think
those are right), Ozako, Erika, more</p></li>

<li><p>helped Dan, Carl, Carla get stuff takubined.</p></li>

<li><p>went up to see departure.  tears; running from one end of the
ship to the other with many many byebyes and I Love You's exchanged in
various forms of voice and hand motions.</p></li>

<li><p>Found Tomoe, arranged to join her group in China town.
Invited Hitomi.</p></li>

<li><p>Took a long time to finally get out.</p></li>

<li><p>Went with Hitomi, Rie, Tomoe out to China Town.  Ate lunch.
Surprised to hear Rie and Tomoe wanted to Talk privately; I had had
visions of saying bye to Tomoe at the last minute as she had to
leave.</p></li>

<li><p>Left Chinatown; met two gaijin women in Minato Mirai station;
they looked lost.  We greatly enjoyed chatting with them and
promising they had every right to be lost.  One of them has a
daughter who's teaching English in Takasaki.  The daughter's
situation is similar to mine: three years here, and can't really go
back: "what the heck would I do back at home?"</p></li>

<li><p>They had JR rail passes, and had enjoyed the shinkansen to
Kyoto, saying the passes paid for themselves in one day.  We helped
them decide a destination after hearing the type of stuff they wanted
to see and do.  We settled on Harajuku (which they mentioned as a
suggestion from a friend) and took them their via Tokaido line from
Yokohama to Shinagawa (where I tried to give them just enough detail
that they could find their way from Yamanote line to Shinkansen on
their way back (but then later realized they could come up the stairs
on a far end of Yamanote line, where it might appear significantly
different (but as I write this, feel sure they would have handled that
no worries)), then Yamanote as far as Shibuya where I just scribbled
the final scribbles of a map to get them situated in Harajuku between
Meiji Jingu &amp; Yoyogi Park, and the crazy cutsey area that I said
they would not be able to imagine the outfits they would see there.  I
reallly really hope they arrived no problem, enjoyed themselves, and
could get back to Tokyo station in time.  (hint hint: <a

me!</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Helping them put me in a really happy mood, and almost
certainly set up Hitomi and I for a nice evening: I had started out a
bit stressed in China Town, and was worried about running around alone
with Hitomi, but everything turned out perfectly.  My lost friends
were angels for me at least as much as we were for them.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitomi and I hung out in Shibuya, where we ate overpriced
cheese cake (70% funded by her), while she did a good job of asking
questions, and I told her some stories of the voyage and plan for the
immediate future: hear back from the meditation center, go meditate,
hopefully figure out what to do next, ignore the detail of not knowing
how I'm going to get tickets to leave the country within 90 days,
probably never be on PB again, given their policy of paying 3rd time
teachers but having quite a big enough selection of 2nd time teachers
who would like to go.</p></li>

<li><p>Bye to Hitomi, who played it 100% cool, and I realllly
appreciate it.</p></li>

<li><p>Hello to Jesse (and Mike, Jeff, Kuriko, Hitomi, Steve, Rick
from his church bible study), who funded my dinner at El Torito, plus
bowling, and I realllly appreciate it.  Jeff wouldn't talk to me; he
literally walked away (nervously?) as I was asking him how he arrived
in Japan, etc.  Rick is jobless now, living off savings from being a
programmer in Japan for a while (his Japanese must be superlative).
Kuriko asked me quite a few questions about PB, and said she may look
into it once she quits her job.  Her English is quite enough for her
to be a CC.  Steve quoted verses from the bible and generally got on
my nerves starting with snidely stating we had met before when I
asked his name (I don't care about just that, but when he's all, "I'm
a Christian blah blah blah" talking about how he follows the example
of Christ, acting all like he's super great, BUT doesn't forgivingly
tell his name again when asked, I'm thinking he's a jerk.)</p>

<p>However, he did treat Jesse to dinner, who treated me to dinner,
so Steve paid for my dinner, and I called it a true blessing.  He
said it was a blessing from the lord, and not from him.  I didn't
point out that I had already acknowledged that.</p></li>

<li><p>Jesse's party at the bowling center, where I bowled all sorts
of crazy ways in order to keep my spirits high even if my score was
low (if I tried to compete, I would be upset if I didn't win, so I
just didn't compete).  I bowled a few super slow balls, a few super
fast balls, left handed, palming, backspin all the way down the lane,
and a backwards granny frame, but my favorite was bowling from next to
my chair where I could bowl, then instantly sit down before the ball
even made it half way down the lane.</p>

<p>37 points!</p></li>

<li><p>Zipped back to Jesse's so he could make a phone call, and super
blessed to have free internet, laundry and a bed, if just for a night
and day.</p></li>
</ul>
