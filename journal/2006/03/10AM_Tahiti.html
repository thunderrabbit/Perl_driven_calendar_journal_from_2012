<p class="date">9:17am HAST Friday 10 March 2006 (day 13134)</p>

<p>Supa thanks to Carla for loaning me some cash for the rest of the
voyage, until some unspecified time in the future.</p>

<p>Most of the GETs and some CCs will be going to Moorea (sp) island
for the night. I need to write a Rob Update, but nearly have no idea
what to say.</p>
