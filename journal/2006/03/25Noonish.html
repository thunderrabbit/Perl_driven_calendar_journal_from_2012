<p>Getting some shit done today; got most Fantastic Rabbits to say
they can come to Yacht Club at 3pm for a picture we need to take.
Threw some crap away..  Need to get lunch and find Carla's CD.  She
also remembers Carl having asked for it and told me not to stress too
much about it.  Or not to feel sole responsibility.</p>

<p>Haven't found Alice yet to tell her to meet at 3pm.</p>

<p>Lisa wants to borrow my computer, but I'm a bit hesitant; I have
had to track her down to get things back from her.</p>
