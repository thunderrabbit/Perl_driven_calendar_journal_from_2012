<p>7:30am to 8:00am meditation with Eri on top of Yacht Club, facing
the sun, slowing becoming soaked with sweat.  I fell asleep a few
times during the experience, mostly toward the end.  Felt an
inescapable urge to just <em>wiggle</em>, which I somehow overcame,
except one of the times I fell asleep, I was woken up when my index
finger spasmed.</p>

<p>Breakfast in Yacht Club and then chatting on the top deck, told her
about Tomoe and how my feelings were affected by Tomoe's invitation to
go walk around today.  Have an intention to remain mindful and
centered.</p>
