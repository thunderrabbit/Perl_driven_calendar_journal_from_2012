<p>Told Carla about Chez jumping; it just came to me as I was
wondering why I felt sad.  I think I'm just super self-centered; I
can't ask questions of people.  "You mean make conversation?" asked
Carla; "yeah... I'm really good at answering questions and talking
about myself,"  "Ah; that's where we differ; when someone asks me a
question I'm like, 'blabla, but enough about me; how about you???'"</p>

<p>Also today, the GET Project Presentation went really well.  I'm
really proud of Fantastic Rabbits' fantastic performance of Peach
Boy; everyone seemed to enjoy it.  The video starring Francois was
equally money.  Awesome!</p>

<p>I've been up too too too late watching movies with Kellie, Liz and
Dan (40 Year Old Virgin) and then part of Final Fantasy VII, which
seems interesting, but not enough to keep me up for the whole thing.
Dan went to sleep, but said it's really cool (but only if one has
played the game).</p>

<p>I've gotta go to bed soooooooooon.</p>
