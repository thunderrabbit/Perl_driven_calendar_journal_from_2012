I found an organization that needed adults to chaperone youth to
different countries around the world.  I applied, and they were like,
"how much in-country experience do you have?"  And I was like,
"ummmm, I'll call you back."

So I decided to go to Japan for a year and then call them back.  I
knew fully that going to Japan for a year would open myriad doors for
me and I might never call them back, but I wouldn't be worse off for
having gone to Japan.

<p>I just found this in a letter I wrote to Tammy in October 2004.  I
had totally forgotten about that organization!  I think I'll need to
get my Japanese a bit stronger before I call them back.</p>
