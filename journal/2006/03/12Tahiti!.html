<pre>Hello Tahiti and the rest of the world!!

Thanks to everyone who has sent me updates!

We have arrived in Tahiti today, and the place seems quite beautiful. Even the port
is nice, and they are usually not all that great compared to the rest of their
respective cities.

The recent days are like a blur; I can hardly remember enough to put together a
&#34;summary,&#34; since I don't even know when I last wrote, BUT I know I didn't get to an
internet cafe in Rapa Nui, so I'll start with that story.

Rapa Nui is the local name for what I've always known as Easter Island.  It's
dubbed the most remote inhabited island in the world, and has a pretty amazing
history, due in large part to that distinguished honor.

Apparently, the civilization that made the enigmatic (*) heads (called Moai) used
up all the island's resources to the point that the civilization collapsed (similar
to what may have happened to the Mayans), and has never recovered.  There is a
quarry of unfinished Moai on one corner of the island; they were just abandoned as
if no one noticed the imminent collapse.

(*) first time I've used the word 'enigmatic' in a sentence.

In our 7 hours on the island, we saw several moai, large waves crashing on large
rocks, two volcano calderas, more moai, and a lovely beach with super calm water.

In the water at this beach I had my underwater camera and Francois. For some
reason, the camera stopped working, and I lost track of Francois.

Oh man.  Francois; where are you???  I searched and searched, until I just got too
tired from holding my breath underwater and trying to find him.  I gave up. 
Floated on my back, releasing Francois to the world, becoming one with the idea of
admitting to everyone who would ask about him that I lost him.

Thanks to Petra and Lisa for helping look for him.

Our time was up; we headed back, and I found Francois.  Just like that.  Face down
on the bottom.  So happy!

After Rapa Nui, 6 days and 5 timezone changes to Tahiti!  Went swimming in a huge
lagoon last night and saw a waterspout (tornado) a couple of kilometers out on the
water!  Scuba diving this morning with sharks and more fish than I saw in Acapulco
or Seychelles, and the sea floor completely covered in coral.  Really nice, and
pretty bummed that my camera wasn't working; I forgot to charge the battery last
night.

Super short, but our time is shorter!!!!

   Love Love Love
