<p>I barely snuck in to dinner in Topaz today; wrote Olena a positive
comment card after she got me a meal.  I ended up with three and 1/2
desserts, though 2 halves were shared by Matt and Karen.</p>

<p>Sat with Carla and Petra at the ending moments of mealtime.  Petra
was like, "are you interested in going to the dance?" and I was like,
"kinda" or something like that, and we discussed what I meant by
that.  Basically, "until you mentioned it, I had no idea it was even
scheduled; I still have no idea what it's supposed to be, and I don't
particularly have plans to go.  But, if I remember it once I finish
my desserts, I may go."</p>

<p>"How good is your short term memory?" inquired Carla.</p>

<p>Eight young women and four limber men danced and sweated on stage.
Plus the alpha male and female, then a band to jam the jams.</p>

<p>I joined them for all three songs that they invited audience
participation.  I have no pictures of me dancing, but I may be able to
get one.</p>
