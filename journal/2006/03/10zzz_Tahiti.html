<p>I snuggled Kellie for a bit while she fell asleep last night, but
then left about 20 minutes after Laura came.  Laura had already called
Kellie's bunk for sleeping purposes.  We each spooned a bit, but there
was not really room enough for three to sleep.</p>

<p>Carl scammed sleeping arrangements with Lisa's parents in a luxury
hotel up the road.  I had already paid for his accomodations here,
and I trust I'll be able to get that back.</p>
