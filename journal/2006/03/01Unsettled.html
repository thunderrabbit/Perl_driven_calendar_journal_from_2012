<p>I'm feeling unsettled.  Antsy.  Want hugs, or to cry.  Don't
really know why.</p>

<p>So tempted to seek Saki or Rei, both of whom I saw in the past 10
minutes.  But I didn't follow them.  Just barely.</p>

<p>Sit.  Meditate.  (what does meditate mean???)</p>

<p class="date">3:54pm CST Wednesday 01 March 2006</p>

<p>I stood for about 5 minutes in my best version of Tadasana, the
standing yoga position that Catherine taught me back in Houston.</p>

<p>I felt finished, opened my eyes, turned to my closet, and opened
it.</p>

<p>I thought, "what am I doing?"</p>

<p>Paused a minute, "oh yes, getting the book <em>Shaving the inside
of your skull</em>"</p>

<p>Reached into the closet and pulled it out.  "Oh, this is <em>We're
All Doing Time, a guide to getting free</em>"</p>

<p>Pulled it out and then pulled out the book I sought originally.
Began reading _We're All Doing Time_, and find it perfectly applies
to what questions I was having.  I opened randomly and found answers
to "how to meditate".</p>

<p>I have a feeling that a life change is about to begin.</p>

<p>Just wanted to capture it.</p>

<p>Didn't even open _Shaving the inside of your skull_.</p>
