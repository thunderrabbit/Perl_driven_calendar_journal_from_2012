<p>Ugh.  My guts are all awash in butterflies with the speech
contest, and I don't mean about doing my speech.  Well, not totally.
I'm mostly worried about the competition itself; I think everything
is all lined up to go, but I have a fear that people are going to be
all, "hey Rob what about this? and this?  and this????" and I'm going
to be like, "I dunno; I don't care.." or worse, that the decisions I
make will be wrong or perceived as wrong.</p>

<p>What silliness.</p>

<p>The first half of the show went well; Matt and Yuuka saved my ass
a lot, and Matt wasn't really impressed with that.  I basically
didn't delegate anything and tried to do it all myself and wasn't
able to do it.  It's just so impossible for me to speak up in the GET
Meetings; I feel so shut down every time I try.  What the fuck is
that about????????</p>

<p>But also, the fuckin' person who said she would help hasn't
helped, but <em>wrote her speech</em> while we were getting ready for
the competition, and not only that, is like, "I've got something to
say so my speech is way long, so don't ring the bell and cut me off
at 2 minutes."  (which was the agreed-upon time limit for all
speeches).  Grr.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in a killer-samurai-warrior mode, ready to destroy
anything that gets in my way, though that's greatly muted by the
desire to maintain some semblence of sanity and mindfulness in this
process.</p>

<p>As a result, I notice myself completely</p>

<p>completely</p>

<p>completely distracted from chasing women around the boat, (except
that I notice I'm distracted from it); I don't care about Emi,
Tomoe,..  haven't even thought about Saki in ages.  Who were the
others?  Rei?  Over it.  Rie?  Over it.</p>

<p>Man, I'm in a fuckin' rough mood.</p>

<p>7:30 now; time for a fast dinner then back to the speech contest.</p>

<p>SUPER special thanks to Kellie and Pepe for getting the awards
printed.</p>
