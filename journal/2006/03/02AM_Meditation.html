<p>"I've decided that I'm going to meditate each morning," I
announced to my roommates, knowing that I should explain my planned
change in behavior, "so if you see me with my head up in the ceiling,
that's what I'm doing."</p>

<p>Carl goes, "if you see me levitating 1 inch above my bed...."</p>

<p>Hahaha "yeah, take my picture, but don't talk to me."</p>

<p>"Hey Rob!"</p>

<p>&lt;whump&gt; "yeah?"</p>

<p>"Uh, you <em>were</em> floating above your bed."</p>
