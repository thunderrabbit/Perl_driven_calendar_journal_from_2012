<p>Last voyage, I was in bed basically all day on Sports Day.  This
day, it looks like I will be involved.</p>

<p class="date">11:53am PST Monday 06 March 2006</p>

<p>Spring team is doing okay; we are in second place with 210 points,
but the leaders have 290 points and the two tied-for-last place teams
have 170 points each.</p>

<p>I competed in the mass jump rope (get about 20 people jumping at
once) and am embarassed to report the rope hit me once.  Not so bad
out of about 20 or 30 rotations, but I thought I could do 100%.</p>

<p>Our girls won the "stick pulling" race, which is actually a stick
grabbing race.  Our boys lost that game.  We did so-so in the tail
stealing competition.</p>

<p>I acted about a second too late to save some cat's glasses when
they came off in the stick grabbing melee.  They came off, and then
got crunched before I could get off my ass to get to them.  Shouldn't
have hesitated when they came off, but oh well.  At least I was
foresightful enough to *not* wear my own glasses today, given that I'm
in the apparently most aggressive event, with 1 guy riding a "horse"
of three guys, and trying to steal headbands off other riders.
Apparently a technique is to trip the other horses.</p>

<p>Lunch break now until 12:50pm.</p>

<p>Sports Day is over; we came in second, and for the first time in
apparently a really long time, Winter team came in first.  Usually
they lose, so it's really cool to see them win.</p>

<p>I had fun as one of three people in the base of a horse thing; we
didn't win, but it was a good struggle. The girls seemed more
aggressive than the guys!</p>

<p>Maruan and I were happy to be invited to compete in the tug-o-war;
our team won that game.  When we won, I didn't cheer, though I
reflected the happy greetings given to me from other teammates;
winning didn't seem like a big deal; we just pulled the rope and that
was it.</p>

<p>The winning team will get a 飲みほだい in Namihei for an hour
tonight.  Yuki joked that it was an all the <em>water</em> you can
drink.</p>
