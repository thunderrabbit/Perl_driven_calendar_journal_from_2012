<p>We will go into a new timezone tonight.</p>

<p>Last night I helped up in the newspaper office; wrote a couple of
title images.  Gazed at Saki's graceful beauty as she worked with some
others on the GO-TA-NI project, a collaboration of individual
artists.</p>

<p>This morning I meditate not for a full 30 minutes (giving lots of
blessings to ロシェル from the end of my UH days, and wondering what
our lives would have been like had we (I ?) chosen to keep the baby)
because I was super tired and didn't wake up in time, then chowed a
bit at the last minute in Yacht Club, wondering why I seem to want
Rei, and realized I just want *someone*, which is the <em>exact same
thing</em> Maggie says I said before, when I didn't have a
girlfriend.  I'm glad to be aware of this pattern.</p>

<p>I think I'm on the right track with my mind/spirit/meditation
dealio; I took time for myself this morning: did a bit of laundry and
cleaned the cooling fans for my computer in an attempt to revive the
one that stopped.</p>

<p>I believe I should work (a lot) on my Palestine presentation,
though right now I am going to engage the masses on the ship during
the ドキドキ meet the guests thing in 5 minutes.</p>

<p class="date">11:52am HAST Sunday 12 March 2006</p>

<p>Did it, and am glad I did; I know now whose lectures I'd like to
attend.  Plus I remembered to take the game boards to Kiichi for
lamintation.</p>
