<p>Just watched a video on Japan from before WW2- a video called
something like "colorful Japan" because they claim people thought
there was no color video from Japan before 1945.</p>

<p>But the video was presented as just visual, and then the audio was
a lecture given to a small group of English and Japanese speakers
about WW2, trying to combine the perspectives from US, Japan, and
German points of view.</p>

<p>Way too much information for me to get 10% of it, but I got some,
during the time I wasn't sleeping on Francois as a convenient little
pillow.</p>

<p>Going to lunch now and then gotta meet Kiichi in Yacht Club for a
lesson.</p>
