<p>Been strangely busy today, but not particularly getting shit
done.  Chatted with Eri during lunch; she told me how to say ㄤㄟㄟゥ
仍午卞云誼中毛允月﹝ 中歹中﹥誼中=celebration</p>

<p>Set up the YRUU account on my computer to let Lisa use iMovie on
it so she can import some video.  I don't think I have enough disk
space for her to do it though.</p>
