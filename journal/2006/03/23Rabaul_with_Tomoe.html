<p>People in PNG impressed me with their friendliness.  Everyone said
Hello and many people asked our names or where we were from, or about
the ship or how long we'll be here...</p>

<p>Tomoe and I took Bus (van) 1 to Kokopo, so we could hang out on the
beach.  The beach was narrow and dirty, but it had a lot of coral,
though there was rubbish in the water.  We hung out for a bit, and
then were invited over to some shade below some trees where we hung
out with people who chewed beetelnuts, making their teeth disgustingly
red... I was pretty turned off by it, and didn't even try a nibble,
especially since I had heard it tastes bad.  Tomoe tried some; she
found it bitter and dry.</p>

<p>We met Owen and some women and lots of kids, who all sat around us
like we were interesting, though we didn't do much of anything.
Tomoe engaged the kids a lot; I just said HI to them and chatted some
with Owen.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to "just step foot" on a foreign land.  I told
him about Margaret, whose job entails being flown to foreign lands
and riding ships back to PNG.  I offered to try to introduce him to
her if he came back to Rabaul with us, but he chose not to.  Also the
bus (van) was really full.</p>

<p>Chatted and chilled with Tomoe and asked about likes and dislikes,
hopes and dreams.</p>
