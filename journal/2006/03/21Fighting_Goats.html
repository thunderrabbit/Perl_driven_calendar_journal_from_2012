<p>Fighting with Fighting Goats right now, on the last day of
class... not <em>fighting</em>, but trying to think of a song.</p>

<p>During the class, I decided to quit teaching English.  I was
literally composing the reasons and sentences in my mind.  I'm not
dedicated enough to teaching; I don't really have the credentials;
I'm just a washup from overseas.</p>

<p>I'm a fraud.</p>

<p>At the end of class, as we were signing each others address books
and messages and such, they surprised the shit out of me.  Honestly.
Gave me a card and photo and I was so overjoyed; I thought I hadn't
reached them <em>at all</em> during the voyage.</p>

<p>I might still quit, but only because I'm going on to differenter
things.</p>
