<p>Last night at Gaby's English only lecture, I became inspired to
get involved again, and was like, "I should go back to Palestine and
really get involved with ISM," and then thought of money as an
obstacle, plus wanting to do 54th, so I realized I should do
something in Japan, and I realized I could get involved with PB when
we get back, and, like that day I made the switch from inactive to
active at UH, I realized I could get involved in PB *now*.</p>

<p>Talked with 愛 during dinner and asked her how to get involved
with the volunteer thing, and she said they didn't really have a
structured way to let English speakers volunteer, but Stacy and
someone else just got involved by showing up repeatedly and being
offered positions.</p>

<p>That sounded more like what I'd be willing to do: show up as it
continued to suit me, and I could, in fact, start that night because
I had been invited by みずほ from the newspaper to help with the 
小タイトル, small title images.  Went there at 10:30, drew four title
images (they're very small) and chatted with them and felt a new
infusion of energy on both sides of the table.</p>

<p>During that time, やっちん came up looking for me (I don't know
who ratted me out; she and I had never met before) to sign me up for
sports day things.  I didn't really want to do them, but I agreed to
the three events that she requested.</p>

<p>Left around 1am MST and talked with Emi until 1am PST.  Her
English is quite good, though I had never really chatted with her
before.  She gave me 3 おやぎガグ that I remember:
ふとんがふとんだ、わくせいはくせえ、もくせいもくせえ</p>

<p>Fuckin' hilarious!</p>
