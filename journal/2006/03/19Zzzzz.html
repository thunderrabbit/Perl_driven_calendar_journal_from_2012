<p>Eeek.  I'm up way too late for my own good, but I've at least been
doing productive things: worked on some small titles for the newspaper
for a bit over an hour, then smurfed all the names for the speech
contest by teacher so each teacher can collect their students' speech
titles, then aggregated all the vocabulary words for Fighting Goats
and printed them (2 pages).  I forgot to print them double-sided, so I
was bummed about that, but not tooo much.</p>

<p>Didn't see Eri at all today.  Nor Saki for that matter.  But I saw
Rie for about 2 seconds.  Hung out with Akane for study purposes, Rei
talked to me a tiny bit while hooking up pictures for Chieko and
Kentaro.</p>

<p>Oh shit!!  We get an hour back tonight!   WHooohooooo!!!</p>

<p>It's only 12:24am!!</p>
