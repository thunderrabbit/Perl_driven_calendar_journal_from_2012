<p>Yesterday afternoon Lisa used my computer to make a video, so I
didn't write that I had a fantastic 2 hour conversation with Tony on
the front deck as we watched the waves pass by below.</p>

<p>An amazing revelation came during that.  Watching the waves go by,
I wondered why I didn't become attached to them as I get attached to
chilling with women.  Realized that I knew for certain another wave
would come, so I don't mind letting the current one go.  I get
attached to the connection with women because I don't trust I'll ever
see her again, but I've got to trust the universe to provide.</p>

<p>Also, Kellie (and Dan) made a slide show featuring Francois that I
really enjoyed.  It features basically all the GETs and CCs and some
crew.  Wonderful!</p>
