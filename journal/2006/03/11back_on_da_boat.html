<p class="date">4:15pm HAST Saturday 11 March 2006 (day 13135)</p>

<p>I'm back onboard, fully 3 hours before the time limit, but I just
need time to chill within my own brain, but mostly cause I'm tired of
being out of money in the port.</p>

<p>Oh man, and really sucky: I found out that my camera wasn't
working while we DOVE WITH SHARKS because the battery compartment had
come open a bit.  Not because the battery was dead.  I was stupid to
not realize this, or to not check it above the water
or <em>something</em>...  I'm really bummed about it, but suffice to
say, diving with sharks for the first time was pretty surreal.</p>

<p>I guess I'll have to come back to Tahiti sometime.</p>

<p>We zoomed back on the express ferry, but it didn't seem as fast as
it <em>looked</em> when we saw it yesterday while we were on the slow
ferry.  The waves were bigger today, so maybe they slowed down for
that reason.</p>

<p>I got a card from Hitomi; my brain is confuzzled; I want to see
her but I don't want to get physically involved with her, but I don't
see the harm in it right now since I'm obviously not going to get any
on the ship, and I'm just like <em>argh</em> about it now.</p>

<p>Plus, when I got emails today, my PB peeps are doing all kinds of
fucking cool-ass stuff, and I feel like I'm just a lazy fuck, going
around the world again with no job nor direction in life.</p>

<p>How can I <em>go around the world</em> and not think I'm doing
something interesting???  What a weird disconnect.</p>

<p>It also seems that the women I know who are doing cool things, like
the go-out-there and do-it people are also people who love to party
smoke-and-drink, which is totally off my list of things to do.  Then I
think about super-tall super-beautiful super-Paige out there in AMMAN,
Jordan, working with the UN; oh my god!</p>

<p>There's an obvious disproof to what my brain thinks is true above:
Kattrean doesn't smoke-n-drink, but she is doing cool as shit in the
form of going to UK for 2 years..  so awesome!</p>

<p>I just need to meditate; figure out my own shit for my own self; do
my own thing; it will allll fall into place.</p>
