<p>Chowed up in Yacht Club with Kellie and a student who seemed
hesitant to move her chair so that she would not be facing the sun.</p>

<p>Our CC neighbors came up and sat at a nearby table; Kellie chatted
with them; I left myself out.</p>

<p>While leaving, Yuka (on video team) was like, "yo yo" and we talked
for about 15 minutes; mostly I tried to explain in Japanese why it's
cool to keep a journal.</p>

<p>Gave her the battery charger for the video camera; yesterday they
all but finished recording the scenes necessary for the video.
Fantastic!!</p>
