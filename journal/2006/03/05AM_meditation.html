<p class="date">8:01am MST Sunday 05 March 2006</p>

<p>I woke up without an alarm around 5am, flopped around in bed a bit
and then decided to practice meditation for an hour.  I did 35
minutes before I just couldn't anymore; several times I nearly gave
up; several times I found myself falling asleep.  I was using the
ceiling tiles and plumbing supports as physical reference points
to monitor my posture.  If I couldn't feel them on my left shoulder
and right temple, then I knew I had slouched.</p>

<p>Plus, the ship's rocking keeps me from being able to sit in an
effortlessly balanced way.</p>
