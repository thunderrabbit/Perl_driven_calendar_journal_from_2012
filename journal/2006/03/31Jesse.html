<p>Jesse offloaded some US currency from his wallet.  I've done the
same in the past, so definitely know how that works.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to scamper out of here soon to go meet GET Ts at 3pm,
but the box I sent to Jesse's hasn't arrived yet.  (They wouldn't
guarantee a delivery time.)  I'm going to skip the first part of
hanging out with them and go to the 5pm part.  Crud.</p>
