<p>Holy Shizah.  Akiko just suggested a description of the current culture of Japanese women:
basically 30 years ago women worked in the house and men worked in the office.  Then (with economic
crash), both had to work in the office, but the women still had to work at home because the men
didn't start helping.  Now, women who saw their moms working so hard are like, &quot;fuck
that&quot; and won't do it.</p>

<p>And as a result the birthrate is declining.</p>

<p>OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>

<p>I have just met someone who I've basically considered a god among humans: a JR Line computer
programmer.</p>

<p>I absolutely *love* the Tokyo train system.  She fuckin' *writes* it!  Her job is to write
programs that will coordinate the connectivity between JR Lines and other companies' train lines
around Japan.  That's amazing!!</p>

<p>I was all like, &quot;I have *so* many questions to ask you,&quot; but I could hardly think of
what the first one should be, so she was telling me about *her* job, and .. and.... I was like,
&quot;WOT??&quot; I didn't know the different lines even <em>connected!</em>  I thought they were
all separate systems, so it adds a whole huge dimension to the huge spaghetti of lines that
crisscross this city and country.  Wow wow wow wow wow wow...</p>

<p>She told me it took TWENTY YEARS of planning and construction to finish the changes that
&quot;occurred&quot; between 31 January 2003 and 1 February 2003 on the Tokyu Toyoko line, moving
the line from 2 stories above Yokohama station to 4 stories below Yokohama station (and then to a
whole slew of new stations instead of just 2 more that didn't get a lot of traffic).  Twenty
Years!!</p>

<p>I want to ask her about Nambu line and its history...</p>

<p>Guess what language the systems are written in.  It starts with a C, and it's not C.  hint: it
(was) a Common Business Oriented Language.  I was like, &quot;WHAT???  COBOL is a terrible
language!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but it's easy.&quot;</p>

<p>Although now they are changing over to C and C-sharp.</p>
