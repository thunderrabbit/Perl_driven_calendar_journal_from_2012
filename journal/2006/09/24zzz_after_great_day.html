<p class="date">4:44am JST Monday 25 September 2006 (day 13333)</p>

<p>This is the first time I've written about day number 13332, which, by any standard, has been a
great day.</p>

<p>Possibly the most notable moment will prove to be a pivotal one in my life.</p>

<p>I don't totally remember the train of thought leading up to this station, but my brain was
delighted upon arrival and has been happy traveling on the other side.</p>

<p>While enjoying my life, lying down on the steps of a dome roof thing, in a historical park in
Seoul (the one with the 10 story pagoda circa 1470 encased in a glass tower), I made a connection
between my mission statement and living my daily life.</p>

<p>My mission statement, from my men's group: &quot;As a man among men, I bring joy to the world by
playing within the world.&quot;</p>

<p>As I enjoyed the perfect weather, calm breeze, gentle traffic noises, happy surroundings, and
nice paint job on the underside of the dome, my brain came to light on the mission statement.
Basically, &quot;wow; here I am; this is me, enjoying travels around the world.&quot;</p>

<p>I continued my train of thought with something like, &quot;what does it mean to 'play within the
world'?&quot;</p>

<p>It would mean being more like Carla, Daniel, or Jesse, and just have fun each moment.  And not be
stodgy, and jump up for fun times, and dance when I want, and not be shy, and say Yes more often,
and when posing for a picture: throw the peace sign that I have loathed for over three years.</p>

<p>All Japanese people (especially girls(?)) do a two finger V / peace sign when posing for
pictures.  Carla does it as dramatically as possible.  I never did it.</p>

<p>Until today.  Until tonight, after that afternoon moment of inspiration in the park.  I can just
do what the heck I want to do, and be silly and not worry about what people think.</p>

<p>Blessed me.  Blessed be.</p>

<p>(the first was a typo, but I'm leaving it in honor of this great day)</p>

<p class="date">5:00am JST Monday 25 September 2006 (day 13333)</p>

<p>I'm really tired.  Summary of today:</p>

<p>Chilled with Andrew for a decent amount of time this morning, and found we still had time to
meet Akane and friends for their performance at 11am.  Headed out to the park and met them.  Andrew
didn't stay long; he had to do report cards for tomorrow.  I stayed.</p>

<p>Watched their performance and then hung out with Akane and Abebe for quite a bit, including
browsing lots of vendor stalls and chowing snacky food (molten sugar in chewy battery dough is
yummmmmy), and found some delicious naturally sweet tea.  Also including my inspiration in the park.
In the same park, before or after that inspiration, I met さっこ, whose English is surprisingly
good.</p>

<p>Then watched their show again, (this time from the back, where I wouldn't have gone
pre-inspiration because I had to sorta break the rules to get there (go past the sound booth)) then
went to dinner with them and sat across from Yuuichi, who happens to live near me.  Was happy with
Tomas sat next to him (I declared she has the best smile in the group), and then MoriMori sat next
to me and asked lots of questions in Japanese, including some pretty good ones like about
reincarnation and the meaning of life, etc.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Then talked with さっこ and she asked if I wanted to walk around with some of them tonight.
Def.</p>

<p>Before walking around, I met Meg, who can speak English, Japanese and Mandarin.  Wow.</p>

<p>Walking around turned into many hours of random wanderings around the city on foot and by taxi
after we discovered I had missed last train to get back to Andrew's.</p>

<p>Seoul Tower was closed, but we went to a different place with a view of the city.  Viewed the
city, sang acapella karaoke, headed back to their youth hostel around 3am.  Upon arrival, it was
determined that if I take first train from the youth hostel to Andrew's, I would not have enough
time to get packed and get to the airport.</p>

<p>Taxi-time.  30,000 wan got me to Andrew's with no worries.</p>
