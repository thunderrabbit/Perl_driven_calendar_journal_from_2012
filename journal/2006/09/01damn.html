<p>I just realized this.</p>

<p>After I had a fight with my ex-gf, I posted one of her messages here to document her pov.  I got
a comment from one of my friends soon thereafter, suggesting that it was in poor taste to post such
things.  I had realized this, and taken down the post before I saw the comment.</p>

<p>It turns out</p>

<p>the comment was written by my ex-gf, impersonating my friend.</p>

<p>I hear you, angels.  Just one at a time.  Thank you.</p>
