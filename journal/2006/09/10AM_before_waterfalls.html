<p>So, today I'm going to go waterfall climbing with a guy named Naoki who I met at EV!!  I'm quite
excited about it, with visions of the waterfall climbing I enjoyed in Jamaica, and the
<em><b>amazing</b></em> waterfall Zach and I engaged on Kawai'i.  Holy shmoly wow.  I'd like to go
back.</p>

<p>But for today, this <em>new</em> (to me) waterfall in...  somewhere!</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>Last night he encouraged me to bring my insurance card if I have one.</p>

<p>I still don't have insurance.</p>

<p>I'm still going to go, trusting my feet and hands to keep me intact.</p>

<p>(I basically 100% attribute my TJ Bike crash to brakes that had worn down to useless; that won't
be a factor today.)</p>

<p>Underwater camera (with charged battery!): check</p>

<p>Dammit.  I think I left his floppy ass at EV.</p>

<p>Welp, sorry rabbit, not pics for you today.</p>
