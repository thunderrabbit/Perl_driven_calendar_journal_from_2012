<p>This morning I kept sleeping until fully 10+ am, with a dream featuring Kris from Canada at a
tiki style buffet, asking me what was available.  Discounting that she's a vegetarian, I tried hard
to memorize the offerings to give her a full report.</p>

<p>Soon after I woke up, Kris came online and we chatted for an hour + 20 minutes on Skype.  Good
times.  She and her business partner are going camping Wednesday to experience travel, clear air and
clear minds (except for the &quot;get loaded&quot; part) and think of a name for their travel
agency.</p>

<p>We gossipped about PB and Greg's funny email closing featuring homoerotic stylings to Brandt
after carefully neglecting Brandt in his otherwise full email.</p>

<p>Hilarious!</p>

<p>88slide and Korea and girls were other topics of concern, including Kris' 3 year old twin
cousins, one of whom was featured in the beginning of the chat.</p>
