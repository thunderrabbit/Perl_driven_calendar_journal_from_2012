<p>We just had a cute little earthquake.  I felt the vertical vibrations and was like, &quot;that
feels like an earthquake, dawg,&quot; (to myself) and it was a relatively long time before the
horizontal shake.  Like 3 seconds, I'm guessing.  Usually it's only like 1 second.  I'm going to
make a big guess that it means the epicenter was far away - like lightning and thunder.  Perhaps the
verticals propogate more quickly than the horizontals.</p>
