<p>Wow.  I just tried to alt-tilde through windows, but I hit alt-esc instead and found a
super-glossy graphical interface to effectively dumb down the machine to a simple DVD player /
movie maker / photo editor / music player.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Fair enough.  It's a clunky interface (e.g. I don't know of an efficient way to use it
besides arrowing through the menus; no mouse or character input items work) but it's pretty.</p>

<p>Not</p>

<p>that</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>care</p>

<p>about</p>

<p>pretty</p>

<p>but.  ..  I am listening to Tori Amos now.</p>
