<p>Stupidly, I missed my lesson with Kaoru today.  She had requested we meet at 10am instead of
noon.  I totally slept through it.  Fuck.</p>

<p>Then Sayuri just called me a bit ago and asked to cancel our lesson again this week (same as
last week)... I asked her to give me 24 hours advance warning if she can next time.  I hope she'd
be willing to tell me honestly if it's something else and she just doesn't want to meet me
anymore.  Just so I can move on to another student.</p>

<p>¤ä¤ëµ¤ is down as a result; I don't want to do shit today.</p>
