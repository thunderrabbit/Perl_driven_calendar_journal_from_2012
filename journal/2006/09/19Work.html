<p>Work was great today; lots of cool students and even my not so cool students got a good lesson
because I didn't bemoan their badness, but really tried to help.  One girl was reading and not
really understanding shit.  So I was like &quot;待って。これを分かった？&quot;　and she was like,
&quot;全然&quot; so I was like, &quot;aight&quot; and we went through it word by word to make sure
she understood everything, and then each sentence in Japanese and then in English again, and then
the whole thing again, and then I asked her questions about the paragraph, and then the whole
paragraph again, and then back in the book to the grammar she missed.</p>

<p>The paragraph:</p>

<pre>
I'm writing from our hotel on Sludge Beach.  Ralph and I are here on vacation with the children for
a few days.  We are happy to be here, but to tell the truth, we are having a few problems.
</pre>

<p>The trickiest word was &quot;our&quot; which is the possessive of &quot;we&quot; and which I
translated to Japanese so she could understand.  Otherwise, basically impossible to explain without
many minutes of practice.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>One student was late, and I forgot to keep track of the time in my brain, so we went 7 minutes
over.  I only noticed because Madoka (who covered for Reiko today) came to check on us.  Ooops!!!
I was showing her Metropolis magazine and the different groups she can contact in the back.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I ran the next two lessons equally late and ate into my next break a bit.  No worries.</p>

<p>Other things happened but I can't remember enough specifics.</p>

<p>Someone had arms of a tennis player.  One woman had nail polish that was pink at times and blue
at other times.  One woman read Metropolis and mentioned interest in mixi.jp, but bemoaned the fact
she didn't have any friends who could invite her.  (except me, it turns out)</p>
