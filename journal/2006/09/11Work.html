<p>Today work was pretty easy, given that I only had 4 students scheduled, and one was a no-show.
Unfortunately, she was the only student I knew from before and actually had something planned to
talk about: she had come last Monday and I invited her to play ultimate with us on Sunday
(yesterday), but she never contacted me, so I went with Naoki, et.al. to the waterfall thing.</p>

<p>Wanted to make sure she hadn't tried to contact me, and invite her to come to ultimate on any
given Sunday.</p>

<p>Right now I'm at the conveni near where we meet for i-group, ready to meet.</p>

<p>Oh, and for those who were concerned, I did find Francois at work.  He doesn't know about the
waterfall thing, shhhhh.</p>
