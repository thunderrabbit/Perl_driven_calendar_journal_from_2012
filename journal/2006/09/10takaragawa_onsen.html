<p> ı¿Ó≤π¿Ù was quite beautiful, set in a gentle valley of a mountain river with rocks creating
whirls and pools and eddies.  There were a couple of strange points, though (well, one strange
point and two notable points): 1) (strange) we didn't bathe before getting into the hot spring!  I
thought that was totally forbidden in Japanese culture.  2) (interesting) there was a women's side
and a mixed side.  No men's-only side.  3) (sad) four bears are kept in little cages; at least two
of which have no real protection or privacy.  I was not super impressed with that.</p>

<p>I don't want to poopoo the day; I'm really enjoying this chance to meet new people and see new
parts of Japan.</p>
