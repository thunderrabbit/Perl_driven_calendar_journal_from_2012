<p class="date">11:27am JST Friday  1 September 2006</p>

<p>I hadn't made a plan for a problem I want to solve, so that was a bit less than optimal, but I
did reach Focus 10 quite well.  I think a key is for me to do this in the morning when I'm much less
likely to fall asleep.</p>

<p>However, I feel asleep at the end; at the beginning of the exercise I got into my sleeping bag (as the humming part started) and didn't restart the exercise to give time to relax more fully.  But I relaxed plenty overall and zonked out after the exercise.</p>
