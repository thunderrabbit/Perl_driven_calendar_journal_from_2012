<p>Nice.  I was well awake through the whole beginning and only near the end did I not hear every inch of his descriptions.  I found myself in an interesting dream:</p>

<p class="dream">In the safari in Kenya, I rode secretly away from the ticket gates toward the exit
of the park.  Just as the truck slowed down to go through the elephant grid, I jumped off the back
onto the dusty road.</p>

<p class="dream">After glancing back at the truck to make sure they were not concerned for me, I
started walking back toward the ticket gate, and saw an elephant up on a ridge overlooking the dusty
road.  I found that I was floating more than walking, and realized this was a semi-real experience.</p>

<p class="lucid">I remained relaxed and knew I was on my back in my apartment.  I noted my hands
were floating above my physical hands.  I remained relaxed and observant, then fell asleep</p>

<p>as Monroe (narrator for these CDs) started to talk about being equalized when we return to Focus
1 (awake).</p>
