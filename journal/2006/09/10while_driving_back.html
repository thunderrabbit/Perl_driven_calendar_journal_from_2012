<p>We played some fun car games, including the word game of saying words that begin with the last
letter of the previous word (in Japanese), and then someone suggested a game of trying *not* to say
21, but being able to say up to 3 consecutive numbers and the next person picking up where they
left off.  Kazue was made to lose that game; I quickly said I had a better game: the seven game,
where we say numbers in sequence, but clap and reverse the order of speakers on numbers that include
7 or are multiples of 7.</p>

<p>We played that game like 10 times until we completed to 100 in Japanese, and then got to 48 in
English.  Good times.</p>

<p>Then a grouping game: a topic is announced and everyone says the most popular item in the topic,
and those who say something unique lose points.</p>

<p>(Very interesting, the Japanese rules of that game.  The corresponding game I know in English
rewards people for uniqueness per topic, and the loser each round is the one who can't think of an
item that others have already said.)</p>
