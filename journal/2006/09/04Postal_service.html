<p>Mailed an overseas voter request form today, reusing some old window envelope from a bill.  The
postal worker had no concerns with this; I'm glad.</p>

<p>Also got a stamp for my RSVP card for Nathan and Lauren's wedding.  I won't be in attendance,
but I like the artisticity of what I wrote, so at the last moment I decided not to send it yet;
I'll get a picture first for posterity.</p>
