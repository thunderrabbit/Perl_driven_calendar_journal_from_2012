<p>Doing a visa-run in Korea this weekend; hopefully my work visa will come through before I have
to do it again.  Ah cool.  I'll be 13331 days old tomorrow, a palindrome worthy of a weekend
adventure!</p>

<p>Will get to meet Andrew, my first friend in Japan; he's been in K-land for over a year, I think;
we still stay vaguely in touch.  He misses ume boshi from Japan, so I'm gonna hook a brotha up.</p>

<p>We're scheduled to visit the DMZ, where I hope we can do an 88Slide filming.  Perhaps other
shenanigans.  If we do it, I intend for Francois to be fully featured.</p>
