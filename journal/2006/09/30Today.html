<p>Haven't really hit my journal in a long time.  Have been going out most nights after work until
last train, chillin' in various places around Shibuya or Sakurashinmachi or Harajuku, talking and
stuff.  This has been quite a strain on my journal writing time.  Plus busy with studying Japanese,
which I've decided I don't like, though I do like practicing Japanese.</p>

<p>In the past week (or was it last week), I've been pretty crappy on my schedule: I
missed <em>two</em> students (Kaoru and Reika), and ended up everything all cool, but still I felt
bad and gave a free lesson this week as a result.</p>

<p>Plan to meet up with Shinpei after work to practice Japanese with him.</p>

<p>Missed Jesse's wedding today.  I was stupid and didn't ask for the day off from work until too
late; I basically didn't want to &quot;push it&quot; after I had just gone to Korea, I didn't want
to ask for another day off, even though I actually had to take the first trip (visa run).  Called
Jesse and chatted with him and Anna during their after-reception party for about 50 seconds.  Look
forward to seeing them again.</p>

<p>Have had a bit less than super-genki lessons recently; partially because I've been tired, and
partially because I'm not super-thrilled to be working... but in general it's still cool to have
work, and most of my students are cool.  I try to give quality teachin' to each, but can't always
do it.</p>

<p>Hopefully going to play ultimate tomorrow, though I'm not sure if people will be there.
Nightmare.</p>
