<p>Just skyped with g, brainstorming ideas and existing code for an images program; he wants to do
stuff similar to what my imagesadmin code is supposed to do, so we were discussing ways to make it
work for what both of us want to do.</p>

<p>And, it's Dad's birthday this weekend.  Kickin' around some ideas for that as well.</p>
