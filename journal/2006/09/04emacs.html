<p>I'm happy to have my day counter back in operation.  I did it a far better way this time.  Last
time I had written a macro that opened calendar and all sorts of crap.  This time it's all function
driven:</p>

<pre>
  (print (concat " (day " (number-to-string (- (time-to-days (current-time)) (time-to-days '(109 0 0)))) ")"))
</pre>

<p>But now, for some reason html-rob-paragraph is not working.  Perhaps I can figure that out
tomorrow.  It's the code that prints either a dream paragraph or a plain paragraph depending on the
file name.</p>
