<p>Akane just walked up!  She's also going to Korea on this flight.</p>

<p>We were on 52nd voyage together!  She'll be meeting Abebe in Korea!  Coooool!</p>

<p>For those keeping careful track, this is not my Akane-sensei, but the *other* Akane, who I
probably have never mentioned before.</p>

<p>We chatted for a bit until it was time to board.  The gate attendants called my name because the
boarding pass I got was not actually a seating pass.  Just proof of purchase. Had to exchange it
for an actual boarding pass.  Akane watched my bags while I did the exchange.</p>
