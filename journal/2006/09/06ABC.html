<p>I heard <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/?tag=Path+to+911">ABC is airing a show claiming to be based on the 9/11 Commission Report</a>.  However,
distinctly <em>unlike</em> the report, it blames the Clinton Administration for Airplane Day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/30/clinton.terrorism/">Clinton tried to pass anti-terrorism
laws in <em>1996</em>!</a>  Did the Republicans in congress allow that??</p>

<p><a href="http://propagandamatrix.com/mystery_of_terror_insider_dealers.htm">Trades were made
that prove prior knowledge of the attacks!</a>  Did Clinton do that?</p>

<p>NOW, I haven't seen the program.  The claim in my first paragraph may not be accurate.  But, if
they blame Clinton in this show, please complain to ABC.</p>
