<p>Pretty fun walking along the river with Yumiko, but I was pretty tired overall.  It may have
been a &quot;reaction&quot; to me not really impressed that she won't make (m)any decisions.  Feels
a lot like something I don't want to engage any further.</p>

<p>We did go to Shibuya in search of popsicle sticks at Tokyu Hands, but they didn't have any.  My
next guess is to contact an ice cream manufacturer to see where they get their stock of sticks.</p>
