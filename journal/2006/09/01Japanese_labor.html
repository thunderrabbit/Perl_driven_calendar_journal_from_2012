<p>I just got a comment on an old description
of <a href="/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=all&date=2004/07/15#Errands">slogging through Japanese
bureacracy</a>..  Funny to go back and read it now; I can tell how little I knew about how deep the
bureacracy runs.  But this guy, Mike, appears to have even more experience:</p>

Weird as it sounds, these stamps like they tried to sell you for \4,000 is the normal way to pay for
things like visa renewals, re-entry permits, registering documents, etc.

If you go to the office where you need to get the paper you are after (like a visa renewal), they
will usually send you upstairs where you buy a stamp, get a receipt (so your employer can reimburse
you if they are your sponsor), then go back downstairs to the clerk that started jerking you around
in the first place.

Why couldn't the first clerk sell you the stamp? Somebody once told me that this is the form
Japanese social welfare works, making sure that there are always three people hired for a job that
one could do in his spare time. Buy somoething made in Tokyo. It will first be shipped from the
factory to a warehouse somewhere, then trucked to an area distributor and finally to your store. And
at each step along the way, the cost increases to pay for these services. In the process, a lot of
truck drivers and warehouse workers (who never got enough education to do anything else) have a job
and vote for the LDP. The Japanese man in the street knows and supports this as 'doing his part for
Nihon'.

Registering your 'hanko' takes about 10 minutes for '600 or so at you local post office. I lived
here for almost 20 years before I registered mine, I just couldn't get my head around the idea of
using something for accessing my bank account that any person who knows my name could by at any
hanko maker shop.

I only use my hanko at government offices and such, but still insist on using only my signature for
my credit cards, bank account, etc. The ony person I know who can duplicate the spider scrawl that
serves as my signature is my teen-age son, after a lot of practice. Scary idea.
