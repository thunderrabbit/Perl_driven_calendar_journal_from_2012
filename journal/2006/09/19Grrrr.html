<p>Fucking boss called me today to make sure I fucking know what time I start work today.  I know
what time I fucking start work today.  If I don't know I will come at the earliest time I *might*
start work, so don't fucking call me.  But the pissy thing about it is I was getting ready for work
when he called me so I had to call him back and see what the fucking crisis was that he was calling
me about, (i.e., I had to pay for the call.)  Now it's only like 40 yen (I hope) to make the call,
but I don't want to pay for a stupid phone call that's a waste of time and gives me no valuable
information.</p>

<p>AND THEN he called me back again (while I was on the train, so I called him back) and he's like,
&quot;oh I forgot one thing, the passport sized photos you got are not the right size.  They need
to be bigger.&quot;</p>

<p>And I was like, &quot;they are passport sized.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they need to be passport sized; can you make them again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;THEY ARE PASSPORT SIZED!&quot;  (I probably shouldn't yell at my boss)</p>

<p>&quot;They are supposed to be 3cm by 4cm&quot;</p>

<p>I knew it was pointless to argue the size over the phone when I couldn't see the photos, and
only know that I pressed the button that said PASSPORT PHOTO; &quot;okay; I will make
more.&quot;</p>

<p>The he started to tell me when he will be in to pick them up, and I was like, <em>I don't
fucking care when you will come pick them up; I'm going to make them right now, are you going to be
there in less then 3 minutes?</em> &quot;okay; I'll make them now.&quot;</p>

<p>Fortunately, I did happen to be quite close to the machine where I had made them before.</p>

<p>Still pissed off, I imagined rending the machine to shreds, but knew that wouldn't be helpful.</p>

<p>I verified the passport sized photos were in fact 30 by 40 mm, and I'm guessing by &quot;not big
enough&quot; it's a miscommunication that my mug doesn't take up enough of the photo.</p>

<p>Stepped inside, not ripping the curtain.  700 fucking yen; that's my daily food budget this
month.  Put in 1000 yen bill.</p>

<p>Oh, sorry, jack, we can't make change.  Not even 3 coins worth.</p>

<p>I punched the machine, and it hurt a lot more than I expected.  Remembered the time Dave Osborne
broke his hand by punching something that didn't give as much as he had expected.</p>

<p>Alright, machine, you fucking win for now, but I'm going to get those photos made.</p>

<p class="date">10:36pm JST Tuesday 19 September 2006 (day 13327)</p>

<p>Got them made.  First time I did it the same as the first first time (in English, and was only
able to select &quot;Passport&quot;) and they turned out the same, 30 x 24mm.  Fuck.  The second
time I did it in Japanese, and was able to choose the size in mm.</p>

<p>They came out the right size, but Francois didn't show up in the picture.</p>

<p>Fuckin' machine.  So I took them *again*, and made sure Francois was high enough to show up in
the pics.  I hope he will show up in the picture on my alien registration card.</p>
