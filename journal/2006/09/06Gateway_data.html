<p>The Energy Bar Tool is surprisingly powerful.  During the off and on flashes, I began to
feel that I was actually beginning to vibrate, and to a degree I was able to focus on increasing
the vibration instead of turning off and on the bar itself.</p>

<p>This was my experience back over a year ago when I did this exercise.  I could feel myself
vibrating.</p>

<p>I semi-fell asleep at the end of this exercise.</p>

<p>Definitely want to do it again.</p>
