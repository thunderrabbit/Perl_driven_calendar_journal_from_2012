<p>Really glad to go waterfall climbing with Naoki, Tomo, Kazue　(かずえっち), and Aiko (よろちゃん)。
</p>

<p>The tour itself was far too controlled and Japanese for my liking overall, BUT I did get to hang
upside down like a monkey before dropping into the river.</p>

<p>The water was.. cold, so wetsuits were nice to have.  But the rapids were for babies and we all
had to stand over here and wait over there and blah blah blah to make sure we stay safe even
though we had signed waivers saying it was dangerous.</p>

<p>There were lots of people there, so we didn't get to do all three sets of falls, but perhaps
that gave us more time on the monkey vine that I enjoyed.</p>

<p>I *think* we will end up with digital photos of the event.</p>

<p>I <em>brought my camera</em>, but they wouldn't let me use it because it would take their
business of photgraphing us.  Grrr.  There's *other* stuff to photograph as well.  And perhaps I
would give a better recommendation than overall it was lame.</p>

<p>BUT, really really I enjoyed and am enjoying chillin' with these friends of Naoki's who I met at
EV.  Good times, and I hope to hang with them again.</p>
