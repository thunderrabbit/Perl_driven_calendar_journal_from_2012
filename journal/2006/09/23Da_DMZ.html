<p>On the bus now to tour the DMZ; was able to navigate to the location easily enough; the train
stations are way simpler than Tokyo.  I only got lost for a moment when I asked a guy in the
building I suspected was the right one and he pointed me to the bus, but I knew I should register
first, so I thought maybe it was *that* gray building, so I went, talked to a guy, used the pay
phone, found out it was in fact the first building, and I had been directed past the registration
table next to the souvenir shop in the back.</p>

<p>Have arrived in plenty of time and even bought an orange juice for 2000 wan (about $2).</p>

<p>Just had the DMZ briefing</p>

<p class="date">4:49pm JST Saturday 23 September 2006 (day 13331)</p>

<p>Just finished the tour.  I had only typed &quot;Just had the DMZ briefing&quot; before our guide
was like, &quot;you're not allowed to use a laptop here.&quot;</p>

<p>I was in camp Bonefas, an area where we are allowed to take pictures freely, but
... apparently <em>typing</em> is a nono</p>

<p>Basically the DMZ is just a big dick contest between the two countires, and I can't really
understand why.  Things are so bizarre that we are not allowed to point across the border because we
might be photographed, and the photographs used as propoganda by the North Korean government about
how people in South Korea are threatening them.</p>

<p>We were allowed to cross the Demarcation line by about 10 feet but not allowed to cross on one
particular side of the table where a guard was standing, and not allowed to touch the tables nor
chairs nor sit in the chairs, but we could take pictures with the guards, mocking their stoic
stances with fists cleched ready to disable anyone who tried to cross into North Korea on the wrong
sde of the table, or go too far into North Korea.  Really really bizarre.</p>

<p>Some soldiers were standing in the same stoic clenched fist stance, but with exactly half of
their bodies hidden from North Korea by the wall of a building behind which they were standing, like
trying to do funny antics using a mirror edge on.</p>

<p>In case North Korea attacks, they are better protected than fully visible, and better aware than
fully hidden.</p>

<p>I talked to the US soldier from Arizona a bit.  He said his job is to make sure we don't stray
from the tour.  However, on the actual US tour, he gives the tour.  I bet that tour would be 100
times better than trying to understand our Korean tourguide, etc.</p>

<p>In short, sign up early and do the US tour.  It's cheaper and probably better.</p>

<p>I totally wish I had prepped and brought my video camera *into* the room with the stoic guards
and did the 88slide thing there.  *That* would have *ruled*.</p>
