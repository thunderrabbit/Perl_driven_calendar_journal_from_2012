<p>In Jaimie's room today after being in Tracy's for a month.</p>

<p class="date">11:17am JST</p>

<p>Just had a level check after chatting with Rie for an hour, mostly about PB.  I have *got* to get
some business cards for PB; I am promoting the shit out the voyages!</p>

<p>My nose was a floody nightmare during work today.  It's basically fine now that I've been home
for a bit.  It was snotty yesterday at Shibuya school and snottier today at Kichijoji; I wonder
what was the problem.</p>

<p>Four level checks today!!</p>

<p>One of them was super high.  Only problem was the occasional verb with correct meaning, but that
sounded unnatural.  During the lesson he was like, &quot;actually my French is better, so sometimes
I accidentally use the French equivalent without thinking about it.&quot;</p>

<p>He didn't use any accidental French with me, so under Weak Points, I wrote &quot;allegedly uses
French at times.&quot;</p>

<p>Two students were pianists.  One since she was 5 years old, and the other since she was 3.  The
former was more interested in chatting about Tori Amos after I mentioned her brilliant
pianofication, and actually asked if I could sing the melody of my favorite song,
&quot;Winter&quot;</p>

<p>I could.  I did.</p>
