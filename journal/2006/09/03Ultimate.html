<p>Off to play ultimate today!  ¤æ¤ß¤³ will meet me at Sakurashinmachi on the 2:08 train and go
with.  Dunno if she really knows what ultimate is, so I will bring shorts and shirt for her in case
she wants to play.  Not sure about shoes, though.  Perhaps she does know and will bring her own.</p>

<p>Or,</p>

<p>no one else showed up because there was a tournament on elsewhere.</p>
