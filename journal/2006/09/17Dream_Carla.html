<p class="dream">Carla was back from the PB voyage.  Telling the stories through a repeated cycle
of writing a snippet and then telling the story, we were in a cafeeria type room with luggage from
various peole there.  My Magic ROB box was next to a big trunk of the same style material.  We had
to get everything back the way it had been previously.  That was a bit of a trick, but we did it.</p>
