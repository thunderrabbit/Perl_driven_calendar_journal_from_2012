The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract."</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Lincoln used those words to immortalize their sacrifice.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Today our leaders could use those same words to rationalize their reprehensible inaction. "We cannot dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground." So we won't.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Instead they bicker and buck pass. They thwart private efforts, and jostle to claim credit for initiatives that go nowhere. They spend the money on irrelevant wars, and elaborate self-congratulations, and buying off columnists to write how good a job they're doing instead of doing any job at all.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Five years later, Mr. Bush, we are still fighting the terrorists on these streets. And look carefully, sir, on these 16 empty acres.&nbsp; The terrorists are clearly, still winning.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And, in a crime against every victim here and every patriotic sentiment you mouthed but did not enact, you have done nothing about it.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And there is something worse still than this vast gaping hole in this city, and in the fabric of our nation.&nbsp; There is its symbolism of the promise unfulfilled, the urgent oath, reduced to lazy execution.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>The only positive on 9/11 and the days and weeks that so slowly and painfully followed it was the unanimous humanity, here, and throughout the country. The government, the President in particular, was given every possible measure of support.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Those who did not belong to his party -- tabled that.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Those who doubted the mechanics of his election -- ignored that.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Those who wondered of his qualifications -- forgot that.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>History teaches us that nearly unanimous support of a government cannot be taken away from that government by its critics. It can only be squandered by those who use it not to heal a nation's wounds, but to take political advantage.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Terrorists did not come and steal our newly-regained sense of being American first, and political, fiftieth. Nor did the Democrats. Nor did the media. Nor did the people.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>The President -- and those around him -- did that.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>They promised bi-partisanship, and then showed that to them, "bi-partisanship" meant that their party would rule and the rest would have to follow, or be branded, with ever-escalating hysteria, as morally or intellectually confused, as appeasers, as those who, in the Vice President's words yesterday, "validate the strategy of the terrorists."</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>They promised protection, and then showed that to them "protection" meant going to war against a despot whose hand they had once shaken, a despot who we now learn from our own Senate Intelligence Committee, hated al-Qaida as much as we did.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>The polite phrase for how so many of us were duped into supporting a war, on the false premise that it had 'something to do' with 9/11 is "lying by implication."</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>The impolite phrase is "impeachable offense."</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Not once in now five years has this President ever offered to assume responsibility for the failures that led to this empty space, and to this, the current, curdled, version of our beloved country.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Still, there is a last snapping flame from a final candle of respect and fairness: even his most virulent critics have never suggested he alone bears the full brunt of the blame for 9/11.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Half the time, in fact, this President has been so gently treated, that he has seemed not even to be the man most responsible for anything in his own administration.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Yet what is happening this very night?</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>A mini-series, created, influenced -- possibly financed by -- the most radical and cold of domestic political Machiavellis, continues to be televised into our homes. </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>The documented truths of the last fifteen years are replaced by bald-faced lies; the talking points of the current regime parroted; the whole sorry story blurred, by spin, to make the party out of office seem vacillating and impotent, and the party in office, seem like the only option.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>How dare you, Mr. President, after taking cynical advantage of the unanimity and love, and transmuting it into fraudulent war and needless death, &nbsp;after monstrously transforming it into fear and suspicion and turning that fear into the campaign slogan of three elections?&nbsp; How dare you -- or those around you -- ever "spin" 9/11?</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Just as the terrorists have succeeded -- are still succeeding -- as long as there is no memorial and no construction here at Ground Zero.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>So, too, have they succeeded, and are still succeeding as long as this government uses 9/11 as a wedge to pit Americans against Americans.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>This is an odd point to cite a television program, especially one from March of 1960. But as Disney's continuing sell-out of the truth (and this country) suggests, even television programs can be powerful things.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And long ago, a series called "The Twilight Zone" broadcast a riveting episode entitled "The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street."&nbsp; </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>In brief: a meteor sparks rumors of an invasion by extra-terrestrials disguised as humans. The electricity goes out. A neighbor pleads for calm. Suddenly his car -- and only his car -- starts. Someone suggests he must be the alien. Then another man's lights go on. As charges and suspicion and panic overtake the street, guns are inevitably produced. &nbsp;An "alien" is shot -- but he turns out to be just another neighbor, returning from going for help.&nbsp; The camera pulls back to a near-by hill, where two extra-terrestrials are seen manipulating a small device that can jam electricity. The veteran tells his novice that there's no need to actually attack, that you just turn off a few of the human machines and then, "they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find, and it's themselves."</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And then, in perhaps his finest piece of writing, Rod Serling sums it up with words of remarkable prescience, given where we find ourselves tonight: "The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices, to be found only in the minds of men.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>"For the record, prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy, and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own -- for the children, and the children yet unborn."</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>When those who dissent are told time and time again -- as we will be, if not tonight by the President, then tomorrow by his portable public chorus -- that he is preserving our freedom, but that if we use any of it, we are somehow un-American...When we are scolded, that if we merely question, we have "forgotten the lessons of 9/11"... look into this empty space behind me and the bi-partisanship upon which this administration also did not build, and tell me:</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Who has left this hole in the ground?</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>We have not forgotten, Mr. President. </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>You have.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>May this country forgive you.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span><a name="#060911a"></a><strong>Sept. 11, 2006</strong><b><strong> | </strong></b><a href="/id/14687895/#060911a"><strong>3:19 p.m. ET</strong></a></p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span><b><strong>A special comment on 9/11</strong></b></p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span><table style="padding: 5px 15px 0pt 0pt;" align="left" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="1%"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Components/Art/MSNBC_TV/Evergreen/Bloggermann/Blogggerman_illo_TEST.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="270" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="182"></td></tr></tbody></table>Tonight at 8 p.m. ET, “Countdown with Keith Olbermann” broadcasts live from Ground Zero to commemorate five years since 9/11.&nbsp; </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Olbermann will offer a special commentary on how the course of the nation was forever altered by the events of that day, and by the actions of the administration in the months and years afterward.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Check out this sneak peak:</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span><em>The only positive on 9/11 and the days and weeks that so slowly and painfully followed it was the unanimous humanity, here, and throughout the country.

A confusion that suggested that the office can not only make the man, but that the office can also make the facts.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Thus, did Mr. Rumsfeld make an apt historical analogy.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Excepting the fact, that he has the battery plugged in backwards. </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>His government, absolute -- and exclusive -- in its knowledge, is not the modern version of the one which stood up to the Nazis.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>It is the modern version of the government of Neville Chamberlain.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>But back to today’s Omniscient ones.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>That, about which Mr. Rumsfeld is confused is simply this: This is a Democracy. Still. Sometimes just barely. </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And, as such, all voices count -- not just his. </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Had he or his president perhaps proven any of their prior claims of omniscience — about Osama Bin Laden’s plans five years ago, about Saddam Hussein’s weapons four years ago, about Hurricane Katrina’s impact one year ago — we all might be able to swallow hard, and accept their “omniscience” as a bearable, even useful recipe, of fact, plus ego.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>But, to date, this government has proved little besides its own arrogance, and its own hubris.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Mr. Rumsfeld is also personally confused, morally or intellectually, about his own standing in this matter. From Iraq to Katrina, to the entire “Fog of Fear” which continues to envelop this nation, he, Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney, and their cronies have — inadvertently or intentionally — profited and benefited, both personally, and politically.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And yet he can stand up, in public, and question the morality and the intellect of those of us who dare ask just for the receipt for the Emporer’s New Clothes?</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>In what country was Mr. Rumsfeld raised? As a child, of whose heroism did he read? On what side of the battle for freedom did he dream one day to fight? With what country has he confused the United States of America?</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>The confusion we -- as its citizens— must now address, is stark and forbidding. </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>But variations of it have faced our forefathers, when men like Nixon and McCarthy and Curtis LeMay have darkened our skies and obscured our flag. Note -- with hope in your heart — that those earlier Americans always found their way to the light, and we can, too.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>The confusion is about whether this Secretary of Defense, and this administration, are in fact now accomplishing what they claim the terrorists seek: The destruction of our freedoms, the very ones for which the same veterans Mr. Rumsfeld addressed yesterday in Salt Lake City, so valiantly fought.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And about Mr. Rumsfeld’s other main assertion, that this country faces a “new type of fascism.”</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>As he was correct to remind us how a government that knew everything could get everything wrong, so too was he right when he said that -- though probably not in the way he thought he meant it.&nbsp; </p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>This country faces a new type of fascism - indeed.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Although I presumptuously use his sign-off each night, in feeble tribute, I have utterly no claim to the words of the exemplary journalist Edward R. Murrow.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>But never in the trial of a thousand years of writing could I come close to matching how he phrased a warning to an earlier generation of us, at a time when other politicians thought they (and they alone) knew everything, and branded those who disagreed: “confused” or “immoral.”</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Thus, forgive me, for reading Murrow, in full:</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>“We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty,” he said, in 1954. “We must remember always that accusation is not proof, and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>“We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate, and to defend causes that were for the moment unpopular.”</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>And so good night, and good luck.</p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span><table align="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><script>getCSS("3088867")</script><div class="box_3088867" style="width: 300px;"><script></script><table class="boxH_3088867" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="300"><tbody><tr><td class="boxHI_3088867" width="1%"><img src="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/images/icons/video.gif" height="14" width="20"></td><td class="boxHC_3088867" nowrap="true" width="*"><div class="textSmallBold">FREE VIDEO</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="boxB_3088867" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="300"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td height="100%"><div style="height: 100%; width: 100%; background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); background-image: url(/images/backgrounds/component_dkgrey.gif); text-align: center;"><a href="javascript:msnvDwd('00','75f357f0-029f-4699-9171-d4431f8386f9','us','News_Comment - Analysis','c1149','msnbc','','14592370','Feeling morally, intellectually confused?')"><img src="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Video/060830/n_countdown_confused_060830.vsmall.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a><div><a href="javascript:msnvDwd('00','75f357f0-029f-4699-9171-d4431f8386f9','us','News_Comment - Analysis','c1149','msnbc','','14592370','Feeling morally, intellectually confused?')" onmouseout="VT_launchMouseOut('EAMBEA')" onmouseover="VT_launchMouseOver('EAMBEA')" onmousedown="VT_launchMouseDown('EAMBEA')" onmouseup="VT_launchMouseUp('EAMBEA')"><img src="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/images/buttons/launch/buttonsLaunch_02.gif" alt="Launch" name="launch10" id="EAMBEA" border="0" height="25" hspace="20" width="77"></a></div></div></td><td class="boxBI_3088867"><div class="textHang"><span class="bulletRedSmall">• </span><span class="textMedBlackBold"><a href="javascript:msnvDwd('00','75f357f0-029f-4699-9171-d4431f8386f9','us','News_Comment - Analysis','c1149','msnbc','','14592370','Feeling morally, intellectually confused?')">Feeling morally, intellectually confused? </a></span><br><span class="textMed">Aug 30: On Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said administration critics suffered from "moral or intellectual confusion.”&nbsp; “Countdown” host Keith Olbermann responds.</span></div><p class="credit">Countdown</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Comments?
