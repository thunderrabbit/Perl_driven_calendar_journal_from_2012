<p class="dream">My mom showed me a picture she had taken of a tall woman from a village that was
being destroyed (enslaved) by an oil company trying to get at their oil.  I was like, &quot;who is
that?&quot; and she told me the story; I was like, &quot;what?????&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And suddenly was in the middle of a forest with a rather hefty pair of pliers
surrounded by corrugated metal fence being put up all around the place.  It was held together with
large metal bolts and nuts that I could occassionally unscrew with the pliers, but there were too
many people watching and too many bolts for me to actually undo by myself.</p>

<p class="dream">I unscrewed two bolts without anyone (including my mom) noticing, and then was
like, &quot;we have to go,&quot; because someone was coming or I was nervous or something.</p>

<p>(not much of an activist, I guess)</p>

<p class="dream">And she was like, &quot;meet up in the back&quot; and I went toward the front side
of the conveni, dumped the two bolts into the recycle bin, and walked thrugh to the back, but then
come back in to buy a drink.</p>

<p class="dream">Matt was in there, all, &quot;Rob, are you okay?&quot; asked Matt as I walked into
the convenience store.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;No...&quot; walking in a pissed off mood, &quot;remember when I went fuckin
crazy when we watched that apartheid video on 49th?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;It's happening again.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I'm back there with these big pliers trying to take the fence down, but they
are much stronger this time.  This shit ain't gonna work.  What are we going to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Why didn't they fix it in Europe, and conserve water there?&quot; (*)</p>

<p>(*) which apparently in dreamland would have solved the problem.</p>
