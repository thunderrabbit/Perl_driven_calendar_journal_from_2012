<p>I am pretty sure today is the day Yuri and I agreed to meet at Hachiko at 11am.  I've been here
since like 10:40am, but still no sign of Yuri yet.</p>

<p>It's been interesting to watch people meet and greet each other at Hachiko, and tourists
(including Japanese) taking pictures of Hachiko. The greetings are of people who haven't seen each
other in a long time, with people running to each other when eye contact is made, (sometimes with
the assistance of cell phones), and then with exxagerated waves and happy smiles.</p>

<p>There's a social experiment here somewhere, but I'm not sure what.</p>

<p>Yuri just made it.  She had taken the Sebu line in Ikebukero instead of Yamanote.</p>
