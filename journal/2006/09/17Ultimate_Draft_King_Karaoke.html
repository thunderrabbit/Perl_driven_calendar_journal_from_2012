<p>Great fun at ultimate, with some excellent catches and ninja rolls at the end.  Somehow did not
hurt my shoulder.  Met David who's lived several places around the world.  He made me smile by
being well-impressed with one of my throws.</p>

<p>The sky was sprinkling pretty effectively as we walked to Draft King for chowtime.  I was happy
that Wendy sat next to me and asked lots of questions.  I think she's just nice slash practicing
for her work more than interested in me.  Great eyes, though.  I sat across from Bruno and we joked
around several times.  David on my left, also quite funny.</p>

<p>The group dwindled again as 6 of us went to Shibuya for Karaoke.  5 of us sang for 3 lovely
hours.  Bruno, Jolian, Koky, me, Wendy.  Francois got completely drunk.  So embarassing.  Bruno has
pics, which I hope he will share.  Maybe I can convince Francois he needs help.</p>
