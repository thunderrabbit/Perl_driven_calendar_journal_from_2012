<p>I've got 222 messages in my gmail inbox.  66 are unread, and 80 are starred (16 are both unread
and starred).  Starring and unreading has basically been my way of drawing my attention to them to
read later.</p>

<p>Later has just arrived.</p>

<p>First, the ones that are both starred and unread.</p>

<p>Okay.  Now 0 messages are both starred and unread.  50 are unread, and 65 are starred.</p>
