<p>Trains in Tokyo are really great.  On time, basically clean, blah blah.  BUT, some stations are
big and train lines can be a nightmare to find.</p>

<p>Tonight I was blessed with an opportunity to lead two travelers from the pits of Shibuya's
Hanzomon line across the street and up to the Ginza line.  I specifically brought them out onto the
street cause I wasn't sure I could get to Ginza line from Hanzomon line directly (I know it's
possible, but I didn't want to get lost in my moment of leadership).</p>

<p>The couple was from Italy, but I couldn't remember more than &quot;mumbriana&quot; which might
mean &quot;ghost&quot; and has the distinctly memorable feature of rhyming with the name of the tall
beautiful Italian named Juliana, as in &quot;Juliana mumbriana&quot; but I don't totally
remember.</p>

<p>Anyway, I didn't think that would be a very useful topic for discussion, so I just said
&quot;Tokyo es dificil&quot; hoping bad Spanish could pass for worse Italian.  Not sure if it
worked, but they were happy once we arrived at Ginza line.</p>
