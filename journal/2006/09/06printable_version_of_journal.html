<p>Perfect.  Got my printable version code working by adding a few hacks to my journal code.  It's
becoming apparent that I need to revamp my entire journal code before I can do too much more to
it.  It's poorly written without even using the CGI.pm to output HTML.  Not likely to change it
until after I've done my picture viewer, and I haven't made any motions toward getting back to that
any time soon.  It will be after my map project is done..  that is nearing completion.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the upper right corner is now &quot;printable version&quot; which simply displays the
page without the left hand sidebar.  (only in journal.pl, not journal.cgi; sorry Jon)</p>

<p>But that's not all.  If the journal type is nihongo, the text is spaced at 300% to facilitate
writing notes and corrections.</p>
