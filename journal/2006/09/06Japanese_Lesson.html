<p>Today's Japanese lesson was better than it could have been.  I found the teacher's style to be
quite similar to mine, though at times I thought she was using more English than I want overall.
Like explaining in English what I already understood, but I wanted to work on the Japanese.  I may
tell her next time.  Actually more important for me is to have her not read (out loud) at the same
time I'm practicing reading some text (out loud).</p>

<p>But overall, quite awesome.  We talked for 2 hours, and I've requested 2 hours per week with her.</p>

<p>Cool that the first kanji of her last name ÉðÀî is the same second kanji as my name in Japanese, Ï©Éð.</p>
