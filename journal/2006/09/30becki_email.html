Hey Becki!!

Holy shit I've been in Japan too long...  I imagine Sarah must be in high school if not married with
kids by now compared to the wild squirt who ran headlong into the golf driving range and convinced
me touching an electric fence would be a good idea...

I'm still in Tokyo, though I have been *blessed* with an amazing trip around the world *TWICE* with
an organization called PB which basically helps bring peace to the world by helping people make
friends around the world.

Jordan, right in the middle of the middle east is a really beautiful place.  I could live there,
though I never would have guessed that 5 years ago.

I've lived and grown and changed so much..  I can't begin to summarize it all properly in a few
days.

The first year in Japan I worked for a terrible company (that only cared about money, not its
customers).  i thought I hated Japan, but realized I just needed a new job.  So I made the decision
to stay another year once I found a new (and much better) company.

<!-- Then I found PB and volunteered teaching English on a 100 day voyage around the world.  That
experience was tainted for me by a stalker named Hitomi (who had been my girlfriend, then sex
friend, then get-the-fuck-out-of-here not-friend, then just a pain in the ass)....  During that
voyage I vowed never to talk to her again.  -->

Also during the voyage there were two guest speakers on the ship: two young women who live in the
middle of the chaos between Israel and Palestine, an Israeli and a Palestinian...  They told us lots
about the conflict, and basically I couldn't believe it was that horrible.  So Niveen (the
Palestinian, who I chatted with a lot) invited me to come visit and see for myself.  I came.  I saw.
I still can't really believe it... they live in such horrible conditions that we would never
accept...  I can point you to things I've already written if you're interested.

After being in Jerusalem for 6 weeks, back to Japan and back on PB!!  For another voyage,
this time without a stalker, so it was much more comfortable for me to just take it all in.  Easter
Island was quite a highlight of that trip.

Then I fulfilled a long term dream of riding my bicycle with basically no agenda 1200km around Japan
(which is big compared to a bicycle, but 1200km does a pretty good sized loop on this island) That
trip lasted two months, with about 20 days actual riding.  AND a ten day silent meditation, which
was one of the most difficult (and rewarding) things I've ever done in my life.

Ironically, given that I rode my bicycle in order to save money, on the way back, I crashed and
broke my shoulder (and had no insurance) so I was suddenly $4000 in debt for the surgery (100%
success) and $3000 in debt for getting re-settled in Tokyo and getting a new computer (I needed one,
so breaking my old one was a good enough reason for me)

So right now I am missing the shit out of my friends and family in the US, but just working for "one
more year" to pay off this shoulder and stuff...

BUT, I know even if I come back to US, it's still a million miles between Florida and WV and VA and
Houston and other friends and family and California where I am considering going to school.
Especially given that I have no car ( and no real desire to get one after being pampered with this
*fantastic* train system in Tokyo, and $3-$4 gas prices in US)

And I'm not really happy with GWB up in the white house now..  (not really happy = utterly disgusted
and often pissed) He's a nightmare of lies and terror, killing people overseas and taking civil
rights domestically.  The current US government has too damn much power and too little moral fiber
to use that power correctly.  I'm a bit scared to go back.

Back in the US, I was part of Mankind Project (http://www.mkp.org), which has a group here in Tokyo
that meets every other week.  We are working to grow our group, helping "one man at a time" become a
better version of himself.  http://www.womanwithin.org is the women's version.

Thank you for your update; I hope you didn't fall asleep during this one.  Are Barbi and Sarah still
in the house with a golf course for a back yard?  I look forward to visiting there again.

I'm glad Cordie is doing well; I expect to see her again while she contines to be well.

   Love Love Love Love
    - Rob!
