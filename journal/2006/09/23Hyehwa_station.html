<p>Made it out to 


station where the street was blocked for several dance teams' performances.  I have no idea what the
festival was about, but I went to hopefully see Akane and Abebe, but I was unable to locate them.  I
did chow at McDonald's (with help ordering from a guy who spoke pretty decent English) while
watching performances.  I saw some cats, some red and white haired genies, some kids in black
shirts, and a combination of a few teams, but didn't find my friends.</p>

<p>I stayed until the end of the show and got the 411 for the show tomorrow at 11am, so I may be
able to scope them there then.</p>

<p>I talked to the leader of the genies, as he was speaking Japanese with some others, and I was
surprised he didn't comment surprisedly that I spoke Japanese.  He just answered my question
&quot;what's your team's name?&quot; and that was it.  Wow.  A normal 'conversation' in Japanese.</p>
