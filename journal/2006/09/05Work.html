<p>At McDonald's in Shibuya, going to hang out until I have work.</p>

<p class="date">5:46pm JST Tuesday  5 September 2006 (day 13313)</p>

<p>At work, about to have my first student of the day.</p>

<p>I came knowing that my first student wasn't scheduled until 6pm, hoping that someone may call
and request a lesson during the day.</p>

<p>That didn't happen, but I did get a nice phat nap, using Francois as a pillow.</p>

<p>And Reiko helped me (*) get tickets to Korea.  32,670±ß including tax.</p>

<p>She looked for prices and gave me the number of a different company that turned out to have this
even better price available.  I used the fax machine here to receive the confirmation.</p>

<p>Tooth brushing time now.</p>

<p class="date">10:54pm JST</p>

<p>Reiko called Tokudasan to confirm it was okay for me to get an advance of 40,000 yen to pay for
my flight to Korea.  Got it.  Totally cool; I'm going to hook up another stamp in (the new pages of)
my passport, <em>and</em> see Dru Daddy G, <em>and</em> see a new country, <em>and</em> be able to
tell people I've been to Korea.  Finally.</p>
