<p>We had great fun looking through her PB pictures.  I decided Easter Island was right near the
tiptop of the list of favorite ports.  It's so</p>

<p>so</p>

<p>beautiful.</p>

<p>Yuri is a great friend: really interested in meeting people and learning details of their lives.
She's still in touch with several of the crew members and all of her roommates and I can just
imagine she's as warm hearted and friendly (asking questions, and actually caring about the answers)
with all of them as with me.</p>

<p>After sandwiches in Loteria, we wandered a bit around Shibuya then tasty beverages in allegedly
the highest grossing Starbucks in the world.</p>
