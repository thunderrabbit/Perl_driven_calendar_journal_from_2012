<p>Just installed Seamonkey browser (that's what I used to read the war stuff), but I can't say
that I like it particularly more than just Firefox.  Perhaps if I choose to store mail locally, I
would do it... but..  Yeah, it's worth a look; I don't want to store ALL my mail locally, but just
what's in my gmail inbox.  If I can do that, then I'd like to.</p>
