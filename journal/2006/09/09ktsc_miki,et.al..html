<p>Went to KTSC to see KG Miki tonight, and also attend the party being thrown by the school for
their students.  I was asked to open the party with a &quot;speech&quot; and toast, which I did
readily and a teeeensy bit nervously after some faux hemming and hawing (*).</p>

<p>(*) I hope this is the first and last time this phrase appears in my journal.</p>

<p>I primarily enjoyed chowing free food and chatting with Nelly, a woman from northern France who
was the &quot;MC&quot; of the party (just for the beginning) and when she left, I shifted over to
Kaori, a Columbian/Japanese woman from the mountainous region of Columbia where her family speaks
Spain-style Spanish though the rest of the country speaks Columbian Spanish.</p>

<p>She *almost* went on PB, but didn't, because one of her friends said she had gotten into debt
during a voyage.  I explained in no uncertain terms Kaori <em>must</em> apply again.</p>

<p>Kaori left, then Miki and I left, but beat Kaori out the door because she apparently got stuck
talking to someone.  I gave a quick cheek hug with Naomi (tall and beautiful) though I didn't get
to talk to her tonight.</p>

<p>Train home with Miki as far as my station.  Woulda given her a kiss on the cheek, but I think she
doesn't feel that way about me.</p>

<p>Oh Miki.</p>
