<p>I don't actually know if this will work, but it's based on a guess that the metal detectors can't
also (have been refitted to) be liquid detectors.</p>

<p>I think they found my dangerous life threatening toothpaste only because the cat dug through my
bag due to the laptop, etcetera in it.  He pulled out my travel size tube of toothpaste (and also an
old tube of superglue that went through (from Narita to Incheon) with no worries) and showed me the
(laminated) regulation in several different languages explaining that we are not allowed to brush
our teeth on the plane.</p>

<p>I tossed the sheet onto the counter and was like, &quot;yeah yeah, WHY?&quot;</p>

<p>(( Why is every other country so stupidly blindly following the United Snakes of America, the
whiney pissy country of Terrorism Inc?  It's a fucking nightmare.</p>

<p>Why aren't we revolting?  Why didn't I throw down the toothpaste gauntlet and scream, &quot;you
want toothpaste terror?  This is the worst it can get!!&quot; and squirt toothpaste all over the
place, temporarily staining their suits with toothpaste and making the floor and counters a bit
cleaner with its whitener?? ))</p>

<p>He didn't answer, and then collected the offending items as I was like, &quot;can't you just put
them in the fucking box and the thing?&quot; too flustered to even use words properly.</p>

<p>He was like, &quot;checked luggage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah! (that)&quot;</p>

<p>He gave me my contraband toothpaste and was like, &quot;follow me&quot; and then &quot;wait
here&quot; outside a room labeled &quot;RE-SCREENING&quot; (or some such), and then out backwards
through a side entrance of security and then out into the dangerous toothpaste zone, where any felon
could assault me with toothpaste.</p>

<p><em>What??  he just fucking kicked me outside!  What kind of customer service is that??</em>
(nothing like Narita, where they gave me a box for my super dangerous pocket knife, back when we
didn't even know toothpaste was dangerous!  (what fools we were!!))</p>

<p>And really, I can't think of a more dangerous situation.  I was pissed, <em>wielding
toothpaste</em>, and unaccompanied by security.  I could have squirted
toothpaste <em>everywhere</em> and I really considered it, except I guessed I was on security
cameras, and that it would only mess up some low wage custodian's morning.</p>

<p>I stood for literally four minutes, wondering what to do.  Ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>squirt toothpaste on the floor</p></li>

<li><p>throw it away and be done</p></li>

<li><p>try to get a box and check it</p></li>

<li><p>try to check *only* the toothpaste.  (this idea didn't come to mind at that moment, but had
it, I may have tried it)</p></li>

<li><p>fill my bag with thumbtacks so the screeners won't want to check it</p></li>

<li><p>squirt toothpaste on George Bush's floor</p></li>

<li><p>Collect all the thrown-away toothpaste in the world and ship it to his house</p></li>

<li><p>Tuck it into my sock or shorts; I don't think the metal detectors can detect it (a plastic
tube)</p></li>

<li><p>put toothpaste all over my face like a mud mask</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I went to the restroom, squeezing the tube until it finally burst.  I squirted some in the
sink.  I'm so disappointed to waste toothpaste.  Chucked the 3/4 full tube into the garbage.  And
the old tube of super glue.</p>

<p>Back to security, but they saw a stamp on my ticket (that's what they guy had done in the
RE-SCREENING room) and were like, &quot;the other door&quot;</p>

<p>Went to the other door and got a cursory screening.  As in, they did *not* have me pull all the
shit out of my backpack.</p>

<p>And *<em>that</em>*, my friends, is where I could have put the toothpaste.  Exactly back where
it had been.</p>
