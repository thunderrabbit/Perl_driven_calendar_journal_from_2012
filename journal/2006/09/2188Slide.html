Thanks Rachel...

I'm here at the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the border between North
and South Korea which runs close to the 38th parallel north. My
question for you today is, which of these countries is NOT crossed by
the 38th parallel?

Is it...

A. United States
B. Turkey
C. Yugoslavia
D. Afghanistan
