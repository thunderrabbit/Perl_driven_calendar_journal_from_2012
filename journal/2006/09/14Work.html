<p>Brought my passport and passport sized photos to get my visa sorted.  The photo was carefully
constructed (though I forgot to get a picture of it); Francois' hat and ears are *just* visible in
the bottom of the picture.</p>

<p>Last lesson was with Shinpei, who I really like.  He works really hard to study: super motivated
and awesome.  80 minutes chillin' with him.</p>

<p>Chiemi was like, &quot;I can't teach Japanese&quot; or something negative like that.  I griped
her out and told her to write positive messages on her mirror.</p>
