<p class="dream">At arestaurant with a volcano in the back; they turned on the volcano and about 20
minutes later the lava was ready, so my friend went to scoop some up with a large metal salad bowl.
I was surprised he had no protection for his hands, but apparently the technique had been perfected
so that the metal bowl wouldn't transmit heat to his hands.  He scooped up about 2 cubic feet of
lava that he brought to the table; it was steaming and glowing and we used it to cook food at our
table.  We could put food items in the steam venting from the lava, and it would boil the food, or
we could put it in the glow of the lava and it would roast the food. Or we could put it near the
laval out of the glow and steam to bake the food..</p>

<p class="dream">I was testing it out more than cooking, because I wasn't very hungry, but I had
fun soaking some paper with the steam and then drying it out with the glow, and trying to balance
the two so I ended up with a plain sheet of paper like that with which I had started.  Dry enough
to write a letter, but not singed anywhere.</p>

<p class="dream">I got it to the perfect state and then borrowed a pen from my friend and started
to write down my dream because I realized it must be a dream, but it took me a bit to realize I was
still dreaming as I was writing before I woke up.</p>
