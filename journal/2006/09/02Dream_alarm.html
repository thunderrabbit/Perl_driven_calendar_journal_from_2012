<p class="dream">skating on skateboard back to the church, from the opposite direction on the map,
but I simply rememmbered it from last time and I turned left and went past the exit ramp to the
main thing and then it was wet and I slipped and slid on my shoes for 30 meters (paced out later)
and then my <em>dad</em> called me, with some note of calling me before work.</p>

<p class="dream">I paced off the thing to tell him how long it had been, and then woke up.</p>

<p>oh shit; my alarm didn't go off; good thing my dad called!!</p>
