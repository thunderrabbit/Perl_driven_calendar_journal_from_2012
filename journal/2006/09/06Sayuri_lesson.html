<p>Sayuri requested a 2 hour lesson today (usually we do 3) because she needed to take a movie back
to the rental shop.  It's a romance set in a cross country train where two people meet and fall in
love etc.</p>

<p>We chatted at Starbucks over cheesecake, scone, and tasty beverages (ice coffee-ish for her, and
vanilla frapucino (sp) for me.)</p>

<p>She talked a lot about chatting with peeps while at work, and how she is better able to chat on
computer than speak face to face.  I suggested perhaps she is a visual learner, so the text is
easier for her brain to process.  Same as me and Japanese.</p>
