<p>Found Akane after the flight (she had been corraled to the back) while waiting in line for my
visa stamp.  She went through first, and then I was denied because I hadn't filled out the *other*
card; we were only given one on the plane, so I thought that was it.  She waited and watched my bag
while I filled out the card.</p>

<p>Turns out we are also going back to Tokyo on the same flight!</p>

<p>Told her I had met Yun Hee, but hadn't seen her since she got off the flight.  We went through customs
together (actually she was denied at first, though I don't know why).  I changed 5000 yen into
39,000 wan and change after Akane guesstimated the cash I had (from Hitomi and Yun Hee) would get me
a bus ticket, but no food tonight.  Nice to have a friend who's been here 2 times already.</p>

<p>Outside we spoke Japanese and ignored people trying to offer taxi rides as we made plans to meet
tomorrow (if possible) and then headed to our separate busses.  If we can't meet tomorrow or the
next day, we'll try to connect in the airport on ¿·Ä«¤Æ</p>
