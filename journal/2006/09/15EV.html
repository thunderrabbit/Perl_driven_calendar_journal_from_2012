<p>Today Akiko and I were blabbering about stuff, and I was all harshing on TV and media in general
as life-sucking compared to life back in the day where all we had was a rock and trees.</p>

<p>Just had a level check with a woman named Mayumi.  Sometimes she would bust out with good stuff,
or have good understanding, but usually I pegged her for beginner level.  Perhaps she was just
nervous so that made her quieter...</p>

<p>One of my favorite students had a semi revealing top today.  Unzipped down to its lower limit
(mid cleavage), so I had to concentrate to maintain proper eye contact.</p>
