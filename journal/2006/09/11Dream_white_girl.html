<p class="dream">Was doing double stunts with a cheerleader, just goofing around as I was ot in the
school.  A white girl looking like Marilyn Monroe was doing cheers really genkily and the girl kep
telling her she didn't have to be so genki, but actually the genkiness helped the girl prform
(either directly or something) because while before she had been like a sack of potatoes, I now
could throw my double stunt partner nearly around in a full circle.</p>

<p class="dream">I realized the girl was nervous about having a white girl leading an all black
school's cheer leaders, though, irocally, she was also white.  I called her on it, like, &quot;oh
Shit Dawg!  You might hafta have a white cheerleader calling the stunts!!</p>

<p class="dream">she realized her foolishness, perhaps, and then proceeded to tell us about eating
in a restaurant at the very end of Manhattan island.  She said it was quite expensive.</p>

<p class="dream">Just at that moment, I noticed her train was leaving the platform.   D'oh!</p>

<p class="dream">She ran after it, but of course, to no avail.</p>

<p>Interesting, I just noticed Manhattan showed up on the anniversary of Airpline Day.  Hmmmm.</p>
