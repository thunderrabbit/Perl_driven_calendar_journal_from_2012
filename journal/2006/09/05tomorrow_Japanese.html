<p>Tomorrow I'll have my first &quot;official&quot; Japanese lesson in a while.  I've wondered a
bit about how to get back into the practice..  I've got a shload of study materials, all of which
are &quot;in progress&quot; and a lot of which I wish to transcribe onto my site, both to practice
and to record my progress..  I don't really want to start over with a while new technique, nor go
through all the crap from before to cull the stuff I know, etc etc etc blah.</p>

<p>One &quot;big&quot; issue is not having a printer at home; I would like to type a lot (I can
type hella faster than I can write, plus it only makes sense that I <em>type</em> in Japanese because that's
what I do in English, even though there's certainly the argument that I'm not learning kanji as
well when I type as when I write.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can work out a deal of having my teacher print stuff that I send her for checking in
our lesson.</p>

<p>We're meeting near my station; she lives in the same neighborhood.</p>

<p>I want a teacher as supportive and genki as I think *I* am in class teaching English.  And no
resorting to English unless absolutely necessary.</p>
