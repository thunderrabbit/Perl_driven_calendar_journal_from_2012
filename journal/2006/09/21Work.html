<p>Just sold the snot out of PB voyages; I have got to get some business cards like with PB logo
and all professional looking.  I wonder if they will authorize some for me.  And I should get some
PB flyers about upcoming voyages because this particular student was like, &quot;wow&quot; and
looked really interested in going.</p>

<p>Today has gone pretty quickly.  80 minutes with one student was a bit of a stretch because she's
quite hesitant to introduce new topics.  Her English is quite good enough, but she just doesn't use
it.</p>

<p>Had to stand up during the next lesson, I was like, &quot;aight, let's pretend we are at a
party,&quot; because we had just done greeting questions and I was close to zonking out.  But when
we stood up, it was much easier.</p>

<p>One more lesson, then 20 minute break, then 3 more lessons, ending with 80 minutes with Shinpei,
who loves my hard corrections.  I think tonight I will ask him to teach me Japanese.</p>
