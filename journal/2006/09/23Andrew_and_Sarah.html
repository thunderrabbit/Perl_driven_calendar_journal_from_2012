<p>Andrew and his friend Sarah are going hiking today; I pretty much wish I was going with them, but
the tour has been organized and I will hopefully get to do the 88slide recording.  Sarah and Andrew
gossipped about work and were generally pretty funny.  Sarah and I got one good joke in, but Andrew
got a killer..</p>

<p>I can't remember Sarah's, but we were standing waiting for the bus near his house.</p>

<p>At one point, Andrew was like, &quot;how old do you think he is?&quot;</p>

<p>And Sarah's like, &quot;how old are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh oh oh!!  Today I am thirteen thousand three hundred and thirty one days old!&quot;</p>

<p>Sarah was like, &quot;so.... how old are you?&quot; not even going to try the math (I wouldn't;
most people don't).</p>

<p>&quot;Andrew goes, &quot;aren't you even going to try?&quot;</p>

<p>And I &quot;whispered&quot; to Andrew behind the tour book, &quot;<em>your friend is
dumb.</em>&quot; so she could overhear and then we all busted out laughing; I had tears streaming
down.</p>

<p>BUT, in the train station, .. shit I can't remember the set up..</p>

<p>Sarah was taking a drink right as Andrew was like, &quot;well, I wouldn't say I'm a
<em>slut</em>....&quot; and she spewed, hitting the cover of her drink and Andrew's leg.</p>
