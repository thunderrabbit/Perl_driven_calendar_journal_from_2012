<p>Just been reading about Abrams M1 tanks, the new Stryker replacements, and Apache helicopters
with hellfire missles that can take them all out.</p>

<p>Interesting that a <em>helicopter</em> seems to beat a tank in this case, but my imagination
says tanks are more prevalent.  I wonder why.  As personnel carriers?</p>
