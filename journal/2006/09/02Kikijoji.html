<p>Students today have been cool so far, going from high speed chat about exporting slag (byproduct
of steel production) to use as concrete (while I slurped down a couple of jelly drinks from the
convenience store, to my answering a spew of questions with quite limited relation to each other, as
in very low comprehension on my answers, though she didn't ask for clarification.  (Same as last
week, apparently, when I wrote '&quot;I don't understand&quot; &lt;&hyphen;&hyphen; I taught her how
to use this.')</p>

<p>It doesn't seem to have stuck.</p>

<p class="date">6:37pm JST Saturday  2 September 2006</p>

<p>Last two lessons were husband and wife; Hideaki and Sayaka.  They are both high level, so I
enjoyed finishing out the day with them.</p>

<p>Actually there was a level-check in between them, scheduled at the last minute.  A woman named
Junko whose English is even *better* than theirs; she live in Ohio starting at age 15 and somehow
survived though she went in with zero English ability.  Now her skills are money and I was hard
pressed to find any errors.  She missed a single plural: &quot;month&quot; instead of
&quot;months&quot; in our 18 minute chat.</p>

<p>Super funny: on the level check guide, there are questions that are rather strange, and just
serve as suggestions.  In Junko's level check, I was able to ask one of the stranger questions, and
it was only slightly strange!</p>

<p>I asked what she had done today and she said she had gone out with her mom.  That was my chance:
&quot;does your mother like animals?&quot;</p>

<p>Junko assured me her mom likes dogs (big dogs) and told me the sad tale of their 16 year old dog
recently leaving the family for doggie heaven.</p>

<p>I switched back to the vocabulary and made an error: completely underestimated her vocabulary
memory.  I was like, &quot;are you an optimistic person or a pessimistic person?&quot; as I was
certain she knew every other word on the list.</p>

<p>She goes, &quot;what kind of question is <em>that</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>That's when I showed her the sheet and that I was glad to have been able to use the strange
question.</p>

<p>Had to wrap up soon thereafter.</p>
