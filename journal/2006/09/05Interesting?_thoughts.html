<p>On the train thinking about the meaning of life.  It seems I want to have a focus, a goal, a
reason for living.</p>

<p>(I posit that <em>everyone</em> wants a reason to live (once their basic needs are met).)</p>

<p>I can continue to walk around Tokyo and say, &quot;there's no reason for me to be here...&quot;
and move to the next city and say the same thing.</p>

<p>Eventually go to every city and believe there is no reason to be anywhere, and therefore no
reason to live.</p>

<p>So, it's not something external that gives me reason to live.</p>

<p>Or I can see reasons to be here, and do them, but not be fulfilled by them.</p>

<p>What is fulfilling?  How do I find it?</p>
