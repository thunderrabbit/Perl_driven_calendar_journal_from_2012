<p class="dream">At a post office where a customer had a transaction in progress: a ig basket full
of stuff.  I came to the window an my large flat box was placed on top of the baset before the
basket tranaction was finished.  The postal employee was confirming with the customer, &quot;so all
of these are priority,&quot; referring to the items in the basket, which now also contained my
parcel.</p>

<p class="dream">I was walking along the counter alongside my box as the basket was moved along and
a cute young woman with braces recognized what had happened.  She asked about the box, and I was
like, &quot;I don't mind if it's also priority, but I'm not sure if it's been paid for,&quot; (which
was strange because I knew it had not been paid for)</p>

<p class="dream">She smiled, &quot;it would go to the dumpster in the back, unless you fill out an
anti-address form.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The box was clearly addressed &quot;From Google&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I was flirty like, &quot;an <em>anti-</em>address form?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I know it's weird,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I'll do it only if you tell me why it's called an anti-address
form.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I was hoping she'd be facing me when she told the story so I could watch her
bracey smile, but the story was short and she told most of it while going to the back and getting
the form.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Basically I misunderstood the Japanese on the form, and told people to write
the address, but it actually calls for a map.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">As she showed me the form, I could read some katakana on it, though the font was a
bit sparse: ¥Õ¥¡¥Þ; it was supposed to be farm.</p>
