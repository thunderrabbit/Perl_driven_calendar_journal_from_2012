<p>Pretty solid awake for most of it, and when it came to perceiving floating in the ball, I didn't
notice much.  Perceiving above my head felt cold, then to my right felt like a stretching to the
right.  To the bottom I started to have dream images and felt water dreams or liquid alcohol, and
then to the left people were beckoning me to join them.   I basically fell asleep durng the rest of
the directions.</p>
