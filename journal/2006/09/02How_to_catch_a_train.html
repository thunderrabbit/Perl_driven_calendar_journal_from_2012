<p>Zoom</p>

<p>I'm panting, catching my breath....</p>

<p>I <em>just</em> got the train at 9:14am in Sakurashinmachi... as in I arrived at the station at
9:13, and was running down the two flights of stairs as the train was entering the station.</p>

<p>Stepped on with no worries.</p>

<p>(( The trains in Tokyo are really excellent.  The train system in Tokyo is second to none in the
world for on time departures, precision arrivals, cleanliness of trains, low price tickets, and
sheer stunning <em>volume</em> of passengers that ride every day. ))</p>

<p>Because of the &quot;precision of arrival&quot; factor noted above, I knew exactly which door I
should exit for fastest transit to my next line.</p>

<p><em>zoom</em> running up the stairs, around the corner through the gates, run up the still-empty
escalator, up more 1.5 flights of stairs, outside, walking up the long escalator, right to the
gates of my next line, just as the bell was going off to signal doors closing. </p>

<p>Here's the part to watch on video in super slow-mo:</p>

<p>Two people in front of me, &quot;rushing&quot; for the train</p>

<p>Doors <em>begin to close</em></p>

<p>The two people in front of me give up, effectively <b>blocking</b> the doors</p>

<p>I <em>bolt</em> to the <em>next</em> set of doors as they are <em>continuing to close</em></p>

<p><em>Punch the air</em> between the doors as they close on my arm</p>

<p>Doors open, and I step politely onto the train.</p>

<p>さくっと</p>
