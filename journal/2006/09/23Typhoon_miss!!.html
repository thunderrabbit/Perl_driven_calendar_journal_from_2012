Typhoon Yagi, a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 221 kilometers an hour (138 miles
an hour), was located 959 kilometers east-southeast of Iwojima at 9 a.m. Japan time today (9/21),
according to the latest advisory on the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center's Web site. Yagi, the
16th-named storm of the Pacific cyclone season, is heading west at 29 kilometers an hour and is
forecast to become a Supertyphoon, or Category 5 storm, by tomorrow morning, the center said. The
storm's winds are gusting to as high as 267 kilometers per hour and typhoon strength winds extend
out as far as 74 kilometers to the north east of the storm's eye. Waves are as high as 39 feet (11.9
meters) in the vicinity of Yagi's eye, which is now clearly defined on the satellite photo on the
Typhoon Center's Web site. Yagi, which is Japanese for goat, is forecast to track west before
turning north. It's forecast to be closest to Tokyo during the morning of Sept. 24.

Since this Typhoon will be approaching Tokyo over the weekend, everyone should tune into AFN 810 for
further information. You can find additional information on the following link:
