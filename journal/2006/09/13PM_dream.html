<p class="dream">There was a problem on PB, though everyone was okay (even though it included
flooding).  The huge and controversial fish tank ruptured, spilling its contents and flooding the
passenger rooms with three feet of water.  During the discussion, I was only getting snippets of
the story until I was like, &quot;actually, I don't know exactly what happened.  What
happened?&quot; and someone told me the deets.</p>
