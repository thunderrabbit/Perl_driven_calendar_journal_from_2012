<p>Yes, liquids are prohibited in Japan as well.  I can't ....</p>

<p>fathom how stupid it is.</p>

<p>After I received the sheet of paper (how many trees per day are killed) telling me about the new
rule, I crumpled it up and left it on a cattle-guard post, then tossed my tube of toothpaste onto
the floor (it was empty-ish) and left my bottle of water (that I've been reusing for <em>two
months</em>) on a newspaper rack as my little pointless acts (not discarding such items where they
are &quot;supposed&quot; to go) of defiance against the system and The Man (George Bush's Puppet
Master(s)).</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>I brought the chicken leg bone (remains of my snack on the way to the airport) through the X-ray
machine (TWICE (because they freaked out when I had a computer, cooling fan, keyboard, video camera
in my bag)) without a problem.</p>

<p>Chicken bones, as we all know from childhood, are sharp when they break.  &quot;Don't give
chicken bones to the dog; they could splinter and get stuck in his throat.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm thinking of breaking my chicken bone into a nice little stabbin' knife and killing a cabin
attendant just to prove PLANES ARE NOT SAFEr than just walking around downtown.  All this fucking
plastic bottle wasting, paper wasting, time wasting, stupid bullshit to keep me safer,
while <em>allowing</em> me to bring matches to burn things, my wallet chain to strangle someone, a
computer to beat someone to a pulp, a keyboard to do the same, a chicken bone to stab them in the
eye..  it's a fucking farce and I don't buy for one second that I'm any goddamn safer without my
bottle of water than if ALL of us were water bottle toothpaste wielding maniacs set on overtaking
the cockpit and <em>splashing</em> the captain!!</p>

<p>Half the mofos walkin' around here on the safe side of the water impasse are mindlessly carrying
the A4 sheet of paper as if it will keep them safe!</p>

<p>Who pushed this through, Coca-Cola?  I saw a guy carrying a can of coke that he must have just
purchased for a million percent markup because it's been Certified Safe by the Department of
Stupid.</p>

<p>As we all know from Youtube, we can just buy a bottle of yer favorite carbonated beverage, a tube
of Mentos (I wouldn't promote them, but I don't know what the hell they <em>are</em>) and presto,
instant bomb!</p>

<p>So, what do I do?  Just get pissed and follow the rules and not have any impact?  Blab about it
in my journal?  This is so fucking stupid.</p>
