<p>Question took various forms, and the first two didn't get answers, but then the third one,
asking about what to do regarding the ability to take toothpaste on the flight was, &quot;do
research&quot;</p>

<p>As in, perhaps only the US and UK have this preposterous rule.</p>

<p>Just as the track was finishing, I got this chat message from Fred:</p>

Fred: i think only america is damaged that way
      i would be surprised if you could stage a media event
Sent at 6:10 AM on Monday
me:   UK was blocking toothpaste too; they had to cancel a lot of flights.
Fred: yeah, well, us and uk are in bed together
me:   Japan too
      but not as much I hope
Fred: i bet japan is more sane about "terrorism"
      and i'm sure korea has better things to worry about
me:   I was thinking about Japan's sanity recently
      in positive terms as you are suggesting in this case
Fred: heh
me:   I'ma go back to sleep; your timing was lovely.
Fred: k
me:   have a great rest of your day!
Fred: wondered why you were awake
      aoight
me:   just taking a whiz
      then listening to a hemisynch CD track
Fred: ah
me:   it was just finishing
      scope you later
Fred: k
