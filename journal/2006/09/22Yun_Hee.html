<p>I met Yun Hee on the plane; she sat next to me and we chatted to the best of my ability in
Japanese.  Her Japanese seems better than mine, but I still fared semi-okay, I think.  She's from
Seoul, and going back for a week after 6 months of a year studying in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Right when I asked her name, she was taking a bite of her Doraemon-branded snack treat, one of
which she offered to me.  Pretty funny.</p>

<p>Her sister lives in New York, and her friend's birthday is today.</p>

<p>She told me what foods I should try, and a few words in Korean.  She suggested against trying
dog because they are too cute to eat.</p>

<p>I whipped out Francois, who is also too cute to eat, and we used him as a point of conversation
for a bit.</p>

<p>Traded contact info, etc; when we arrived, she headed off the plane first to contact friends;
I've not seen her since (on the bus now, so prolly won't see her again).</p>
