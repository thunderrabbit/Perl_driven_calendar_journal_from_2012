<p class="dream">I was walking outside and close to a university, and a whole bunch of Japanese
were waiting and waiting for the light to turn green, though the street they wanted to cross was
nothing more than a sidewalk, and not crowded.  I just walked across, behind the back of the cop
who was monitoring the intersection, and ignored anything that sounded like, &quot;hey, where are
you going??&quot; and went into the school under the guise of wanting to register for classes.</p>

<p class="dream">Wandered into a room and found myself at a party designed for people to meet and
hook up, but every time I started getting really groovy baby, I got shut down.  As I left the party,
I met a woman who seemed more interested, but I woke up before we talked too much.</p>

<p class="dream">The party was advertised as if its participants could really get raw and crazy,
but then all the resulting materials (album covers and art) had to be quite family oriented.</p>

<p class="dream">I was getting close to a black girl and a mexican girl at the same time, but then
they both dumped me because I wasn't choosing one or the other.  I chose the black girl because she
was tall, but she was like fuckoff (not so harshly) and walked away, but I couldn't tell if she was
joking.</p>

<p class="dream">There was an aspect of the party like a game to get as many people's ribbons as
possible, as that meant they were interested in hooking up, but we couldn't get too many ribbons
because then people would think we hadn't been playing fairly.</p>
