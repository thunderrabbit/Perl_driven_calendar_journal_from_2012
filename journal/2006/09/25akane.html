<p>Akane arrived as the flight was boarding; we didn't chat during the flight, but got ample (though
sleepy) talk time during the train back to Yamanote Line.  We mostly chatted in Japanese.   I can
barely remember the details now, but I remember hoping to see the Hana Korea crew again
soon. (perhaps in October)</p>
