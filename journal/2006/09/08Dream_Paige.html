<p class="dream">In a classroom setting, Paige was a couple desks away painting a picture of a car
with a custom paint job that made it look 3D.  I asked what she was working on, and she was like,
&quot;I'm going to register this paint job,&quot; as in to get it trademarked.  I was like,
&quot;wow, that's really cool,&quot; because I didn't know one *could* get trademarks for custom
car designs.</p>

<p class="dream">I knelt down next to her desk, and as my perspective changed, so did the 3D-ness
of the car; I realized it wasn't a car with a big extra hump on the hood, but a car with a big
section carved out of the hood; basically the size of a bathtub was &quot;dented&quot; into the
hood.  I was like, &quot;double wow!  I thought it was a big lump!  But this is amazing; you've got
the engine compressed along the edges so compactly!&quot; even though one couldn't actually see the
engine from the picture.</p>

<p class="dream">Some type of dream-shift happened, and she was answring a question by placing a
kiss on my cheek.  I noted it seemed to last longer than a peck, so I turned and she was like,
&quot;that's right,&quot; and we began to kiss.  A lot.  All the other students who had been in the
room left, and then the teacher did too, as we began to consummate our love for one another.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;I've loved you since I met you, but I was just too scared to say
it.&quot;  She said her love for me has grown over the years, and was glad that we finally had a
chance to connect.</p>

<p class="dream">We continued to connect until I woke up.</p>
