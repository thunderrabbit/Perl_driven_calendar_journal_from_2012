<p>Have arrived in Icheon, and am actually on the bus now headed toward Dru's.  I didn't realize
Icheon was on an island (I don't know *shit* about Korea); until I asked Andrew, I didn't even know
what airports existed in Korea, etc.</p>

<p>ANY way</p>

<p>Right after I got off the jetway, I found a passport on the floor.  I picked it up, turned it in
to the next official looking guy I saw and discovered a difference between Japan and Korea.  He
thanked me for the passport, then opened it and shouted down the hall at the passengers walking
toward customs.</p>

<p>Joe Skateboard!!!!  (or whatever the name was)  JOE SKATEboard!!!!!   JOE
SKATEBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>That would not happen in Japan.</p>
