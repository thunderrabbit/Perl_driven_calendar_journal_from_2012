<p>So, at the end of day number 13331, my first day in Korea, I find Koreans louder than Japanese,
more willing to offer help than Japanese. </p>

<p>Except there are only like 10 lines in Seoul, as opposed to a million in Tokyo, the trains are
about the same as Tokyo, though I haven't checked their timeliness.</p>

<p>Koreans are more willing to break the rules than Japanese, as in we were stuck in traffic at the
end of the tour, so they just let us off the bus in the middle of the street.  Pretty sure that
would never happen in Japan.</p>

<p>Girls hold hands more in Seoul.  I mean with each other.  Girl friends walk hand in hand, or arm
in arm, and sometimes pet each other while talking.  I see this occasionally in Tokyo, but more
often here.</p>

<p>Makeup and fashion seem to be of equal importance in both cities.</p>
