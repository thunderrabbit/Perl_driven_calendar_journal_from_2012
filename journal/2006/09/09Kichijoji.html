<p>Working at Kichijoji today; I'm well on time this week as opposed to last week, though I still
haven't really eaten enough this morning.  Up late talking last night.</p>

<p>Today after work I'm going to KG Miki's school for a party thing, and Madoka has asked if I
would be willing to lead a game or activity for 30 minutes.  (!!)</p>

<p>I snagged my &quot;New Games Book&quot; and... yeah I can do a game or activity, though I don't
know if it will last 30 minutes.  Perhaps 10, 15, 60 minutes....???</p>

<p>Wow.  Just had a new student named °Ñ»Ò who was super super super genki and really worked hard to
learn, etc.  And she just smiled and smiled during the lesson with the joy of learning.  So great.</p>

<p>Really look forward to working with her again.</p>

<p>Just finished.  Last student was new, and quite fluent.  She's level 3 at NOVA and using up the
remainder of her points before she makes a full transition to EV.  She agreed with me that NOVA
only cares about money, and not about teaching students.</p>

<p>I talked way too much during the lesson, but she didn't seem to mind.  I hope that's the case,
at least.</p>

<p>Second to last student was a cat who works for Honda's marketing company, which, as I understood
from his description is basically a Honda spin-off company so that its workers would not have the
protection of the union that Honda manufacturing workers have.  Wow.</p>

<p>Also chatted with Yuria today; she asked me to help her compose two letters: one thank you for a
referral, and one welcome to the referral.</p>

<p>Had the married couple each in their own lesson again today.  He asked some quite specific
questions about advertising on trains in the US.  I first had to clarify that there basically are
no trains in the US.</p>

<p>At the end of our lesson, she and I talked about ways of augmenting my days old counting scheme
by using base 2 or base 16.  Basically base 16 makes slightly more interesting words, but they are
too big before they get very interesting.</p>
