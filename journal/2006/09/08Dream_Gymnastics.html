<p class="dream">I could do flying gymnastics called kilometering, a super combination of spins and
flips that used no bars to apply force, but just the mind to rotate the body around any imagined
object, at any level in the room, so the result was like flying and flipping and looping aroud the
room in three dimensional space like Peter Pan.</p>

<p class="dream">I had tried to do it before, but had been unable to qualify, but apparently I
could do a lot more now, so my manager encouraged me to try out again, and was even willing to call
the recruiter guy who judged these types of things.</p>
