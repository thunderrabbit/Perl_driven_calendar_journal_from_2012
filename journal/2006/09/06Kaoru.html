<p>Lesson with Kaoru was pretty relaxed today after we chatted online and she &quot;accused&quot;
me of acting Japanese (polite), so I busted out with some shit like damn dawg why da hell you
don' say you ain't talkin' no Japanese style an shit?</p>

<p>She was like, &quot;that's better.&quot;</p>

<p>AND, she assured me she didn't mind printing stuff for me, so I asked her this morning if she
would print some goodies for my Japanese lesson, which she did.</p>

<p>I noted I could use the printouts more effectively for studying if the Japanese was
double-spaced, so I plan to add some code to my site to allow this.  (just a quick stylesheet
change)</p>

<p>Oh, plus not printing all the google ad stuff.  Perhaps I'll make it &quot;print version&quot;
and take out the ads.  If the journal type=nihongo, I will double space it.  Sounds good.</p>
