<p>After work I told her I kissed Miki on Sunday.  I layed out every distracting woman in my life
right now:</p>

<p>janette, with whom I've connected mo' deeper than any other woman ever</p>

<p>Ami, one of my students who I'm sure I could get, but it would only be feral</p>

<p>Paige, tall brilliant beautiful genki in Jordan, but who won't email me back</p>

<p>Madeline (rar), in US who may come to Japan</p>

<p>I told her about the impersonation of Eri, and how Eri has not contacted me back since
she said, &quot;I didn't write that.&quot;</p>

<p>I cried, and would have cried a lot more had we had time before last train.</p>
