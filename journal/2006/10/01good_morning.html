<p>In Omote Sando, while waiting for the train, a girl two seats from me fell asleep.  Our train
came and everyone else got up except her.  Following Japan's inability to communicate with strangers, I
just bumped her arm a bit and made brief eye contact before walking to the train.</p>

<p>I could have easily started a conversation; she was quite thankful for having been woken up; she
would have been screwed to miss last train (though this was only the second to last train), through
which she easily could have snoozed.  But, I didn't.  I didn't think of the first thing to say
which could have been おはよございます or 大丈夫？</p>

<p>She made eye contact with me and smiled thanks, and then smilingly thanked me again when she got
off at her station (駒沢大学).  I seem to have forgotten to be a bit outgoing as prescribed by my
epiphany in Korea.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>
