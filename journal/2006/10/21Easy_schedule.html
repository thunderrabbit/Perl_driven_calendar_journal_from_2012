<p>Yesterday when Michiko faxed my schedule for today, I was surprised to find I start at noon,
instead of 10am.  Wow.  This must be partially because Tracy and Jamie are both back in town; I'm
no longer covering their students.</p>

<p>This morning just as I was leaving, Michiko called me, and I was thinking <em>shit! did I get it
wrong??</em> as she was politely identifying herself, asking how my day was going, etc, and *then*
explaining the purpose of her call: my first student had cancelled; I don't have to work until
1pm.</p>

<p>Ah.  Okay; fair enough reason for not jumping straight to the point.</p>

<p>I'd rather work in Shibuya where I can make more money, but there are no rooms available in the
school on Saturday.</p>
