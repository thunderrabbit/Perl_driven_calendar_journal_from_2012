<p>Yesterday I went to Softbank in ½ÂÃ« and met Sone, who spoke decent enough English to explain
the mystery.  They are not offereing a phone and iPod combined.  They're offering a discount iPod
if I buy a phone.</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>That changes everything.</p>

<p>Also went by Tokyu Hands to find popsicle sticks.  They had them, in the baking section, 50 in a
pack for 304 yen.   Basically 6 cents per stick.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;naw naw naw, I need a <em>thousand</em> sticks.&quot;</p>

<p>She explained they didn't have a thousand in stock, but that they could get it by...</p>

<p>&quot;Naw naw naw naw; I ain't buying 10000 popsicle sticks in 20 packs of 50.  I want a BOX of
1000 sticks.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally the idea made it across the gap and she called someone at a number in her catalog.  It
took about FIVE MINUTES of discussion to get a price back.  I don't know what they were talking
about, but she kept saying 10000 sticks. and she kept saying 20 and 50.</p>

<p>So basically they were talking for five minutes about the exact same thing already available
here, and it took five minutes to get a price.  5000 yen.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly unimpressed with the amount of time wasted getting a simple answer (especially
one that was only 15% lower on a price that was 300% too high in the first place.)  I was like,
&quot;is that it?&quot;</p>

<p>yes</p>

<p>Okay thank you bye.</p>

<p>Cripes.</p>
