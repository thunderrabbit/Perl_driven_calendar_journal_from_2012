<p class="dream">Talking with a guy in a tennis court who spontaneously came up with a tennis /
baseball hybrid game for three people.  One is the batter, and whoever can recover the most batted
tennis balls becomes the next batter.</p>

<p class="dream">I knew his son, a young boy with curly blond locks.  I was like, &quot;your dad is
pretty cool.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I don't remember what topic we had been discussing before the game, but it was interesting.</p>
