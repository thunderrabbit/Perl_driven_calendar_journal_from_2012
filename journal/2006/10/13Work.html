<p>Word was pretty good today; I almost set up a lesson with Ami outside, but decided it would
basically be a bad idea.  Fun with Kyoko, who had plenty to talk about; I'm *so* glad I
&quot;killed her book&quot; (my description in her file of the day I was like, &quot;wtf are you
doing? your English is fine; let's just talk&quot;)  She's booked my lesson multiple times in a row
since then.</p>
