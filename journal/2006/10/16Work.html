<p>At work just had Victor's favorite student, who has one cool and rare kanji for her name.  She
lives quite close to Kosugi, near MH where I used to live, and where NPShokoShoko probably still
lives, though I'm not totally sure.  Also not sure about Ikumi; haven't talked to her in quite a
while.</p>

<p>Anyway, she was cool and pretty chatty, though her interests seem to match Victor's more closely
than mine (ancient European history).</p>

<p>Had a lesson was was like, &quot;oh . my . god . please&quot; like please laugh or understand or
speak or anything.  Wow.</p>

<p>One student whose first name is Ãæ joined today after taking my lesson as his second trial
lesson.  He owns a bar in ½ÂÃ« and has invited us to come visit.  He apparently cooks everything,
and I could see a smile spread across his face as he talked about it.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying a no-show now, then a student I don't remember, Ami, and then Tatsuya who runs two
video distribution websites (one for adults and one for kids).  I tried to download a couple of
vids, but don't have the latest version of the .wmv codec.</p>
