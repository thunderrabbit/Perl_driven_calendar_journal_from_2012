<p class="dream">On a tropical island with PB peeps, walking back to my cabin along a narrow road,
a car started to curve towrd me and lie squish me against the wall, and I yelled at him to get away
from me.  He baced off, then came again, and I yelled obscenities each time at him and it was
alsmost like he thought I was calling him to me, but I uust wanted him to get the hell out of my
way.</p>

<p class="dream">I turned toward my cabin and he stopped and got out to try and see if he could
help, and I was angry at first but then disarmed when I saw he was a monk, who apparently only
spoke Spanish.  I tried to back track, but couldn't do it, and then just cried that I was scared
when he was trying to squish me, and I'm all alone on this trip around the world.  He wrote for me his
email adress on a train ticket, and I gave him my gmail address only so he couldn't ikely find my
domain and see my journal and find that I was not in fact alone on the PB trip around the world.</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't want to admit having lied to a monk.</p>
