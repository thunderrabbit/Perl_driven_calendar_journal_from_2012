<p>Worked on games for Tariq, basically cut and pasted paper and glue and pen and made some
semi-decent looking paper versions of the games.  Nothing to write home about, but it was fun to be
like a kid again.  Went to Shibuya to try and scam free copies from work, but Reiko was like,
&quot;no&quot; so went to Kinko's and got copies then to Royal Host to chow and work more on the
pages until I got tired and came home.</p>

<p>Worked a bit more at home and now it's bedtime.</p>
