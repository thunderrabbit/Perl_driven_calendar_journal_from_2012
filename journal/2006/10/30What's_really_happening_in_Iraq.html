wanna know what is really going on in Iraq?  Here's a letter from a Marine who is there now and has
been there a while.  Apparently, this email has been passed around to many US Generals.  I've
clipped some of the highlights of the letter and provided a link to the full text, if you are
interested...

All: I haven't written very much from Iraq. There's really not much to write about. More exactly,
there's not much I can write about because practically everything I do, read or hear is classified
military information or is depressing to the point that I'd rather just forget about it, never mind
write about it. The gaps in between all of that are filled with the pure tedium of daily life in an
armed camp. So it's a bit of a struggle to think of anything to put into a letter that's worth
reading. Worse, this place just consumes you. I work 18-20-hour days, every day.
 
Proudest Moment - It's a tie every day, watching our Marines produce phenomenal intelligence
products that go pretty far in teasing apart Bad Guy operations in al-Anbar. Every night Marines and
Soldiers are kicking in doors and grabbing Bad Guys based on intelligence developed by our guys. We
rarely lose a Marine during these raids, they are so well-informed of the objective. A bunch of kids
right out of high school shouldn't be able to work so well, but they do.
 
Bravest Guy in al-Anbar Province - Any Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician (EOD Tech). How'd you
like a job that required you to defuse bombs in a hole in the middle of the road that very likely
are booby-trapped or connected by wire to a bad guy who's just waiting for you to get close to the
bomb before he clicks the detonator? Every day. Sanitation workers in New York City get paid more
than these guys. Talk about courage and commitment.
 
Second Bravest Guy in al-Anbar Province - It's a 20,000-way tie among all these Marines and Soldiers
who venture out on the highways and through the towns of al-Anbar every day, not knowing if it will
be their last - and for a couple of them, it will be.
 
Most Profound Man in Iraq - an unidentified farmer in a fairly remote area who, after being asked by
Reconnaissance Marines if he had seen any foreign fighters in the area replied "Yes, you."
 
Happiest Moment - Well, it wasn't in Iraq. There are no truly happy moments here. It was back in
California when I was able to hold my family again while home on leave during July.
 
Biggest Outrage - Practically anything said by talking heads on TV about the war in Iraq, not that I
get to watch much TV. Their thoughts are consistently both grossly simplistic and politically
slanted. Biggest Offender: Bill O'Reilly.
 
Biggest Hassle - High-ranking visitors. More disruptive to work than a rocket attack. VIPs demand
briefs and "battlefield" tours (we take them to quiet sections of Fallujah, which is plenty scary
for them). Our briefs and commentary seem to have no effect on their preconceived notions of what's
going on in Iraq. Their trips allow them to say that they've been to Fallujah, which gives them an
unfortunate degree of credibility in perpetuating their fantasies about the insurgency here.

<p>If that's the biggest hassle, then the high ranking officials should be taken on real missions so
they will 1) stop wanting to come and 2) know what's really going on 3) want to stop the war!</p>
