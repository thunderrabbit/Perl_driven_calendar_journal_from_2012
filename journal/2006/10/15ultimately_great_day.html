<p>Ultimate was big fun, and tiring.  Jason was a little zany with his comments.  At one point I
came onto the field on his team, and he was like, &quot;and Rob's here; it's over,&quot; as in the
game is over because we've won already.</p>

<p>Far too kind; I don't think I touched the disc that point.</p>

<p>But even better than ultimate</p>

<p>connecting with. Lisa, Laura, Yoshi, Matt, Phil, Maruan, Kyoko, Reiko, Dan, Robento, Yuuka,
Kellie, and Caroline..  All from 52nd voyage except the friends and significant others.</p>

<p>Big fun crazy-bowling (I got 166 points in two games; Francois got caught between the balls a
lot, and even helped throw a ball; mostly I was just effing around, doing backwards throws and
sliding on the floor, and bowling without touching the floor, etc), and then heading to a
&quot;Korean BBQ place&quot;, chatting with Dan and Kellie across the table from me, as we tossed
various things up the suction pipe in the restaurant, a grill-it-yerself place serving all variety
of sliced edibles in raw form.</p>

<p>We were in rare form, given that we rarely hang out (at least *I* rarely hang out with them) and
it was just a blast and 1/2.</p>

<p>Phil and Yuuka are getting on the ship again soon, for the big 55.. and oh-my-gosh I just
realized that's Rei's double-lucky number!!  So great that she'll be CCC!</p>

<p>It was all for Rara's birthday: bowling wearing crazy costumes.  I hope to get pics up soon.</p>

<p>On the way home I enjoyed gazing into Carolie's beautiful blue eyes even though she's married
and smokes, as we talked about conspiracy theories and stuff about the United Snakes of America and
Stonecutters and Bush, etc etc.  Good times.  I invited her to gmail just a bit ago because she
only has a hotmail address....</p>
