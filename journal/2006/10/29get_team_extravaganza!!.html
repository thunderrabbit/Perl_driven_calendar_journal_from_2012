<p>Holy hella wow wow wow wow, what a great GET Team on the 54th Voyage!!  Natちゃん did a great job
putting together an incredibly cool team that bonded wonderfully during the voyage.  I delightedly
hung out with them at Jonathon's after watching departure (from the wrong side of the gap), chillin'
between かな (who will be hitchhiking to Fukuoka with Jeremy (sp)) and Aiko (with a dot under her s
to make it an sh) from Istanbul (now Naha (where one year has turned into 5 years)).</p>

<p>Next to Jeremy and across from Aiko was another かな, who I didn't really meet.  To the left of
the first かな (and past a guitar) was Adriana (who I've met a million times, and always forgotten
her name (until today, is my plan)) and then Carla (of the laughta fantastica) talking with John,
Levi, and others I can't remember now.  Aiko captured my heart for the day with her height, origin,
stories and photos.  Natalie captured the longest bestest hugs :-) :-) :-), and Tony captured the
spirit with a impromptu drumming to which I busted out some useful rhymes. (*)</p>

<p>(*) the drumming and rhyming was actually while we were still back in 大さん橋 about 20 minutes
before departure.  I did a couple of stoopid rhymes and then &quot;the boat's going to leave in about
20 minutes, you can stand here and beat, but don't you forget it.&quot; and Tony was like, &quot;oh
shit&quot; and instantly stopped drumming cause he still had to Takkubin his stuff.  Funny.</p>

<p>I arrived hella early (pre 11am), thinking departure was at noon, but it was actually at 2pm.
Plenty plenty of time to watch the ship and tell stories and see some of the crew chillin',
including Sabrina, who's been on the ship for <em>years</em> and will be Off Da Boat once they get
to Singapore (in just two weeks).  Huge hugs and cheek kisses to her and supa-smilin' handshakes
with Melvin, her PB Beau, who will also be headed off at that time.  Sabrina asked if I've heard
from Paige (who is our usual first topic of discussion); neither of us has for about 2 months.</p>

<p>Saw Yukiyukiyukiちゃん who looked super cute and beautiful all at once, and got to see her
reunite with Tracy in a pure innocent loveful romance everyone should hope to achieve.</p>

<p>玲 even came up for a bit despite her super-busy pre departure chaotic schedule (so busy that
Phil didn't even come, and he comes to <em>everything</em>), just to have a
52回 3049 mini-party and arrange a way to squeeze in one more hour of chatter before 玲 heads out
to sea to CCC on the big 55.</p>

<p>At departure, I asked about Slavena and Kremena, because I didn't see them.. turns out they both
dyed their hair dark!  Woah!!  Slavena (I think (they were pretty far away)) was wearing a brown
outfit and brown hat, which I've *never* seen her wear before.. I eye-contacted her and asked if
they were going around again.  Yes.  I will write to them this time.  Fo' sho'.</p>

<p>Chatted with Yuri and Aya and Ayako (whose names I list in order of meeting today and in
descending order of remembering).  I gots to write to Ayako... probably.  Yuri and Aya were
roommates with my monkey-ちゃん Carol-りえ on 52nd voyage; they hung out in the hall and all over
the ship spreading smiles and friendly greetings to everyone they encountered.  Really amazingly
outgoing energy in those two.</p>

<p>Ayako knows me fo' sho', but I don't know if she was on a voyage or if she heard about my
shoulder breakaroo from someone else; she wrote me an email that I plan to find and acknowledge
tonight.</p>

<p>Carla and Aiko were roommates at the *front* of the ship this time (in one of the rooms so so so
so far away from the cool action-jackson area of the ship that she (they?) were never in it).  Carla
was in GET Room 6, and apparently did a lot better on the computers this time.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, there were apparently several computer thefts at the beginning and end of the
voyage.  That is fucked up.  Stoppit.</p>

<p>I was reallllly jealous to hear of the supa-monsta typhoon they had and almost missed Vietnam.
People were barfing everywhere and Levi assured me he was getting air in his bunk while trying to
sleep.  WOW!  I look forward to experiencing that!!!</p>

<p>Francois made some friends, first with Aiko, then Maria (from Colombia) and then Yumi's hat.
Natalie asked me offhandedly, &quot;how's Francois,&quot; and I was like, &quot;he's on your side of
the fence here&quot; (as we were both turned around backwards chatting over the back of our
respective booths), and she goes, &quot;really?&quot; in a way that I knew she knew.  Hahahaha!
funny girl.</p>

<p>Massaged Tony's shoulders for a bit, and got a request to massage Aiko's at some point in the
future (I think I could get into a lot of fun trouble with her).  She lives in Naha, and I've
always wanted to visit there (ever since I heard Tomoe (from 52nd) lives there).  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>After super-extended YRUU-style goodbyes to a few people (which they will all see in less than
24 hours at hand-over), I joined the group headed out to Natalie's area, and enjoyed sitting next
to Carla and Natalie on the train.  My two long-term favorites in Japan, both smart enough to *not*
accept any (of my) advances.  (happy sigh)</p>
