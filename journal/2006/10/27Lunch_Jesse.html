<p>Was supposed to meet Jesse at noon, but he couldn't come; went to lunch at El Torito and then met
Jesse outside Tower Records, doing a silly ignore-game, walking back and forth past each other into
and out of phone booths until I &quot;found&quot; him stuck in one.  Boy, are we funny boys.</p>

<p>Super surprised when he gave me a Hawaiian T-shirt and chocolate!  Woot!</p>
