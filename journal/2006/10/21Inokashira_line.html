<p>For some reason, I was think Hachijoji instead of Kichijoji as I looked online for the time it
would take to go from Shinjuku to Kichijoji.  When several variants of Hachijoji wouldn't work, I
entered &quot;Inokashira Line&quot; in google and was surprised to find the first result was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keio_Inokashira_Line">Wikipedia's entry on Keio Inokashira
Line</a>.  Wow!</p>

<p>I checked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyu_Toyoko_Line">my favorite line, Tokyu
Toyoko</a>, and found the entry a bit incomplete.  Cool!  時間あたら, I can add some about
Motosumiyoshi Station!</p>

<p>Distinctly missing is recent news: the raising of Motosumiyoshi Station over Bremen Street!  It
would also be cool to have pictures of the stations.. especially the bigger ones and the ones that
will be changing &quot;soon.&quot;</p>
