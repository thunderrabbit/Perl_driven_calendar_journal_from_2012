<p class="dream">I enjoyed sitting next to Kattrean in my dream this morning.  There were several
other PB people there, some from both of my voyages.  We were sitting outside a grocery store (as
you do) and I was super happy to see her.  She wouldn't say anything, which made me realize I was
dreaming.  So I just sat and enjoyed her presence until I woke up.</p>
