<p>Really nice to chat with Eri again; we were both online at the same time so I sent her an email
to see if she wanted to chat.  We did for a while, which was nice.  I had to bite my finger to keep
from asking her why she hadn't replied to my other emails, but perhaps we'll get around to that
topic later.</p>
