<p class="dream">Carla was walking down the hall toward me, and I thought it might not be here
because it's a bit early for her to come back, but I ran down the hall to see her and hug her so
hugely.  So great to see her.  Carla home meant Natalie was also home, so I found her and gave her
the hugest hug ever; she was talking to Matt, saying that he wwould now have an easier name to
pronounce.  He could now be called Soth Korean Matt Cat in the Hat instead of his former name which
was apparently longer, perhaps it was the title that took too much effor to say.</p>

<p class="dream">Got into a small elevator trying to go up to the fourth flor from the first, bt it
went down to the basement first and I saw a friend of mine and was surprised the doors didn't close
on the eleevator and it did't even hae all its walls, just three walls (floor back, and right) so
as it w   so I was able to talk to Natalie a bit onger as the elevator went up while she was stil
on the basement floor ; I was a bit nervous as the  frame of the building seemed frighteningly
close as the elevator went up through the levels.  One nerly hit me as we went up through it, like
th elevator shaft shifted toward the right a bit, bu I survived the ride to the fourth floor
(thought it took well longer than 4, perhaps 10 floors) and I was still chatting with Naalie,
though she couldn't hear me well, I danced for her as I ot off the elevator; I did a basement floor dace to send it all
the way back down to pick her up.</p>

<p>(before going up (down then up) elevator:)</p>

<p class="dream">Was in dirty dusty outdoor construction area, going into an apartment building, and
noting all the dirt and dust on the floor had not been cleaed up since it was tracked n during
construction.  I got onto the elevator and prssed 2 to go up, but it went down instead.  Natalie was
there, and I was happy to see her, but I couldn't hug her because here was no room on the
elevator.</p>
