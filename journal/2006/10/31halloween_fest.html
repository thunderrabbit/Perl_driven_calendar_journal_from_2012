<p>Great fun at the Halloween fundraiser at Pink Cow.  I went as a sheik with loads of
(photocopied) cash which went over pretty well.  At mignight I flipped a coin to decide between
last train and first train.</p>

<p>Heads = First train.</p>

<p>Enjoyed chatting with Kellie who will be headed off to California soon for radiology school.</p>

<p>Spent a decent amount of time on the dance floor with Levi, Natalie, Carla, Aiko.  Good times
with heart pillows and dope beats.</p>

<p>Spent by far most of the time talking with Aiko (with a dot under her s).  Told her I have a
crush on her and I really wanted to kiss her, but in the end, despite a million opportunities, we
did not kiss.  Talked about all variety of things, from life onboard, to injuries, to dreams of the
future.</p>

<p>At one point I told her, &quot;don't let me kiss you,&quot; and she agreed she would not.</p>

<p>Was happy to be there for Carla when she was feeling shocked/sad.</p>

<p>Was like, &quot;that had nothing to do with why I said 'don't let me kiss you'&quot;</p>

<p>Enjoyed Audrey's story about handling shit when she got the news that Kumar and Peter had been
killed.  Equally good was insight on how she handles people in general, always respecting their
point of view is super different from her own.</p>

<p>As all the crowds drifted away, Audrey and Emily were talking to Traci about the fundage of the
evening.  Aiko and I were crashed out on the couch waiting for them to finish.  We all headed out
together.</p>

<p>Audrey gave me hella blessings and kudos and hugs.  Same from Aiko, but more awakefully.</p>
