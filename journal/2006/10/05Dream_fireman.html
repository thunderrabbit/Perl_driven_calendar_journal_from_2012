<p class="dream">Responding to a distress call, I pushed the fire desk over to the situation and
opened up the top to get the ladder out, used the key to drive the ladder, but I hadn't pushed the
desk closely enough to the building to reach it.  The ladder, fully extended, was going stragiht up
into the air and would be about 20 feet from where the people could reach it to get down.  So I
pushed the desk closer to where they were but people put their jackets and coats on it before I had
a chance to extend the ladder again, so I was moving people's jackets off the desk when I woke up.</p>
