<p>Ultimate was a bit sparse: Clif and I tossed from 1:30 to 3pm. He taught me how to do a thumber
(like a hammer but with opposite grip) and we played a game (that needs a name): basically throw the
disc with the same grip as it was caught, and from the same side of the body.</p>

<p>No one else came; they were all at a tournament.  Good thing the student I invited couldn't
come!</p>
