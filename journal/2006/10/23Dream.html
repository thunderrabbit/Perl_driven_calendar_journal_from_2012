<p class="dream">Two other people inside a building trying to solve some problems.   square shaped
rooms with 90 degree angles</p>

<p class="dream">I was asked to join the CCs during the graduation ceremoy and skip with one of them
across stage just because she wanted to skip and no one else did or could or didn't have a
partner.</p>
