<p>Had to say ByeByeKing to them (except for the King part) in Shinjuku as they headed on to Nakano
and I stayed to meet Kakko and her friend for カラオケ for two fun hours and ミスド where I tried
to get them to play Truth or Dare, but Kakko wasn't into it.  Fun anyway to tell them the
awesomeness of PB and try and convince them both to volunteer to be CCs.</p>

<p>Before カラオケ, we hit a コンビに for mega foodage, because I hadn't really eaten all day
except for one plate at Jonathon's.  Oops.  More macaroni and then チョコピーナツ, pudding, and
milk tea.</p>

<p>Eminem's &quot;Business&quot; was not available, but I did well with &quot;My Dad's Gone
Crazy&quot; &quot;Without Me,&quot; &quot;Lose Yourself,&quot; plus other songs by other artists.
This particular karaoke place didn't have a great selection of English songs.  But we did have a
great deal of fun.</p>
