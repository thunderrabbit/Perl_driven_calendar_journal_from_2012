<p>Fucking hell that was short.  My &quot;resolve&quot; has lasted nearly a day and now I'm back to
fuckit I don't want to do anything.</p>

<p>I didn't notice the transition, even though it's happened relatively quickly.  Sometime this
morning, it seems, when I woke up early, got some shit done, then didn't stay away from the computer
and online porn.  Napped after that and the whole thing (in my brain) has gone to shit.</p>

<p>In the 12 step recovery program, they describe a self-destructive spiral of getting high, then
feeling bad/shame about it and then going for another fix to get over it.  Seems like (if that
model is true) then I'm in the shame department.</p>

<p>but what caused the crash?  That's what I didn't notice.  Even as I knew porn-search was a
non-optimal choice, I didn't/couldn't stop it.</p>

<p>Weird.</p>
