<p>Great fun chatting with Fred, Dude and Dr Cutie on skype today.  Mostly the boys talking about
nerdy stuff, but a little about US vs Japanese health care costs.  Vero guesses my shoulder surgery
would have been $10,000; we all agree it would have been done that same day instead of waiting 48
hours after the accident.</p>

<p>We spent a bit of time testing microphones, trying to minimize feedback; I tried to make my
comp's hard drive stop oscillating for no apparent reason.  I don't know what it's doing, but the
entire conversation featured what sounded like a motorboat, or perhaps a thousand monkeys at the NSA
transcribing our conversation.</p>

<p>Days old and return dates were discussed.  Dr C nearly figured out my birthdate given Dude's
birthdate and both of our ages in days.  I'm 68 days older than Dude.</p>

<p>Didn't hear much about Fred's current project, nor his car, nor the link I sent,
