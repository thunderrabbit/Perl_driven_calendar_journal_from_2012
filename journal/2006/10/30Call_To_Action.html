<p>From Rochelle in Oaxaca:</p>

<pre>
Hey all...

So helicopters have been flying over Oaxaca all morning, one is overhead
right now. Thousands of Federal Preventative Police (PFP) have arrived by
plane and bus to the areas surrounding the city. According to the radio
there are groups of police gathered at four locations. They are surrounded
by local residents attempting to prevent them from advancing on the
people.  The police have some large vehicles and 16 water cannons.

The Mexican Interior Department issued a statement demanding protesters
"immediately hand over streets, plazas, public buildings and private
property."

APPO is standing strong and condemning the intervention of the federal
police.  They released a statement yesterday making it clear that they are
open to dialogue but will not agree to leaving the barricades, that the
demand for the Governor to step down is non negotiable and that they will
resist nonviolently.

The radio is calling for all people to go out to the streets, and fortify
the barricades. Call for all to come: women with cacerolas (pots and
pans), carrying white flowers if possible, some women are painting white
the palms of their hands, to indicate they want a non-violent resolution.

There is a march planned at 2pm. If repression hits here today there will
be an opposition mounted to the inuauguration of Calderon December 1.

Please take a moment and act in solidarity for the people of Oaxaca if you
can.  I fear for the thousands of teachers and others who have already
sacrificed so much to try and take a stand for justice.

There are amazing international solidarity actions that have already
occured and many to come next week, there is a list available at
<a href="http://www.ulisesruizasesino.com/">http://www.ulisesruizasesino.com/</a>. Organize and add yours! Any future
actions will make an impact even if they occur after a federal repression,
international response is key for the future!

Here is a list of Mexican consulates in the US and Canada:
