Geologist Jay Hanson, among the first to raise the issue of a global oil crisis resulting in
population overshoot and collapse, came to the same conclusion in &quot;The 'Longage of Critters'
Problem&quot;:

     But when the above scenario seems inevitable, the elites will simply depopulate most of the
     planet with bioweapons. When the time comes, it will be the only logical solution to their
     problem. It's a first-strike tactic that leaves built-in infrastructure and other species in
     place and allows the elites to perpetuate their own genes into the foreseeable future. 56

There is another highly significant test of whether or not what I have presented here is
true. Think back to the statement about the results of the war on drugs after 30 years. Does my
narrative scenario accord with the events since 9/11: the anthrax attacks (using spores developed by
the CIA);57the new vaccination laws and programs; the erosion of civil liberties; all the
inconsistencies in the governmentâ€™s statements about what happened on 9/11 and the bogus link
between the attacks and Iraq; the sudden and nearly obsessive preoccupation with biological warfare;
the invasion of Iraq itself; the creation of a Department of Homeland Security; and the deployment
of US military personnel only in regions of the world connected to oil and gas production or
transshipment.  As Colin Campbell, founder of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil
(<a href="http://www.peakoil.net">www.peakoil.net</a>) has said, &quot;The species Homo sapiens is not going to become extinct. But the
subspecies 'Petroleum Man,' most certainly is.&quot;58 Before that happens, there will, as we will
demonstrate to you, the jury, inevitably be armed conflict to seize diminishing energy resources. It
doesn't have to be this way. It shouldn't be this way. But the one thing that makes it inevitable is
the operation of the world's economic system, a psychological and ultimately moral limitation that
no political leaders and few human beings can see beyond.  I heard this reality confirmed by a major
Dutch economist speaking at a Peak Oil conference in May of 2003 who said, &quot;It may not be profitable
to slow decline.&quot; 59 War is the most profitable business of all.

Make no mistake, the oil companies and Wall Street are banking on severe oil price spikes to fund
this short-lived development and, almost as importantly, to reduce consumption on an ad hoc basis as
people in the US find they can't afford five- or six-dollar gasoline and businesses shut down. There
are, at best, between 500 and 600 billion barrels in the Gulf, which can only be pumped at needed
rates if the investment is begun immediately and sustained over the next ten years.

Do the math, and it's clear: when will the price spikes come? Within six months to a year after the
2004 election. Not before then, if the Bush group can prevent it.
