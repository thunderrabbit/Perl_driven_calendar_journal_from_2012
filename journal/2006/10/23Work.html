<p>Two students today.</p>

<p>Scheduled for 3, but one was a no show.  He's super loud and weird.  He just talks and talks and
talks and talks and talks and I have great difficulty even imagining what he is trying to say.
After the first time we had a lesson together, I wrote &quot;Wow!  his soliloquy should be on
youtube!&quot;  Victor agrees it could be pretty popular.</p>

<p>During that 80 minute paid break, I read from To Be A Man and copied some pages that I like.</p>

<p>Just now I've been playing with Flash a bit, just starting a 30 day trial.  I've been able to
create a couple of tweens, but not able to overlap any objects, create more than one layer, nor
affect object interaction. Some tutorialage could be quite helpful.</p>

<p>And a wireless mouse.</p>

<p>Okay, an external mouse.</p>
