<p>Yesterday I got a chance to chat (again) with a woman who's a computer programmer for the JR
Line!!  I'm quite impressed with the whole concept, and enjoy asking her questions about the train
system.</p>

<p>My last three students knew the meaning of ´ñ¡¹²ø¡¹.  (It's a rare word in Japanese which I
happened across in Hitomi's dictionary some months ago.)</p>
