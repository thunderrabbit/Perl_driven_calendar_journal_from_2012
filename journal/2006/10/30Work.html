<p>I was a terrible teacher for one lesson, not even paying attention to my student because I had
written how difficult our last lesson had been (but not remembering our first lesson, which was
money); she wants to use the book, but it's too high for her, I think... I'll be lucky as shit if
she comes back to my lesson, I think.</p>

<p>Eeek.</p>

<p>Told Reiko, and she was not impressed with my behavior, but impressed that I told her directly
afterward.  Yikes stripes.</p>

<p>In other news, today is the day I started my mini marble track.  So far it has exactly two little
posts on it; they will be the marble catchers.  Ironically, I went out to Tokyu Hands twice (once on
a search mission, second on a purchase mission) and bought a wooden base and wood glue,... got back
to work and was all like, &quot;aw yeah; now's the time for all good marble tracks to start being
built,&quot; and I realized I had forgotten about 7 critical things: Marbles, of course, and not as
obvious, a invisible (ultra-violet) permanent ink pen.</p>

<p>I plan to write the date on all the pieces, but I don't want them to show up in ordinary
light.</p>

<p>Might have to get a light, too, else it will just be a sloppy mess in ultra violet light.</p>

<p>Plan is to get those tomorrow after my lesson with Reika.</p>
