<p>Today I've been doing homework during my breaks.  That makes me feel a bit better about griping
at my students for not studying.  Reiko called her friend Takko to ask how to express the feeling I
want to capture: that moment I broke my shoulder and (especially having recently finished the 10 day
meditation,) I just wanted to relaxfully bask in the moment: <em>This is me, with a broken shoulder.
Congratulations; savor this moment; it's but a fleeting picosecond</em></p>
