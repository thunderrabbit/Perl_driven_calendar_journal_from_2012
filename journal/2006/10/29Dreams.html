<p class="dream">Japanese speech.  She was speaking Japanese to her boyfriend, and I did not know
the meaning.  I was waiting for the English translation, but it never came.</p>

<p class="date">7:17am JST Sunday 29 October 2006 (day 13367)</p>

<p class="dream">A guy from Germany was in Japan, and already knew some Japanese in just one day;
more than just greetings, and I was like, &quot;aw man..  cause it has taken me 3 years to learn
anything.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;Americans are all HELLO HOW ARE YOU BLAH BLAH BLAH&quot; and
there happened to be some American women who were *not* like that standing behind me, and they were
semi-embarrassed, but genuinely asked, &quot;(I'm sorry); are we being like that?&quot; and I was
like, &quot;not you guys, but most Americans have very little cultural sensitivity.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">They agreed and then I was flirting with them and then flirting with multiple girls
at once, but being really respectful of them in a way.  I was doing a rap as I hugged on them.</p>

<pre class="dream">
kissing as many girlies as a man can
but always respectful and watchin' my hands
if you wanna know what I mean by it
I keep my hands on their stomach and not touch the tit
keep my hands in the middle, not too low or too high, 
and only on second date would I touch the thigh
but I don't ever make it to the date number two
after date number one I always say bye</pre>

<p class="dream">Then a girl came up to me who was all flirting with me despite my rappery, or
perhaps because of it.  She was turned on and I started kissing on her ear and hugging her all the
while thinking it was a bad idea, I would have to tell my real gf</p>

<p class="dream">The scene adjusted to having some younger boys with bicycles there, and they asked
me if I could do any bicycle tricks, and I was like, No, but they assured me they could do various
things, and I was like, &quot;aight let's see it&quot; and then they were like, &quot;um um um&quot;
as they tried to get their act together, and I woke up.</p>
