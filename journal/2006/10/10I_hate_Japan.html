<p>Some days I just fucking hate Japan.  Right now is one of those days.  I love individual people,
once we break past the I-am-alone-in-this-crowded-train mentality, people are fun and friendly and
great.  But this fuckin' たてまえ has got to stop.</p>

<p>Waiting in line for people to figure out how to use the ATMs, searching for account numbers and
shit; it's like, &quot;get your shit ready, people, before you fucking rock up to block the ATM and
then look for the information you need.. get your information OUT.  Ready.  Get Set.  Go.&quot;
Don't &quot;Go, Get Ready, Waste Time, Piss Me Off.&quot;</p>

<p>The ATM system in Japan rules in a lot of ways compared to the US system.  It accepts currency
and coins, counts them, puts them in yer account.  Done.  It dispenses currency and coins.  It
updates yer account book, so there's no question about balancing with the bank at the end of the
month.  In this case, a woman was transferring money to someone else's account, and the machine
kept saying, &quot;please enter the account number&quot; as she fumbled about for it.</p>

<p>People take about the same amount of time at an ATM.  More than 30 seconds, less than 5
minutes.  So when one guy was nearing this imaginary 5 minute limit, and someone next to him leaves,
HE MIGHT LEAVE SOON.  It's not the case that there's always a two minute wait between ATM
availability slots.</p>

<p>So, old man in front of the line, open your eyes and stop looking down at the floor and NOTICE
that someone has left.  Perhaps just look at the floor near the machines; watch people's feet.</p>

<p>And here's where the たてまえ part comes in.  The woman behind the old man saw that a machine
was free, but waited about fifty bajillion milliseconds to tell him.  I resisted saying anything
cause I might have barked and scared everyone in the line.  Wake up, old man!  Don't be shy, old
woman; fucking tell him to wake up!</p>

<p>Calm the fuck down, Rob, you fucking American.</p>
