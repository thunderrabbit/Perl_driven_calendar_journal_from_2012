<p class="dream">black bears hibernate in the winter and forage for berries in the spring.  Our
black bear was the opposite so had to wear a winter coat to live in the winter, foraging for
holiday treats, and shave his hair in the summer when he slept.</p>

<p class="dream">The science for this research has been quite careful, with all the correct
paperwork being signed and organized.</p>

<p>one other dream I can't remember.</p>
