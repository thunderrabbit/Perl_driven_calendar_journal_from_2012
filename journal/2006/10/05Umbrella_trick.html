<p>I can semi-consistently do a balancing trick with my umbrella.  Balancing is no problem; I can
walk around while balancing a tall thin object all day (and by all day I mean for minutes at a
time).  I can even swing the umbrella up from hanging (by its handle) to balanced on my finger.
That's not the trick.</p>

<p>The cooler thing is to swing the umbrella from hanging by its handle, up and release and then
catch the umbrella on its point (so the umbrella is pointing down).  That's the trick I've been
practicing on misty days, when it's not actually raining but most other people carry umbrellas
upright in the expanded configuration.</p>
