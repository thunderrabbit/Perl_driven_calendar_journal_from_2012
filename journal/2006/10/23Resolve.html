<p>&quot;foreceful action undertaken, not without compassion, but with resolve.&quot;</p>

<p>Last night, after a simple list created of Things To Do Today, I've been more on track today,
more focused.</p>

<p>Cooked, did dishes, took out the rest of the trash (even the cardboard boxes which had been
waiting patiently for a while), wrote a couple of emails, got Suzanne's thing posted.</p>
