<p>took me a bit, but I expressed anger to Kim for not having started the coaching session on time,
and we looked carefully at what was happening and I'm getting some insights</p>

<p>If I admire someone and work to emulate what I like, then I can bring my life forward to where I
want to be.</p>

<p>If I admire someone and feel &quot;less than&quot; them, then the relationship can damage my
Self.</p>

<p>This dynamic plays a huge role in &quot;falling in love&quot; with women / not being able to
communicate with women who I think are end-all-be-all awesome.</p>

<pre>
there are some things I see that are moderately interesting / neutral.  
In general, these are responses about that person, or my judgements of their charactersitics.

Sometimes I have responses to people that really trigger me.  from anger toward that person, to the
abject <em>awesome</em> feeling of desire/love/respect for that person...  Those are projections

.... okay, not just &quot;bigger&quot; but bigger than what reality supports

the essential characteristic is not that the response is more than &quot;normal&quot;

it's more than what fits the reality of that situation or person

-----

projection is what I do unconsciously ...

</pre>

<p>Just as he said that, the skype connection broke and I was like, &quot;ahhhh!!&quot; and had a
bit of an over-reaction to a simple disconnect.  I wonder if that over-reaction can be mapped to
the same thing as projection.</p>

<pre>
projection is what my psyche does with whatever part of me that I disown or deny or fail to express

<b>when we block it in ourselves we identify with it in other places</b>
</pre>

<p>Like Kim, Rei, Cameron...</p>

<pre>
write down all the adjectives I see as desireable.  <b>the ones that really stand out: go pursue them in my own life</b>

take the ones that remain and pursue a relationship with her on that
