Around 6 October, after enjoying another great <a href="http://www.88slide.com">88Slide</a> episode,
I sent this email to Noah:</p>

Hey Noah!

I liked the pizza delivery episode!  Quite clever connection between Rachel and Blaine at the end,
and her "is this real?" comment cracked me up.  Nice.  :-)

Thanks for your hard work!

    - Rob!

<p>Just today, he replied:</p>

Thank YOU Rob for watchin...

People LOVE your episode, and I've been showing it in meetings as an example of our collaboration.

Any chance of doing another one soon?

<p>So I went back and scoped the clips from Korea.  They're not *that* bad...</p>

Wow!  I'm surprised and thrilled!

Yah; absolutely.. I just need to get my butt in gear..

With current North Korean events, I'm really bummed the thing didn't
turn out as planned.  Basically, when I went to the DMZ, it was my
first time there, so I didn't know what to expect.  I didn't have a
camera guy, nor a lot of time and the video I shot is like super wanky
because I didn't have the mic extension cable..

BUT then it turns out the footage I did was *NOT* actually within the
DMZ.  I was just outside the DMZ, and your show is just too good to
have such an error.

AND THEN, while I did *not* have my camera, we were taken to the Most
Perfectest Place In The Planet for a DMZ shot.  I don't know if we're
allowed to take video in that room, but I'll attach a pic.

Until your super-positive comment today, I hadn't even looked at the
video; I was so bummed about all the above.

If you can place a little "* just outside the DMZ" or something, that
would make it more accurate.

I'm attaching lo-rez versions of the best parts.

If you wanna do it with this inaccurate video, I'll send you the full
DVs.  BUT if you wanna do it fo' real, I need to go back to DMZ.
(though still not sure if I can take video at The Perfect Location)

   Peace
   - Rob!
