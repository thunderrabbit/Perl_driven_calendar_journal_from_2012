<p>I'm reading Michael Ruppert's _Crossing the Rubicon_.</p>

<pre>
But there is something waiting in the darkness, close enough that our civilization can already feel
its presence, even if that feeling is only slowly forcing its way into conscious awareness. Just
outside our ability to cope with upsetting information, an increasingly rapid stream of data and
experience is ushering in what may be the most significant event in human history: the end of the
age of oil.

<p>Goodness.</p>

<p>Reading this book intrigues me...  lll Like..  all this diary writing I've been writing is going
to be lost as the world grinds to a halt over the next 50 years as the oil production dwindles and
then falls..  It's not so far away, guys.. So, what should we do??  Stop using oil now?  Have a huge
war/plague kill 2/3rds of the world population?  How about ignore it and party on!!</p>
