<p>Killa day at work planned for today: 8 hours with only a 20 minute break.</p>

<p>Okay, so it's a killer day for me compared to what I'm used to; I send blessings to those who
are in less favorable work conditions <em>every</em> day.</p>

<p>I survived the day, and even had some cool lessons.  One woman who I'd never met before asked me
about Francois.  One of her friends had taken my lesson and met Francois, who apparently made a
lasting impression.</p>

<p>My last two students were computer-aware.  The very last has a
website, <a href="http://videx.jp">videx.jp</a>, for which he did most of the coding, including the
load balancing behind the scenes.  I was well-impressed with his tales of coding.</p>

<p>The second to last would <em>like</em> to have a website, but said he didn't know HTML.  I was
like, &quot;that's hardly a reason to not have a website, but if you want to know HTML,
visit <a href="http://htmlgoodies.com">htmlgoodies.com</a>, which is where I learned HTML,&quot;
back in the day before it was all commercialized beyond recognition.</p>

<p>One student got a smiley on the notes I wrote about her (so I can know, at minimum, that I
enjoyed our class last time and should perhaps look forward to the next one).</p>
