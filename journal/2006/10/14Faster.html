<p>A bit peeved that I missed the train to Shibuya by like 30 seconds.  It was &quot;random&quot;
though, I didn't consciously know what time the train was scheduled to leave; I hadn't looked it up
before arriving at the station.</p>

<p>On the platform, I noticed the clumps of people standing where the doors would soon arrive on the
upcoming train.  Noticed 1 person with me, though all other clumps that I could see had 3 or 4
people.  Interesting.  I assume it's a form of racism, which I've encountered many times in
Japan.</p>

<p>As the train arrived, the crowds inside reminded me I could optimize my exit strategy in Shibuya
by getting on at the next door, then coming over to my door at the next station and get on last;
this would arrange things so I would get off first in Shibuya.  Decided not to do it, just to deal
with the consequences in Shibs as they may occur.</p>

<p>I was third off the train behind two tied for first place, but first to the top of the stairs,
zipping through the gaps of slow people.  Shibuya was pretty crowded; I was necessarily slowed down
by the mid-sized crowds crowding the gates and ticket machine area.</p>

<p>Now chillin' on the train in Shibuya about to head to Kichijoji.</p>
