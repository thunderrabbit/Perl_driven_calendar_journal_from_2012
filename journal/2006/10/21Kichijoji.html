<p>Kichijoji was pretty cool today; good in the break department, during which I chatted with Tracy
about some concerns she had.  I'm glad I was wise enough to ask more questions before I started
making assumptions about the situation, even as basic as would you like to me just listen or give
advice; she requested option C: what do you think about it?</p>

<p>I basically finished The Google Story, hardback featuring tidbits on how they started and
meteoric rise and and and</p>

<p>good stuff.  I should buy some stock.</p>

<p>Last student of the day was cool, especially once we were able to chat about the US
government..</p>

<p>He's interested in martial arts, and was like, &quot;what would you do if you were attacked in
the street?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm like, &quot;I don't get attacked in the street.  If I did, I would ... play it by
ear.&quot;</p>

<p>He was surprised at this, given that I lived in US, which is &quot;so dangerous,&quot; and I
assured him it's *not* all that dangerous, and not everyone has a gun...  &quot;the most dangerous
thing in the US is the US government.&quot;</p>

<p>He was like, &quot;why do you think the US government is dangerous?&quot;</p>

<p>good question.</p>
