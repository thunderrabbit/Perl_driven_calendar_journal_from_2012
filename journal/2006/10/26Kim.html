<p>Kim was like, &quot;how much time did you <em>actually spend</em> developing a relationship with
her?&quot;</p>

<p>_________________________  his question floored me  _____________________</p>

<p><em>what has <b>that</b> got to do with anything????</em> and <em>holy shit he's exactly
right...</em></p>

<p>&quot;about 100 hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="date">12:25pm JST Thursday 26 October 2006 (day 13364)</p>

<p>Holy shit...  thinking in terms of projections makes so much sense..., and seems like a paradigm
shift in my belief system.</p>

<p>My version of my notes from last night:</p>

<p>There exist untapped parts of myself.  Aspects of myself, which, for some reason have been
neglected or supressed or disowned.</p>

<p>I see these in other people, and recognize them as valuable, but don't recognize them in
myself.</p>

<p>And there are parts of myself that I reject, see them in other people, and despise those people.</p>

<p>I'd like to capture my thinking from 24 hours ago:</p>

<p>I love Paige because she's friendly, working for the UN, intelligent,
successful, outgoing, traveling, passionate about life</p>

<p>I love Sally because she's funny, passionate, outgoing, expressive, musical,
inspirational, supportive, blessing</p>

<p>I love Eri because she's centered, wise, friendly, peaceful, introspective</p>

<p>I love janette because she's cenetered, funny, understanding, genuine, thoughtful, hilarious,
creative, strong, passionate, brave, adventurous</p>

<p>I love Rei because she's unphased by shenanigans, intelligent, cuts through crap, focused,
penetrating mind, happy, graceful</p>

<p>Therefore they are top on the list of possible relationship candidates (except for living way
far away (in most cases))</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Now I'm changing the &quot;therefore&quot; part of it.</p>

<p>They are all these things.  Finish.  Therefore I respect them; namaste; etc.  But none of this
trying to possess them for their qualities.</p>

<p>This, also, is huge:</p>

<p>Yesterday I was nurturing relationships with 500 million different women, but today I see that
activity as a huge drain of my energy and resources.</p>

<p>I literally have started emails all gushing with flirtations, and now I'm thinking &quot;yah yah
whatever, come if you want; I don't care.&quot;</p>

<p>Because some of the emails are in Japanese, I don't know how to express the down-to-business
reality.. just the flirty たてまえ version.  interesting.</p>
