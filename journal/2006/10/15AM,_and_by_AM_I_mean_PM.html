<p>I've been spending a lot of time watching <a href="http://notlong.com/jonstewart">Daily Show
episodes on youtube</a>, though I claim not to watch a lot of TV.  I've quite enjoyed Jon Stewart's
presentation of disconnects within Bush HQ.</p>

<p>Also slowly negotiating doing another 88slide, though I may find someone to ask it in Japanese.
I'll bring my camera to Shinjuku tonight and talk to the kids at Laura's bowling party.</p>
