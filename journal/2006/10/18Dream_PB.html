<p class="dream">In a room with Audrey and Mariko and a lot of new PB peeps.  Audrey was only
vaguely responsive, but I really wanted to talk to her.  I was like, &quot;thank you for being so
supportive of all of us&quot; but she was like, &quot;I have to go,&quot; and headed out.  I told
Mariko I thought PB peeps were better than me, like I wasn't good enough to join the staff.  I woke
up before she gave an answer.</p>
