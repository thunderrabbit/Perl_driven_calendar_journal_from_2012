<p>Super quick entry just to capture having had a successful meeting with Tariq, Michael and the guy
with whom we're designing the game.</p>

<p>Now headed to Japanese lesson; I'll barely make it on time to my station.</p>

<p>I'm excited about trying to write this game that I've designed called Pic Words.  It's just a
little goofy game, but could be pretty cool.  Tariq is managing the project, so he'll send me an
email on whether he'd like me to work on that game or begin laying out another one.</p>

<p>Things to do: copy the sheets I drew for this game.</p>
