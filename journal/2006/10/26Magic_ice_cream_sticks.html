<p>Woah.</p>

<p>Like magic, 300 ice cream sticks have arrived in my life for the low low price of 250 yen.  (At
Tokyu Hands, 50 sticks cost 305 yen.)</p>

<p>At the cafe where Reika and I meet, a woman behind the counter recognized me and said something I didn't
understand, but then showed me a block of 6 packs of 50 sticks.  ¡Ö250 ±ß¡×she said.</p>
