<p>Talked to Reiko after work, a bit about students and then just laid into a tirade against Bush
and US govt and Shinzo Abe and all this crap.  I've been reading all these crazy fucked up things
about the US govt and its meglomaniacal power and history of doing fucked up things and I really
don't want to go back to the US to settle down and live..  and I don't know what to do about
anything.  Bitch about it all I want, write letters to Bush, it's not like he's reading them or
affected by it.  &quot;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/13/MNG50G76G31.DTL">30,000 Iraqis, more or less, have died ...</a>&quot;</p>

<p>He's a monster!  He doesn't care!  What the fuck are we up against??</p>
