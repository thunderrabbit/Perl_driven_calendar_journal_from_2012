<p>Part of the problem relates to this list; I don't want to study right now; I don't want to not
have already done the thing for Tariq.  It's <em>due tomorrow</em> and I've not started.  Reika's
lesson starts now (soon as she arrives) and I've just found the blank paper I allocated for the
project.  Perhaps after the lesson I can do it.</p>
