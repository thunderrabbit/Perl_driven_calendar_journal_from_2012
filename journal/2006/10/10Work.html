<p>Really enjoyed my first three students.  First two were pretty much ペラペラ, and the second two
had a lot to talk about, so it made the lessons pretty darn easy and seem to fly by.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in a surprise break because the Yamanote line is stopped, almost certainly due to
a suicide.</p>

<p>Survived work relatively well, and even got a cool bonus 40 minutes for 40 minutes less work.
One of my students cancelled; he had been scheduled for an 80 minute lesson.  Then in that place I
taught a 40 minute lesson.  I still got paid for the 80 minutes, and was even paid for the extra 40
minutes.  So 500 minutes taught in only 7 hours and 20 minutes.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Also chatted with Ami for 60 minutes.  She's basically my finest student, in the 80's term of
&quot;that girl is <em>fine</em>&quot;... but she's only 26, and her English doesn't allow for
actual full fluency discussions, but we still have fun chatting.</p>

<p>I warned her to look out for guys (like me) and ways to know if a guy is trying to get sex, and
ways to dissuade it.  She seemed surprised and definitely appreciative of the information.</p>
