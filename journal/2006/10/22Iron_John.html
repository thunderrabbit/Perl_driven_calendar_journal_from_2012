Now, the amazing thing about the "Iron John" story is that it doesn't say that the golden ball is
being held by some benign Asian guru or by a kind young man named Jesus.  There's something
connected with getting the golden ball back that is incompatible with niceness.  And the frog only
turns into a prince when it is thrown against the wall in a fit of what New Age people might call
"negative energy." New Age thought has taught young men to kiss frogs.  That doesn't always work.
You only get your mouth wet.  The women's movement has helped women learn to throw the frog against
the wall, but men haven't had this kind of movement yet.  The kind of energy I'm talking about is
not the same as macho, brute strength which men already know enough about; it's foreceful action
undertaken, not without compassion, but with resolve.
