<p>I've had plenty of breaks at work today.  180 minutes total, so I'm only working 5 hours.  Last
lesson goes till 6:20, so I'll have to book it back to the station to get to Shibs on time.</p>

<p>A pair of students I griped at last week for not doing homework did homework this time.  The
other pair of students I griped at last week starts their lesson in 1 minute.</p>

<p class="date">9:10pm JST</p>

<p>They hadn't done any homework, but I believe they will next time.  Explaining why became the
topic in my lesson with Shinpei tonight.</p>
