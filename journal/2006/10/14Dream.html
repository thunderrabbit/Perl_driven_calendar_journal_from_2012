<p class="dream">Living on the edge of a wall next to a river, our house could be moved up and down
the river, like driving a car.  There were passengers up front and Fred and I lived in the back.
One day our house-car nearly fell into the river; we felt it coming and the driver tried valiantly to keep
us from falling into the river; he was successful, and we ditched onto the ground outside the river
wall.  I was last to get out of the van/car because I had to look for my shoes, so I didn't see
where they had gone.  I went into a likely house and asked, but they didn't understand English, but
Japanese or Spanish was okay, so in Japanese I told the woman what happened, but she misunderstood
that I was trying to get free housing, so I was like I just want to find my friends, so I went back
outside, and I found them on the street; all except for Fred, and as I was walking over to them,
some boys on a camper on the street started making fun of me for wearing pink swim trunks.</p>

<p class="dream">I ran over to them and bounded up onto the trailer with them, and took their
cameras and took a couple of pictures of random things as I was like, &quot;hey kids, so you think
it's pretty funny that I have pink swim trunks? well I would love to be cool like you and have cool
black swim trunks and a darth vader T-shirt, and all this, but today my house fell into the river.
Sometimes God finds it necessary to take things back like 'that's enough of that'&quot; and their
leader had apparently heard the story already, so he believed it could likely be true.</p>

<p class="dream">I was invited to watch their dance, during which one guy offered to sell me some
drugs, and he ended up missing his cue, and got yelled at by the leader, not for missing his cue,
and not for trying to sell me drugs, but for lying about the quality of his drugs, and the price;
he was made to apologize and tell me they were available from the convenience store down the street.</p>

<p class="dream">I went back outside as I quietly ducked out of the group between the video cameras
who were filming; I chose not to be all crazy on film and shook the leader's hand as I got
downstairs.  I was surprised at how hairy his hand was, like a wolfman.</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't find Fred, but then woke up.</p>

<p>I've had Japanese-dreams each time I've listened to Japanese as I fell asleep.</p>
