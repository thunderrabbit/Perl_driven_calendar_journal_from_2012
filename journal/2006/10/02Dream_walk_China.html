<p class="dream">The map looked something like that, with ----- being the actual border (east and
west??) and **** being populated area and .... being unpopulated area.  My driver was in a van,
taking me to basically the left side of this map, and a little ways toward the east, and I would
have to walk east and then cross the border toward the north and then continue east until I found
something.  The van was literally unable to drive on the ..... area; the road was too narrow and
precipitous. (*)</p>

<p class="dream">We stopped in the same cabin from the previous dream, and my bag knocked over a
crystal glass which did not break; I cleaned up the water with a napkin I had kept and squeezed the
water back into the glass and gave it to Robento in the kitchen, who was chillin' kicked back in a
chair with a bunch of PB people and YRUUers around.  He poured the glass into his own lap to show
off his new waterproof pants and I gave him the sponge which had been a napkin.</p>

<p class="dream">Richard, my driver, started speaking Spanish fluently with Robento, and I tried to
learn some vocabulary.</p>

<p>(*) not sure I've ever used this word before.</p>
