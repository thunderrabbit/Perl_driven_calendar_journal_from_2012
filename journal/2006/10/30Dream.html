<p class="dream">wearing a funny costume of beard and moustache made to look like a character I
didn't even know, but I was just happy to be with PB people and wasn't even worried about how
people perceived me.  Just happy and fun with Carla and Natalie and The Gang, headed to the
handover meeting..</p>
