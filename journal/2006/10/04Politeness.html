<p>Just saw a guy drive up to the curb and wait about 5 seconds before giving a little honkhonk to
attract the attention of the woman he came to pick up.</p>

<p>His windows were up (he couldn't hear her), but the woman was like, [excuse me] and [I'm sorry],
totally apologizing... to <em>no one</em>(?); she was not making eye contact with him as she said
it, and I sure couldn't see anything like a phone (even headset type) that she may have been
using.  Totally mystifying..</p>
