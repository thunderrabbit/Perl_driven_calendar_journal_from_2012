<p class="dream">In a grocery store with my brother; I knew the cashier as Jon Stewart was checking
out.  He put down two bills, a 100 dollar bill and a 500 dollar bill.  I knew the cashier, so I was
like, &quot;can I see the 500?&quot; because I had never seen one before.  As I was looking at the
bill, I asked Jon what would be a funny word for fake money, and he was like, &quot;Error Mail&quot;
but I was like, &quot;no, no, there's something funnier..&quot; but neither of us could come up with
it.</p>
