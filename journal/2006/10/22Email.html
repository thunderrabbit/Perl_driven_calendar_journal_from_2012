I'm reading a book called _TO BE A MAN_ which is discussing what it means to "be a man" and what it
"should" mean to be a man.  Really interesting theory on why men want to marry their mothers.  wow.

My weekend was pretty easy yesterday at work; plenty of breaks.  Next week only two 20 minute
breaks.  One of my students yesterday wanted my lesson again, but couldn't find any time on my
schedule... turns out the receptionist had given me a 60 minute break!!  I was like, "no no no no
break..  just 20 minutes a couple times is plenty."  Jamie, another teacher, was like, "Rob, you're
a machine!"  hahaha ..  no, I'm just poor.  :-)

Good day at ultimate, though I'm a bit sore.

If you have time, I'd like to see you tomorrow after my men's group and tell you about the book.
Do you have time?
