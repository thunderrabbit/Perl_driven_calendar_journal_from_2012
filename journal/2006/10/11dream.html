<p class="dream">Went to the US to see Fred, and happened to see Miki there on her way to see her
boyfriend.  I had to get off the train; I was too jealous to see them together.  She got off the
train with me and asked if I was okay.  I broke down and cried, telling her I was so jealous of her
being with the other guy, even though we had nothing official together.  We started kissing and
strangely she was asleep and Fred was there and people could see that I was kissing Miki, but Fred
wouldn't close the blind on the door.</p>

<p class="dream">Fred called his advisor who lived in Japan, telling him in Japanese where I wanted
to go, citing places I have already been.  I was translating to English what Fred was saying, and
then told Fred that he seemed to have forgotten I've been in Japan for a while, and I've seen all
those places.  He was like, &quot;ah&quot; and cancelled the phone call with his advisor.</p>

<p class="dream">We jumped in the car to see his advisor and had only 6 minutes to get into Japan,
but it turned out we weren't actually going to Japan tonight, so we had time.  Went down into the
parking garage and Fred was driving Scott, my old car, but I woke up before he got it started.</p>
