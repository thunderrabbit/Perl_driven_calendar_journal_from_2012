<p>Going to Ginza soon to meet Tomoko and Sumidasan and chow.</p>

<p>Dinner was great, and included ideas for sales in the US; they are looking for a bit of help
with some business letters in English.</p>

<p>Now we are in カラオケ and there are more Eminem songs.  They don't have &quot;Rabbit Run,&quot;
but I just sang &quot;My Dad's Gone Crazy,&quot; which is another one that I enjoy (but isn't at
most other karaoke places).</p>

<p>They also have more Beastie Boys, so I was able to do &quot;Intergalactic Planetary,&quot; but
not my favorite (on the same album), though I've forgotten the name.  It has a line &quot;I'm the
benihana chef on the S-P-12; chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf; you be like 'hello
nasty; where you been?'; time to bring those grimy beats up out the dungeon&quot; or some shit like
that.</p>

<p>We got a bit more than 2 hours in the karaoke place because a couple of times the machine
screwed up and didn't play the background music, making it <em>a cappella</em>..</p>

<p>Definitely liked that location for its far more complete English selection.  They even had
&quot;Stay&quot; by Shakespear's Sister (though I was basically unable to sing it), and many other
songs and artists I've not been able to find elsewhere in Japan.</p>

<p>At the end I sang &quot;Nothing Compares 2U&quot; by Sinead O'conner (sp), which I thought was
the last song.  But we still had time, so I busted out &quot;Bust a Move&quot; by Young MC, and
we <em>still</em> had time, so I finished with &quot;Without Me&quot; by Eminem.</p>

<p>For some reason the tempo was super duper super slow, and I kept passing the shit out of the
song even when I apparently maxed out the tempo increase.</p>

<p>Super great times with my longest-term, loveliest friends in Tokyo.</p>
