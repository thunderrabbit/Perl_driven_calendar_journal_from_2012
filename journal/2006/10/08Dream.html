<p class="dream">Olivia got the keys to a hotel suite where her friends were staying, and where she
was making a large castle out of aluminum cans in order to get a jump on the competition for this
castle making contest in which Microsoft planned to participate.  After she finished making the
castle, she was brushing her teeth with some tooth paste that was super minty and had bright
crystals like diamonds in it to visually enhance the mint flavor with sparkly visuals.  She breathed
on me and I was like, &quot;wow&quot; and asked if I could have some of the diamonds, so she kissed
me and transferred some of them over.  The diamonds didn't taste minty, but they were definitely
crunchy.  I tried not to bite them for fear of losing them / devaluing them, but they were
certainly temptingly crunchable.</p>
