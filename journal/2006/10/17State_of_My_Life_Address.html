<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Living in Tokyo in Jesse's old place with Michael.</p></li>

<li><p>Have been meeting my new I-group every other Monday.  We're planning to do an Emotional
Mastery training and a GUTS training in January.  I'm inviting a few select people.</p></li>

<li><p>The super-cute Sayuri cat has stopped taking lessons with me on Wednesday nights.  I think 3
hours each week was too much for her, but she said she was going to be busy from here on
out.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm meeting Reika twice a week in Shibuya in the mornings.</p></li>

<li><p>Paying Hitomi back as quickly as I can, but it's slower going than I had hoped.</p></li>

<li><p>No cats, no girlfriends, but I'm dating a woman who has requested anonymity in my
journal.</p></li>

<li><p>I kissed KG Miki a couple days before she headed out to US for a few months.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm in the market for a new phone; I'm still using Jesse's pre-paid hand-down, the menuing
for which I claim to despise since I can't figure it out, and because it's stupid.</p></li>

<li><p>My white MacBook running OS X 10.4.8 with a 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo with1 GB ram and 75 GB
HD boasts a GetFirefox.jp sticker next to the mouse pad.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been studying Japanese: two lessons per week ÉðÀîÀèÀ¸ in ºù¿·Ä® and ¤·¤ó¤Ú¤¤ in ½ÂÃ«.</p></li>

<li><p>PB 54 comes back on 29 October.  I look forward to hugging Nat and Carla.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm a bit sore from playing ultimate.</p></li>

<li><p>Part of me wonders why I'm not trying harder to make money, given that I've been whiney
about wanting to go back to the US, but also waiting until I finish paying for my shoulder</p></li>

<li><p>I didn't call my dad for his birthday.  I've been feeling pretty shit about that.</p></li>

<li><p>Been staying up until 2am every night online, usually not porn related, but watching The
Daily Show vids on youtube.  Want to change my schedule, but haven't been able to get the fuck offline.</p></li>

<li><p>Getting re-connected with Kim Sawyer on some coaching, impatiently allowing the process to
take time.</p></li>

<li><p>The weather in Tokyo has gotten a bit cooler, like 24 degrees now.</p></li>

<li><p>I was super-thrilled with my genius when I realized I had already paid ÉðÀîÀèÀ¸ in advance
for the month; that way I won't have to scramble for that money as next payday nears.</p></li>
</ol>
