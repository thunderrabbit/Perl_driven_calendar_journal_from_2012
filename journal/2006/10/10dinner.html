<p>Wandered around Shibuya a bit looking for an electronics store that was open, but found they all
closed at 10pm.  Found Softbank that will soon have the iPod+cellphones available (and I'm basically
in the market for both, definitely for a phone) and talked to Miki a bit before she heads out to the
US tomorrow (NC for 3 months).</p>

<p>Found the spaghetti restaurant that Nami took me to about 3 years ago and had never been able to
find again; ended up chowing there for なつかし purposes.  I think it's the same restaurant.</p>
