<p>Traci is the first person for whom I substitute taught at Kichijoji school (after she returned,
I subbed for Jamie); tonight Traci came to Shibuya with me, which was quite convenient given that I
was going to meet Shinpei in Shibuya, and she could meet her boyfriend Ryo, who happens to be one
of my students at the school in Shibuya.</p>

<p>We talked about random stuff on the way, including stories from my college days when I chased a
buncha girls and stuff.  Told her about Maggie and Molly, my two bestest friends from college and
how they were so well-reared.  &quot;Mom, can we drink beer?&quot; &quot;sure!&quot;
&quot;thanks!&quot;... but they didn't follow through - just wanted permission.</p>
