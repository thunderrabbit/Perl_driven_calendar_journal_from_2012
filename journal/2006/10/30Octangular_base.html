<p>In a slow-moving project, I'm on a mission to find a nice octangular piece of wood to be the base
of my new marble track.  It should be cured hardwood; I want it to last a while.</p>

<p>The wood supply store by my station seems not to have such.  They've got only pine and stuff.
And not much of it.</p>
