<p class="dream">At some kind of quick interview / quiz, they asked me how far it was from _____ to
_____, and I was like, &quot;They're a marathon apart HAHAHAHAHA&quot; totally pretending to be a
suave and sexy character like Zap Branigan.  They laughed, so I was like &quot;I didn't know you'd
marathon this question! HAHAHAHA&quot; and they laughed again, and then I was like, &quot;26.2
miles.&quot; and they were like, &quot;yup&quot; and then I went over to hug Aiko who was waiting
for me after also passing the test.</p>
