<p class="dream">Carla asked me to make 20 photo copies of a form that had been mostly filled out
except for name, a registration for attending a party she had coordinated at Pink Cow.  She then
asked for 4 more un-filled out registrations.  The copier was an old stereo, so it couldn't do
double sided copies, and the movie we were watching on the TV I had moved in from the restroom was
put near the stereo/copier, so I decided to wait on the copies until the movie was over.</p>

<p class="dream">Time came to remodel the restroom, and someone asked who had taken down the
suspended ceiling supports, and I was like, &quot;I did, to get the TV out,&quot; and he was like,
&quot;well put them back,&quot; but the rest of the men on their weekend training had already put it
back; that guy was just being a bossy wuss.</p>

<p class="dream">I went back to the copier and made the 20 copies, and then was trying to work out
which way to orient the paper to get the double sided copies to come out right.  I realized I
should have made a little mark on one corner of a sheet, but I didn't actually know where the paper
tray was.  I realized it was a dream, so I could just manifest the pages as done.</p>

<p class="lucid">or I could just wake up and not worry about it, which I did.</p>
