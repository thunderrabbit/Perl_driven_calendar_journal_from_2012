<p>Supposed to meet her at 9:30; I'll be on time, but just barely.  Almost too distracted by
plotting my bike route...</p>

<p>Holy cow; it's been a million years since I even *thought* about drinking a suicide!  How how
how how on earth could I have forgotten such an important childhood tradition??????????????</p>

<p>Lesson was fun; we went through her diary for 1.5 hours and then chatted about her husband for
half an hour; all the while I was chugging drinks from the drink bar.  Hot chocolate, orange juice
and suicides.</p>
