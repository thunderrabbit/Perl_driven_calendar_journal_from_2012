<p>Good lesson with Reika today.  She asked some fantastic questions for which I was hard pressed to
find good answers.</p>

<p>I love Shibuya, which is where I work.</p>

<p>I love teaching, which is what I do.</p>

<p>I love Fred, who is my brother.</p>

<p>I love soy milk, which is what I drink.</p>

<p>The verbs are different.  Fred <em>is</em> my brother.  I <em>drink</em> soy milk.
I <em>work</em> in Shibuya.  I <em>do</em> teach.  This sentence no verb.</p>
