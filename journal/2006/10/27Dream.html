<p class="dream">Fred and I riding with my dad driving his truck on a highway, my dad passed some
three cars in a row, and oncoming traffic was oncoming to the point that I was like, &quot;eek, better put
on my seatbelt,&quot; which I did and he passed some more cars and was going faster and faster toward
the concoming traffic that eventually we ended up on the wrong side (left side) of the first
oncoming car which had to serve out of our way to avoid head on collision.  I was like, &quot;dad!
[what are you thining?]&quot; but he continued to drive super fast and traffic was getting more and
more crowded and well-past the point that *I* would ever drive so fast.  We were now headed with
basically two lanes of traffic going both directions on a road wtih only three lanes, but we were on
the third lane to the left, definitely super dangerous, but we were still alive, thankfully.  Then
suddenly some other traffic had  a problem, and a drive shaft dropped out of the bottom of a car
that had also been driving uber-quickly.  Dad swerved to avoid it but then had to react to
something else and then something else and then it was apparent everyone had to <b>stop</b> and the
pickup truck in front of us was slamming his brakes and we were slow motionly coming far too close
and just about to crash, but I could see on the left of the pickup we had a little extra room, so I
was like, &quot;left,&quot; and my dad swerved to the left of the pickup, and had ample space to
barely stop in time.</p>

<p class="dream">I did a little relieved song and dance, &quot;oh yeah; I saved the day; I saved
the day; oh yeah!&quot; and my dad agreed with a &quot;good job,&quot; and then &quot;ah, wait,&quot;
as we came to the source of the brake slammage: a 30 meter sheer drop in the road, after an
earthquake had made the section of highway collapse.  It was not actually perpendicular to the
ground, but about 80 degrees inclined (6 degrees is the most I've seen otherwise), but dad was like
in go-for-it mode, and gunned the engine and we launched off the edge and gently slowly perfectly
floated down to the roadway 30 meters below. &quot;Wow; that wasn't so bad at all!&quot;</p>

<p>and I woke up</p>
