<p>Yesterday I got an email from <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">my webhost provider,
dreamhost.com</a>, indicting my storage space was being increased by an order of magnitude to 200
Gigs.</p>

<p>Word.</p>

<p>That's more storage than I have locally.  I'm going to arrange a way to do backups of my local
machine into all that storage space.</p>
