<p>Just finished the latest and greatest English lesson with Kaoru; she had originally asked to
postpone the lesson until next week, but I asked if we could do it this week because I had been
counting on the money to help me survive till payday.  She re-negotiated her other appointment and
met me today, and even paid me in advance for next time.  So thoughtful!</p>

<p>Her friend Yoriko happened by during the lesson and we had a bit of a laugh as I introduced
myself in intentionally archaic Japanese.  After Yoriko left Kaoru told me about Yoriko's teacher
who seems more focused on dating and pimping out other English teachers than teaching.</p>
