<p>It took me a second (couple minutes) to remember who he was after Fred sent me a quick &quot;Call
Ma&quot; email.  Oh..  I remember he lived in a nice house and we would come over to see Christmas
decorations.  I never felt super close to them, perhaps because we had to &quot;be on best
behavior&quot; and stuff, but yeah the food was good and the cushions on the couches were soft.</p>

<p>Ah; I am reminded that Fred is named after Dr Frederick Glynn Ellis, (Great) Uncle Bill's
father.</p>
