<p class="dream">In a travel type situation, and arrived near Suzanne, though I had forgotten my
wallet across the street in the other house.  It was lunch time and I hoped she would buy my lunch
and I could reimburse her, but she suggested it would be best if I go back and get my wallet at
that time.</p>

<p class="dream">I still hadn't gotten my wallet as it was time to order, but I still ordered, and
then was like, &quot;sorry; I don't have my wallet; I'm going to *run* back and get it.&quot; the
guy offered to let me pay by credit card if that would help.</p>
