<p>Wow!  I just got the best picture of Francois, <em>ever</em>.  Only way it could be better would
be more contrast between subject and background.  My student Aya did a yoga pose on one leg with her
other leg extended back/up over her head.  Francois sat on her lower back for the shot.
Awesome!</p>

<p>Just went a few minutes over with Yuuko, a woman who's a 3rd year med school student.  We had a
couple problems getting our conversation started at first; I'm sure she was thrown off by me
continuing to refer to Francois as if he were real.  &quot;HI; I'm Rob; this is Francois.  He speaks
French.&quot;</p>

<p>She was like, &quot;uh, yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>She's got a nice scratchy voice the way I like.  I had to work hard to keep my brain focused.</p>

<p>Once we got into a conversation; it was allll good.</p>
