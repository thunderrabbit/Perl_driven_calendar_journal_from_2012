<p>Reika called me 45 minutes after I was supposed to meet her at 11am.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Reika.&quot;</p>

<p>I felt like a moron.</p>

<p>The nice thing was Dude and Vero said my Japanese sounded pretty good; I pretty much spoke to
Reika in Japanese because I knew they were listening, and it was a good chance to &quot;show it
off,&quot; but still.... moron.</p>

<p>Encouraged Kyoko to buy _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ as she has Disney coming to
Japan to get mad at her company for misrepresenting Elmo or some such.  She was worried about how
to handle them.  I immediately recommended that book.</p>

<p>She emailed me; she got it tonight.</p>
