<p>Last Saturday, my computer was in the middle of uploading my local user directory to my web
server, so I didn't bring it to work.</p>

<p>Ironically, Yuria, a student who I've helped a few times by editing on computer, brought a CD so
that I could help edit a document.  Instead, we ended up working with an old fashioned stack of
paper bound together into a &quot;book&quot;.  I invited her to send me the doc via email because
last time she sent a document as a spreadsheet with each line in a different cell.  It had been
quite annoying to edit, so I hope she understood my suggestion that she use a text editor instead of
a spreadsheet.  (To ease communication, I named M$ brand names, but won't name them here)

<p>Today, I have my computer (to watch Daily Show vids), but I forgot my headphones, so I may
choose not to watch.</p>
