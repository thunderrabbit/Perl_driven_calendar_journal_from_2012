<p class="date">6:13pm JST Thursday 26 October 2006 (day 13364)</p>

<p>When I arrived today, my schedule featured 2 breaks for an hour each.  During the day, the first
hour break was filled with an extra student, and the first 20 minutes of the second break was
filled with a prospective student.</p>

<p>Four more students today, including Akiko for 80 minutes.  She's super chatty and fun.</p>

<p>I just finished the tutorial for my first flash animation thing.  Pretty easy, though I didn't
look carefully at the code (just cut-n-pasted it.  It looked pretty easy, though)</p>
