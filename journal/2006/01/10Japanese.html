<p>For the first time I used "。。。タイフンじゃなくて、あの。。。"
without thinking, <em>this is too weird to say</em>.</p>

<p>The whole phrase was when discussing weather with a guy up on
Yacht Club.  I wanted to say this is the rainy season, but I only
knew the word typhoon.</p>

<p>「今日はタイフンじゃなくて、あの、雲（くも）は’タイフンがいいです
か’と思います。」</p>

<p>I have no idea if that's comprehensible.</p>
