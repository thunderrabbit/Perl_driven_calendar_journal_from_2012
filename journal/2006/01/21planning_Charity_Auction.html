<p>Tonight I helped Matt a bit with the Charity Auction planning; it
looks like it will bring in a pile of money as different parts of the
ship are getting involved.  We had a meeting with Maiko, Hiromi, and
Ai, who are in charge of various departments and hashed out what
needs to be done.</p>

<p>It was interesting to go through that meeting and actually have
very little on my to-do list to show for it.  Just write up a couple
of descriptions of charity auction items.  I believe other people are
just doing the bulk of the work moreso than the work seems less when
evenly divided.</p>

<p>I liked working with them; I've wanted to get more involved and
become more integral.  Plus it helps me learn peoples' names.</p>
