were available buffet style for 1000 yen per person.  The staff and
volunteer staff helped greet people in a long-ass queue into Topaz
Dining, and then the hula team performed hula up in front of the room.
It seemed to go quite well, and everyone had fun.</p>

<p>After our performance, Peter's Band performed; they were quite
genki and amazing with their drum stylin's.  Peter's Japanese is quite
good; I'm impressed.</p>

<p>For the actual fruit eating part, I enjoyed a lot of dragon eyes,
mango, canteloupe, jack fruit, and dorian.  The dorian was good only
if I didn't sniff it.</p>
