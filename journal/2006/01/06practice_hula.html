<p>We had a lovely hula practice tonight; everyone is doing so well!!
I'm especially happy to see Kellie happily teaching hula, which is
quite specifically the first thing she wanted to do on the ship when
she learned we could do our own workshops.</p>

<p>Carl on my left, then Carla, then me and Yuki are all in a line in
the back row.  There's another person to Carl's left, but I've
forgotten who.</p>

<p>Really genki fun.</p>

<p>The ship hasn't left yet.</p>
