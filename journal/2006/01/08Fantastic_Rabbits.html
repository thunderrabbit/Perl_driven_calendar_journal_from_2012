<p>My first class was fantastic.  A few minutes before class, I
remembered the idea from my professora de espanol (no enye on this
keyboard) that we all take on Spanish names, countries and
professions.  At that time I became Roberto, vagabundo de la playa en
Costa Rica.</p>

<p>We became:
<br /><! me />Rob, rabbit trainer from Texas
<br /><! Koji />George, professional tennis player from Australia
<br /><! Kaoru />Kelly, science teacher from Canada
<br /><! Rie />Carol, flight attendant from San Francisco
<br /><! Sachiko />Alice, pilot from England
<br /><! Satoko />Michelle, the president of New Zealand
</p>

<p>I gave her high five when she said president.</p>

<p>We talked about a team name.  They were like, "Francois" and
"rabbit" and "fantastic"... they became Fantastic Rabbits.</p>

<p>I considered and then quickly rejected the idea of coming up with
rabbit names for everyone.</p>

<p>We had several vocabulary words and came up with class agreements.
I requested that they come to class and come to me first if they have
problems.  I introduced a combination of ideas from Derrick (from
51st) and Pat (49th) to create a Magic box where we will keep track of
Japanese utterances, and good uses of English.  There will be some
sort of punishment for the one who speaks the most Japanese.</p>
