<p>I went to sleep super early and have woken up naturally now.</p>

<p>I've just finished lessons preps for today, and really think I've
got some good stuff that Matt would appreciate as being useful for
life onboard and in port.  Yesterday he talked to each teacher
individually, and (for me, at least) said that if the students can't
use the language immediately, then we shouldn't teach it.</p>
