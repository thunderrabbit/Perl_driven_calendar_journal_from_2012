<p>I haven't ventured outside yet, but we have arrived in Vietnam.
According to the announcement, we can go upstairs to see a performance
on the shore.  But, we should bring an umbrella; it's raining.</p>

<p>Ugh.  it's raining outside, and I just don't have the (something)
to go out in it.  I partially just want to stay on the ship.  I've
got plenty of money to go out... part of it is I don't want to take
my computer in the rain, but I don't want to leave it...  What a
silly dilemma.</p>

<p>I think I'll solve it by NOT taking it, but taking my handspring
visor and keyboard.  Although I wasn't smart enough to make sure
those batteries are charged enough to use it.</p>

<p>After a bit, I had a revelation which solved the journal problem.
I remembered I had received a blank book from Secret Santa Karen on
the first (second?) night aboard the ship.  All concerns instantly
melted away.  I didn't take any electronic journaling equipment - just
brought my camera and phone (for its clock).</p>

<p>I packed everything, headed up to reception, and felt blessed to
find the GET Team just in line to disembark.  I even had time to run
back down to get _Xenocide_ (next in series after _Speaker for the
Dead_), which I had forgotten in my room.</p>
