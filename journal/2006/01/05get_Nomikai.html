<p>The nomikai went well tonight.  An animal theme (I was on the Okapi
team) so we made animal noises, etc...  Did a true-false game and
Okapis and Giraffes (?) (Petra's team) tied with 12 points and both
got the bonus question.</p>

<p>Lotsa lotsa lotsa dancing, though I got pretty hot in my outfit:
bandana thing from Petra Jordan (red and white checks) and white gown
thing from Port Sayed Egypt.</p>

<p>See ya later (actually Sayonara) party for Sachie, who will be
leaving the voyage tomorrow.  She's the student coordinator for the
53rd voyage!!  They presented her with a cake and we sang and good
stuff.  I gave her a bit of a massage afterward while she was chillin'
on the side of the room.</p>

<p>After I was drenched from dancing, a girl came up to me and wanted
a photograph together.  Funnily, she didn't say anything, but just
pointed at her camera.  She showed me the resulting photo, and it was
really flattering; I was looking right at the camera and she was
smiling looking up at me.  I don't know her name, but wonder if I can
get a copy...</p>
