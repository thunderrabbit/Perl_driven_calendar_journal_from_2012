<p>Much genkiness in 3027; we're happily anticipating our dates
tonight.</p>

<p>Pretty cool storm outside now, more wind than rain, but less wind
than when we had that lovely typhoon during 49th voyage.</p>

<p>Dinner was nice.  I sat between Lisa (on my left) and Tomoyo, the
girl with semi-heavy eye makeup, with Rei across from me.</p>

<p>Carl tried to get extra dessert of apple pie and ice cream, but it
didn't happen.</p>

<p>One funny thing surpassed all others at the table.  Lisa said
something like, "oh my god, these cream packets - do you know how
many I go through a day?"</p>

<p>In coach voice I was like, "well, 1 for breakfast, 1 for lunch,
ah, hell, I dunno, a <em>hundred?</em>"</p>
<p>Rei and I went for a stroll on top deck and chilled in the stairs
in front of the bridge telling stories about childhoods and future
plans and how I came to live in Japan.</p>

<p>We could hear the wind going crazy outside, so we decided to step
out into it.  I got pretty soaked, and tried to keep her dry, though
the rain prevailed.  Downstairs next to the T-club and to our
neighborhood where we found Dan asleep in my room, Yuki asleep across
the hall, but Carla still awake.  She jumped up all excited to see the
rain, so we joined her, though it took two tries to get all three of
us up there.  The second time was with Tony as well.</p>

<p>Back downstairs, Rei painted my toenails and we joked about how
quickly Carla falls asleep.</p>
