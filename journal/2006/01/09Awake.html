<p>I'm staying up; I plan to go to the gym now and run on the

<p>No treadmill was available; the ship was teeming with old people!
Every machine in the gym was in use.  A parade of people were walking
around the top deck.  A crowd of people were doing slow motion
exercise on top of Yacht Club.</p>
