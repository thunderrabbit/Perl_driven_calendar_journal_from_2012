<p>We've got a bunch of guests onboard right now.  Lee Hirsch,
Mikalah (sp) something, and two members of the Zora Youth Choir.</p>

<p>Tonight was the Zora Youth Choir guys' first performance, so I
went to check it out with Rei.  It wasn't exactly the kind of music I
like; it was definitely <em>good</em>, but also definitely acapella,
and especially without percussion.  100% opposite from the Kenyan
music we got from Peter's Band.</p>
