<p class="dream">I needed to get back to the top floor of the parking
garage, so I got into a taxi that was just doing a slow circuit around
the garage from top to bottom and around again.  The driver was
careful to get to know each of us; he pent some time sitting next to
each passenger, carefully learning names and hometowns, etc.</p>

<p class="dream">I was carrying Yuuka's bag instead of my own, though
I don't remember why.</p>

<p class="dream">We got under way, and the guy beside me, perhaps
inspired by the taxi driver, started telling me that I was pretty good
at voice percussion and singing the blues.. I was like, "thanks, but
I'm not really all that good..."</p>

<p class="dream">We arrived at the bottom of the garage, because the
guy was on his downward driving, and I had plenty of time so I had
just intended to ride all the way down and back up.  But at the bottom
he got a call saying basically he was needed for a job across town,
and the customer was willing to pay 10 pounds to each passenger who
was inconvenienced.  I was thinking it would be a good way to make a
bit of cash, so when the driver dropped us off in the restaurant at
the bottom of the garage, I told the Maitre-D I had to split, and he
said I could turn in my ten pound claim form by some date.</p>

<p class="dream">I woke up while looking for a new taxi.</p>
