<p>Danced up at Sports Bar during the byebye party Lee (*) invited me
to.  Pretty slow music at first, but it pepped up after a bit, and I
was sweating after not too long.  I can tell I've not smooched anyone
in a while; I was feeling really angsty to have some fliratious
connections.</p>

<p>I left around 12:15, 25 minutes after they said there would be a
party in 10 minutes.</p>
