<p>GET ME(eting) was aight; pretty fast... Shit is about to get hectic
with GET Olympics on top deck and GET Charity Auction in Broadway,
both on the 23rd.</p>

<p>I massaged Carl's shoulders and back during the meeting even though
he was sweaty from runnin' on the treadmill just prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>Oh shit; I remember what else: Phil, for some reason, has come up
with the genius idea of letting someone shave our chests for the
charity auction.  Damn.  I've never considered shaving my chest
before, but...  it sounds like a good thing to try once.</p>
