<p>This is 'supposed' to go in my blog, but I don't have access to
it, and I'm not planning to write much.</p>

<p>Saw <em>Mr and Mrs Smith</em>, starring Brad Pitt (I think), and
Angelina Jolie.  Nice.  I liked the scene where they first made up in
the kitchen, and then the slow motion shooting after they were
cornered in the shed in the shopping mall.</p>
