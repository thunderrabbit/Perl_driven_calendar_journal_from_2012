<p>Pretty fun lesson with Fighting Goats; I hope they enjoyed it.  We
went to top deck to hear Carol play saxophone for a bit, and I made
them treat it as if they were in a jazz bar meeting each other.  This
is a simple task I believe, and they were able to do it, but didn't
really extend or expand that I noticed.</p>
