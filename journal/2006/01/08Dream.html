<p class="dream">I was back in my old school and forgot to
dosomepreparation so I got a detention slip from noon to four pm, and
I couldn't go on the origginal day (voyage), so I got it deferred to
today (this voyage), but I had no idea if they would actually remember
it.  I looked in my filebox and was delighted to find it.</p>

<p class="dream">The guy supervising over the file boxes said the
woman who got me into the original trouble was a really bitch, but on
my form I had written, "I forgive the woman for this challenge," being
way more accepting of her as a person who took out some thing on me
that I didn't 'deserve'.</p>

<p class="dream">I wouldn't be able to serve the full four hours,
though, because I had many PB meetings, so I was asking about that
when I woke up.</p>
