<p>First dream</p>

<p class="dream">We were sailing in some incredible waves that were getting taller
than the ship, and crashing down like over the front deck.  We were
surfing like down with a tube of waves on either side of the ship as
we went down along this hill.</p>

<p>-------------</p>

<p class="dream">On the ship with several Japanese passengers and some
valley girls, we were like totally having lunch, and I thought we
should play some silent football, so I was like, "okay, let's play
silent football" and people were keen, including Laura of the current
GET Team, sitting across from me.  Other people were asking questions
before I even started explaning the rules, but asking about specific
rules slash, "I've played before, but I don't remember what a gopher
is." and I was like, "acknowledged; we will hear all the rules now,"
if you will just stop asking questions..</p>

<p class="dream">I started to explain the rules, but realized we had a
much coooler thing to watch: our spaceship car was flying down a
mountain, crashing through fences and other obstacles with ease.  We
had a professional driver and I stopped explaining the rules, but was
like, "this looks much more interesting, but I still want to play
silent football when we are done!"</p>

<p class="dream">The driver was also tour guide and he commentted that
there were so few species left from this park, where we had
intrdoduced lots of dinosaurs like Jurrassica Park.</p>
