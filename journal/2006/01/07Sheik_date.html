the hall.  I dressed in my white gown from Egypt and red/white checked
head thing from Jordan.  I became Mr Sheik, and Dan and Carl were my
body guards in business suits and sunglasses.  I put Francois looking
out my front pocket (on the left at chest level) to complete the
silly outfits.</p>

<p>We tried walking side by side with  them flanking me as we walked
through the ship, but the corridors were too narrow, so we resorted
to single file.</p>

<p>Relatively little response as we walked around the 7th deck of the
ship, but Maruan recognized it as a gag of unparalleled genius and
took some pictures of us.</p>

appreciated; several people took pictures, and our three dates were
like, "oh my god!" etc.  For super added hilarity Forward Body Guard
(Dan) served Mr Sheik's food and carried it to the table.</p>

<p>The Forward Body Guard tasted Mr Sheik's food and water to make
sure it wasn't poisoned.  We then dropped the pretense but joked like,
"what if we had forced everyone to clear this side of the room before
Mr Sheik came in??.."  etc.. hilarious!!</p>

<p>During dinner, we asked the girls what they thought of the letters
and which ones were allocated to whom and who they thought wrote which
ones.  They guessed Carl for the eloquent one, then me for the
'normal' one (perhaps Carla recognized my handwriting), but that left
Dan for the misspelled one in crayon.</p>

<p>It seems they never decided which ones were for which of them.</p>

<p>We never gave them a straight answer, only "one of us likes one of
you; one of us likes two of you; and one of us likes all three of you
lovely ladies.." the last spoken like The Ladie's Man.</p>

<p>After dinner walk around to the front deck, we gazed at the ships
on the horizon and joked that they were all pirate ships coming to get
us.  The wind was brisk; Yuki in short sleeves stayed huddled behind
me; I enjoyed the bit of contact and warmth, because it began to
sprinkle big drops of rain.</p>

<p>Down the front secret entrance and in pairs, with Front Body
Guard in front and Back Body Guard in back, we paraded through free
space and into Hemmingway, where I was called habibi by one of the
arabic speaking bartenders.  I don't remember his name, but he was on
49th voyage.</p>

<p>We joked that Mr Sheik should pay for everything, obviously being
incredibly rich, and then joked about an incredibly poor sheik, whose
oil field has dried up, and has no palace, no cars, no food...  as I
am still on my quest to spend 0 dollars on the ship.</p>

<p>(( although it must be noted that Hitomi has blessed me with $50
for laundry (and chocolate) on the ship; she wants to make sure I have
clean clothes available.  I'm not sure how I will go about buying
laundry tokens and chocolate, but not putting it on my card. ))</p>

<p>They bought four ice creams and two brownies.  I had a bit, not
feeling comfortable in taking much of what I didn't pay for.</p>
