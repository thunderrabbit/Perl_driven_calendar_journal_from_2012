<p>Rei happened by while Fantastic Rabbits were planning George's
byebye party in the hall.  It's her friendliness; bilingualness;
tanness; smile and swept back hair that I like.</p>

<p>Today is the day I joined the CC meeting, with Joel's blessing,
though he seemed hesitant to give it.  I just wanted to see what they
were like, and I got an extra bonus of stablizing in my mind the names
of all the CCs.  I kept getting Yumi and the non-CC Maiko mixed
up.  Now I've got them sorted.</p>

<p>I wrote down some vocabulary and learned two new words: よび which
means extra, and はんしょく which is like seating, as in First
Seating and Second Seating for dinner time.  ぜんはんしょく is first
seating, and こはんしょく is second seating. よびのじしょ means extra
[electronic] dictionary.</p>

<p>After the meeting, Rei defined those words for me, and we set up a
time for me to make suggestions on her translation of the newspaper
article from a few days ago.  And we'll go to Peter's Band tonight.</p>

<p>Rei came up to me before English Cafe and I was chatting a bit with
her and then when Lisa came up, Lisa asked Rei if Rei would be
interested in helping Lisa with a project...  I felt jealous; I should
have thought of that... a project... working together on some
something instead of me fumbling about asking if she likes a
particular movie or song or whatever.</p>

Peter's Band's performance, and stayed out watching the stars on front
deck from 8:35 to 10:10ish pm when they closed the deck.</p>

<p>During that time we calculated that she is 10487 days old, and
therefore her 10500th day can be celebrated on 30 January!  Wow!</p>

<p>It took a bit longer for us to calculate my birthday starting with
27 Oct 2005 = 13000 days, but we got it.  I was truly impressed.  We
started by calculating the number of days in a leap year cycle, and
then rounding that up to 1500, and then doubling that and subtracting
3000 day chunks from my days old and calling them 8 year chunks.  Got
down to 1000 days after doing four 8-year chunks, and then adding to
1000 the number of days we had overestimated by saying 1500 = 4 years.
1312 days actually, and that's *almost* another 4 year chunk, so we
subtracted 1312 from 1461 and got 149, which is the number of days we
need to add to 27 Oct 2005 to get to my next 8 year chunk, which
happens to be my next birthday.</p>

<p>Yuki and Carla wandered by around midnight and chatted for a bit.
Now I'm packing for tomorrow.</p>
