<p>Though it got moved inside due to rain that stopped just as
everything was moved, we had a lovely / invigorating / dancetastical
celebration in Broadway Show Lounge.</p>

<p>I've somehow messed up my knee (I think from sitting weirdly), but
that didn't keep me from dancing (it doesn't hurt if it's in use; only
when it's all the way straight or all the way bent.</p>

<p>One kid threw down some mad phat breakdance steps, and one time
when he did a wild handstand, he hit a table on the way down to the
floor.  The table is well fastened to the floor; I hope he wasn't
injured too badly.</p>

<p>He danced a lot after that, so it seems not to have been too
traumatic.</p>
