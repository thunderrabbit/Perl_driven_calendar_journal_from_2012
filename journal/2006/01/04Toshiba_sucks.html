<p>I was just in time to meet ¤ê¤¨ at 7pm to figure out why her
computer wasn't burning CDs.  Turns out the OS is locked so only one
particular vendor's CD burning software can be used.  What a horrible
way to treat their users..  They have even locked in some crappy
software.  We were burning about 100 photos and the Time Remaining bar
counted from like 2:10 to 1:30 then jumped up to 5:40 and counted down
to 3:50 and then plummeted to 2:00 again.. Totally shit software.
Toshiba sucks.</p>
