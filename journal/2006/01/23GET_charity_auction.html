Audrey was before the 49th) so I hope it goes well (as the 49th
did).</p>

<p>Dan and I will be doing the Suite with Bath skit with blue
streamers for water and me in a towel getting into the bath after
pouring water on myself and he'll dump water out when I get in.  Sheer
genius!</p>

<p>Phil had the great idea of shaving our chests for money, so Phil,
Carl and I are in on that.  If we raise 5000 yen, I will let someone
shave my chest; if we raise 10,000 yen Carl and I will be shaved, and
15000 yen means all three of us will be shaved.  Carl is a bit
confused about how we got pulled into this thing and are getting
shaved before Phil, but I'm sure we'll raise the money....</p>

<p>For the skit, Carl and I are wearing wigs on our chests.  Phil will
wear a whiteboard with hair drawn on it, and with an eraser it will be
shaved while he's onstage.</p>

<p>Last, we are part of the Date with boys from a room, with three
rooms "competing."..  The highest bid gets first choice, and the mid
bid gets second choice, and the third bid can pull out if they want,
I guess.  I don't actually think we can say the second highest bid
gets second choice, cause the two highest bidders could be both
interested in the same room.</p>

<p>Anyway, I will be dressed as the Sheik, with Dan and Carl as my
poker-faced body guards.</p>

<p>The auction was great!  We raised $4400 today!  About $2000 with a
raffle of about 10 prizes and then $2400 with all the rest of the
goodies.  For some reason, the GET and CC girls went for $170 while a
choice of 3 or 4 guys went for $210.  How crazy is that?  I think
people were just dissuaded by what the hizzle to do with a date with
16 girls.</p>

<p>The chest shaving thing was painfully nervewracking that Phil was
going to get away unshaved, leaving me and Carl smooth like buttah.  I
begged people to pay and then fell flat on my face when it looked like
we were sunk, but then I heard a chorus of cheers as someone bid the
next increment to $150 for all three!  I jumped up with joy and ran
offstage, throwing my wig down and shouting with glee ....
Yeahhhhhhhh!!!!</p>

<p>CC Rie made that winning bid; she specified that I am hers to
shave.</p>

<p>The Sheik and two body guards were not selected as the guy date,
so I'm glad we're off the hook for that one.</p>
