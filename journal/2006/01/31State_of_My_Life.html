<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I haven't really kissed anyone on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>I have just recently quite specifically specified that I won't
be really kissing anyone on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>I recognize myself going through transformations around
relationships with women.  Long talks with Kattrean on the last
voyage helped a lot.  She helped me begin to believe that it's in my
own best interest to not haphazardly connecting with women.  During
that voyage I made a vow around making sure everyone is tested for
HIV before getting involved.</p>

<p>Long (!) <! disastrous > talks with Hitomi helped a lot.  I
have fought with her and strung her along enough for a lifetime.
That shit has got to end.</p>

<p>This voyage, long talks with Rei have shown me a new platonic way
to relate with someone on a higher plane, with minds switched on,
awareness and honesty all around.  Something similar to relationships
as described separately by Ram Das (sp) and Charlotte Kasl (sp).</p></li>

<li><p>We've just left the continent of Africa: we went to Mombasa
(Kenya), Cape Town (South Africa), and Walvis Bay (Namibia).  Mombasa
was the most like what I thought it would be.  Cape Town is too much
like a western city.  Walvis Bay is too cold.</p>

<p>We're in route to Rio de Janeiro now.</p></li>

<li><p>Today is the last vacation day before Term 2 starts tomorrow.
We'll have three days of classes, a break, then three more days and a
week long break as we hit Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>After that, 3 class days, another break for Ushuaia and glaciers
then 2 more days and Term 2 will be done.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm teaching GET Open lessons this coming term (along with Liz,
Maruan, Kellie and Carl).  I've gotten my first two days' worth
planned.  My third through sixth days are not planned.</p></li>

<li><p>Today is Rei's 10501st day.  We'll be "learning" Majong with
Picasso and then going for a brownie in Hemingway.</p>

<p>I could say "the brownie," because this will be literally the
first thing I have bought on the ship, but I didn't even buy it with
my card, but I paid cash to Carl and put it on his card.  I'm still at
0 balance with PB.</p></li>

<li><p>Rei and I had a lovely dinner and walk around the port for her
10500th day, and then a conversation that I didn't want to have,
which resulted in what I didn't want to happen, but which I trust is
for the best in the big scheme.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm enjoying my Powerbook G4, with keys laid out in Dvorak, but
still typing in QWERTY, much to the chagrin of most people who want to
borrow it.  Still no keytop on the \| key, which has been moved over
to replace the iI key which broke when I rearranged the keys.</p>

<p>I've just considered starting / catching up a list of hardware
that I've used, and its capabilities.  I keep writing that I'm using
this computer, and it's been the same computer for years.  But in 10
years I'll have forgotten how puny it was.</p>

<p>Only 512 Megs of memory?????</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really studied Japanese on this voyage, but I might
start, with Akane as my teacher.  I hope she doesn't speak a lot of
English in our lessons, or I'll have to ditch her.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really hung out with Rie on this voyage as I had
expected I might.  I think a big factor was her overland tour from
Kenya to South Africa.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitomi said she sent a package to me to arrive in Kenya, but it
never came.  I'm really bummed about that.  I'm sure she is, too.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still carrying around Francois, who went sandboarding with
us yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p>Some GET Ts were late coming back to the ship last night.
We're going to hear about it in GET meeting today.  Matt will push
back on punishment that will be requested by PB staff.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't played any Silent Football on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm tired, and going to take a nap until lunchtime.</p></li>
