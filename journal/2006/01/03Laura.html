<p>Laura and I walked around Hoi An a bit and then I showed her where
Tam lives, cause she (Laura) wanted to get off the beaten path.  I
ended up ordering new sandals from her brother (his shoe shop is right
at their house), but I wouldn't pay the requested 100,000 dong because
Tam wasn't there to fend for me; she had said 60,000 dong shoes from
her brother the previous day.  I paid 50,000 and we continued on our
walk as the shoes were being made.</p>

<p>Laura and I were welcomed into a woman's house, where she (Lang)
gave us tea and Laura took pictures of her baby (Hiu) and few year old
son (Ha) and sister.  Then Lang was like, "can you help me for about
30 minutes?"  and I thought she meant for me to help her carry some
rocks somewhere or some such, so I was like, "sure..."</p>

<p>We headed out and went to her boat (her house was right on the
water).  Laura and I didn't want to go together, in case something was
sketchy, so I gave her my book and camera and headed out with Lang.  I
was like, "can I help you paddle?" and helped her paddle, and then I
was like, "which way?" and she goes, "I don't know; you choose; left
right okay." and I realized this "help her" was actually "pay for a
boat ride" that I didn't want.  I directed us immediately back to
shore and ended up giving her about 10,000 dong (about $0.80) just to
get away.  It can be attributed to miscommunication, but still it was
kinda weak.</p>

still refused to pay the balance until I talked to Tam to get the
60,000 dong price, and ended up leaving the sandals there until I
could meet her.</p>

<p>Back to the hotel and took a phat nap.</p>
