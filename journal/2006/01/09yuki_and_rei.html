across the hall.  Carla was up on GET Street (they (probably via
Carla) have started to call it Ghetto Street) planning lessons for
tomorrow.  The original plan was just to help Rei get photos from her
camera to her computer, but she offered tea and cookies and a bit of
chocolate, plus Yuki came home so we were all talking and when Yuki
pulled out her nail polish, Rei painted my toe nails as well.
Alternating blue and soft pink, with contrasting colors as polka dots
or lines, and one smiley face.  So cute!</p>

<p>I quite enjoy being closer friends with the CCs this time than
last voyage.</p>
