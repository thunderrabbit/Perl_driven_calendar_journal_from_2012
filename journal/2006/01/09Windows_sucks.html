<p>Recently, since our network is a set of Microsoft Sucks Windows
machines, I have collected some reasons that Microsoft Windows
sucks.</p>

<p>I don't know that I can remember them all now, but here are a
couple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I was creating hyperlinks to local files within a text
document.  For each new link, I had to navigate to the file I wanted
to link starting from the directory which contained the file I was
editing.  That sucks a bit, but I solved it easily enough by moving
the file to a more convenient directory and creating the hyperlinks
while it was stored there.</p>

<p>I wondered if it would be so dumb as to create the links relative
to the file, but the text that popped up when I hovered the mouse
over the link showed a fully qualified location.</p>

<p>But it wasn't.  When I moved the file back to where I wanted it,
all the links were broken.  But hovering over them still showed the
same fully qualified location.</p></li>

<li><p>There is a key labeled POWER on the keyboard.  It's right next
to SCROLL LOCK or something.  If pressed, the computer shuts down
without question.  No pop-up window, "are you sure?" It just shuts
down.  A single keypress can derail a train of thought, close all
chat windows, shut off the music.  That's fucked up.</p>

<p>At least move the key to where it won't easily be hit.</p></li>
</ol>
