<p>Chowed lunch with Rei and Keith (guest passenger for a day),
subsequently joined by Yuki and Kentaro out in the delicious sun
behind Yacht Club.  Keith has worked with PB for 8 different visits to
South Africa, but had never actually been on the ship.  He wanted to
get a sense of what life was like onboard, so he's checking it out for
the two days we're traveling to Namibia.</p>

<p>Rei and I watched the waves go by for a little over an hour,
sharing conversation on theoretical silliness: "Would you want to be
on a spaceship with 5000 people destined for another star, never to
return to earth?" and "could there be a planet made entirely of
water?" and then she shared a story about life in Japan before PB.
Good times.</p>
