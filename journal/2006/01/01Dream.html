<p class="dream">In a rather fancy casino as part of a PB tour; there
were multiple levels in this large glitzy showroom of slot machines
and various green felt covered tables with lights and sounds
permeating every moment and balcony levels with their own machines
overlooking the scene.</p>

<p class="dream">There was a queue of people wanting to go into a new
area, while I was on my way outside to get some free space for my
brain to relax.  I cut through the line and walked around outside, and
when I came back in, they let me into an even fancier gaming area,
where all the seats had dinner plates loaded with fine cuisines,
different in each room.  I walked around looking for something that
piqued my interest and at one point decided to get rid of the balloon
I was carrying and it popped, startling one of the waitstaff, but she
quickly recovered her smile as I threw away the dead balloon.</p>
