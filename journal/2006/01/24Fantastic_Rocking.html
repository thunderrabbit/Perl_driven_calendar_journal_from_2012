<p>The ship is rocking pretty nicely.  I've enjoyed the occassional
oscillations that can't be easily ignored.  All around me as I sit,
the walls are creaking and doors open and close on their own, but we
certainly haven't had any of the ship shuddering waves that Stacy was
talking about from previous voyages.  I do truly hope we get those.
I think it would *rule*.</p>

<p>Speaking of things that rule, I have a bit of free time, and plan
to use it for getting pictures on my site more efficiently.</p>
