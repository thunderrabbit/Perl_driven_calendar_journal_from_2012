<p>Awake now; actually got a call at 5:20.  Nick slept outside on the
balcony.  I had chosen the side of the double bed by the window, but
actually got the double bed all to myself (though I didn't know it
until I woke up at 3:45) and Dan slept on the single.</p>

<p class="date">6:13am EAT Thursday 19 January 2006</p>

<p>Small breakfast for me, then sat by Karen during her breakfast.
Headed toward my room to read the schedule, because I guessed it would
be good if I knew what was going on today, and Matt asked if I was
sorted for today.  I was like, "uhhhhh" cause I didn't know what he
was talking about.. I'm not packed, but I think I have time to pack;
what?</p>

<p>"For the English activity."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeh; sorted."</p>

<p>"Do you mind filling me in a little on what you've planned?"</p>

<p>So...  plans, eh?  plans...  hmmmmm, "yeah, we're going to have
each van count off 1 through 6 to make teams that are evenly
spaced."</p>

<p>"you'll have all the vans meet each other first, right?"</p>

<p>"Um, oh yeah obviously that,"</p>

<p>"What I think would be a good idea would be to have some way for
them to get to know each other in their groups, some questions about
the safari...."</p>

<p>Uh huh; yeah; okay</p>

<p>"But I'll leave it in your capable hands...."</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>Yikes stripes, what a narrow escape!</p>

<p>Back from our second safari; today we saw an ostrich and some
baboons, in addition to the types of animals we saw yesterday.
Particulary interesting were lions patiently waiting for our vans to
stop blocking the way to their water buffalo treats.</p>

<p class="date">11:32am EAT Thursday 19 January 2006</p>

<p>Our workshop went quite well.  Then singin' and dancin' with
Peter's Band!</p>

<p class="date">4:47pm EAT Thursday 19 January 2006</p>

<p>Headed back now; we've been headed back since 2pm...  Flat tire
time now on one of the other vans.  We had been cheering our driver,
Harun, as he was passing traffic, using all sides of the road as
passing lanes.</p>

<p>A bit scarier than riding motorscooter taxis in Vietnam because at
times we were tilting at scary angles on either side of the road.
Good times!</p>
