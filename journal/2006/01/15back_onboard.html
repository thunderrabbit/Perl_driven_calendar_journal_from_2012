<p>I arrived back on the ship at 16:15 or so, 15 minutes before
boarding limit.  Laura was sought by those whose job it is to make
sure we are all onboard.  She was on, but her card hadn't been
scanned.</p>

<p>Hung out with the 3029 girls (*) until dinner at 17:30.</p>

<p>(*) 3029 is their room number; there are 3 women living in that
room.</p>

<p>We departed during dinner; I ate too much, then went down to Topaz
and ate again; I had actually just gone down because I wanted the
dessert, but ended up eating the whole meal, just because.  The
service in Topaz Dining is really fantastic.  I was the *last* person
in before they close the doors, and the *last* person out.  But they
made me feel like the first person in, and that I never had to go
out.</p>

<p>At that point I planned to just collapse into bed, but Nick was
going to check Lisa's party on top deck (though he said it was
supposed to start in her room; I chose to forgo that part) so I went
to top deck.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>found Tony and Yuuka lying face up, watching clouds and stars.</p></li>

<li><p>lay down between them and watched</p></li>

<li><p>was happy when Rei came up</p></li>

<li><p>Tony went to hang with the hip hop kids</p></li>

<li><p>Rei came and sat down</p></li>

<li><p>Yuuka left for a meeting at 9pm</p></li>

<li><p>I happily chilled with Rei and sang her songs</p></li>

<li><p>We traded stories and back massages, but nothing else</p></li>

<li><p>I determined why the hip hop kids' radio was bleeping periodically.</p></li>

<li><p>Rei agreed it was due to the radar, which we could visually
confirm its rotation corresponded with the bleeps.</p></li>

<li><p>I went to the meet Peter's Band, except for Peter workshop
because she was CCing it.</p></li>

<li><p>I fell asleep a lot during the workshop.</p></li>

<li><p>Lost track of Rei after the workshop.</p></li>

<li><p>I've got to go to bed and sleep sleep sleep.</p></li>
</ol>
