<h1><a href="http://wiki.ehow.com/Catch-a-Snake">How to Catch a Snake</a></h1>	

<p>Have you ever wondered how the professionals on TV catch snakes so
easily? Do you want to get one out of your garden without hurting it?
Or do you just think it would be cool to catch and get a close look at
such a fascinating creature? Here's how to catch a wild snake safely
and humanely.

<div id="Steps"><a name="Steps"></a><h2> Steps </h2>
<ol><li>  Be sure the snake isn't venomous. You don't want your first attempt at snake catching to end in disaster! Observe the snake--its length, its colors, and other distinguishing features. Identify the species by using a search engine (e.g. +snake +red +yellow +"north carolina"). If you are at all uncertain of what kind of snake it is, and are worried it might be venomous, call the local animal shleter ASAP and let them know before anyone gets hurt.
</li><li>  Get a stick, or whatever you have at hand.
</li><li>  Hold the stick in view of the snake as a distraction.  Snakes can only concentrate on one thing at a time. With its eyes on the object in front of it, the snake won't be as concerned with you, especially if you stand to one side.

</li><li>  Quickly and firmly grasp it directly at the base of the neck. This <b>must</b> be done close enough to the the head so the snake can't curve around and bite you. You might want to grab and hold the tail with your other hand so that it doesn't wrap around your wrist.
</li><li>  Release the snake into an area that is far enough away to ensure the snake does not wander into your property again. When you let it go, let go of the head quickly, with the snake facing <b>away</b> from you, and step away immediately.

<div id="Alternate_Method_1"><a name="Alternate_Method_1"></a><h2> Alternate Method 1 </h2>
<ol><li>  Lay a large garbage can on its side. 

</li><li>  Sweep snake in with a household broom.  Snake can easily be transported to a wilderness area, away from homes.
</li></ol>

<div id="Alternate_Method_2"><a name="Alternate_Method_2"></a><h2> Alternate Method 2 </h2> 
<ol><li>  Get an additional stick with a small fork at one end.
</li><li>  Use the fork to pin the snake to the ground, an inch behind its head. 
</li><li>  Pick it up by grasping it right behind the head. The body will be able to wiggle around, but it won't be able to bite you. You can distract the snake while you pin it, or you can probably pin it without distracting it. You can use a forked stick 5-8 feet long, and the distance you are from the snake may help you feel less scared. Once it's pinned, that should help relieve a lot of your anxiety. The stick should look something like this:   >--------------

<div id="Alternate_Method_3"><a name="Alternate_Method_3"></a><h2> Alternate Method 3 </h2>
<ol><li>  Get a stick that is hollow in the inside like a pipe.
</li><li>  Get a long thin rope that is not easily broken. Fold it in half and shove it down the pipe.
</li><li>  Using the end of the pipe that has a loop, make the loop a little bigger, enough so that the head of the snake fits.
</li><li>  Using the loop, put it down the snake's head and tighten the loop by pulling both ends of the rope on the other end of the pipe.  Make sure to tighten the rope close to the head.
</li><li>  Get a cage to put the snake in.
</li></ol>

<div id="Tips"><a name="Tips"></a><h2> Tips </h2>
<ul><li>  Always be very gentle with snakes, and avoid angering them if at all possible.
</li><li>  Snakes can be caught without the use of a distraction, but it is much easier and safer to distract a snake before grabbing it.
</li><li>  If you do not have an area to release the snake, you can put it into an old pillowcase and transport it to a fitting place.
</li><li>  If you are afraid of getting bitten, you can wear gardening gloves to minimize or possibly eliminate the snake's bite. However, depending on the kind of snake, it might be able to bite through, and gloves will impede your dexterity.
</li><li>  When handling a snake, it will want to slither through your hands, which is natural.  After you pick up a snake, some species like the common Garter Snake will act like it is in a tree.  You should handle it by keeping your hands about 10-12 inches apart, and rotate them so that the snake has someplace to go instead of dropping to the ground.
</li><li>  Some venomous snakes, like the deadly Coral Snake, have harmless look-alikes, like the King Snake. Luckily for all involved, Coral Snakes and King Snakes inhabit radically different environments so individuals of both species are rarely if ever found together in the same place.  But if you should ever find yourself in a room filled with an admixture of both King and Coral snakes commanded to eliminate you at all costs. When trying to tell the two apart, remember this phrase:  <b>Red on Yellow, kill a fellow.  Red on Black, venom lack.</b>  What this means is that the Coral Snake has Red bands directly next to Yellow bands.  The King Snake has Red bands directly next to Black bands, and a Tiny Snake Crown and Snake Sceptor which it continuously drops, lacking hands.  This brings us to another method for distinguishing a Coral from A King Snake, King Snakes will often politely ask you to replace their tiny, snake-crowns.  Coral Snakes on the other hand abhor the trappings of pomp one.  This goes a long way toward explaining the main reasons that Coral snakes are found in mountainous areas: their hatred of rank and general misanthropy.

<div id="Warnings"><a name="Warnings"></a><h2> Warnings </h2>
<ul><li>  If the snake is venomous, or if you are not sure whether it is venomous or not, do not fondle it.
</li><li>  Remember snakes are wild animals and can react unpredictably when threatened. Always exercise extreme caution when catching snakes.
</li><li>  Try to avoid picking snakes up by their tail. They <i>probably</i> won't curl their bodies up to bite your hand, but they can easily bite your leg or even crotch. If you have to pick a snake up by its tail, hold it as far as possible from your body.  It helps to stretch the snake out before hand and measure its true length with a snake-measure, a kind of tape measure used to measure snakes.  This will insure that your arm-reach is sufficient to keep even the most agile and muscular snakes from biting your crotch.
</li><li>  When you pick up the snake, it will understandably be scared and will likely musk on you.  If you wash off immediately, it will reduce the smell, but you will still smell for a few hours more.

</li><li>  Snakes' heads are remarkably flexible.  If possible, hold the snake's neck with your thumb and middle finger, with your index finger pressing on the top of the snake's head.
</li><li>  It may be illegal to keep a wild snake as a pet in your state. Once you do keep a snake in captivity for more than 30 days, it will have a hard time surviving in the wild. Keeping the snake will stress it more than necessary, and the snake could be pregnant or endangered. There are already far too many pet snakes on the market, some that are given away for free.
