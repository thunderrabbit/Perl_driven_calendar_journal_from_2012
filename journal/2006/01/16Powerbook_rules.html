<p>On my Macintosh Powerbook Rules, there is a power key.  If I press
it, a dialog box pops up and asks if I want to Restart, Sleep, Cancel,
or Shutdown.  Now, arguably, the Cancel option should be placed after
Shutdown, to but <b>a dialog box pops up.</b></p>

<p>I love my Macintosh.  I will never buy a Windows Sucks machine
again.</p>
