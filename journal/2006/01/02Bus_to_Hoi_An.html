<p>In Tien Sa (sea port near Da Nang) now, on the taxi-van with Petra,
Nick, Laura, Phil, Carla, Maruan, IKellie, Daniel, &amp; Lisa, and our
driver, Gn.  We're headed to Hoi An for 80,000 VND per person.  I plan
to find Tam (with a ^ over her 'a') who said she will remember me.</p>

<p>I took zero pictures on the way to Hoi An.  It was about an hour
drive, and basically everything looked the same as 6 months ago.
Traffic consisted mostly of motor scooters and bicycles with some cars
and occassional large trucks or buses to shake things up a bit.</p>

<p>People have amazingly big things on their vehicles... bicycles with
stacks of super long bamboo, motor scooters with washing machines..  a
small cage with three dogs in it, facing opposite directions and
unable to move.  I saw a cage filled with ducks chillin' on the back
of a bike.</p>

<p>Lots of marble carvings of pieces from Marble Mountain.  At one
point our driver pulled into a parking lot with a lot of marble, and
was like, "this is Hoi An."  We laughed slash said "no" and he backed
up and drove us to the real Hoi An without further incident.</p>
