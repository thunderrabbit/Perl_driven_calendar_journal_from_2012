<p>Well.</p>

<p>I feel sad, foolish, and optimistic.</p>

<p>This was the night we ate dinner in Yacht Club in Namibia, I
remarked on a huge crane with like 64 tires and hugemongous feet to
lift all those tires off the ground and 130 tons of counterweights on
the crane, she was like, "you're such a boy," (and I agreed), and
walked on the port to see if the Panamax ship was in fact longer than
Topaz (it isn't, really), watched the crane on the ship pick
containers off trucks and the guys affix feet to the containers, and
discussed how everything worked, and marveled at the 30 ton stones cut
out of a quarry, walked toward town and tried to take a picture of Rei
at 5TH RD and 5TH ST (but Hitomi's camera doesn't focus properly after
its day at the sand dunes), and incredibly enjoyed sitting together
down by the sea, watching three seals swiming forth and back along the
shore, with their funny breathing patterns, swimming upside down,
occasionally so close that Rei could *almost* touch them, and then we
started to <em>talk</em>, and I took the big plunge and told Rei that
I basically expected Hitomi to meet me at Yokohama port, and I wasn't
sure what I would do if/when that happened.</p>

<p>I told Rei my biggest fear is that she'll become another casualty
in my relationship landscape, and my second biggest fear is that
she'll hear about my issues and bail out.</p>

<p>She didn't bail.  But she agreed with my realization that we
should stop being so close, and that I need to handle stuff with
Hitomi no matter what else, and I shouldn't get involved with anyone
while I'm still confuzzled with someone.</p>

<p>At one point I said I needed alone time, during which time I
intended to cry then go to bed, but we continued to talk through it
and things were somehow made optimistic in the end.</p>
