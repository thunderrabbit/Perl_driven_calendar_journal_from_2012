<p class="date">2:58pm EAT Saturday 21 January 2006</p>

<p>Pretty good day today in Fighting Goats; we had 5 people do
show-n-tell, which they really seem to enjoy.   We practiced the
games for GET Language Olympics, and they did well with them,
especially charades!</p>

<p>I quickly checked Ann and Eye's diaries and returned the books to
their rooms.</p>

<p>I just sorted out a schedule for open lessons for next term, to be
covered by me, Carl, Maruan, Liz and Kellie.  I can see how managing
schedules as a job would be a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to whiz, then zip up to Yacht Club to get a
snack, then to Carl and Tony's rap workshop, then to Chat With; I'm
covering for Nick, who covered for me recently.</p>
