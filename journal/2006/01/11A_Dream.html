<p class="dream">I walked by Kelly's room and discovered I could see
into the crew area where the passenger was being disembarked to a
different ship.  I opened the door to get a better view, and stepped
one foot inside to get a much better view.  A woman walked by and was
all, "you can't be in here," but I stayed for a bit longer.  She was
like, "seriously; it's better for you to be in a different crew area
for an hour than to be here for a minute."</p>

<p class="dream">I wondered why this could be true; perhaps because
there was so much activity here, the chances of being caught were
that much higher.</p>
