<p>Good two hour nap, then upstairs to Hemingway to pay for a brownie
to be consumed tomorrow night.  I used some of the ideas in Dale
Carnegie's book, and that seemed to help, though I can't say for
sure...  The bartender (Reyna) said it was impossible, but then after
I apologized for even asking and causing trouble, asking her therefore
not to do it, she came around to saying she would do it because she
had never heard of such a request (pay now, eat later) before.</p>

<p>I used Carl's card to pay for it, and paid him $10 cash.</p>
