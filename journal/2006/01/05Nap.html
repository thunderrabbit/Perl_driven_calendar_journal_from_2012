<p>Worked a bit on my curriculum, felt out of sorts, read my book,
felt out of sorts, wrote first-class-invites to my students, felt out
of sorts, ate a snack, felt out of sorts, got my laundry done, felt
out of sorts, and now I'm about to take a nap.</p>

<p>I'm close to uncovering something hidden in my brain.</p>

<p>For a while, I followed my breath in meditation, then fell
asleep.</p>
