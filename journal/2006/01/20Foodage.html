<p>Chowed breakfast with the girls across the hall and shared cameras
to scope all the pics from our recent adventures.  Rei taught me two
new words,</p>

<p>こむ and ひょう which mean "to arrange" and "graph" or "grid" or
"leopard", respectively.  I was trying to ask her if she wanted to go
get the schedule and plan our respective days.</p>

<p>よていひょう何とか何とか</p>
