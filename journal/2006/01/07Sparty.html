<p>Spa Party = Sparty</p>

<p>SO</p>

<p>Much</p>

<p>Laughter.</p>

<p>We had 12 people in the 4 person hot tub.  Then the bubbles turned
off.  More people got in.  Then the water began to drain, and we were
all trying to squish down to keep the water up.....</p>

<p>At the party thingie I chatted with Erica, who I was unable to say
much about at the see-how-much-you-don't-know meeting with CCs and
GETs.  I still don't know much about her, but she asked me about my U2
concert T, and I told her the story of having "Bust A Move" by Young
MC and playing it over the phone to Sam Malone who played it over the
air live, and then how I won free basketball tickets, cheered for them
on the air, but then out of the studio said I couldn't go, and was
offered PopMart tour tickets for U2.</p>

<p>Told Rei and Erica that story, plus how the band came out of the
lemon as the audience went apeshit and how Bono got a girl out of the
audience and sang to her and put his head in her lap while
singing....</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Carl told us the story of missing a week of school to drive various
vehicles in a chain of good will and good friends for a trek from
perhaps Virginia to Tampa, Florida just to see a show from that U2
tour.</p>
