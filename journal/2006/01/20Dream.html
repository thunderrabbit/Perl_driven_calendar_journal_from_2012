<p class="dream">Sitting in an audience, three performers did a funky
walk onto the stage, though the first one came on and was doing some
contact juggling with what looked like a wadded up ball of newsprint,
but I later noticed it was full of buckshot, to give it some mass for
him to work with.</p>

<p class="dream">The other two guys came in together and were doing a
little chant that sounded like the backup vocals in "The Lion Sleep
Tonight," before the lead vocalist starts.</p>

<p class="dream">The contact juggler guy was also doing some magic by
making other balls appear in his contact-juggling right hand, while
his left hand was behind his back, like a well-mannered butler. With
the two balls, he made his hand look like a frog puppet (Kermit,
without the mitt) with the two balls for eyes on the top/back of the
guy's hand.  A third ball appeared in the frog's mouth, and I was
really impresed with this guy's contact juggling skills and set myself
a task to remember to tell Fred about him because he would appreciate
it.  Then I began to wake up.</p>
