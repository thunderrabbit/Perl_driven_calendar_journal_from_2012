<p>Got some shizzle done todizzle, especially the Mombazzle Chazzle
Prizzle.  Right nizzle, my calendazzle be locked in GET rizzle
tizzle, but just gotsta eazle in Topazzle.</p>

<p>I'm in charge of printing the Mobassa Challenge Program workbook
once it's all laid out.  That will pretty much be easily done, given
the suggestion by Petra to do the resizing on computer instead of
with the copy machine.  That just assumes that I will be able to use
Microsoft Windows sucks programs.</p>

<p>I have now met all of my students, and have come to the clear
conclusion, the girls who I thought were higher than the others
actually need lower level material.  Not sure what happened, but the
M class is able to handle higher level stuff than the N class.</p>
