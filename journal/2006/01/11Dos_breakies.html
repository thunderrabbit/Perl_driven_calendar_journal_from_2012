<p>Went up to Yacht Club for breakfast, and sat by Yuki out on the
back deck.  Kellie came by and sat with us.  Talked about the weather,
which has been basically cloudy, except for the day Peter Band had
their performance on top deck, and the night Yuki, Rei and I scoped
the stars.</p>

<p>Yuki came to the table with her tea and spilled a bit due to the
rockiness of the ship, uneven floor, and wind then she got sidetracked
inside for a bit and left her tea abandoned, so when I was leaving, I
carried it in to her, but she happened to be on the way out just at
that time.  I gave it to her, and wondered what it would mean if more
was spilled.  But she balanced the forces to a net normal force
relative to the inner lower surface of the cup.</p>

<p>Downstairs I worked on my curriculum a bit, and hated Microsoft
because I couldn't use [enter] to make carriage returns below an
image.  Turns out I had to type visible characters first, and then
that apparently switched from picture moving mode to text mode.</p>

<p>The one *good* thing though - I was <em>relatively</em> easily able
to draw arrows that pointed up to some lines above.  I can't do that
easily in html.</p>

<p>Went downstairs to get info on Mombassa Challenge Program, and
found myself drawn to Topaz Dining, where I found Kellie chillin' with
members of Peter Band.  They were just leaving, so I quickly asked
Eric if I could get Swahili lyrics of a simple song from him.  Told
him we want to pre-teach the song to the students so when they teach
it, the students will basically already know it.</p>

<p>Ate breakfast (omletted eggs with edamame, sausage weinie, salad,
something, and two glasses of orange juice), as Kellie and I said HI
to Ley (one of the staff), then Karen and Rie on my way out.</p>

<p>Meeting Karen in a moment to scan docs from Mombassa Challenge
Program.</p>
