<p>At the hotel alone now with Carla's $20 safety net in case Tam
doesn't show up to take me to Tien Sa.  I hope she does, - that will
be a nice deepening of our friendship.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>At 1:15, Tam hadn't arrived, so I walked back to her house and
found her there.  She said she could not take me, but that her husband
would.  I wondered if that would have been communicated to me had I
not come to her house.. I asked her how much (hoping for the offer of
free, but still with the intention of paying a decent amount) and she
asked for whatever amount I had paid yesterday.</p>

<p>When I inquired about the price of sandals, it was apparently the
case these were higher quality sandals, and therefore worth 100,000
dong.  Had Tam been there at the time I ordered them, I could have
gotten the 60,000 dong version.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>It seems fishy, but I really wanna think that the changes were pure
of heart.</p>

<p>Paid the remaining 50,000 dong and rode in basic thankful happy
silence behind her husband and 6-ish year old son on the motor
scooter.  Didn't take many pictures, but they are all in my mind.. the
close calls, the pretty Vietnamese dresses on girls on bicycles, and
the wide variety of things carried...  Gave him $8, and forgot my bag
for <em>almost</em> long enough to be relieved of its company.</p>

<p>Ran back and caught him before he left.  I trust it was
unintentional.</p>

<p>Repaid Carla with $12 and 1000 yen.</p>
