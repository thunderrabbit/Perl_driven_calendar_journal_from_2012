<p>Aight.  I'm ready for the first day.  Gots all my books in a row,
and pretty much know what all I will do, starting with leaving the
classroom to show them the GET Board.  That will be a good start.</p>

<p>We will work on introducing ourselves and introducing friends.
I'll introduce Francois.</p>
