<p class="date">9:32am SAST Sunday 29 January 2006</p>

<p>I woke up this morning after a single sleep cycle and went up to
eat breakfast in Yacht Club.  I stayed there until they closed,
hoping the 3029 girls would come up, but they never did.  I wonder if
they are still sleepin'.</p>

<p>Today was supposed to be Walvis Bay day 1 of 2, but because we were
late arriving in Cape Town, we left late, which has pushed this back;
we'll arrive at 6am tomorrow and have just one day instead of two.</p>

<p>Oh, so that means I have nothing written on my schedule today.
I'm going to nap now for another sleep cycle, then probably do
productive stuff:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>clear my bed</p></li>

<li><p>* type the Opens curriculum for the first 6 days</p></li>

<li><p>* plan my first open lesson</p></li>

<li><p>plan my second open lesson</p></li>

<li><p>perhaps write post cards</p></li>

<li><p>* coordinate a brownie date with Rei for her 10500th day
tomorrow.</p></li>

<li><p>plan Fighting Goats curriculum</p></li>

<li><p>augment my iPhoto webpage writer thing</p></li>

<li><p>* set up URLs to put pics in my journal</p></li>

<li><p>put images into my journal entries</p></li>
</ol>
