<p>Have just come down to GET Street after being up at Namihei's third
attempt at their Grand Opening after the first two were rained out.  I
(and many others) danced a lot.. over an hour; my feet feel a bit raw
from the surface upon which I was dancing.  It's no-slip platic mat
stuff.  Good for not slipping.</p>

<p>I've got a bruise on the inside of my wrist from jumping and
swinging like a monkey from the roof support. (*)</p>

<p>(*) Several times.</p>
