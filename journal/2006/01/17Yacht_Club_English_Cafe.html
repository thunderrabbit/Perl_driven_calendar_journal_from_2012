<p class="date">5:01pm EAT Tuesday 17 January 2006</p>

<p>English Cafe was pretty good; Lisa and I had several people there;
we basically had two simultaneous coversations about various topics.
I tried to stay centered on animals as a topic (safari tomorrow and
past and current pets); I heard Lisa talking about a variety of
things.</p>

<p>I checked all Fighting Goats' diaries today and wrote a bit in the
class diary as myself and a bit as Francois.  His first written
material.  Something like, "I am Francois I like pictures with
passengers Pictures with me are cute." written with my left hand kinda
messy and shit.</p>
