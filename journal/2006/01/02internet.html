<p>Kellie and I just got our internet fix.  I read and replied to
exactly one email: Paige's.  Kellie found out her blog is editable,
but not viewable.  That bites.  It's on blogspot, one of the bigger,
more stable communities, I thought.</p>

<p>Once I logged off, I realized I hadn't responded to Paige's direct
questions, though I did comment on her other points.</p>

<p>Magically, internet was free.</p>
