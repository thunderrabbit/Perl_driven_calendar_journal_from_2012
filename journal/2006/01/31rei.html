<p>I cried.  I don't know why.  It's not for losing her; it's for
having to grow up.  It's for breaking old habits; it's for breaking
out into a new world of loving, open, clear relationships.</p>

<p>I went upstairs to give Kyoko the lesson plan for the Open we'll
be doing tomorrow (she'll be my CC).  Said HI to Rei, and everything
was okay.  All the angst is in my head.</p>
