<p>Stayed up probably too late tonight, but I enjoyed sitting with Rei
in GET Room 8, helping her transcribe a movie about refugees in South
Africa.  I learned a bit about the problem, and what is/not being done
about it.</p>

<p>I also worked a little on trying to write a local perl script that
will write a .shtml for a directory of images on my site.</p>
