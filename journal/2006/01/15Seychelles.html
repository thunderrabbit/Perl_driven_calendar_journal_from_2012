<p>Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands basically east of
Madagascar.  We stopped on Mahe at Port Victoria for a total of like
11 hours, giving us about 8.5 hours to explore.  Therefore, I did not
allow any time in an internet cafe.  (( Mombassa is an overnight port,
and only three days away, so I'll wait.  Although I will be basically
busy during our stay, I assume I'll be able to get to a cafe. ))</p>

<p>Today we walked to the main part of town, but most things were
closed cause it's a Sunday.  Took a taxi to "the beach," "which
beach?" "we don't know," and ended up where everyone else ended up:
Buffalo, er, make that "Beau Vallon" I believe.  We were dropped off
just several meters from the beach and even fewer meters from a dive
shop, so we immediately got hooked up with snorkling and scuba diving
utensils.   $10 to snorkel (with $100 deposit) and $50 to dive.
Glynis (sp) is quite friendly and immediately learned my name, which made
me smile inside.</p>

<p>I met Paul, an experienced diver who lives in the area, and he
gave me a few tips and stories as we waited for everyone to get their
shiznit together.</p>

<p>14 divers, 3 dive masters went out on our little adventure to Group
Point (I think) and dove in two groups of 6 plus a dive master, and 2
in buddy system, then 1 person to move the boat to our pickup location.</p>

<p>I dove alone-ish, mostly tagging along well behind our group.
Didn't keep up cause I was caught up in taking pictures of Francois
with fish.  I had a bit of trouble going down, though we used the
anchor rope.  I got down to perhaps 15 meters.  Used 150 bars of air
in about 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Found myself floating up near the end of the dive, though I had
released all the air from my vest (and hadn't dropped my weights, or
anything) ...  My theory is that since I only had 50 bar left in my
tank, it was super floatier than it had been.</p>

<p>I had some sinus blockage problems near the end, which turned out
to be loads of blood from my sinuses.  Once I was back on the boat, I
spat out gobs of blood snorted out the back of my sinus.  Nice.</p>

<p>Found Carla, Laura and Lisa at the end of their meal and I cleaned
up the remains of Laura's lunch.  Hung out on the beach watching some
beach boys do gymnastics.  They seemed obviously self-taught.</p>

<p>Once we had about 1.25 hours until boarding limit, Nick, Phil and I
began heading back.  Glynnis (sp) drew a flawless map for us.  I
walked barefoot back to the port (3 kilometers); Nick and Phil paired
up with GET T girls and hitched rides.</p>

<p>On my way back, I met Freda, who gave me fried bread fruit slices;
also met Rie who gave me some black currant drink, and Rie's friend
who gave me some cookies.  I gave them some of the bread fruit.</p>
