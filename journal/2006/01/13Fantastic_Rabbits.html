<p>Nice class with Fantastic Rabbits; we started with a discussion of
English signs on the ship, and when Angelina asked where we could find
"Emergency Escape Breathing Device" on a sign, I thought we could work
on giving directions to go find it.  I gave them directions to where I
knew we could find an EEBD, and sent them to it.  Then had one of
them give directions back to our room.</p>

<p>Finished going through the signs they had written down, and then
had a bit of a field trip as different people gave directions to
different places.  Down on third floor there was a lot of crew traffic
as they carried various things various places, but were always polite
with us as we basically got out of the way.</p>

<p>In the last ten minutes of class, we zipped through some
prepositions on a slideshow made by Petra, then it was 9:26, one
minute past the time to escape. (*)</p>

<p>(*) Escape is a verb that basically all Japanese know.  There
wasn't actually an emergency.</p>
