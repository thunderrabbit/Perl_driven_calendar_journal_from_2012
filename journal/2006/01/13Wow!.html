teacher tonight in Topaz Dining!!  I wasn't really happy with my seat
for most of the meal; I was with some random passengers, none of whom
seemed willing to talk, and I sure wasn't willing to talk, and I saw
lots of GET Ts come in after I did, so I could have sat with
them..  But, in the end, people started talking and I disclosed my
neighborhood and one woman perked up and told me she's a teacher at
the International Lounge, and turns out she teaches Erick!  We got a
picture together that I may send to him via her.</p>
