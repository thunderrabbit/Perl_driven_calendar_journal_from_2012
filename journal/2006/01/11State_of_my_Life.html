<h1>State of My Life Address:</h1>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>GET Classes have started; we've done three days of lessons, and
today was a day "off" to catch up on lesson planning or whatever.</p></li>

<li><p>My M class called themselves Fantastic Rabbits.  There were
five students for the first two days: George, Kelly, Alice, Michelle,
Carol.  (I had each student give themselves English names.)  On the
third day two more students came: Angelina (who looks a bit like Ms
Jolie) and Nikki.  I've heard rumors that one or both of them will not
stay in the class, but they are just rumors and speculation.</p>

<li><p>My N class called themselves Fighting Goats.  Six female
students: Jerry, Emily, Carol, Sugar, Eye, and Ann.</p>

<p>They are nearly as shy as my shy girl class from last voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm caught up on all my primary tasks of preparing and
teaching lessons.</p></li>

<li><p>Ain't spent no money; ain't kissed no women on the ship.</p>

<p>Those are not meant to be double negatives; I really haven't done
either.</p></li>

<li><p>I have, however, flirted a bit with a woman in Yacht Club,
whose name I can't necessarily spell correctly in English, but I
think it's something like Alyona.</p></li>

<li><p>We three in 3027 have gone on one triple date with the three
girls in 3029, and will give them another letter tonight. (the one
requesting numeric 'data')</p></li>

<li><p>Today was the first nicely sunny day on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>So far, we've been to Singapore and Vietnam.</p></li>

<li><p>All the ports past this will be new for me.</p></li>

<li><p>I've got 1/2 of one chapter left in _Xenocide_.</p></li>
