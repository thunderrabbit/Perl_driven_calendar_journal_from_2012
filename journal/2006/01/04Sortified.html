<p>Got our classes hashed out; very few changes past what we had done
already.  I'm quite pleased that I've got 5 and 6 students in my
classes; I enjoy smaller numbers of students instead of larger (so
long as they are whole numbers).</p>

<p>I haven't been super productive on my curriculum, but I think I'll
bang on that a bit more tonight.</p>

<p>After sorting, we had a quick GET Meeting in the Sunshine Bar, and
then Nick and Matt simultaneously threw each other into the pool after
one or both of them had been (play?) threatening to toss Sachie into
the pool.</p>

<p>I had a quick roommate meeting with Carl and Dan; I had heard a
rumor that the girls hadn't understood the hilarity of our notes, but
they got confirmation that they have decided on a technique of RSVP,
and it's all good.</p>

<p>Ran down to the GET Office to do a final swaparoo (Carl said the
guy who had requested a low class told Carl that he didn't want it to
be *that* low, so I swapped him back from my class to Carl's) and
*now* my classes are set.</p>
