<p>My N Class has named themselves Fighting Goats, because the name
sorta sounds like 52 in English and Japanese.  I love it cause it's
so random!</p>

<p>Fighting Goats did really well today; they all presented pictures
in front of class, and I gave them a mass of homework - basically
talking to crew / staff and introducing friends, etc.  And learn what
TSS means.</p>

<p>I just ate a bit of a snack in Yacht Club for Tea Time, and have
already gotten my shiznit ready for tomorrow's classes.  Oh, and Carl
asked if I have room for one more student.  I was like, "if she's cool
with coming to class at 8am!"  She said it was cool.  Her name is
Tamami.  I told her we have English names in class and she immediately
said Angelina.  I immediatelly saw the resemblence between Tamami and
Ms Jolie.</p>

<p>About to go upstairs now and join the djambe (sp) circle.</p>
