<p>Have had a pretty productive day; finished my laundry: Francois is
hanging by a noose to dry, and my shorts are being worn by the
circular air vent on the ceiling with the legs all pinned closed so
they're like an air mattress, plus underwear and shirts are hanging
in the normal manner.</p>

<p>Have also scanned the old Mombassa CP papers and gotten some
Swahili lyrics to a song we can teach on the CP.</p>

<p>Haven't finished my curriculum for tomorrow, but I think I have
enough stuff to pull something together in realtime if I don't look
at it again tonight.</p>

<p>Going now to catch the last half of a photography speaker, being
translate in part by Rei.</p>
