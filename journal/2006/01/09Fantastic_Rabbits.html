<p>I've just finished Fantastic Rabbits' second class today.
Basically, we signed the class agreement and then everyone decided on
one thing to teach about for 15 or 30 minutes.  George seemed the most
hesitant, but he will teach us about Rapa Nui.  Kelly will give us a
30 minute tour of the ship.  Alice will teach us about viruses.
Michelle, who is now the governor-general of NZ, given that there is
no NZ president, will teach about Cairns.  Carol will teach about
Japanese Archery.</p>

<p>Yay Fabulous Rabbits!</p>

<p>oops, Fantastic Rabbits!</p>
