<p>Today traveling around Cape Town has been amazing.  The wind, the
waves, the sun, the sea spray, the rocking of the ship..... All these
factors together have come to one conclusion: we haven't docked
yet.</p>

<p>At this point, we are 10.5 hours late, and have been circling
around the southern tip of Africa.</p>

<p>I had planned on climbing Table Mountain with Nick and Maruan, then
uploading my journal entries, Rob Updates, checking email, and
hopefully uploading pictures.</p>

<p>Instead, I woke up at 7, and noticed the ship was still
rocking.  <em>I thought we were supposed to be docked by 7...</em>
When they made two announcements of "don't go out onto the top deck,"
I immediately jumped out of bed to go out onto the top deck.  Whatever
they don't want us to experience must at least be worthy of checking
out.</p>

<p>It's really not all that bad.  We've had far worse (better)
rocking than this, and higher winds...  It must just be that the port
in Cape Town isn't protected by an island to keep the waves from
slamming boats against the dock.</p>

<p>Ate breakfast in Yacht Club, during which time I asked Joel for
his prediction on the day, right after he said he had no idea what to
expect.  He said he guessed we would be docked by noon.</p>

<p>People were like, "we <em>have</em> to dock..."</p>

<p>I assured them we do not.  "The captain's number one priority is to
keep us safe and alive.  Number 2 is to get us where we are supposed
to go."</p>

<p>Went to the top of Yacht Club to see what we could see and ended
up napping next to Carla after Yuki, Rei, and Dan all went to
Hemingway to get a snack.</p>

<p>Came inside and watched _Le Marche du Emperor_, a French movie
watching a couple years in the lives of emperor penguins.  It was
dubbed over in Japanese, and had a few interesting bits. </p>

<p>Ate lunch with Rei and others, then chatted with her out on the
front deck in Naho's favorite quiet spot where she would sit
meditatively on the 49th voyage.</p>

<p>We sat for a couple hours sharing histories and herstories and
decided Slow and Low is the tempo.</p>

<p>At 5:30 all the leaders who had things scheduled for today or
tomorrow started meeting in Winjammer to figure out what's what for
scheduling.  I'm not in that group.</p>

<p>Rei is back from the meeting:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>we're not going to dock anytime soon</p></li>

<li><p>'they' say the wind is even more dramatic close to the port</p></li>

<li><p>there is rumor of a forest fire fanned by winds, and we can
see brown haze near the port</p>

<p>Dined with Rei at a two person table in Topaz, right next to the
table with Carla across from Dan and Yuki across from Stacy, while
Carl was next to Lee Hirsch at the next table over.</p>

<p>At everything then took a nap for a bit while she was at a CC
meeting.  Watched _Blue Horizon_, a surf movie that Stacy offered for
a little slumber party movie thing in my old room.  I scritched and
massaged Rei's back; Carl sprawled out on Carla's bed as she slept
through the whole movie; Yuki's bed was put up so she and Stacy sat on
the floor against the dresser.</p>

<p>Amazing cinematography.</p>

<p>I'm nearly done with the image filename changer.  It used to break
with multiple pages of files.  Now I just need to rename the main
page index.html
