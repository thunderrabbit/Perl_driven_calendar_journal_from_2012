<p>Today Carl and I took a train to Little India, and he treated me to
lunch at a vegetarian buffet restaurant.  We chowed until we couldn't
possibly eat much more, then worked on some post cards.  Misata,
Maiko, and Rei happened by, and were walking away when I ran to the
door to encourage them in.  The manager was quite smiley thankful for
that, and the girls seemed to enjoy the meal as well!</p>

<p>They chatted in high speed Japanese that I pretty much couldn't
keep up with, but could get some of the words.  I showed them the
postcards that Hitomi printed for me from Palestine, and it made me
remember that I need/want to do some sort of presentation on PB.</p>

<p>I got a bit more dessert and then we walk walk walked to Arab
Street and then to the big Merlion near the water.  We got some funny
Francois pictures!  The funniest by far were of him flying next to
variou signs or over the water fountain.</p>

<p>We saw Xiangrun!  He was near the big Merlion, and I tossed
Francois to Xiangrun over the little Merlion for a photo.  My second
toss went a bit short, and Francois took a dive.</p>

<p>Met Jenny and Wing from Hong Kong after I took a pic for them with
the big Merlion in the background.  Carl and I traded email addresses
with them.</p>

<p>They were like, "email us before 95 days, or we will forget you!"
I emailed them my Rob Update; we'll see what happens.</p>
