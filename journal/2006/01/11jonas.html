<p>Had a 2 hour all English session with Jonas G-something, of
Zimbabwe, who has been working for unconditional, complete and
immediate debt cancellation for (African) countries, plus gender
equality issues in a way that sounded quite similar to my men's
group.</p>

<p>I asked if his organization worked with other organizations around
the world and was somewhat saddened by his answer that most of the
other "men's groups" he had found were not groups that meshed with
what his organization was trying to do.  He cited a group of fathers
in London who have been characterized as doing public performances to
try and win (partial) custody of their children.</p>

<p>I will email him info on <a href="http://mkp.org">Mankind
Project</a>.</p>

<p>The first portion of his talk, about debt reduction was nearly
putting me to sleep, but the gender issue stuff woke me up.</p>
