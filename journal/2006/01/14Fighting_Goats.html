<p>Pretty sortof okay class with Fighting Goats.  I dropped the level
down to a far easier grammar and did plenty of....  I guess I didn't
give enough examples, or maybe I need to to drills...  Actually it's
like three of the girls are totally on and totally getting it, and
three of them are totally quiet and I totally don't know if they are
not getting it, if they are just "shy" or if they can't think of
examples.</p>

<p>I despise doing drills, and I'm prettttty sure they don't need
them.  I can't really imagine putting them the three chatty ones
through drills, but I may have to resort to that just to get people
talking.   Maybe a die with a word to fill in the blank.  I can make
a die with paper or just ... oh I can use one of my tigger boxes
inside out.</p>

<p>Up on the top deck we were describing the weather, which I thought
would be easy enough, and would wake them up.  Nice and breezy to
whisk away all contaminants so I tried to fart but was like, "whups;
that's not a fart" and stopped everything just in time.</p>
