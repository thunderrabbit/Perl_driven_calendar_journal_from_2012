<p>The watertight door just closed; I think we will be leaving
Singapore soon.</p>

<p class="date">6:39am</p>

<p>We haven't left yet, although the refueling ship has just recently
left our side.  I'm about to go upstairs to see what I can see.</p>

<p class="date">7:43am</p>

<p>We must have just started to move as I was writing the text above.
I got some hopefully unusual pics of Singapore (at least from PB
perspective) in that they were at dawn in Singapore, and near a port
but with very few people on deck.</p>

<p>I also got a pic of the *first* gondola (hanging cable car) coming
out of the gondola station.  But they sent just three cars out each
direction and then stopped sending more cars out...</p>
