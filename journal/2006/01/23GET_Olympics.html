<p>GET Olympics were pretty darn fun today!  Kellie and I were the
yellow team, Yellow Monkeys!, so I tied a tail to my shorts, and at
one point during the events, we were in second place.  But we lost one
of the charades, "Ironing Clothes," so that probably knocked us back
some.</p>

<p>I was quick to jump into the pool afterwards; the waves were
really rockin' and fun fun fun!</p>

<p>Needed to get ready for Charity Auction, so I jumped out of the
pool pretty soon thereafter.</p>
