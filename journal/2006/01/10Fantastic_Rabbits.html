<p>Had a fantastic class with Fantastic Rabbits today!  Had two new
students, Nikki and Angelina; I didn't coddle them much, but let the
other students give examples of what I wanted: English name, country,
profession, and then what topic they will teach and when.</p>

<p>Then I had them talk about why the joined GET, and then ways to
accomplish those goals, which I knew would be "meet people and
practice English."  Gave them homework of freestyle talking to two
people from different countries, plus one other person as a bonus,
plus discover when/why PB started.</p>

<p>Then I was like, "you guys wanna do a class project?" and they were
like yeah yeah and I had them brainstorm what they would do.  Soon
enough they had come up with people to play the characters of a
classic Japanese play with a PB twist.  Peach Boy on PB.  Nice.</p>

<p>I was like, "do you want to plan it now?"</p>

<p>"Now?"  As if I had something else planned.</p>

<p>"Yeah... this is freestyle teaching; I have very few plans.  You
guys are driving this class.  I'm just the .. uh, security
officer."</p>

<p>Planning <em>Peach Boy</em> took up the whole rest of the class and
they will do more for homework, it seems.  Next class (break tomorrow)
we will probably start nailing down some lines with them doing the
writing and me as the grammar cleanup crew.</p>

<p>I think all seven students will quit bouncing around the GET
classes and stay with Fantastic Rabbits!</p>
