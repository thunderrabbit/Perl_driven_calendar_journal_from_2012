<p>Just at pork ribs lunch with Kellie, Lisa, Laura.. big fun with a
huge moth parked by my head and the rain squall Kellie identified a
couple minutes before it sent the people in back of the boat scurrying
"like rats," said Kellie, and Lisa was mockingly, "they're people too,
with names and families..." We joked about the amount of food we had
stuck in our teeth; bones and corn and sauce on our faces.  Too bad we
were in public, or it woulda been <em>really</em> messy.</p>

<p>I thought about janette and food antics.</p>
