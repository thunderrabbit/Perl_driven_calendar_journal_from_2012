<p class="dream">Taking part in an art project of sorts, a guy did a
project every Wednesday to revive a tradition that had been previously
shut down due to getting a bit out of hand.  His idea this week was
being given to groups as they happened to arrive; he didn't want to
get caught by having a bunch of people all come at once; he preferred
to teach people a couple at a time.  He told the idea with great
enthusiasm: Find someplace in the city where we have to park our cars
on a corner, with the wheels turned.  Then get five people to sit in
the drivers seat, one at a time and take pictures of each one.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, "aight; let's get to work" and was
directing people to sit in a chair and taking pictures of them.  They
didn't seem to have the idea down; they didn't know to actuallly move
the butts and put a new butt in the same position, so I had to explain
that again, but then once they got it, the energy was building up, and
I was like, "okay, the sixth person go find a new place to sit."</p>

<p class="dream">Pepe was like, "pick me pick me!" and I did, but he
then couldn't think of a place to sit, so I chose Petra, who was
already seated and ready.</p>

<p class="dream">Pepe said he understood why I hadn't chosen him, but
I was thinking we should put Francois in some of the pictures.  The
energy started to die down, and as I woke up, I remembered we hadn't
taken into consideration that we were supposed to park on a
corner.</p>

<p class="dream">Once we had taken the first set of pictures, Matt
walked by and we had to talk to him to see how much longer we had
available.</p>

<p class="dream">Petra went out to talk to him after getting her photo
taken.</p>
