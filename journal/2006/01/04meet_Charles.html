<p>Just got back from all-English session with Charles, the Executive
Driver (actually Director) of Second Harvest Japan, aka Food Bank.</p>

<p>I didn't know that most of the 'homeless' in Tokyo are not
ex-salarymen, but day-laborers, who reached 55 years old and can no
longer work (or their job market dried up).</p>

<p>He recalibrated my brain which had been thinking I could just live
off the free food from his organization when he said they only give
food once per week.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p>I asked if financially poor people in Japan were friendlier than
the working class.  He said they were.</p>

<p>After Carl's question, we learned that it's better to be homeless
in Japan than the US, unless one wants to change their status, then
the US has more resources for climbing out of the job/homeless
hole.</p>

<p>Maruan asked questions about Charles' military service, spiritual
belief, voting record, and if he was a fatalist.  I didn't quite get
why, but it's all good.</p>

<p>Mary, Charles' 12(?) year old daughter, who is quite wonderfully
bilingual (at least), came in for a bit and answered a couple of
questions.  She wants to be a singer/actress in Hollywood; she didn't
want to come on PB before she was on, and now she doesn't want to get
off.</p>
