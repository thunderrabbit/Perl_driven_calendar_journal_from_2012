<p>In Des a Mis restaurant in Hoi An now.  This was Laura's
suggestion, I believe, after we checked in at a hotel (also Laura's
suggestion).</p>

<p>This restaurant is between the 2 bridges, and facing the river,
from the big bridge, just past the market brimming with veggies, fish,
and motor scooters.</p>

<p>The portions were delicious and far far huger than I could eat, and
I wished I had had my tupperware container to toss it into my
backpack.</p>

<p class="date">1:23pm</p>

<p>Dan and I were cleanup crew for a lot of the food, which was as
delicious as ample.</p>

<p>We sat across the table from each other, and all food seemed to
migrate our direction.  Magic, that.</p>
