<p>Nikki (Etsuko, I think), who came to Fantastic Rabbits yesterday
to scope it out, did not come today.  I hope she finds a class that's
perfect for her.</p>

<p>Angelina (Tamami) came back, and was quite well-synched with the
class.</p>

<p>Looks like Fantastic Rabbits will have a fantastic GET program!</p>

<p>Today we talked about some good and bad points about PB, a
discussion that was a bit out of their reach.  I told them the reason
for the topic: we can help guide PB, the organization, helping choose
how things are run, etc.</p>

<p>Then we had a simpler discussion of how we'd like to use English
during the voyage.  They would like to do the Peach Boy performance,
and I am thrilled to hear they all want to join the speech contest on
24 March!  George was peer pressured into it, but I am sure it will
be great for him.</p>
