<p>Got back from Vietnam today.  I hope this is apparent, but I'm
writing it because I haven't written anything here about Vietnam yet.
Been too busy working on my curriculum, laughing with Carl and working
on our funny idea:</p>

<p>We're going to invite the girls across the hall on a triple date,
by placing three invitations under their door.  The first one is
printed in a curlicue font:</p>


<pre>
             Your Majesty of the Infinite Blue Sea,


Joy blossoms from the hearts of all those graced by your presence.

            If thy beauty and spirit allow, please accompany
           thine ardent admirer from the humble 3027th abode
            
                        Saturday
                    January Seventh
                    Two-thousand Six
                    at Seven O'clock
                     in the evening
                    in the Yacht Club
            
            
                    Faithfully Yours,

</pre>

<p>The second one will be hand written, something like,</p>

<p class="dream">Hey you, :-)
<br /> I know you're probably busy, but if you have time to meet up
for dinner the day after Singapore, I'd be delighted!  7pm in the
Yacht Club,
<br />
<br />XOXO  RSVP  3027</p>

<p>And the third will be written in crayon or marker:</p>

<pre>
Do you like me?

[ ] YES

[ ] NO

[ ] MAYBE (find out in Yacht Club)
</pre>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We are so hilarious!!  We will not specify which one is for/from
which person.  Just good fun.</p>
