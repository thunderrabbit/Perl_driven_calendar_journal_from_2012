<p>Super special thanks to Karen's friend Luke for taking a day off
to cart us around and for watching our bags while we swam.</p>

<p>Carl: "Now I think I know what it was like back when people first
got here.  Just walkin' around with the animals."</p>

<p>Rob: "Yeh." (after some thought: "def.")</p>

<p>Penguins were just chillin' out on this beach and on the rocks and
swimming in the water in little penguin herds of like 10 to 30
animals.  Every time we walked gently by them, they generally took
little notice, unless we were less than a meter away, which was
sometimes unavoidable due to the placement of the water, rocks and
penguins.</p>

<p>They seemed to walk aimlessly at times, though mostly they just
lay on the rocks, sunbathing in tuxedos.</p>

<p>The water was a bit colder than my preference, but became
acceptable with just a bit of exercise.  Lee had asked if brought a
swimsuit; I hadn't, so he was like, "just swim in your shorts."  I
knew how long they would take to dry; he was like, "just swim in your
briefs.  This is Africa [no one will care]."</p>

<p>Africa.  South Africa, to be more precise.  European as anything,
save for the townships of poor black Africans who are still crammed
into corrugated tin buildings from Apartheid.</p>

<p>Climbing on the rocks reminded me so much of Hawaii and California.
Moreso of California, plus the landscape looks just like highway 1
just north of Santa Monica.  I literally surprised myself when I
realized I was *not* in California.  <em>Holy shit this
is <b>Africa!</b></em></p>

<p>Other people were around, but the only people who cared what I
wore were the voices in my mind, plus I figured I would appreciate
having had the experience of swimming in my briefs with penguins in
South Africa.</p>

<p>I'm really bummed that I didn't bring my underwater camera or
swim goggles.  I had no *idea* I would have a chance to swim!
Especially not in such beautiful water!!</p>
