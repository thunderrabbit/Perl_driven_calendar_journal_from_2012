<p>Went outside with Yuki and Rei from my old room to see if we could
join the hot tub party, but the rumor of its cancellation seemed to
be true.  We noticed a good deal of stars, so headed to the front
deck and saw scads of them.  I remember being awed on the 49th
voyage, but this time was not as amazing to me.</p>

<p>I quite enjoyed them being quite so impressed and just general
banter about how many more stars were visible here than in Tokyo (of
course).</p>

<p>Equally impressed when Yuki was able to explain what shooting
stars were, and I told them where the dust comes from (short version:
Oort Cloud).</p>

<p>I am falling asleep here, but be assured today was awesome!</p>

<p>Last night we saw a couple shooting stars, and in each case one of
us was looking a different direction.  Except once, we saw a short yet
bright shooting star and the girls were jump-dance-shouting with glee!
So so cute!!</p>

<p>The front deck closes at 10pm (because there are passenger rooms
right below it (and easy access to a Crew Only deck)) so we got kicked
out, and headed over to Namihei for drinks and chattin'.  Joined by
other GET Ts and had a lovely time.  They wouldn't serve us water, but
they had self serve water in these Ridiculously Small Paper Cups, so
Yuki and I went down to get our (and her roommates') bottles.</p>

<p>Back up, though weather seemed to get cold quickly (and we were
drinking iced drinks), so back down after not too long.  Plus,
Vietnam tomorrow!</p>
