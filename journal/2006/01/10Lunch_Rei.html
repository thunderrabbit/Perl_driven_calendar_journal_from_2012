<p>Didn't have lunch with Rei, but happened to find her and Chieko up
in Yacht Club after their CC meeting.  Sat by Rei and chatted; she
asked again for my birthdate, but I have only given her my days old.
(I wonder what I'll say if she asks when I was 1 day old...)  She has
indicated that she's "bad at math," so I offered to help her figure
out how many days old she is.  There was not enough time / interest to
do it now, but maybe later.</p>

<p>She showed me some kanji and reminded me of hers (ŒË) after I could
remember half of it, and she taught me ∏·¡∞ and ∏·∏Â, which are
representin' on the schedule.</p>

<p>Neat to see her cause Carl and I had just been commenting
positively on Rei painting my toes last night, and I answered one of
his questions like, "I ain't tryin' to get with her; she don' seem
like the type for foolin' around."  He agreed, "yeah; she's da real
deal.  Don't wanna be phonin' her on the ship."</p>

<p>Except he used a word that <em>rhymed</em> with phonin'.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I *did* have lunch alone, and then with Laura and other GETs who
arrived later.  We shared scar stories after I noticed Laura's finger
was a bit crooked; her(?) dog bit and twisted it 180 degrees; she had
to drive to the hospital with her fingernail facing the same
direction as her palm.</p>

<p>Nick has dislocated two fingers, and I told them about my
relocating Christine's finger after she did a back handspring when we
were in gymnastics together at UH.  Nick did his dislocation in Japan,
and none of his mates on the field would fix it, and it
took <em>three</em> doctors to get it back into place.  After hearing
that, I felt even better about how I had immediately fixed
Christine's.</p>
