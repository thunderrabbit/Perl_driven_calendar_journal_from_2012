<p class="date">8:39am SGT Friday 06 January 2006</p>

<p>Went up to Yacht Club and sat with Charles, director of <a
href="http://www.secondharvestjapan.org/english/index_e.html">Second
Harvest Japan</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask him more questions than I did, but his question
production frequency was a bit higher than mine.  Did learn that this
is his first time on PB (same for his 12 y/o daughter Mary), and they
didn't particularly have a good idea of what it would be like (knowing
"what it will be like" is basically an impossible task, I posit) but
Mary realllllly didn't want to go at first, and now she realllllly
doesn't want to go back home.</p>

<p>He left around 8:12 and I jumped tables to Rei and Yuki's.  They
told me about their roommate this morning:</p>

<p>waking up, walking barefoot to the door, stopping to ask "where're
my shoes?", turning around, deciding otherwise, "ah fuckit," going
outside, standing, coming back in, "it's too far,"</p>

<p>Rei: "what's too far?"</p>

<p>"GET Street; it's too far..." and going back to bed.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Yuki has a tour early this morning, and Rei has a tour this
evening; she may hang out with Maiko and Joel, who have no plans for
today.</p>
