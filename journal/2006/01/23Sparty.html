<p>There's a Sparty going on now on top deck.  I'm not going to hit
the hot tub, but I'll go up there and chat with peeps.</p>

<p class="date">1:17am EAT Tuesday 24 January 2006</p>

<p class="date">12:18am SAST Tuesday 24 January 2006</p>

<p>Switched timezones, to South Africa Standard Time, perhaps.</p>

<p>Sparty was cancelled due to weather.  We are rocking nicely.</p>

Too tired to get all the details, but we played hand frog games (make
a frog face with hands) as per Rei's suggestion, and threw french
fries and ate a lot of cheesecake.  Well, they did.  I ate only a
half-bite of Rei's cheesecake.</p>

<p>Oh, and I explained why our note looked like a form letter.</p>

<p>Searched for a piano for Rei to play, but Broadway was in use, and
the Windjammer piano was in use, and the Hemingway piano can't be
used without JG permission.</p>

<p>Saw Stacy as we were headed off to our neighborhood and he told us
that when it's reallly rocky, the front of the ship lands in the water
and we can feel the shockwave rush through the entire
ship.  <em>That</em> sounds <em><b>awesome</b></em>.</p>

<p>I waved them goodnight and as I was basically ready to get into
bed, I heard Carl come to the hood and he went into their room.</p>

<p>I couldn't stay away, and went over as well; found Carla's reply
to our form letter.</p>

<p>Fuckin' hell, my brain has got to get more sleep; this is slipping
down an emotionally dangerous slope for me.</p>
