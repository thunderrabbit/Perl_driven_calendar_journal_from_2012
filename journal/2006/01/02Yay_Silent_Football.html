<p>Just got back to the hotel after a lovely game of Silent Football
(!)  at a restaurant on the river.  Maruan had the game nailed, and
Nick made a few errors.  I think alcohol damped Nick's ability to
grasp the rules.</p>

<p>We had five players, but we laughed and had fun, despite the empty
seats and those choosing to watch.</p>
