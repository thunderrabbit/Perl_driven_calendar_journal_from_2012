<p>Lunch then meeting with Kellie, Laura, Maruan in room 8 about our
classes (same general level) and made some (greater than zero)
progress in talking about evaluating students' abilities.</p>

<p>Lovely lovely wonderful talk with Carla about our old Nova days and
stuff.  I'm really glad to be friends with such an awesome woman.  I
told her I like Rei and she said she could tell.</p>
