<p>Today was Lisa's birthday, and we recruited the Zola Youth Choir
singers to help us with a killa version of Happy Birthday, with echo
harmonies and such.  We sang a normal fast version first, then the
echo version, then in Italian, then in Spanish, and then Lee led the
rockin' Happy Birthday version that just keeps repeating those two
words.</p>

<p>Maruan told us about The Game, which we are always playing, but
the object of the game is to forget we are playing.  If we remember
we are playing, we have to remind everyone that everyone is playing.
The person who forgets the longest is the winner.</p>

<p>Carl then told us about The Penis Game, where everyone takes turns
saying something louder than the person before, and the first person
who doesn't say it louder is a penis.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised if we get in a bit of trouble for
screaming "Give Me Sex!"</p>
