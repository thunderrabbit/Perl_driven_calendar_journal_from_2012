<p>We are in Seychelles time now!</p>

<p>After Laura and Kellie finished their painstakingly detailed
pages, I arranged them and figured out in what order to scan them for
best copying and binding.  There is one program on the GET Room 8
computer that does a nice job of printing double sided pages that fit
the paper.  However, it only works with TIF files, and I haven't
figured out how to get the scanner / computer-import process to
consistently creat TIF files.   Sometimes they are TIF, and sometimes
they are JPG.</p>

<p>BUT, I have put together one (1) useable rough draft, so if
nothing else good happens (such as when I scanned all the pages one
at a time to get good dpi, and they all turned out to be .JPG), we
can just print the rough draft version as if it's the real deal.</p>
