<p>Carl did a funny thing with his port orientation information today
by making certain letters bold, which read together as "if you are
reading this, please start clapping."  I definitely want to one-up him
on that, though I must give him kudos to the original idea.</p>

<p>I considered writing a fixed width font auto-justifying port
orientation, and then a message within that, but I'd be bordering on
creating a masterpiece, which I don't really have time to do.</p>
