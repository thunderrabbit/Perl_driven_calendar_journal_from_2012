<p>Busy busy day today, but getting tons of shit done...  it took well
longer than I thought to get the raffle tickets made; I couldn't write
a macro in Microsoft Sucks Word Sucks because the security was set to
High, and then because it would only hard code text and not let me
cut-n-paste or do cursor movements in the macro.  I ended up getting
it done in NeoOffice/J, but even that was a bit of a pain cause,
though I could do the macro I wanted, I couldn't just tell it to
repeat 1000 times like I'd be able to do in emacs.  But emacs won't
output in .doc format.</p>

<p>Corrected student diaries until I met up with Rei in Yacht Club,
and she helped me run the macro 1000 times in NeoOffice; she held down
the fn key and I pressed F4 repeatedly until we got through it.</p>

<p>Petra thought of a better solution: replace " f" with " ^Mf" to
put a carriage return in there.  That woulda been a lot easier.</p>

<p>Given that we were conforming to the stupidity of computers instead
of the computers being smart enough to just figure out what I wanted
it to do, I asked Rei how she would know we had reached the future.  I
gave her my example: when I am able to ask my computer for a realtime
video chat with anyone in the world (with appropriate exceptions for
those who are sleeping / busy, but also with the ability to override
those for people who've given me that permission) and just do it, with
no "extra" equipment required except what I carry around with me all
the time (retinal implant or video screen lenses), I will know I've
reached the future.</p>

<p>She gave Doriamon as her gauge of the future.  When we are able to
walk through a どこでもドーア, or fly around with personal
helicopters, that will be the future come true for her.</p>

<p>Zoom to Chat With where I described my days old counting idea to
two of my four students, then printed the raffle tickets for マミ,
then off to a bit of chow in Yacht Club, then GET Meeting, then a All
English session with some guy who knows a lot about South Africa -
well more than I probably want to know, then dinner with Karen and
Carl where we all laughed about Carl trying to talk to Vickie, I mean
Maria, about her name, and then being a bit late to the planning
meeting for tomorrow's South Africa fundraising auction, but then
zooming out and getting pics taken and flyers flown, and good stuff
like that, and now here.</p>
