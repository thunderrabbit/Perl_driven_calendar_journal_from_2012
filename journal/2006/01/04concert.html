<p>Around 8:50, the girls were like, "are you going to the live?"
("live" as in Live Concert, an example of Japanese English).  I was
like, "naw, man" and then realized I had nothing to lose (though I
couldn't stay for the whole thing), so I stepped into the back/side of
Broadway.  Soon as the music started, I was like, <em>gotta get outta
here</em>, cause it was just rock, which I basically just reject
outright after having worked at KTRU.</p>

<p>Then when the lead singer girl started singing, though her voice
was cute and lovely, I realized it would be in Japanese, and I'd
basically understand nothing.  So that clenched it and I escaped
without further delay.</p>
