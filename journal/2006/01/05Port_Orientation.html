<p>Joel said some really funny stuff at the port orientation, as he
ususally does, cause he's basically hilarious all the time.</p>

<p>The CCs had translated the Japanese port information sheet to
English for us, but made a couple of spelling errors, for example,
when referring to the tours it said</p>

<pre>please remember to bring your boucher</pre>

<p>Joel goes, "that's a joke.  You should actually bring your voucher
or else everyone will laugh at you."</p>

<p>Later, when referring to the arrival time he goes, "the ship is
scheduled to arrive at 11:30.  You'll be made aware of it because we
will stop moving."</p>
