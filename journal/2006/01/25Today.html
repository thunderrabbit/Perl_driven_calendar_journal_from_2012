<p>Today two Fantastic Rabbits presented things for the rest of the
class.  I'm glad they were so keen to teach; I hope they enjoyed it
and learned a lot!</p>

<p>I've gotten a great start on the picture changing code.  I think I
will be able to complete it by tomorrow and get some pics uploaded
while in Cape Town.</p>

<p>The ship is rocking a bit, but not as well as yesterday.</p>

<p>Today is the last class of Term 1.  Our schedules change next
term, which begins on February 1.</p>

<p>The last Fighting Goats class of Term 1 starts in 15 minutes.</p>
