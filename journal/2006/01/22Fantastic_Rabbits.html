<p>This day Angelina rejoined us after a day being sick.  She was
scheduled to do her presentation today, but asked to move it to next
class (ÌÀ¸åÆü).  Michelle gave a nice presentation on her homestay in
Cairnes, and we practiced cheers and jeers for Language Olympics
tomorrow..  I was surprised at some of the jeers they came up with.  I
told them they should not use those words unless they want to get into
a fight.</p>

<p>But I still added them to their handouts, under the heading
Angry.</p>

<p>Handed out diaries to all of them; I was supposed have done that
earlier in the semester, but I had decided to save the notebooks
unless they were specifically requested.  And they were.</p>
