<p>Wow.  Today zoomed by like a rabbit...  I ate lunch upstairs after
a nap where I showed Rei bottle number 3, which was dated yesterday,
but didn't get tossed overboard.  She did the drop and we watched it
bob in the water as the boat relatively sped away.</p>

<p>Coordinated a date with Rei at the formal dinner tonight!  We have
differing seating times, so she will have to sneak in to my seating.
I hope it's not an issue.  I'm sure we can talk our way in.</p>

<p>Fighting Goats class was alright, but not as good as I would have
liked it, given that Matt was evaluating.  I met three of my students
afterward, and amazingly enough, one of them thought Matt had been
there to evaluate if she was the correct level for the class.  At
least I think that's what she was asking. Wow.  I assured her that was
not the case, and hoped she would stay in the class; some concern
about not being good enough...  tears and the whole bit.</p>

<p>Met four Fantastic Rabbits in 1-on-1 things in Yacht Club.</p>

<p>Matt gave feedback on the evaluation, basically wants me to spend
more time preparing for lessons, something I probably would have said
to me were I in his position.</p>

<p>Fast GET meeting in Sunshine Bar, led by Karen.  26 minutes and
much clapping afterward.</p>
