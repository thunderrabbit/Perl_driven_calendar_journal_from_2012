<p>Didn't take a nap, but have been relatively productive today.
Finished my Open lesson plans for two days, then scheduled and
rescheduled my Staff GET lesson, unfortunately settling on a time that
conflicted with the drumming portion of our KSB workshop, which I'm
sure woulda been hella fun.  I was able to participate in the Kentaro
portion; he led us through some breathing exercises and then I
partnered with him for the goldfish massage (basically shaking people
by their ankles and toes so they look like wriggling fish)</p>

<p>Staff GET with Kiichi, who will laminate a big-ass clock for me
for tomorrow and from whom I will borrow a screwdriver to take apart
Hitomi's camera to get a bit of sand out of it.  It won't focus up
close, though it tries.</p>

<p>Now I'm joining Rei for Majong and then brownie in Hemingway.</p>
