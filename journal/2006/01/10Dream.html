<p class="dream">Lisa was sitting in front of me and for some reason
had to expose her right breast, because of a sunburn or some chafing,
and I looked carefully into her eyes with a semi-joke like, "I'm
carefully gazing into your eyes," and she laughed a bit, then I got
on an air-phone (*), and looked up like I was no where near Lisa, and
go, "hello, Lisa?  Yeah, what are you wearing to dinner today?  I
want to make sure I don't stand out.."  We laughed a lot..</p>
