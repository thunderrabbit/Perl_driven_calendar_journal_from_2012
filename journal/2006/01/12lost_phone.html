<p>Not <em>lost</em> lost, but I can't seem to find it here.  I must
have left it in 3029.</p>

<p>I will have to jump out of bed when the guy does the announcements
at 7:07am.  I'm meeting Fighting Goats at 7:10am.</p>

<p>Oh, this is the day we took our first Larium tablets.  I wonder if
I will have freaky dreams.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>
