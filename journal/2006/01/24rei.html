<p>After our group date, with Matt and Maiko added, and an empty chair
representing Yuki, I hung out with Rei on top deck watching stars.
While telling stories and gazing up on the backdrop of Orion and
friends, we saw three satellites, a few little shooting stars, and one
really long slow one.</p>

<p>We got cold, though the wind wasn't too bad and went down to our
neighborhood and listened to なつかし music on her computer.  Lots of
80s groups and singers from the US.  I was impressed by how well she
could do Black Eyed Peas "Where is the love"</p>

<p>I basically was falling asleep by the time Carla got there at
midnight, and then I did fall asleep while they were talking.
Whups! Time to go!</p>
