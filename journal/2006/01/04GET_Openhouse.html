<p>Just did the GET Open House and met our students, though we still
may do some more swapping.  Kellie did a really good job of
remembering names and abilities; I didn't really at all... Just
remember one guy (Akira) was really funny.  The rest are just a
blur.</p>

<p>I'm pretty much not even worrying about who ends up in my two
classes, but I'll be sure to not have a homogenous class when it's all
settled.</p>
