<p>Egad.  I hate Microsoft Sucks.  There's a text document that has
some kind of bug or some shit so that it won't print, and I can't
cut-n-paste it to another document.  When I try either, it crashed
Microsoft Sucks Word Sucks.  I tried two different computers;
I took out all the images from the document; I fucking should be able
to print it, or sue Microsoft for wasting my time by being assholes
who write shitty code and pretend it's worth anything.</p>

<p>Phil came by and reset my angry brain; I can just copy the document
I want from a hardcopy that we already have printed.</p>
