<p>Class was good, though they were pretty quiet.  We did a bit of a
lesson on shopping.  It seems they want to be hand fed all their
English.  I think I need to be a bit more proactive with them than
with my other class.  Got a good thing going with both classes; I am
thankful things continue to be great!</p>
