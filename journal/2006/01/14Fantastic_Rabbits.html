<p>Fantastic Rabbits were fantastic again today; George (Koji)
presented Rapa Nui for us and everyone asked questions. Plus, everyone
had done homework and joined in the discussions afterward.</p>

<p>They've basically decided to do the bulk of Peach Boy in class
because everyone is so busy.  Nikki (Etsuko, I think) has dropped out
of class officially after her 1 day cameo, so the Fantastic Rabbits
asked if I would take her role as grampa.  "You will be couple with
Angelina..." (Tamami) I'm sure I'll get some ribbing around that.</p>
