<p>Holy fuck.. what happened to eastern medicine in Japan?</p>

<p>I go into the doctor cause my ear is a bit cloggy feeling after
diving and come back with ear drops, and antibiotic tablet,
anti-inflamitory, <em>and</em> something to "support my stomach" in
taking all these meds.</p>

<p>how much does this fucking cost PB????</p>

<p>AND and, he only looked in my left ear, not my right.</p>
