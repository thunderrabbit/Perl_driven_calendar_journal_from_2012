<p>Hmmm..  I'd like to do another triple date at the upcoming formal
dinner with the girls across the hall, but</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The GETs and CCs have different seating times in the dining area</p></li>
<li><p>It's only 2 days away, and I haven't talked with Carl and Dan.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But I did just write a note:</p>

<pre>
                Your Highness
                   of the
              Infinite Blue Sea,
              Infinite Blue Sky,
           Infinite Stars at Night
        
        
        Sweet Memories of our Encounter
        
          with visions of thy beauty
          my dreams gladly overflow
        
            <b>Formal Dinner
                 Thursday
             January Twelfth</b>
        
         Will my heart burst with joy?
        
               Everlastingly,
</pre>
