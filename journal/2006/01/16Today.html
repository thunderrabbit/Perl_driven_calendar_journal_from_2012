<p>Today is pretty quiet and lazy, save for Mombassa Challenge
Program setup and presentation, we've got not much to do.  Except
prepare for lessons tomorrow and do laundry.</p>

<p>I was massaging Carla's shoulders / back and noticed a bit of a
bend in her spine.  I'm finding myself quite interested in getting a
massage therapy type degree.</p>

presentation.  That's basically my favorite character to play because
I get to climb on things and not get in trouble for it.  I was running
around the room sniffing things and mime-picking and eating lice off
people's heads, and sniffing and eating bits of paper, plus climbing
on the chairs, tables, railings, counters.  At the end, Matt was like,
"good job," which I highly doubt he would have said had I done that
and climbed on everything without wearing a monkey outfit.
Awesome.</p>
