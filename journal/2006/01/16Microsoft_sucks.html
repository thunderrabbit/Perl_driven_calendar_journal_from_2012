<p>Microsoft Sucks.</p>

<p>On this Microsoft Sucks keyboard, not only is there a key labeled
POWER, which, if pressed, shuts down Windows Sucks <em>without</em>
verification, but,</p>

<p>when I accidentally pressed the key labeled POWER, Windows Sucks shut
down Microsoft Word Sucks with <em>unsaved</em> files that I was
editing.</p>

<p>I turned the computer back on, and it took about 5 minutes for it
to check the disk for errors, load drivers, load Windows Sucks, load
drivers, and get settled.  Note carefully, this time
included <em>checking the disk for errors</em> because Microsoft Sucks
had not been shut down properly.</p>

<p>NOT Only all of that, but when I loaded Microsoft Sucks Word, and
it said there were autosaved versions of the files, and I should
choose the one I wanted.....  it forced me to specify the old file
name to save them.</p>

<p>ie, I chose the file, clicked save, and it was like, "what name
would you like to save the file?"  SAVE IT THE SAME FILE NAME IT
ALREADY WAS!!   "A file with that name already exists.  Are you sure
you want to overwrite?"</p>

<p>YOU MEAN TO FUCKING TELL ME THAT I CAN'T SAVE A FILE AS ITSELF
WITHOUT A DIALOG BOX, BUT I CAN SHUT DOWN WINDOWS, LOSE DATA, CORRUPT
DISKS, WITH A SINGLE KEYPRESS AND <b>NO DIALOG BOX?</b></p>

<p>How embarassing for Microsoft Sucks to write a product so shitty
that I have resorted to writing in all caps like some loner screaming
about something inane.  Like this.  Can't believe how fucked up
Microsoft is.</p>
