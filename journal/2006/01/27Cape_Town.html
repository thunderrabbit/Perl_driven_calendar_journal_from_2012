<p>It's looking quite like we will arrive in Cape Town today.  Kellie
and I could definitely see there had been a fire; smoke and
occassional flames are still visible on a ravine on Table Mountain,
and there was smoke visible on the nearby pointy mountain.  And we saw
a fire extinguishing helicopter flying around that mountain.</p>

<p>We arrived around 9am and all the passengers seemed
so <em>happy</em> .... we didn't know if we'd be able to disembark at
all.</p>
