<p>Just talked to Phil as he did his arm exercises as part of his
recovery from a shoulder injury that wasn't treated properly when it
first happened.  He asked if I plan to show pictures on Palestine, and
we talked about it a bit.  I definitely feel some fear about doing
it.. basically based on my not knowing a lot about the issues.  When
I've told people I just know it's fucked up, they say, "well, everyone
knows that!" so I'm wondering what more I know and what I have to
share....</p>
