<p>Briefly met Lee Hirsch today, the director of Amandla!, a
movie/documentary on the effect of music on the fall of Apartheid.  We
watched the film today in Broadway, and he's doing question and answer
now, but I left when the questions seemed to veer into the realm of
the not-so-interesting.</p>

<p>Good questions that I can remember: Did HBO fund you well to get
their logo on the front?  ($100,000).  How did you get involved with
all this while in high school? (went to a school board finance meeting
and wondered why they had assets in South Africa, couldn't argue that
it was wrong because he didn't know enough about the situation.)
Where else has music affected change?  (The US, Okinawa, Hitler's
campaign of nationalism, and more.)  Why did your mom not want you to
go to South Africa so soon after Apartheid ended?</p>

<p>That's when I left.</p>

<p>The movie is great, inspiring, and when I first watched it, made me
want to be black.  Or at least in solidarity with such a powerful
movement.</p>
