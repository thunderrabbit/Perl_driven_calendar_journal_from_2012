<p>Was just chillin' on the top deck; chowed a bunch of lunch and read
a lot of _Xenocide_, then worked a few minutes on my curriculum, and
then read more on the pool deck while people swam and swung poi
balls.</p>

<p>The sky is overcast, and winds and generally flowing right with the
boat, making for lovely calm weather and a great day for lounging
around outside.</p>

<p>I'm going to write about Vietnam now, using my fish book diary for
memory-prompts.</p>
