<p>Run run run run run back to the customs thing, get through the line
okay, then run run run and find a huge line at the ship.  Oh shit.</p>

<p>But wait.  That line isn't moving.  We're going to be considered
on time because *everyone* will be late.  Apparently the docking
mechanism wasn't working properly.</p>

<p>We sat for a while and it got fixed and we headed onboard.</p>

<p>Not late.</p>
