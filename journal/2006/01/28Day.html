<p>Today is a day off, but there are still plenty of meetings.
Breakfast, then 11am to meet the guest speakers, lunch, 1pm to meet
with other teachers about curriculum ideas that have worked well,
right now work on curriculum for next term, meeting my Staff GET
student at 3pm, then meeting Matt about Open Lesson curriculums, and
then 5:30 for the Walvis Bay port orientation, and GET Meeting then
dinner with Fighting Goats at 7pm and then for dessert, hang out with
Rei in the evening.</p>

<p>Curriculum planning went okay for my classes.. well, I got a basic
start on them.  The planning for Open lessons was even more effective.
Matt led the meeting and we brainstormed ideas and I was like, "aight;
you guys do these 6 and we will do these 6 and then the rest we'll do
later," and that plan seems to have been adopted by everyone.</p>

<p>Chowed with Maruan in Yacht Club - chopped eel stuff that was
actually pretty bad with all the bones all over the place.  Ah well;
it was a snack.</p>
