<p>We're in Namibia where there's plenty of room and plenty of sand.
We bounced 33 人 in a 15 person truck to an adventure center where
we're scoping a DVD about the local offerings complete with pumpin'
music and we're all, "YEAH!" and "will that music be playing as we
VERB?" where VERB is dune buggy, sky dive, sandboard, paraglide,
kayaking, hot air ballooning, horseback ridin', fishing, aerobatic
flying, paint ball...</p>

<p>Bigtime sandboarding fun!!  I got a video while sliding down.  I
hope it turns out well.  We used snowboards and masonite boards as
high tech speed machines.</p>

<p>Raymond and Constatine were our guides.  Two cool cats, they.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a bit late to meet 玲 at the ship at 5, but I'm
remaining relaxed.</p>
