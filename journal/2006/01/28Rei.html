<p>Hung out with Rei tonight: we ate down in Topaz (I just had the
appetizer and dessert) and then went to Victor's presentation.  He's
a self-taught photo journalist who grew up within Apartheid.  His
story amazed us all, especially to see how warm and loving he is
toward life and everyone now.  He has a lot he could be bitter about,
but instead he chooses to see how much he has, after having
everything ripped away from him before.</p>

<p>We went and walked around on top deck, looking at stars.</p>
