<p>Kellie joined our breakfast table, and after a bit, Matt came up
and asked Kellie if she would do the hula as people joined the fruits
party, and she was like, "alone?  no way..." and quickly Rei was like,
"I'll help," etc, and suddenly Yuki, Carla, Rei and I were Kellie's
new hula team, and learning the steps to the hukilau dance!</p>

<p>We got some haphazard audiences while practicing; two of the
servers clapped and some people from the deck above Yacht Club
watched as well.</p>

<p>It really is pretty easy; I think it will be fun!</p>
