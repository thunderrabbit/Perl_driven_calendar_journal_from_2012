<p>Fantastic Rabbits were quite a blessing again today. Very
talkative and taking charge in their own lesson... Man that sure
makes things easier for me.  Each lesson perfectly tailored to their
interests and needs.</p>

<p>We played a card game; Carol did a card magic trick; Alice and
Michelle did show and tell slideshows; we learned lots of vocabulary;
they genkily locked onto their homework grammar.</p>

<p>George is going to Tanzania starting tomorrow and will rejoin us
in Cape Town, so we're going to have a byebye party for him tonight
in Yacht Club.</p>

<p>Best class ever.</p>
