<p>Carl and Dan are home and Carl came up with a better genre of
invitation ideas than a simple letter:</p>

<pre>
To the lovely 3029 crew:

After a thorough analysis of our first encounter, the 3 of us who
like 1, 2, and 3 of you, respectively, require the following
information for strategic planning purposes:

<ol>
<li><p>Pick a number randomly from 1 to 1000.</p></li>

<li><p>Add 5 for each one of you who would considering dating a GET teacher.</p></li>

<li><p>Add 11 for each of those who are male.</p></li>

<li><p>Add 29 for each who reside 3027.</p></li>

<li><p>Subtract 100 if said individual is Francois.</p></li>

<li><p>Multiply by 2 for each duplicated non-rabbit on your list.</p></li>

<li><p>Add 3 if you like me.</p></li>
</ol>

Please write the resulting number on a piece of paper and deliver it
to the Boys in Yo' Hood.
</pre>

<p>Given that your number is more than negative 6 billion, we have
decided to ask you for another date.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We are definitely tired, and definitely having fun.</p>
