<p class="date">7:55am SCT Saturday 14 January 2006</p>

<p>Saw Carla, Stacy, Petra, Erica, Kellie, and Phil during breakfast
up at Yacht Club.  People seemed sleepy after the Sparty, save for
Petra and Kellie.  Kellie inquired about the scanning; she now has the
16 300dpi JPGs that I wasn't happy with last night; she said she's
happy to clean them up and save in TIF so they can be laid out in
relatively small file space.</p>
