<p>Met up with Rei right after we got back to the port; I looked for
internet access briefly, but would have to go into town to get it.
$3 each direction, plus $3-ish for the connection, would cost more
than just doing it onboard the ship, so I've decided to wait, or do
it onboard.</p>

<p>Walked around with Rei; she showed me her $2 drum, originally
priced at $25.  One of the dancers showed us how to play it.</p>

<p>We shared stories about our respective adventures, which were
about as opposite as they could be.  We stayed in a relatively
luxurious lodge, while she was in a village without electricity,
where this visit is only the second time people from outside Kenya
have visited the village.</p>

<p>The men in the village made mouse/rat traps out of flexible sticks
and gourds.  Amazing.  I can see basically how it works, but I
couldn't figure out how to set it.</p>

<p>We chowed dinner together in Yacht Club, and then went for a walk
around top deck.  She helped correct my Japanese in a postcard I had
written (using some of my own vocabulary and grammar structures).  We
told each other about our respective strangest jobs while we watched
the PILOTS boat come pick up their pilot after he sailed us out of
the port.</p>

<p>Down to our neighborhood where we imported pictures from her
camera onto my computer and then scoped those pictures, plus my
pictures from yesterday.</p>

<p>Super tired; must go to bed now.</p>
