<p>Just finished getting to a stopping point on getting stuff ready
for charity auction tomorrow.  Joel is going to emcee it, though I
had said I was willing to if he wasn't.  I'm glad I won't be, but I
think I woulda been up for the challenge.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>Helped Carla get  pics off her computer and tried to get them to
the network, but for some reason I couldn't get them off my computer
to a card.  It kept erroring.  I said, "I know enough to know that I
don't know what's wrong, but it could take a really long time to
figure it out," and we aborted to the bare minimum of what we needed
to copy over.  3 pics instead of 352.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
