<p class="date">1:22am SCT Sunday 15 January 2006</p>

<p>A lot of today was spent getting the Mombassa Challenge Program
booklet properly set out on the computers.  In the end, I found Irfan
Viewer rules, and was able to do everything I wanted with it.
Specifically append pictures side by side.</p>

<p>After that was dinner then 30 minute GET Meeting led by Liz, who
joined Pepe at the end for a Spanish lesson.  We learned how to shake
our asses.</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep while writing this.  Pretty funny...</p>

<p>umm, a bit of dinner talking to Tony behind Yacht Club in a
conversation dominated by Pepe and then traded massages with CC Rie,
and then worked on Mombassa CP stuff starting at 8:30pm, but Pepe
wasn't there right at that time, so he ended up waiting in GET Room
10 while I was up in Peace Center meeting Tamo who helped me cut and
fold the booklets.</p>

<p>Laura and Pepe came up after a while and worked with me, and then
Pepe did the rest of the stapling while I went to T-club for more
massage action, with lots of wiggling.  I was partnered with Nick.
Massage was called goldfish massage cause we wiggle our partners like
a wriggling goldfish.  I got ironed after that.  Nice.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will be in Port Victoria, Seychelles!</p>
