<p>Awwwww.. I got a precious postcard from Hitomi!  It's all handmade
(on her printer) and includes the kanji for my name.</p>

I remember that I enjoyed
this lesson of you, But I didn't
understand this story a bit
when I had your lesson.
I felt sad because I like your
lesson.  After that, I read
a lot and I understand and
memorized this story.
So. I was able to read with
no text when I had this 
lesson again!

<p>The lesson was definitely one of my favorites to teach at Nova.
Probably my favorite: The Legend of Willy the Kid</p>

<pre>
Willy the Kid arrived in Dodge City one evening.
He walked into the saloon, and looked slowly round the room.
Everybody was afraid. Willy had two guns.
The Sheriff was in his office.  He was asleep.
The saloon barman rushed into the Sheriff's office.
"Willy the Kid's in town!"
The Sheriff hurried to the saloon.
The Sheriff shouted to Willy.  "Give me your guns, Willy."
Willy replied calmly. "This town is too small for both of us."
They walked into the street.  The Sheriff waited.
Willy moved his hand towards his gun...
The Sheriff pulled out his gun.
He fired twice.  The first bullet missed Willy.
The second bullet killed him.
Two cowboys carried Willy away.
That was the end of Willy the Kid.
