<p>Met Fighting Goats for breakfast in Topaz Dining, that 'luxurious'
dining hall just above my room and just below GET Street, where we are
greeted at the door and during buffet meals handed our trays, or led
to our tables when it's a four course meal.</p>

<p>Breakfast is served buffet style; we 7 sat at a 6 person table and
one at the next table because "the tables are like lifeboats, we can't
add an extra chair or it will be off balance," according to one of the
waitstaff.</p>

<p>In Topaz, breakfast includes eggs, sausage or bacon, waffles (( I
will always think of Shawn, who always assured us "I love waffles" as
he piled them high on his plate. )), rice, okayu (messy soupy rice),
sliced fruit (orange, apple and/or pineapple), natto (disgusting
fermented beans that many Japanese love), and water, then orange juice
or milk.</p>

<p>We didn't chat much during breakfast, but it was hopefully an okay
experience for them.</p>
