<p>I found Tam!!</p>

<p>It was only by the grace of an ANgel, that I found her:</p>

bearings, a woman was like, "HI" and stuff.  Her name was An, and she
invited me to her shop, and since I was still not quite sure where in
the city I was (compared to last time I had visited), I agreed.  On
the way, I recognized where Tam's cart had been.  It wasn't there.  No
carts were there along that section of street.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Wound back through some small streets (that would unlikely get any
random foot traffic) and saw An's shop.  Told her I would come back
after I looked for my friend.</p>

<p>On the way back to the main street, I found Tam!!!  She and her
peers and carts had been moved around the corner from where they had
been because of a new building under construction.  I may have found
her without An's (indirect) help, but it's nice to think An was an
Angel for me that day.  Especially when I went back to An's shop and
didn't find her.</p>

<p>Talked with Tam for maybe 2 hours, helping her a bit with English,
and just exchaning stories and questions as best as possible.</p>

<p>Wandered a bit through the streets, then back to Tam's cart, as
she was finishing her work day.  She drove me back to my hotel after
taking me by her house!  I got to meet her mom, dad, husband,
brother, sister, and various kids.  I taught the kids how to do high
five; they were great!</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, where I found Nick and told him how I met Tam,
and how she drove me to her house and the hotel, etc.  Her house, our
hotel, and her shop are all quite close, and I felt the magic of two
maps merging like puzzle pieces long sought.</p>

<p>She offered to take me to the ship tomorrow for free!!  It cost
80,000 VND to get from the ship to Hoi An.  80,000 VND for food, and
75,000 for the hotel.  I be running' low on cash!!!</p>

<p>During the day I was with Carla when she found a dog that she
decided to take home with her.</p>
