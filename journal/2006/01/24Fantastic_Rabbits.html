<p>Good class today; Angelina talked about her 3 week stay in Santa
Monica, __(i_forgot)__, and Las Vegas.  I made sure to praise her for
having gone alone, and overcoming obstacles to make her trip a
reality.  Then I gave a few suggestions on correcting English for her
stories and for questions that the rest of the Rabbits asked.</p>

<p>That took up a full hour, which is well-more than I expected, so we
didn't have all that much time for Carol to give her tour of the ship,
which, fantastically enough, introduced a new convenient stairway of
which I had previously been unaware.  Nice.</p>
