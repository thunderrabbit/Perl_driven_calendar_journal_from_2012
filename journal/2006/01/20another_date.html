<p class="date">11:11pm EAT Friday 20 January 2006</p>

<p>We've taken a long time to respond to the response from the girls
across the hall.  We sent them a request for information with some
silly number questions and they sent a number back.</p>

<p>Tonight I thought of the perfect response.</p>

<p>We had been thinking of saying, "since your number is greater than
negative 6 billion, we have decided to ask for another date."   but
we never ended up sending it, nor any response, until just a moment
ago.</p>

<p>A form letter like</p>

<pre>
To the Lovely Ladies of ____________



After careful consideration of your response, ____________, we have

decided to offer you an opportunity for a date on ______________.



          Sincerely,

          the young studs of 3027

<p>I printed it, then wrinkled the paper and scanned it with scotch
tape on the page and crooked on the scanner, etc.  It has all kinds of
little lines and copy splotches now, and then the numbers filled in:
3029, 1123, 1/24/06</p>

<p class="date">11:15pm EAT Friday 20 January 2006</p>

<p>Heh heh.  And Carla has just now said she's going down to bed,
where she will find the note under her door.</p>
