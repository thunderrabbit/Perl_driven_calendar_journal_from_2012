<p>Just had our brownie in Hemingway; Rei didn't feel supa-genki
during Majong and went downstairs to sleep for a bit.  We connected
for lunch and then for brownie.  While there, we chatted a bit, but
things felt less than great.  Mirena noticed and asked me what had
happened.  "There used to be so much light."</p>

<p>Damn.</p>
