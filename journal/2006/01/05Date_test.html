<p>I was at breakie with Carla, Rei, and Yuki (the three roommates
across the hall who we three roommates have invited to a date) and Rei
was like, "so how did you write 'Your Majesty of the Infinite Blue
Sea'??"</p>

<p>I was like "how did I <em>write</em> it?" not denying having
information about the author.</p>

<p>She goes, "oh, I mean, how did the <em>secret admirer</em>
write it?"</p>

<p>I recognized I had almost given away a (pretendly secret) bit of
information and stalled a bit so I could think.  "Like what do you
mean?" and then I interrupted before she could answer, as all three of
them had made it to the table on the back deck behind Yacht Club, "all
I know is: one of us likes one of you,"</p>

<p>They laughed, having heard the line before.</p>

<p>"one of us likes <em>two</em> of you, and one of us likes <em>all
three</em> of you lovely ladies."</p>

<p>They laughed and then were joking like, "well, that's not fair
that one of us gets more love than the others..."</p>

<p>"Look what's come out of 3027; you're going to start a war in our
room!"</p>

<p>"There will be a big Japanese and Canadian flag blocking the
middle of the room"</p>

<p>"And an American flag burned in the corner..."</p>

<p>We went on to a discussion of saying "United States" vs "America"
vs other things and who associates what words with what meaning.</p>
