<p>Went down to dinner with Rie and happened to meet up with Petra,
Karen, Tomoyo, Tomomi, Yuu, and Isabel.  I was playfully like,
"whoohoo!  Going to dinner with 7 women!"</p>

<p>Yuu has a sister named Ai.  Yuu and Ai make/get lots of English
jokes based on their names...</p>

<p>When I told them I was 13,068 days old, they said I was д▐дс, which
we translated as "diligent."  I can certainly go with that.</p>

<p>Tomomi and Tomoyo were like, "Bye, Mi!" and "Bye, Yo!" when Tomomi
left the table.</p>
