<p>At work today with an hour break near the beginning.</p>

<p class="date">5:47pm JST</p>

<p>Aw man; I didn't bring any money for a snack.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>First lesson was with Motoko, who is a sound effect designer.  We talked about Star Wars a bit, and the fonky sounds they created for the movie.</p>

<p>Starting in 12 minutes I have 4 hours straight.  There was a 20 minute break in there (after the first hour), but it got filled with a level check.</p>

<p>I may start early to get a break in there..</p>
