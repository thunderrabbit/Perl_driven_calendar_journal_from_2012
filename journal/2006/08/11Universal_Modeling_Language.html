<p>Just about to continue working on mapadmin, but decided to read about UML first.  Rick suggested
it to me, and I think I need a better way of laying out projects.</p>

<p>I didn't get very far reading about that.  The language is not really a language, but just a set
of ideas to write out a project from different points of view.  Wikipedia has a pretty good
description and lays out the complaints against UML.</p>
