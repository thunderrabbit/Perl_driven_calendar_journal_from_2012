<p>Met a cool student named Shinpei today who is like the perfect match for me.  He was like,
&quot;don't tell me good job unless I'm really doing well.&quot; (or at least that's basically what
he meant.)  He locks on to adjustments I give just as well as little Riho the 14 year old, even
though he's 30, totally blowing away the curve of younger students better able to retain
language.</p>

<p>We can have a real conversation, and even though I interrupt him with corrections, often
restructuring his entire sentence, we get right back on the topic and it's great.</p>

<p>He's just started a new job with a clothing store of some sort.  In 3 months his bosses expect
him to be in charge of opening markets overseas.</p>
