<p>Working at EV Ikebukuro today.  First student was super smiley and nearly got contact
information, but I resisted being so foolish.  Next student was choosing between two books, and
wisely chose the easier one.</p>

<p>Next student was supposed to be a level check, but she cancelled.  Not sure if I will get paid
for it or not, given that level check students don't pay.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>As I'm writing this, Kelly is next door talking to a woman who likes to ride motorcycles.</p>

<p>Yummy lunch of noodles eaten while watching the hula performers watch each other to figure out
what they will do tonight at the performance across the street from EV warmed me up.</p>

<p>I wonder if Kaoru plans to perform.  Wonder if Kellie would have.</p>

<p>Met Miho, who had questions about ways to describe her job to people in English.  Turns out it's
internet related, so I had a good idea of what she was describing.  Even broke out my laptop and
keyboard to write up corrected versions.</p>
