<p>AW YEAH!</p>

<p>Holy shizah that was ubersuper fantastic!  At 6pm, which was after the time I expected to
be <em>in</em> Shibuya, and tons of people were escaping the station, I zipped out, busted through
the gates (hordes were crowding the ticket guy to get refunds) and saw a motorcycle guy.</p>

<p>[can you go to Shibuya?  I will give you 1000 yen.]</p>

<p>He said no at first, and I took off walking, looking for the next option.</p>

<p>Then he came up.  [1000 yen?]</p>

<p>Yeah.  I handed it over and we were off.  ZOOOOOOoooooOOOOooooOOOOooooooomm!!  through traffic
stop start stop start zoooooooOOOoOOOoOOooooOOOoooooooooooom!!!  stop start weave swerve
zoooooooooooooooooooooo</p>

<p>It was <em>great</em>!!!!</p>

<p>Got here <em>just</em> in time.  Like walked in and walked into the classroom &quot;ready&quot; to go.</p>

<p>Totally wish I coulda gotten a picture of that.</p>
