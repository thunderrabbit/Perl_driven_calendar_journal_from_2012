<p>Hopefully I will be able to use Jesse's Skype account tonight so Kim can call me using Jesse's
Skypein number.  Jesse seems to have forgotten to change the password to something just for me, and
may not have time to change it before the call is scheduled for tonight.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will be able to walk Kim through an installation of skype; he's not as much of a
computer nerd as me, so he doesn't have skype already.</p>
