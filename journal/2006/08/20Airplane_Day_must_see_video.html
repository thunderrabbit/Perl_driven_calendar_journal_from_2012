<p>Petra sent me a link to a video about Airplane
Day: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7218920724339766288&q=Loose+Change">Loose
Change's Airplane Day video</a>.  The Google version is not full length; here is
a <a

torrent search for Loose Change Airplane Day video</a>.</p>

<p>A friend of hers sent
a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7501020220921158523">video refuting all airplane
day conspiracies</a>.  It does so by mocking interviews with people presenting theories, featuring a
narrator who drives his point home with &quot;bad words&quot; ...  I found it utterly offensive.</p>

<p>Not because of the language.</p>

<p>Cripes.  I just read through a lot of
the <a href="http://www.ccdominoes.com/lc/LooseChangeGuide.html">Loose Change Viewer Guide</a>, and
find it brings up some good points, but overall an emotionally charged refutation that lacks citations.</p>

<p>It appears the debate will rage for years; I would love to know what happened.</p>
