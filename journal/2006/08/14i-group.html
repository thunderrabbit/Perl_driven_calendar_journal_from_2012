<p>Haven't attended the meeting yet; I just want to acknowledge all the times in my career in Japan
that I've profoundly desired to reconnect with my I-group.</p>

<p>I am hoping this group will be equally fantastic.</p>

<p>I-Group was great.</p>

<p>I had forgotten a lot of the protocols.  A lot.  But it mostly all came back.</p>

<p>I did work around relationship stuff.  I completed my stretch goal of sending the email.</p>

<p>Three of us went to Starbucks afterward and talked about cultures for 2 hours.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Now I've met someone who has been Charisma Man.</p>

<p><em>AND!</em> one of the men is a Monroe Institute trainer!!!  How beautiful that I may be
getting my CDs back soon...  Such perfect synchronicity!</p>
