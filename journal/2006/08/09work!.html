<p>During the lesson I got a call from EV; they want to offer me a job!!  Woot!  Gotta get my
frickin' transcript sent over from UH though.  I wonder if, since I have had a working visa before,
proof of my degree is still in the Japanese government records.  That would be sweet if they can
just look it up.</p>

<p>During the discussion with EV about job timing, I told them I cannot work tomorrow nor Friday;
those are the days I will go get TJ Bike from Odawara!</p>
