<p>Today I took the unpopular trains the wrong ways so I could sit down on the way home.  First up
Hanzomon from Shibuya until the crowds thinned out, and then back into Shibuya where I enjoyed my
seat on a crowded train.</p>

<p>But then my train turned out to be express, so I went past my station to Futakotamagawa where I
got a seat on the vaguely used train back toward Shibuya.</p>

<p>Wrote journal entries and played Marble Blast all the way..</p>
