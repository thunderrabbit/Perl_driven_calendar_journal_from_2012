<p>Met Jesse before work for about 20 minutes walking to the school, chillin' in Lawson's back room
and then he asked Reiko about working up in one of the Ikebukuro schools.</p>

<p>He bought me a ピルクル for drinking purposes.  Delicioso!</p>

<p>He's greatly enjoying his new apartment situation.  He says he's able to sleep very well; it's super quiet!</p>
