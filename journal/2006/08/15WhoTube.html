<p>Found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=geriatric1927">Peter, 79</a>, on YouTube via
slashdot, I think.  Peter has responded to Renetto's query of &quot;Who Are You?&quot;, a video I
would never have seen save for Peter's response to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=renetto">Renetto</a> sold me on the idea of posting
an answer to &quot;Who Are You?&quot; referring to the YouTube viewing public.  So I did.</p>

You?&quot;</a></p>

<p>I felt a bit self-conscious while recording it, but later (while taking a quick shower before
work) I realized I could really get into it, with videos answering all the FAQs I am asked:</p>

<p>What hood I grew up in
<br />What school did I go to</p>

<p>Not those.. Um, crap I forgot, but I had some excellent ideas.</p>
