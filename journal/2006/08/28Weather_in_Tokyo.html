<p>Last week it was comfortably warm for a couple days and everyone including all of my students
were like &quot;wah wah wah wah it's so hot, blah blah, is Texas hot? blah blah&quot;</p>

<p>First: Texas is well bigger than Japan.  In the north it's cold, and in the south it's hot.  But
comparing Tokyo to Houston: Houston is hotter and more humid than Tokyo.</p>

<p>iirc, when I looked up the annual averages, Houston and Tokyo reached the same high temperature
in August...</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>Houston maintains that high for over a week.  Tokyo hits it just 1 or 2 days.</p>

<p>And Houston is more humid.</p>

<p>I'm blessed to have a roommate who *also* doesn't want to use air conditioner.  We just have the
windows open.  No worries.</p>
