<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>

<li><p>I live in Setagaya in Jesse's old room.  He has moved out and I'm living with Michael.  Rent
is 80,000 yen per month plus 7,000 yen utilities.  That's almost twice what I was paying at
Millenium House, but it's too much of a pain to move, plus all my old peeps are probably gone, plus
it's a big mess (rumor has it)</p></li>

<li><p>I am on tourist visa which expires 27 September.  Need to get a work visa sponsored soon or
I'm going to have to bust outta here.  I would like to stay and not go further into debt buying
plane tickets, but with the rent situation as it is, escaping is a consideration.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is a new MacBook, white with Tiger 10.4 and 80Gig HD and 1Gig RAM and other
stuff.  I've used the embedded camera to take funny pictures and video chat with Colleen.</p></li>

<li><p>Purchased Marble Blast from Garage Games and worked on some of my old levels, thanks to Fred
extracting them from some CDs I sent him back in the day.</p>

<p>Also recovered my TMG files and have sent them to Wholly Genes to be upgraded to the latest
versions.  Wholly Genes does not have a Mac version of their software, so it may be a while before I
get back into that.</p></li>

<li><p>Got Hitomi hooked up with pekoneko.com, which is hosted on dreamhost.com, along with
robnugen.com and thunderrabbit.com.  I bought thunderrabbit.com to get started on Dream Host, and
set up rob.thunderrabbit.com to test the new location for robnugen.com before moving it over.</p></li>

<li><p>Got emacs from somewhere, and it's a pretty cool version that handles international characters
like ´Á»ú better, and has a pretty cool feature when searching for files: if I put // or ~, it
knows all the stuff preceeding that is useless, so it gets grayed out.</p>

<p>The source is editable in this version, so I made the changes to sgml-mode.el that I had done in
Mie-ken while on TJ Bike adventure.  Hadn't fixed C-cL to do
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; until just now.</p></li>

<li><p>Have three browsers on my machine: Firefox, Flock, and Camino.  I haven't really used Camino
at all.  I use Firefox primarily, unless I want to add something to my blog and Flock handles that
pretty nicely.  Not sure why I won't just change over to Flock 100%, but I keep seeming not
to.</p></li>

<li><p>Have just gotten reconnected with Kim Sawyer as of last night.  We didn't have a full
coaching session, but plan to do so next week now that we seem to have kinks worked out.</p>

<p>My homework is to write a check in by this weekend.  I noted that he said part of the process is
to grieve lost friendships and even old ideas that no longer fit.</p></li>

<li><p>I would like to get connected with MKP men in Japan; I want to have trainings hosted in
Japan.</p>

<p>I have gotten some names of men, but also have plenty of ways to procrastinate and not face
this.  The first step is trivially easy: just write to them and say HI.</p></li>

<p class="date">3:22pm JST Wednesday  9 August 2006</p>

<li><p>Did it.  Almost got completely sidetracked (as I thought I might).</p></li>

<li><p>Kim Sawyer has just sent me results of my Birkman evaluation thing I took some years ago.  I
read the summaries and they still seem pretty spot-on.</p></li>

<li><p>Have been working on google maps type stuff, and I think I will start that again right about
now.  Almost.</p></li>

<li><p>No girlfriend, no pets, no car.</p></li>

<li><p>Yes Francois, and have just last night put together a slideshow featuring like 100 pics of
Francois, mostly during PB adventures.  Once I regain edit ability, I may add some from Bali, and
TJ Bike.</p></li>

<li><p>TJ Bike is still at Nachiko's house in Odawara.  I am basically 100% shoulderrific (funny how
I'd forgotten that news altogether), and plan to get TJ Bike soon.</p></li>

<li><p>One consideration is finding time; my work (EV) calls me on a day-to-day basis: &quot;can
you work tomorrow???&quot;  Yes.</p>

<p>So I basically just need to decide to go.  I plan to go in the evening, spend the night at
Nachiko's then ride TJ Bike back and complete the journey (minus a few km from Hakone to
Odawara).</p></li>

<li><p>I currently have two private students, 3000 yen per hour each:</p>

<p>Kaoru, whose English is really fantastic; she's working on fine tuning her prepositions,
articles, and subtle differences between similar words.  She lives near my house, so that's really
convenient.</p>

<p>And Sayuri, whose English is pretty good; we meet in Shibuya, and for the past two weeks have
come to McDonald's (where I'm actually writing this now).  Tonight (her birthday), we will go
somewhere else.  (not because of her birthday, but)</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really gotten back into studying Japanese.  Called Ayana once, asked her if she
was interested, she said she would call me back later that day, but she never did.  I called
her <em>three times</em> after that, during a seven day period.  No answer.  I will call her one
more time and then delete her number if no answer.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of doing that, I had gone out twice with Yuka, the bilingual woman who helped me in
the Hakone clinic and who bought me a burger and train ticket back to Tokyo after my crash.  The
first time was fun, and the second time was more like a date, almost, even with a hug at the end.
I called her three times over a two or three week period after that, but never got a response.
Deleted her number.</p></li>

<li><p>I have recently joined 43things.com, writely.com, youos.com, and others... but none have
really really grabbed my attention for long.</p></li>

<li><p>Just today became interested in an online RPG.  But only a free one.  And only a cute one.
No rampant killing.  Found mudcraft.com and secondlife.com.  Downloaded mudcraft, but haven't
gotten past the registration screen for second life.  They severely limit the possible names we can
use in the game.</p>

<p>Best acceptable name I've come up with so far is But Howe</p></li>
