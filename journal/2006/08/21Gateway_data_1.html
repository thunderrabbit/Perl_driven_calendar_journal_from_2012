<p>Success.  Just barely touched on some dream states, but basically remained conscious through the
entire thing.  Was upright for the first 30 minutes and then lay down during the transition from
Focus 10 to Focus 1 and back to Focus 10.</p>

<p>During the final 10 minutes, I dreamt a bit more than the first 30 minutes, perhaps because I
lay down.</p>
