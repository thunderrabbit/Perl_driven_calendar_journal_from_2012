<p>Upon first meeting me, people usually think I'm younger than my birthdate thinks.  Most of my
students think I'm around 25.  Cool.  Nice.  thank you.  I try hard to stay young.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>At times I meet people who are older than me, and, as people do, they seem either older, younger
or the same age as themselves.</p>

<p>I imagined, that at some day, I would hear &quot;when you're as old as me, you won't think
that,&quot; <em>but</em> I will be older than the person already.  Booyah!!!</p>

<p>That didn't happen today.</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>It just about happened, and had my student been a bit more confident with English, I prolly
could have pulled it out of him.</p>

<p>After 10 minutes of &quot;ug; when will this be over&quot; conversation, I was like, &quot;do
you have a dream?&quot;, hoping that he did, and could spark the discussion, but betting he
didn't.</p>

<p>he didn't.  He was too old to have a dream.</p>

<p>&quot;how old are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;31, maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>(( this is not a misquote.  he said &quot;thirty-one, maybe.&quot; ))</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe??&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;are you so certain about your age?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am 13232 days old today.&quot; (for some reason I messed it up, but then corrected it)
&quot;wait wait.  I am 13,303 days old today.&quot; (( don't fuck wit' me and try to prove yer point
by thinking I don't know how old I am. ))</p>

<p>And I proceeded to sell him on counting days instead of bemoaning years.</p>

<p><strike>(gotta student now; gotta go.) - - - - (nevamind; she will be 15 minutes late.)</strike></p>

<p>So I whipped out my trusty laptop and emacs with its calendar program and it quickly calculated
my student is 11570 days old today.  &quot;Today!  only today.  you are eleven thousand five
hundred seventy days old.  Congratulations!&quot;</p>

<p>The new way of thinking took a bit to settle into his brain, but soon he was like,
&quot;celebration every 500 days... not as often as most people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But more <em>real</em> than most people.&quot; and I told him party sizes are related to
the number of zeros in the number.  &quot;Today, for you, one zero.  a small party. This lesson is
your party.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have never heard of this type.  Is it your idea?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;do your family tell you days old?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. My idea.&quot;</p>

<p>My idea.  Basically yes, celebrating every day as beautiful and unique is not my original idea.
But annual celebrations that slowly age into annual depressions is a horrible way of celebrating our
lives!  Turning this annual celebration idea onto its ear and only celebrating Days Old is my idea.
If someone else thought of it, we came up with it independently.</p>

<p>I'm thinking I should expand my days old page, to at least include a Reason, and perhaps the
ability to spew out a slew of 500 days old dates.</p>

<p><em>perhaps</em> buy daysold as a domain and advertise it that way.  At least I should set up
<a href="http://days.robnugen.com/">days.robnugen.com</a> so I can quickly send people to the page.
My homework for tonight. (after hanging out with Yumiko.)</p>
