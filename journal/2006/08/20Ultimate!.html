<p>Headed out to play!</p>

<p>Great day of ultimate.  But even greater to reconnect with peeps and to meet Henry/Hank for the
first time on his last day of play and then join the crew rafting at Draft King near the river.</p>

<p>My shoulder stayed intact throughout the day, another blessing.</p>

<p>I tried to keep from too much verbal spewage unless people were actually asking me about stuff;
part of it is not wanting to be a whiney baby about my shoulder, or braggy about travels, and cause
there's a lot of interesting things in others' lives as well.</p>

<p>Brady and Yuki have both been on PB; Henry is a solo-journey bicycle kinda guy; Jo and Adrien
have been in Japan less than a year (from Singapore); Yasuko enjoys free rent in Saitama; etc.</p>

<p>Magnificent times....</p>
