<p>I'm sitting on the train right beside a guy with a black MacBook.  He has his dock unhidden on
the RHS of the screen, and an external drive.  His camera is on for some reason. Perhaps it's cause
he's doing stuff with photos, but iPhoto doesn't use the camera, I thought...</p>

<p>Hey, I need to write a SOML.</p>
