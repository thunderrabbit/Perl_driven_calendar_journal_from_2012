<p>I tried to merge the latest Marble Blast Gold with settings files from my old version of Marble
Blast.  Got no change for a while, and then I moved several files over and broke the game.
Crud.</p>

<p>But the really stupid thing is those cats at Garage Games haven't responded to my plea FOUR DAYS
AGO to help me purchase the game.  Their javascript won't let me enter a non-US zipcode for my
credit card address...  ack; it's just ridiculous.</p>

<p>I even CCed Alex Swanson because I had traded a couple emails with him before, and I know he's a
pretty heavy hitter in GG.</p>
