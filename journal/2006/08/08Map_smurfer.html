<p>I'm writing some code to let me create a line on a google map..  soon (?) I will have a map of
my TJ Bike adventure available.  Nothing to show just yet, but feel free to toy with
this <a href="/maps/mappointer.html">google maps code that draws a line and prints coords</a>, the
base code for which I got from <a href="http://www.ovationmarketing.com/GMaps/MapMaker.asp">Chris
Haas' map at Ovation Marketing</a>.</p>

<p>My code is a bit cleaned up:</p>

<b>slight tweaks to your MapMaker.asp code</b>

HI Chris

I grabbed your code from http://www.ovationmarketing.com/GMaps/MapMaker.asp and made a couple of
tweaks to it.  I updated it to use v2 of google maps API, and added an "oops" function, to remove
the most recently added point from the list.

The result is currently online at http://robnugen.com/maps/mappointer.html I've included it below as
well, because I am still working on it and may break it soon.

The link mentioned above is not (yet) for public consumption, so please don't post it.

    Thanks
     - Rob

<p>The code has a bug: the oops can remove all but the last point.  Trying to remove that last
point breaks the script, which will have to be reloaded.  Not much data will be lost, though, so
it's a low priority fix.  Anyone who does fix it, feel free to email the fix to amazing_code_fix at
my domain.</p>

<p>NB: the link above is okay now.</p>

<p>Does NB stand for No Brainer???  Certainly not, but it sure fits.</p>
