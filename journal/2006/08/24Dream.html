<p class="dream">Inside a rock quarry home with my father Obi-wan Kenobi, I was coming back home from
work when all the cars in the large parking lot seemed to be gone.  Like 90 percnt of the cars were
taken during the day.  I couldn' find mine where I usually parked it, so I called my dad and he was
like, &quot;actually I moved it today; stay there and I'll come show you where it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">So I stayed there and he arrived, taking me down to a short cut path to where he
had parked the car.  However, the short cut was blocked, so he was like, &quot;okay, this is an
even more secret short cut&quot; and he began to drive backwards down into a tunnel that was a
railroad line, though he had taken no precaution to ensure a train wasn't on it.</p>

<p class="dream">We got well into the tunnel and a train was on its way, so we picked the car up
onto a little ledge up on the side, overlooking the train line.  The train got closer and closer,
though we could not see it due to the track curving out of sight, but the light was getting
brighter, and I looked back to make sure my dad was all prepared, and he was gone.  Vanished
somewhere leaving me in nearly plain view of the train.</p>

<p class="dream">The train turned out to only be two cars long.  I was certain the driver did not
see me, but the conductor in back would have a longer time to gaze back my direcion given the track
went straight for a while before curving out of sight the other direction.</p>

<p class="dream">It appears I must have been spotted, for as the lights dwindled a large goose came
up through that tunnel, ready to pluck me off the side of the wall as a bite sized morsel, but my
dad was on the goose's back, trying to reign it back and ultimately kill it.  I noted that its eyes
were critical to its abilities, so I shouted for my dad to stab its eyes out, which he did and the
goose was destroyed.</p>

<p class="dream">I climbed up and over the wall and over the ledge to safety on the other side,
away from where trains could see us.  My mom, Leia, was there, generally supportive of my father's
technique for saving me, etc.</p>

<p class="dream">I went to sleep and soon noticed my pet had come to sit on my chest.  It could feel
its weight and fuzziness.  I didn't remember having a pet anymore, nor if it was a rabbit or cat, so
this woke me up.</p>

<p>It turned out to be my pillow covered in janette's pillow case.</p>
