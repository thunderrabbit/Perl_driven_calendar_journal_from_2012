<p>Today has been quite chillerific.  Video chatted with Colleen at first, this time featuring her
voice sporadically on her new microphone.  Told me about her latest adventures, including paying
rent and trying to get connected with an equestrian organization in CC.  I hope it all works out
well for her!</p>

<p>Spent a good deal of time on gmap-pedometer.com, a free tool I've been using to create a red
line representing my TJ Bike adventure in April and May.  The last set of points seem not to be
saving though; I hope I haven't lost (much) work.</p>

<p>Did an email volley with Miss Jackie Purdy, proud owner of the naming rights to The Jackie Purdy
Game.  She and Paul are still well; she likes having projects, and she's preparing to move soon.</p>

<p>Did a strange chat volley with Jesse; he didn't want to talk (type?) so he sent me images
representing what he otherwise wanted to say to me.  I didn't get it at first, but it could be a
fun game.  Perhaps The Chatty Jesse Game.</p>

<p>Cooked something sloppy but edible: onions, sausages, tofu, sliced, cut, squished, fried.</p>

<p>Read most of an article <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/features/general/060801fege01">detailing
events of Airplane Day</a>, including several snippets from NEADS' phone recordings during the 6
hours of wacky antics on that morning.</p>

<p>Got an invite from Matt The Artist to visit his place tonight.  I am headed there now.  I
invited Kaoru and then Miki.</p>

<p>Definitely fun.</p>
