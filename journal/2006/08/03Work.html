<p>Arrived at work in plenty of time today.  4.33 hours of classes today.</p>

<p>I've decided not to name each student, due to privacy issues.</p>

<p class="date">10:42pm JST</p>

<p>Work was cool; I got to chat with a girl (high schooler) who's leaving in just a few days for a
full year homestay in the US.  Holy cripes she will come back a changed person.  I taught her basics
like names of coins and who is on 1 / 5 dollar bills, and unit conversions and shtuff.  Her English
level is fine.</p>

<p>A different student asked if I was a full time teacher there.</p>

<p>&quot;No, but tell Reiko if you'd like me to be.&quot;</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Talked to Reiko for a while during my last lesson, which was a no-show.</p>
