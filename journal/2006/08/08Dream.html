<p class="dream">Kissed Shalini from PB49.  I felt quite nervous and quite certain it was her first
time to kiss anyone.  I wondered if I would have to marry her, or at least be committed to dating
her for a while.</p>

<p class="dream">In a train station and the station attendat asked if I had ever umped over th
gates in order to see what tme the tran would be coming.  I was like, &quot;of course not, because
the times are indicated outside the gate area as well.</p>

<p class="dream">A bus arrived and he used his foot (wearing multi-colored toe-socks) to help the
driver lower the window, which was apparently stuck.  I got into the passenger seat where a cute
woman was seated.  I started to play with her short red hair.  She had a septum piercing; it was
rather small and almost not visible outside her nostrils.  The first thing she said was she was
excited to go visit a certain bar; she backed up her claim by stating she was a wild girl and could
be rather annoying..</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;welp, I guess I won't be going with you.&quot; but I kept playing
with her hair until I realized I should stop.  I explained that annoying is okay, but wild is not.
I claimed my ex-fiance was annoying, but only in a cute and predictable way.  Not wild.</p>

<p>(For the record, I don't think Wende was annoying.)</p>
