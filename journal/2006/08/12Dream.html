<p class="dream">With Audrey from PB working on a project.  I knew what she needed, but I couldn't
remember what floor the office was on, so I asked her, then jetted toward the elevator.  It was a
really old style elevator, combining a rotating wall as a door that would squeeze people into the
elevator to keep them safely away from the edges.  We crammed four people into the elevator but
then went past the 5th floor because we had taken so long to get inside that it forgot which button
we had pushed.</p>

<p class="dream">The elevator memory was quite limited, so unless it was on its way to a
destination, its next destination was set as the most recent button pushed, including requests from
outside beckoning the elevator's service.  We went up to the 10th floor where no one could get on,
and then back down to the 1st floor, at which point I decided to just run up the stairs, though they
wrapped around the entire inner perimeter of the building and would take a long time to ascend, I
thought it would end up being faster than the old elevator.</p>

<p class="dream">Back on PB again, and the ship was headed up a really small canal, with residences
on both sides.  Nick and Isabel were being really loud and I told them to be quiet; we needed to
respect people around us because we were no longer in open sea.  They were not impressed with my
request, but then realized where we were and thanked me for the alert.</p>
