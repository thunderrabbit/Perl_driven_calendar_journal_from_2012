<p>KG Miki and I needed to take the same line to our respective houses, so I had her check the last
train coming back to my station.  Just to squeeze those last few minutes of chillin' time out of
the dwindling time to last train.</p>

<p>Right now I'm a bit tired, so I know I'm a bit more cuddly than normal, but I know I'm generally
safe with Miki because she won't exacerbate any advances.  Just smile a little shrug.</p>
