<p>Been watching some youtube videos, mostly Jon Stewart bashing the government, &quot;tha 'merican
people are safer.&quot; and the like..</p>

<p>Also got an email from Noah of <a href="http://88slide.com/">88slide</a> giving a likely air date
of 14 September for the 88Slide video featuring me!!</p>

<p>I'm excited about it and hope it turns out well.  I've been most concerned that Rachel says my
name right; I sent Noah a video of me saying my name.  Corny, I know, but if Rachel were to
mispronounce my name... heartbreak!!</p>

<p>He was also excited about the clip I sent of the Rockabillies in Yoyogi.  If I don't have to work
on Sunday, perhaps I will rock back out there and ask the question &quot;who are these
guys???&quot;</p>
