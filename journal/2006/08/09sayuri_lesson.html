<p>Lesson with Sayuri was good; we met at Hachiko and tried a new cafe to chat, but they don't have
internet access.  I did use the internet at McDonald's for some hours today before the lesson,
though.  We chatted about random blah blah and she asked some good questions.  Even had some good
advice.</p>
