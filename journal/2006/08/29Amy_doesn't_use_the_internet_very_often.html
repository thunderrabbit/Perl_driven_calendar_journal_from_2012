<p>and her life seems outrageously amazing.</p>

<p>Because she's not online often, I am not going to post her wonderfully long email to me, but to
summarize, Amy Leyenberger is doing wonderfully, traveling around the world, with plans to settle
and create a farm after doing an independent research project on creativity and healing.</p>

<p>Her email <em>blew me away</em> with its maturity.  Amy seems well-centered, well-focused,
well-balanced, and right on her life path...  It's utterly fantastical!</p>

<p>Wow wow wow.</p>
