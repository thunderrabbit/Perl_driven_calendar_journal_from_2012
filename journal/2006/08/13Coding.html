<p>Good progress this morning on my maps code.  I am definitely closer than I was last night.  Now
it can read from the DB the names of the routes.  Next step is to select a name and actually load
the route.  Pretty sure I know how to do that, and get all the points from the db loaded into my
javascript points array.</p>

<p>At this rate, I will <em>probably</em> have my first day of TJ Bike trek available by tonight!</p>

<p>I know *I* will be able to see the route, but will the code be good enough to let everyone bang
on it?  That's the question..</p>

<p>Right now, it's showertime, cause it's been a couple days..</p>

<p>Crud.  Closer, but a bit stuck (mostly lack of concentration) but only a bit.  Naptime.</p>

<p>Ah.  Nice.  I figured out how to get the script to work.</p>

<ol>
<li>The points in Google map's API are not just arrays of points, but actually objects of type
GLatLng.</li>
<li>GLatLng is only defined once the page has loaded, so can only be used inside function
definitions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tomorrow: hopefully, something worthy of public display.</p>
