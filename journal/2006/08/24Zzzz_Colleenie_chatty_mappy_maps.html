<p>Great chat with Colleen tonight, and video chat for a while, including sharing slide.com
shows.</p>

<p>I've finished my map thing just enough to show a few people the first 5 days of my TJ Bike
journey:  /cgi-bin/maps?journeyID=1  Intentionally not linking it because I
don't want everyone/thing hitting it just yet.</p>

<p>Oh, and it doesn't work in Internet Explorer. <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Get Firefox</a>.</p>
