Hi Nachiko!!

How are you?  How did you enjoy departure?  I wasn't able to watch the ship leave.  Too sad being on
the wrong side of the water!

How is TJ Bike?  If possible, I would like to come get him soon.  If possible, I would like to leave
Odawara early in the morning so I can be sure to have enough daylight hours to get back to Tokyo.

Would it be possible to stay overnight at your house some night?  If not, I can work out something else.

What is your schedule like next week?  I have two students on Wednesday each week.  Other than that,
I can keep my schedule clear.

      See you hopefully soon!
         - Rob
