<p>Working in Shibuya today.  Supposed to start at 5:20pm.  I will tell Reiko today that I'm
willing to pay the 10,000 yen visa sponsorship fee if that will help them sponsor my visa.</p>

<p>(( Apparently there was no suicide upon the train that just passed so, so I should make it to
work with no worries.  No motorcycle zoomin' for me today. ))</p>

<p>Cripes.  The train stopped one station short of Shibuya.  Station attendants are running around
looking at the other track.</p>

<p>Okay; moving now.</p>

<p>Work was good: 4 hours of straight lessons.  The most interesting was a mom and daughter pair,
where the daughter, though 26 years old, was <em>amazingly shy</em>.  She kept looking to her
mother for ..  something more basic than what to say, because she wasn't saying anything.  I found
out she likes to draw so I had her draw a rabbit and write down its favorites, and then had her
read those things and then fill in the blanks with her own favorites.  That was at the very end of
the lesson.  When Reiko asked, the mom said it was すごく楽しかった, which is quite good.</p>

<p>I also called Tokudasan to see if I can get full time work there.  He said he'll call me
tomorrow.  Reiko is really surprised he hasn't given me a straight answer.</p>
