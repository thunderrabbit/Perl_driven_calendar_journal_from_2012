<p>Meeting with  Rick was productive..  we met separately after the four-party meeting in El
Torito.  Rick and I busted out after that and hit a McDs for beverages and internet access.</p>

<p>Actually before that, I went to EV to talk to Reiko about new MKP project that I want to
incorporate into my life..  Still told her I can work in the next few weeks; nothing is happening
immediately, but..  I just wanna stay on top and in integrity and keep people informed of what's
the dealio, etc.  Basically I see three options.</p>

<ol>
<li>stay here and do nothing</li>
<li>go to US and focus only on MKP</li>
<li>find a balance</li>
</ol>

HI David

Hawaii as a transitional point from US mainland to Japan seems quite logical.

(( For clarity: I must state I am not Asian.  Some people see my last name and think of Nguyen,
which is Vietnamese.  I'm as Caucasian as we come.. ))

I totally agree that bringing the training to Japan (and/or any part of Asia) will require enormous
cultural consideration.

> How can I be of service in getting you on a weekend as staff? ASAP? 


This question has been ringing loudly in my mind.  It seems there are basically three options:

1) For me to leave Japan now, help lead some weekends, then be a Leader in MKP who wants to have the
training in Japan.

2) Stay in Japan now, begin attending the bi-weekly I-group I have just recently found, do not lead
any weekends (at least not in the next several months)

3) Stay in Japan, begin attending bi-weekly I-group meetings, fly back to US for some weekends to
gain experience as a leader.

---

Option 3 is the best for me.  But it requires a lot of money to fly back and forth.

Perhaps if there is an angel investor who wishes to have trainings expanded to Japan, that person
would be willing to fund my travel expenses to live in Japan and attend training weekends in the US.

---

Option 2 is second best, and I believe most realistic.  I am already in Japan, and the I-group already exists.

---

Option 1 is possible, but seems ill-planned and short-sighted.  What would I do in the US between
trainings?  Where would I live?  How could I get started again in Japan once I've done some
trainings? etc etc

------------

Thank you again for reading and helping me consider possibilities.

<p>That's what I wrote to David, who is a leader in MKP.  He also said he is also interested in
bringing the training to Japan.</p>

<p>We can do this thing.  :-)</p>

<p>Gotta leave soon to visit Nachiko in Odawara and ride TJ Bike back tomorrow!!</p>
