<p>I'm headed to work.  On the way to the station trying to walk with good posture, with the
intention of remaining well-aligned and not slumped over when I'm old.</p>

<p>Weird: there is a new message on the train announcements in English.  Basically &quot;don't run
for the train, you may slip and fall...&quot;</p>

<p>duh.</p>

<p>I finally remembered to look up where <a href="http://metropolis.co.jp/">Metropolis</a> is
available in Shibuya.  Plan to snag a (few) cop(y|ies) on the way to work.</p>
