<p>Hung out with Yumiko after work; practiced a lot of Japanese.  Started with her showing me the
best customer service bank in Shibuya.</p>

<p>Ended up chowing at El Torito but missing deadline for ice cream at Haagen Dasz (why can I never
spell this correctly??)</p>

<p>We live one station from each other, so ate conveni ice cream in a »û between our stations.</p>

<p>Shared a lot of quiet time together, half because of language barriers and half because it was nice.</p>
