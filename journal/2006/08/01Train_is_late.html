<p>Shit.</p>

<p>Trains in Tokyo are almost never late.  Usually exactly on time.  This train is late.  When I
arrived, it was about 30 seconds late, but now it is over 8 minutes late.  It's getting into 17:47
timeframe, which is when the latest train I can take to still get to Shibuya on time.</p>

<p class="date">5:44pm JST</p>

<p>A guy just came up, &quot;hey man, how's your Japanese?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Totally shit man, I have no idea what the deal is.  But people are escaping, so it looks bad.&quot;</p>

<p>at the same time he was like, &quot;people are bailing; I'm outta here, too.&quot;</p>

<p>At 6pm, a new flood of people left after a certain announcement.  Chaos near the ticket gates as
people crowded to get their money back.  I knew I couldn't waste time doing that; I can explain
later why my ticket thinks I'm still in the system.</p>

<p>Blew through the gates and ran upstairs (as a cop was coming down the stairs!) and outside.
Fortunately not crowded; I had been worried cause there was a huge crowd in the station around the
gates.  Wish I had had my camera!!</p>

<p>I saw the guy who had asked me if I knew what was up.  Told him about the cops; we agreed some
bad shit had happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps just a suicide, but there was no suicide at <em>this</em> station.... why cops?</p>

<p>Taxi taxi taxi... hmmmm.. ah.  <em>motorcycle</em>!</p>
