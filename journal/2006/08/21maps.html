<p>Ack.</p>

<p>I thought I had all the bugs squished from my maps code...  or at least enough so that I can
release it, but there is a major flaw: journeys don't load multiple routes correctly.  Given that
routes all load correctly by themselves, and my journeys code just calls the route loader multiple
times, I am hoping that I can do a quick fix in the AM when I'm a bit more awake-ish.</p>

<p>But for now I have 3 days worth of TJ Bike ride plotted out (some in pretty rought coordinates,
but good enough for first draft), and am just about ready to start plotting more points.</p>

<p>Bedtime first.</p>
