<p>I'm up too late for my own goodness, but it's all good.  Been watching Youtube Blue Angels and
post Airplane Day commentary and
saw <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/08/06/sept11.theories.ap/index.html">finally some
mainstream articles about the demolition of WTC</a>.</p>

<p>Dude replied to the article: <a href="http://robnugen.com/blog/?p=67">Dude replies to Airplane
Day inside job</a></p>
