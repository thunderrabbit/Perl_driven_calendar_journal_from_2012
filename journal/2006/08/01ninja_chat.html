<p>Got to chat a bit with Hannah Banana from Memphis!  I met her when I visited my friend Lisa on
my first solo-road trip around some of the eastern US states.  Mostly we just said HI and she asked
questions about Tokyo and how much Japanese I know.  not much.  Well, more than that; I think I
don't give myself enough credit, but when I hear people who have actually studied..  wow.</p>

<p>Good to see Hannah is happy!</p>
