<p>I <em>think</em> I will be able to get big progress done on my TJ Bike map by tomorrow.  I have
a hardly-user-friendly tool that will let me plot points on a google map and then display those
points.  Next step is to display the points in a format that I can import into mySQL.  And then
write code that can read points from mySQL.</p>

<p>Cool.  I just finished writing the part that can store the data into mySQL.  Now just got to
read it.  But first, a nap.</p>
