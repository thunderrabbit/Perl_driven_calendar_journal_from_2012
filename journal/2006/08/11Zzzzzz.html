<p>Falling asleep here; worked on maps code, played secondlife a little bit (my character name is
Blinking Signals (because we can't choose our last name or just one name) and watched three
episodes of Simpsons after Michael got home.</p>

<p>Got an email from the mom from Tokaido line, but no email address to write her back.</p>

<p>I'm in touch again with the woman who called herself Tatyana.  This time she is calling herself
Natalia.  I am pretty sure it's the same person because s/he's using the same email address.  Not
sure if I will make a new 3rd level domain name or what.  She sent two pictures I hadn't gotten last
time.</p>

<p>Before I write, I need to think of a good persona for myself.  I'm thinking of living on Rapa
Nui, or an island without a big airport.</p>
