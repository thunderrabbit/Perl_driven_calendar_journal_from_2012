<p>I've decided to write some Japanese each day.  We'll see how long <em>that</em> lasts.</p>

<p>I just now wrote that I went to ultimate at Tamagawa the other day, and like my barefoot days in
college, I played barefoot.  But unlike college, where the other ultimate players called me
Wonderboy, I was just Rob.  Perhaps if I were to go every week, I could become Wonderboy again.
But I pretty much have to work each Sunday.  Sigh.</p>
