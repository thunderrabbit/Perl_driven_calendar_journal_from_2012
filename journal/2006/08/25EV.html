<p>Wow.  80 minutes of a man who just talked and talked and talked but I couldn't understand
basically *anything* he said.  Like 80% of his words I had no idea what they were or how they
related to their brethren, or if he was quoting someone or himself or making a joke or emphasizing
a point or speaking a different language....</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>He would then ask, &quot;do you understand?&quot; and I'd be like, &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p>Then I just had Aya for 40 minutes of her polite smile and bright eyes as she gave me yoga
instructions in Japanese and I translated them to English for her.  I pulled a lot of memories from
working with Catherine back in the day.  Man I miss those lessons.</p>
