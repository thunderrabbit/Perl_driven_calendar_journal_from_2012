<p>The Master Genealogist is a genealogical research/archive tool introduced to me by my dear
Laura (Guennie from BBST) back in the day (1992?).  She still avidly uses the software and has
probably done more research on her genes every year since then than I have ever.</p>

<p>So she was the perfect person to ask last night if she could hook a brotha up with some data
updation.</p>

<p>&quot;No problem,&quot; says she, &quot;just send it to [Wholly Genes] and they will update it
for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No wow about it; they want your business, and they are professional genealogists!&quot;</p>

<p>そうだね。。。</p>

<p>So tha next thing I did was email them to get confirmation and deets.  Confirmed; just send my
data and it's all good. </p>
