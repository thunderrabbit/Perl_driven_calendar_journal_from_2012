<p class="dream">In a group of people in a circle with Kevin and I on opposite sides, in a work
situation ish, we were asked why we don't hang out more..  and we were like, &quot;we hang out in
I-group and on email, but&quot; and then he finished, &quot;but we don't know where the other
lives, because then we would drop by all the time,&quot; and I finished, &quot;but we basicaly
don't have enough time to hang out [more than we do already].&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">It was an interesting realization, and pretty strange, I thought.  I asked him if
he was part of Mankind Project in the US, but he said no; if he had said yes, I was going to invite
him to my I group.</p>

<p class="dream">Doing some freestyle walking on rocks and stuff outside, I was trying to scamper
up a little semi-slanted short verticle crook, like the guys in France, and I just happened to put
my hand on a little forgotten wad of US currency.</p>

<p class="dream">(wow!) and in an instant, I decided to keep it (given that I was outside, with no
one else in sight to claim ownership) and put it in my wallet.</p>

<p class="dream">Once I was inside, Isabel asked me if I knew where a high=end grocery store was
located around here.  I knew I had seen one, but couldn't remember where exactly.</p>

<p class="dream">Then I got a phone call from my travel agent, basically asking if I wanted to
arrange a shuttle from the airport once I arrived home.  I had plenty of cash and didn't want to
worry about such details once I arrived, so I was like, &quot;yes.&quot;</p>
