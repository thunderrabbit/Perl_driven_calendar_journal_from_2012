<p>Jesse and I are going to meet in Shibuya soonishly.  We were funny in chat, talking about prime
numbers and stuff after I noted it was 12:34pm when we started chatting:</p>

<pre>
me: hey
Jesse: hey
me: it's 1234 o'clock
Jesse: wassup
yes it is
me: what time are we meeting on Friday?
Jesse: 1234
me: okay
1234 is good for me, too
Jesse: anytime
ok 1234
then
lunch too?
me: I will need to splt by 135
or 1357 for sure
but we can get a lunch in there
Jesse: there is no 135
me: it's 35 minutes after 1300
Jesse: or could be 5 minutes after 1300
your statement is ambiguous
me: yah, but it's numerically pure
no pesky even numbers
Jesse: oh the purity from odd numbers
me: zactkly
Jesse: yes, even numbers can be divided
we don't want them
me: hahaha
only prime numbers for me, please
like 1237
okay, so 1234 on Friday
Jesse: 12357
me: do I owe you money?
Jesse: yeah 1234
me: coo
I will bring it
Jesse: no, i owe you
me: if yu have change for 1500
Jesse: bring what?
me: I'm willing to accept money.
I'm being silly
and answering as if your answers to my previous questions are intended for my most recent questions
Jesse: how many hours did you work on the tapes?
i see
me: I don't remember
Jesse: 20..something
great
me: sounds good
Jesse: you wrote it down
me: I would say I spent about 40% of what you did on them
Jesse: i did one extra job than you
me: Even if I could find the paper, I don't know if I could positively identify it
Jesse: great...
me: yah, I remember the last job you did was like 1 tape or so
Jesse: I "think" it was 22 or 24
me: and you told a story about not wanting to split such small jobs..
Jesse: that one tape took me 7 hours
me: 22 or 24 is great
I honestly don't remember and will be happy with anything
Jesse: ok it will be 23 then
me: only 23???
Jesse: since it is a prime number
me: HAHahahahaha
nice
Jesse: what!
23 times 30 is...
me: oh, I thought you meant 23 seconds
you should be more careful with units, there, Mr Assumptious
690
Jesse: hahahah
minus 10% of tax
so 620
me: 23 * 30 = 690 - 10% = 621
620 is equally cool
Jesse: right, 621, that is a prme number, so I will give you that
me: I'll bring 379 yen change
Jesse: no it inst'!!!
me: sorrry
Jesse: 623 then
me: is it prime??
Jesse: yeah
gotta be prime
must be
not sure, but prolly it is
me: 7 * 89, boyiiiii
Jesse: oooh yeah, you're gonna get served 623...
too bad, you gettin that UN-prime number YO!
me: dawg!
Jesse: UN-PRIME! HA!
me: Don be sendin' me no composite cash payment!
Jesse: i ain't you dawg, cuz i gonna serve you that composite stash
me: How about 619?
That's definitely prime
Jesse: hmmm... 619
me: I just checked it
Jesse: sure
me: AND
it's the same upside down
Jesse: Ok, WOWOWOWO!!! Upside down too!
me: wowowooooooooo!
Jesse: damn boyiiiii!
me: and then you can buy lunch with the remaining 3 yen
Jesse: you a genius
me: yep
Jesse: cool
me: I know how to use my computer to calculate prime factors
Jesse: shiiiiiiiiiiiit dawg

Jesse: shhhhhhhhhh, quiet
me: how about some Prime Minister Soilent Green?
Jesse: eh?
me: that's disgusting sorry
Jesse: I know Soilent Green the movie
