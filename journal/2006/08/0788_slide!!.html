<p>Yay 88 Slide!  Jesse braved the heat and recorded about 7 takes of me doing my first guest spot
on 88 Slide today in Shibuya.  (That be the answer to the question, by the way.)  (shhhhhh!!!)</p>

<p>I plan to import the video into my machine and send to Noah, so he can do a pre-screening.  I
will actually mail him the tape if he says it is good enough for the show.  Unless he has a big ftp
server somewhere...</p>

Thanks, Rachel!

I'm in the middle of Tokyo, a metropolis of over 12 million people!

Actually Tokyo is made up of 23 smaller cities called ku.

My question for you today:

In which ku am I standing?

A. Kookoorookoo ku
B. Shibuya ku
C. Shinjuku, or
D. Harlem ku

Okay, back to you Rachel!
