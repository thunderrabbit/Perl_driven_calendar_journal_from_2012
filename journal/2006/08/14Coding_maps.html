<p>Even closer to getting an alpha version out.  Plus, last night I found GLatLng.distanceFrom, and
am using that to calculate the total distance of the route.</p>

<p>Right now working on the interface to allow display of data points so that I can write them to
mySQL.  Basically I have figured out how to pull data from mySQL into the Javascript map, but not
figured out how to write the lat/lng data from Javascript to mySQL (through perl).  I am using
CGI::Ajax, which can send information from Javascript to perl, but it can't (by default (which I
don't know if/how/where to change)) send the large volume of data for hundreds of points at a
time.</p>

<p>Nice.  I've gotten data to save (via a cut-n-paste) from javascript to mySQL.  I believe I've
figured out how to get it to happen with a single button click via perl, but haven't implemented it
yet.  Now just need to correctly load data, and we'll be set.</p>

<p>Oh, actually I need to add two more parameters to the route saving: mapCenter and zoomLevel.</p>

<p>Yes!  I got it to load a set of points from db.  I forgot to add the parameters mentioned above,
though.  They will come soon.</p>

<p>Time now, however, to start getting ready for I-group.</p>
