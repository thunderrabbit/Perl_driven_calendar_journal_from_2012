<p>Made it back to Tokyo with TJ Bike!!  It seemed a lot quicker than I expected, though at times
TJ Bike seemed a lot heavier than before.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I guess because I took the train back, and when not on the train, carried TJ Bike on my back.
1300 yen to get back from Kamonomiya, primarily via Tokaido sen.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Nachiko for all her help in getting TJ Bike safely home.  Recovering him from
the police station, storing him at her house, picking me up at the train station last night, and
getting us to a bike shop this morning.</p>

<p>Our plan had been to have a nice ride around the river near her house and then chill in a
park.. but after getting on TJ Bike, I realized the source of my accident:</p>

<p>The brakes didn't work worth shit.</p>

<p>Though I got them fixed in Kobe (thanks to Richard getting me to a competent bike shop), they
were crap again by Hakone, causing me to eat dirt and then meet pavement.</p>

<p>No more crashing due to failed parts for me, so we went to a bike shop, but neither he nor his
friend could fix them to my satisfaction.  I basically want all new brakes.</p>

<p>Chilled with Nachiko in Mister Donuts for a bit, then she helped me load TJ Bike into a bag for
the trip home.  That's when TJ Bike started getting heavy.</p>

<p>I was quite pleased to see the station was on Tokaido line; I'm quite familiar with its route in
Tokyo.  Zoom straight to 品川行って、山手線で渋谷に行って、田園都市線で帰った。(*)</p>

<p>On Tokaido line, starting from 4 or 5 stations from Kawasaki to Kawasaki, I met a mom and her
kids a bit after she asked me if my big bag contained a bicycle.  Her son was too cool to talk
(being about Jr High age), but her daughter gave me a piece of candy.  We got through a few
questions and talked a bit about Francois after I saw the daughter's Poohbear keychain thing.  Gave
them a <a href="/images/peeps/Francois/">link to Francois' slideshow</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, a good day.  And 12 more hours to go!</p>

2:42 PM Fred: ok
          me: AND AND AND AND AND there is a funny thing
              you got 5 mins?
        Fred: whassat?
              yeah, but not more
2:40 PM   me: In Shibuya, there are three train lines owned by the same company
        Fred: k
          me: but they don't physically connect. People have to exit the platform area and go to the next one
              Transferring from one line to another (of the same company) costs nothing
2:41 PM but exiting the gates and reentering costs something.
              SO
        Fred: .
          me: they have a way to tell the tickets that we are going to transfer to the same company's other line
2:42 PM Fred: ok
          me: For some reason, during the day those tickets (with credit to enter the other lines)
              pile up (like 4 or 5) and are available at the specific turnstiles..
2:43 PM it's like peope use the transfer tickets, but then don't Take The Ticket with them
              SO these tickets are like an untapped resource that the train company is happy to throw away periodically
              and I am happy to use
        Fred: and you're happy to captialize...?
          me: perfect!
        Fred: haha
          me: there is an even better word..
              harness
2:44 PM Fred: heh
          me: "every year thousands of lemmings..... ... if we could somehow harness this energy, we
              could keep their lives from being wasted"
              I just go grab a ticket and boom only 20 cents or FREE to go home
2:45 PM Work will pay for both ways to and from.. and I just use TO
              can't do it at my station; there are no other lines to transfer
        Fred: haha
              cool!
          me: def
2:46 PM Fred: aiiite
              i gots to go
          me: though I'm just thinking about it... I will have to bang out the numbers to see if I can actually capitalize
        Fred: a friend is in town
          me: seeeeeeeeee you
        Fred: aiight
              lemme know how it goes!
          me: peace
              tru
        Fred: just sell them, yo
              at work?
          me: haha
              like homer simpson selling sugar
        Fred: to ur students?
          me: to sketchy
        Fred: heh
          me: would never work
2:47 PM Fred: tru
