<p>Last night was the first night I slept with the window open; Jesse had had it blocked to keep
out the noise and light.  I 100% prefer the natural filtered lighting of earth's visual alarm clock
when wondering about the time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was a bit worried that I might not have enough sleep since I had only allocated 6.5
hours... but I woke up with no worries before my alarm alerted me of impending deadlines.  In fact,
woke up a few times with awesome dreams, all of which have flittered from my braincells, but.</p>

<p>I feel blessed to be lulled to sleep by noisy traffic.</p>
