<p class="dream">In a rather tall building, on the 7th floor, I wanted t go down.  The elevator had
no doors or walls; just a floor.  Jason (Faisal) was in it (on it) but it was about to go up.
Another friend got on mistakenly, though he wanted to go down.  Then the elevator switched and
started to go down.  I jumped on because I also wanted to go own.  The extra weigt made the elevator
speed up until we were free fall for a momet.  I wanted to aologize to my friends, but the elevator
ecovered in the las few oments and we were okay.</p>
