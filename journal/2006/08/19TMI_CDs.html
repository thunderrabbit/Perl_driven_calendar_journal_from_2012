<p>Awesome!</p>

<p>I have just received the <a href="http://www.monroeinstitute.com/">TMI</a> CDs that I had loaned
to Hitomi before the 49th PB voyage..  so it's been a few days since I've listened to them!</p>

<p>In an awesome synchronicity, I have just recently met a TMI traner, who gave me a suggestion for
how to stay awake during the CD: &quot;sit up.&quot;</p>

<p>Pure genius.</p>

<p>So, without much more ado, I shall go try it.</p>
