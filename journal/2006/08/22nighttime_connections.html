<p>Wowzers to all the connections tonight!  Right after work, Jesse called me and invited me to
join him and Kellie in Jiyugaoka &quot;on my way home&quot; (perhaps my old home, but not current
one).. We took the train back to Shibuya as they chattered about booths at Gaba and wondering if
they should come work at EV instead.  We said bye to Jesse in Shibuya, then Kellie and I went to
the big Starbucks (highest grossing in the world, I have heard) and told stories while we watched the freaks below, which
included Phil from PB!!  Kellie called him and after finishing the lovely cheesecake and vanilla
slushy, we headed to the front of OutBack where a drunk guy was zonked out face down on the steps (perhaps
should have gotten a Francois photo with him, but I'd prefer only willing participants).  Chatted
with Phil and his mate (whose name I instantly forgot) and then a couple he met at a party came
up.  It was like a Phil party right outside!  Kellie told lotsa stories about baseball games and I
misguessed Lisa to be from South Africa instead of New Zealand (don't know why I was really pushing
for a longshot, but it just came like *snap*!) and the party slowly broke up as last trains needed
to be caught.</p>

<p>Kellie and I took our line as far as my station where we mockingly did young couple in love torn
away by fate and transportation.</p>

<p>Fun times!</p>
