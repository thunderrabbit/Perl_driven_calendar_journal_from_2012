<p>Just had a multiple hour fantastic chat with Colleenie Beanie!!!  But not only chat; it
was <em>video</em> chat; my first one!!</p>

<p>When we got the video part connected, I nearly started to cry like oh my god I miss you so
much!!!</p>

<p>She didn't have a mic, so I could talk and she had to type or gesture.</p>

<p>I showed her Francois and she showed me Fiver and told stories of SWUUSI and who's
getting/gotten married and it was totally totally great great great!</p>

<p>At the end, we had to do a 1..2..3.. hang up because neither of us wanted to.  She has to sleep,
and I need to eat and think about going to work.</p>
