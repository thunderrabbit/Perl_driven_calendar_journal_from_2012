<p>Tried to open a bank account today, but they were quite hesitant when I told them I don't have an
gaijin card (alien registration).  I don't know if it was them &quot;politely&quot; not telling me
that I must have a card, or if it was just plain ol' racism (which happens a lot around here).</p>

<p>I grabbed a new account form and plan to perhaps go back once I have a card.  Reiko helped me
fill out the form.  I could likely have gotten a lot of it right, but even with her help, I
accidentally wrote ¶è instead of ¥¯ in the ¥Õ¥ê¥¬¥Ê box for my work address.  Ah well.  It's pretty
funny in a way.</p>
