<p><b>TJ Bike back in Tokyo...</b></p>

<pre>No news is good news with me and TJ Bike.

I have deemed my shoulder 100% healed, and decided to go back to Odawara to get TJ
Bike and ride back to Tokyo and finish the journey.

Things didn't quite work out that way; I recognized the back brakes were basically
useless (this is likely a primary cause of my accident), so I didn't want to ride
back home.  Fortunately, I had left my bike bag with TJ Bike.  Packed TJ Bike into
the bag and took the train back home.

In other news, I have gotten full time work!  This is good news for I will begin
some positive cash flow to pay back the debt after a wonderful 15 months of
traveling.  It does mean I will be in Tokyo for another year, so that's one more
year of not seeing friends and family back home.

Also, I have found a few men in Tokyo from Mankind Project (<a href="http://www.mkp.org">http://www.mkp.org</a>), it
will be a great blessing to reconnect with this energy.

No travel plans at this point (though I have just added blank pages to my
passport!) so probably no more Rob Updates for a while.

Please send *your* updates!  I love to know how my friends are doing.

   Peace and Love
   Hugs and Blessings
