<p>Reiko said my student (Mariko) had been totally chill with rescheduling if necessary, and she
knew what kinda chaos was going on.  Reiko said Mariko said people were totally amok, though we
still don't know what happened.</p>

<p>My student now is late; I wonder if it's part of the same deal.  (still???)</p>
