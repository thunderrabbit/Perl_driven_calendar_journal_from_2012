<p>今日高田馬場に行ってプィルと会ってしゃべりました。</p>

<p>We caught up on PB gossip and upcoming plans (his vacation and my job).  I was inspired and wrote
a few letters to GET Peeps I know on board: Carla, Tony, Natalie.  Wrote Carla and Nat normal
letters and a semi-rap poem thing for Tony.  It was pretty ... noteworthy, though I didn't think to
write it up before sending it.</p>

<p>Said HI to Allison (who is here from New York office!) and Pat and Sachie and Chris (56th
coordinator (who asked if I am interested in sailing again (def!))) and Mariko, and Rei and Yuuka
and Levi and Rachel.  I think that's all (eep!)</p>

<p>So great to reconnect with such good energy with such awesome people!!</p>
