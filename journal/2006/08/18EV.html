<p>On break right now after my first two students: Riho and Aya.</p>

<p>Riho is 14 and doing pretty darn well: huge retention and I'm expanding well beyond the source
material in the book.  I played a game of hang man with her to teach her what letters are.  (She
was trying to recall a word and wanted to ask me what was the first letter, but she didn't know the
word &quot;letter&quot;)  This was an idea of genius, but in the end I forgot to confirm she got
the new vocabulary word (letter, the word).</p>

<p>After Riho, Aya, who was quite .... shy, though it was only her second lesson.  I discovered
she's the owner(?) of a hot yoga studio and wanted to learn English to help her foreign clientelle.
So I ditched the book altogether and did some roleplays of me as a customer and she starring as
herself telling me what was what in the studio.</p>

ゆう and めぐみ are hilarious.  They definitely don't study, and are hardly serious in the
lesson, chattering away in Japanese, but they sure were a lot of fun, and ゆう has a cute diamond
stud on her upper left lateral incisor.</p>

<p>After their lesson, I met a guy whose English was worse, but who seemed way way more interested
in studying; unless it's just a whim, he will rocket past them.  I gave him a ton of ideas for ways
to study.</p>

<p>Met a woman named ひろこ with pretty good speakin' skills who captured my thoughts when she was like,
&quot;but I don't know what I want to do in the world.&quot;  Me neither.</p>

<p>I told her how awesome PB was; I hope she checks it out.</p>
