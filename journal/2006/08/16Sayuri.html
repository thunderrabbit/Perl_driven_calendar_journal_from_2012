<p>I made the train with 1/2 second to spare.</p>

<p>Good times; we scoped some different cafes, then headed to what will possibly become our
standby. <!--  Royal Host  --> Ended the lesson abruptly at 10pm cause I had to meet Kim by phone at
11pm.</p>

<p>Sayuri and I weren't as flirty as before, but it was still great; I am glad we are settling to a
happy safe medium.</p>
