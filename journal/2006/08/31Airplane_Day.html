<p>I'm creating a portion of my site dedicated to archiving research done by other people on
Airplane Day.  I've just uploaded a really big video (actually it's not finished uploading yet).
From <a href="http://infowars.org">Alex Jones' infowars.org</a>, a video
called <a href="http://infowars-shop.stores.yahoo.net/teascsyed.html">Terror Storm (2006)</a>.</p>

<p>It's available free on google video, so I guess he won't mind me hosting it here as well.  Lemme
know if you want a copy.</p>
