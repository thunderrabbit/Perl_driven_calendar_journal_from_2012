<p>After sending those emails, I spent basically all day on my computer, looking for code that
records clicks on a google map thing and stores them in mySQL for subsequent red line drawing on a
map.  As in a line describing where TJ Bike and I went on our little 1100km adventure.  Some
issues: I plan to have a lot of points; will that slow it down too much?</p>

<p>Also worked on my hands-off Marble Blast level.  I've got it about 1/5th of the way
&quot;finished&quot; but there is still the incredibly tricky gravity modifier spiral.  Used to
have some perl code that would help me with that, but it was lost with my old machine.</p>

<p>And, I just got sidetracked from this entry enjoying a chat with Fred about his latest projects
and my latest &quot;projects&quot; and stuff.  He's at Josh and Katy's house now.  なつかしい。 I
wonder what it's like from their point of view that I'm in Japan.  (( Josh was like, &quot;where is
he?&quot;  &quot;Japan.&quot;  &quot;That's crazy.&quot; ))</p>
