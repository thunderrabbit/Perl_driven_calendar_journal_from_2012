<p>Just talked with a cat who's working with a team trying to build the world's biggest super
computer in 2010, on the order of teraflops for operating speed.  I think he said 20 times the
speed of today's fastest super computer.</p>

<p>I told him about an article I read about a new transister technology; I will send it to him.</p>

<p>Wow!  Fantastic.  My last student (the one who was late) wanted to translate a buncha stuff for
her work, so I typed it up for her on my computer.  We weren't able to get through all of it, so
she wants to meet me again in Shibuya EV!  Wow!</p>
