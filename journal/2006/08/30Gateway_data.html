<p>I lay down during the exercise.  Couldn't keep my head upright.  Somewhat vibrationally coming
out of that one.. Little awareness during it where I was or when.  I thought I had all the time in
the world, but I'm supposed to meet Jesse in an hour.  I almost stayed sleeping through the next
exercise, but remembered the suggestion that it's better to come to full consciousness between
exercises.  Only when I saw the timestamp, did I remember about meeting with Jesse.</p>

<p>Also, it's way hotter than just 28C in here now, I bet.  (with windows closed)</p>
