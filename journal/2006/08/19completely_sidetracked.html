<p>Sidetracked over 4 hours, starting with restoring 3 DVDs from my old computer, looking for the
templates that I used for my old Gateway Data entries (though they are actually on my site (just
not as templates), so I could easily have gotten them that way), and then finding several movies I
&quot;always wanted&quot; to upload, but never did, and now realize I should just throw them up
on <a href="http://youtube.com/profile?user=thunderrabbit">youtube</a> and be done with it.</p>

<p>So I have done just that with several vids, mostly roller coaster riding, and one of a guy
playing didgeridoo and drums in Shibuya.  Not drum-n-bass, but drum-n-didge.  Nice.</p>
