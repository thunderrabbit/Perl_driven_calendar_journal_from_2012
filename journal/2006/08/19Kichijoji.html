<p>Working in Kichijoji EV today.  Right now the start of a huge 3.3 hour break, which I may use to
work on getting some pictures ready for upload, and coordinates of my maps and shtuff.</p>

<p>Ah fuck.  I can't believe my idiocy of leaving my adapter at home when I knew there was a break
during work today.</p>

<p>Okay, cancel all the shit I just said about working for hours on end, but I can get a good start
on pictures.</p>
