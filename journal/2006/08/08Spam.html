<p>I get a lot of spam.  Well, not a lot lot lot, but maybe 50 per day.  (haven't tested this
recently).  Some spam gets through to my inbox, usually by having a bunch of random words in it.</p>

<p>Just thinking that it would be way more effective for spambots to read the top page or two of the
domain of the intended recipient (or in the case of hotmail, yahoo or other portal/web-based
addresses, read the pages of text from where the address was gleaned), quote parts of the text from
that scan, and send it along with the spam URL to the email address.  That way the spam will
likely be natural language, the recipient will likely be attracted to things relating to the
recipient's interest, etc.</p>

<p>I hearby patent this idea as of 8 August 2006.</p>
