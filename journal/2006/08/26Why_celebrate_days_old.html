<p>We should all be enjoying days instead of bemoaning years.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every day is original and unique</p></li>
<li><p>Counting days is far more interesting that counting years</p></li>
<li><p>Celebrations happen in various seasons (*)</p></li>
<li><p>Party sizes vary according to the number of zeros in the age-count</p></li>
<li><p>Seem more humble by celebrating only every 500 days</p></li>
<li><p>Know who really cares (!)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) especially good for people whose birthdays are eclipsed by national holidays</p>

<p>(!)  takes more effort to remember a celebration with inconsistent dates</p>
