<p>At EV tonight from 7pm to 10.  Not alotta hours, but they are all mine.  I mean this is the
first day that I haven't been subbing for someone else.  Today is my first official day.</p>

<p>Supposed to get a train pass today, which means the end of having to scrounge for tickets at the
end of Tokyu Toyoko line to get a free or almost free ride on Tokyu Denentoshi line.</p>

<p>I've not been using this technique for long; I just found out about it perhaps a week ago from
Jesse.</p>

<p>Reiko reported that Tokudasan would prefer to pay me on a weekly basis instead of a daily
basis.  Fair enough.  It means I will have to dip into my shoebox savings to make it through the
next couple of days, but it's all good.</p>

<p>I couldn't see where/how to get a train pass; turns out they are available only from an office
in the station, and not from the vending machines.  Reiko will lead me through the process on
Thursday.  So that means a couple more days of seeking reduced price tickets.</p>

<p>Just had a one hour lesson with Ryoko, who will be 11,000 days old on 13 March 2007!!  I told
her my technique of age celebration, and griped a bit about gender stereotypes in Japan.  She has
taught Japanese before, so I asked if she would teach me, given that I couldn't get back in touch
with Ayana.</p>

<p>The student who is on my schedule for this timeslot called and said she may not be able to come.</p>

<p class="date">10:11pm JST Tuesday 15 August 2006</p>

<p>My second scheduled student didn't come.</p>

<p>My third student is moving to Singapore soon; she's excited to leave Japan and join her husband
who has been there 3 years already.</p>

<p>Chatted with Virginia (works in the semi-adjoining cube) for about 20 minutes after work; she is
tall, talkative, with friendly eyes and lots of questions.  She's been in Japan for 9 years, though
Reiko says she's work at EV for 10 years.  Hmmm.  I think it's a rounding error.</p>

<p>Inquired where to buy a 定期 (ていき) for Shibuya to Sakurshinmachi.  Up next to Toyoko line.
But I didn't go because I don't have any money to buy it.  Ah crap, but I should have gone up to
look for a &quot;discount&quot; ticket.</p>
