<p>Super thanks to Miki for inviting me tonight; I'm glad I got to join the party (pile of free food
and huge girl to guy ratio)...  I was pretty shy at first, but later sorta got speaking some
Japanese a bit.</p>

<p>Near the beginning of the party, everyone did introductions, which I generally did not
understand, though Miki summarized afterward by saying, &quot;baasically everyone is like PB
people, doing cool things and want to do more cool things.&quot;</p>

<p>My self introduction was something like, 「こんばんは。私は路武です。アメリカのテキサスに住んで、
３年前日本に来て、２年間英会話にはたらって、後はいっぱいりょうこ」and I looked over at Miki for
confirmation &quot;which one is cooking, and which is travel?&quot; but then sorta remembered, 「りょ
うりじゃない。りょうこして、船でひこきでいろいろ、後は自転車で２ヶ月東京から神戸」「うそ！」someone
interrupted.「うそじゃない！神戸から天の橋立、琵琶湖、名古屋、箱根、でも箱根でかるまとちょっと大変だっ
て、肩をろた。ろちゃった。よろしく。」</p>

<p>Then Miki added some details about me going on PB twice, etc.</p>

<p>Miki was next, being the other guest, then Miki was last, being one of the teachers there.</p>

<p>Naomi is a counselor there; I asked her what that entailed and she tried to give me a sense of
what their organization is about.  Basically helping Japanese travelers by setting up homestays,
work, visas, language training.. basically everything but travel tickets, it seems.</p>

<p>Youko just got back from Turkey for 9 days; she was telling us about it; said it's really super
beautiful with all the mosques and stuff.</p>

<p>The people in running this organization seem to be pretty cool: Fujisan (bald and super outgoing;
is/has been a gymnast), Madoka (seems to be the secretary / mom of the place; who, during all the
introductions (except Miki and I (cause she doesn't know us)), added flattering details for
everyone), and Naomi (counselor who told me about the organization).  They ran the party pretty
well, got everyone comfortably chatting, etc.</p>

<p>At the very end, talking to Naomi and Yukino (who uses her season pass to Disney Land between 1
and 3 times per week (including today)), I found out that Yukino loves roller coasters but has
never been to Fujikyu Highland.  I told her she has to go because Fujiyama is such a great ride.
Drew a picture of Eejyanaika to show Naomi, who recognized it after my scribbly drawing.</p>

<p>At the very very end, another Naomi wanted to ask me something, but was being shy.  Youko tried
to encourage her, though it didn't actually happen.  But we got a picture with Naomi.</p>

<p>Good times.</p>
