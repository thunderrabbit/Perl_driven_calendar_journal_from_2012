Ho, men

I am Rob Nugen, Thunder Rabbit, November 1997.  After 5 years of joyful attendance in our I-group, I
chose to travel the world.  My Monday night connection to reality is one thing I miss dearly.

I lived in Tokyo, Japan for 2 years, traveled the world for 15 months, and seem to be setting into
Tokyo again (to work my way out of debt incurred during my travels).  I still miss you men and my
connection to heart-centered communication.

I see Japan as a country suffering from its culture: people are expected to hide their emotions.  I
judge this has an affect on the high number of suicides here.  Some say the highest percentage of
any country in the world.

I want to support the introduction of Mankind Project into Tokyo.  The hurdles seem huge, and I have
a great flurry of shadows holding me back from even considering such a project.  But I must step
forward.

Do you know anyone who has expressed interest in introducing the training to Japan? 

Do you know any Mankind Project participants who are fluent in Japanese?

Does The Drum still exist?  I didn't see any references to it on mkp.org

In service,
  
   HO!
