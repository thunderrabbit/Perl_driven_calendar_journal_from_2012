<p>Today I've gotten my map thing working so that I can save and load points in mySQL.  Next steps
are to clean up the interface for public viewing and then to add all the points from TJ Bike trip,
and add this concept of &quot;journey&quot; = multiple routes to the code.</p>

<p>Haven't quite figured out an optimal easily understood/modeled way to set it up, though I've
also not yet given it a lot of thought.</p>
