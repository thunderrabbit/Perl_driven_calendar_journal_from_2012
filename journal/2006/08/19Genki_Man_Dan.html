<p>I'm on Genki Man Dan's train line (Inokashira sen) all the way from Shibuya to Kichijyoji, so I'm
thinking of writing him an email that would go something like this:</p>

Genki Man Dan the Genki Man, A.K.A. Genki Genki Genki Dan The Man Genki!!!

Man!  I'm on your train line (Inokashira sen) all the way from Shibuya to Kichijyoji, so I'm
thinking of writing you an email that would go something like this:

Mate!

How's life UK style??  I hope you've found some hackey sackey kickey people in your area; Jesse
recently moved out (to get married of all things!) so we can't really play anymore.  HSJ seems to
have gone awol, or perhaps he's just buried in one of my semi-unpacked suit cases that I'm using as
a chest of drawers.

I hope you got (and enjoyed) the train cards; I've been collecting more, and have a pretty good pile
of them started.  Perhaps 6 or 7 (*) already!  I've checked through them all to make sure they're
unique (among each other), but we really need to do a big train card sorting party (more like a
festival!) to fully appreciate the breadth and depth of your collection!

(*) 6 or 7 MILLION!!

I do you have any plans to come back for a visit?  Wouldn't be the same without Jenny J In Da House,
but *I* sure would be happy to give you some floor space with a bed on it.  You could stay in the
swanky new apartment I'm in semi-near Shibuya!  I'm the new roommate for a cat named Michael, though
he prefers not to kick things so no HSJ, HSM, nor even HSJ for him.  I tried HMSJHMHSMH, but he
wasn't down.

<!--  hey michael, so just hit my hackey sack minus hands -->

Aight, we are at the end of the line; I know if I don't finish this now, I'll get super distracted
and never finish it then...

Love Love Love
  - Rob!!!
