<p>Good lesson with Kaoru today, though the first two questions were ones I couldn't answer!  What's
the <a href="http://lacountymurders.com/whatis-articles.cfm">diff between homicide and
murder</a>?</p>

<p>Second: what is &quot;violation&quot; when in terms of secondary color palettes when used in
advertising???</p>
