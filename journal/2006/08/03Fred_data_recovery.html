<p>Fred put the first CD worth of desired data online this morning.  Got it downloaded so I will
soon try to get my old Marble Blast level working again.</p>

<p>I should work on something more useful, probably.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>

<b>WAIT</b>

I did not get everything.

wget defaults to 5 directory deep recursion.

I set it to 20 and am trying again.

Not sure why the numbers seemed to match so well.  That's a bit spooky.
