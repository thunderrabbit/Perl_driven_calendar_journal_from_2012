<p>Bueno.  I've finished plotting coordinates of the first major portion of my TJ Bike adventure
around Honshu.  So far I've done <a href="/cgi-bin/maps?journeyID=1">from Tokyo to Koji's
house</a>.</p>

<p>It's being calculated as 503 km, which makes me guesstimate that the total for the whole journey
will be significantly over 1100km, which I've been telling people when I brief them on the story.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Oh, and it won't work in IE.  This is intentional, to help people move
to <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">firefox</a>.</p>
