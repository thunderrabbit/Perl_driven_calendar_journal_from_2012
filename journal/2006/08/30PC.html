<p>I woke up relatively early today (as per my plan to get more aligned with the sun) though I
didn't get a lot of cleaning done.  I did eat and do dishes (or at least gave them a good rinsing)
and took out the trash.</p>

<p>Read an article about <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/subscr/108/open_lightbulbs.html">swirly
light bulbs</a>, set to be the next best thing since the light bulb.  Save energy and good for the
world and all.  I like the aspect of GE and Wal-Mart looking at the business plan as a big push to
get everyone on fluorescent bulbs, and then having the light bulb market shrivel to 30% of what it
is now.</p>

<p>Much better than fighting the wave the way the media industries do.</p>
