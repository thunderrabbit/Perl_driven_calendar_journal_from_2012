<p>Have had two students so far; the first was Kyoko, who will begin her training at Dotour coffee
shop tomorrow.  She'll be trained in 駒沢大学, which is the next station from my place, and then
working on Nambu line somewhere.</p>

<p>I brought the SUDOKU game that Jesse handed down to me when he left the apartment; I've decided
to start getting rid of shit that I don't need anymore.  Oh, and I also decided to study some
Japanese.</p>

<p>Met a cat who is the multi-hat man of <a href="http://nobel-label.net">nobel-label.net</a>, so I
wanna check it out and perhaps turn some aspiring musicians that direction.</p>

<p>On the train briefly with Linda, who subbed for us in Shibuya (listen to me &quot;subbed
for <em>us</em>&quot;) but, embarassingly, I turned her loose at the wrong station; I thought she
wanted Omote-sando, but actually she shoulda gotten off at Aoyama-i-chome.  Oops.  She's from NYC;
she hadn't heard about WTC 7 until I mentioned it.  I hope she'll look into it.</p>

<p>I will have Ami on Thursday; I was telling Reiko that if Ami could speak English well, I would
want to date her.  (but actually she is probably too young)</p>

<p>One of my students from today is 10082 days old; we just missed her 10,000th day.  She was like,
&quot;I'm 27.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;woah,&quot; as the 10,000th day alarms went off in my head, &quot;when is your birthday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;January...  one.&quot;</p>

<p>And for a while I thought she was saying January 1st, even after I confirmed it with her, but it
turns out she was just confirming the name/number of the month.  January 22nd, actually.</p>

<p>It took a while to explain why I had asked her if people forgot her birthday amidst New Year's celebrations.</p>

<p>I gave a woman named こころ the sudoku game.  She seemed to appreciate it.</p>
