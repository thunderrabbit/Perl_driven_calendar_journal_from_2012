<p>Home now.  Michael looked up online what happened.</p>

<p>There was a suicide in Yoga station, one station away from mine.  According to the news report,
s/he jumped right around 5:30, which is about 1.5 minutes before the Express train should have been
passing through my station.</p>

<p>So, my train was waiting to be passed by the Express train.  But someone jumped in front of that
Express.  Disrupting probably tens of thousands of would-be passengers, and therefore costing the train
company 10,000 * 120 yen = US $12,000.00 (*) in returned fares, plus clean up, etc.</p>

<p>But,</p>

<p>Guess how the train company will recover the money?</p>

<p>Insurance?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>The family of the deceased is left with the bill.</p>

<p>(*) I bet this is way way way too low of an estimate.</p>
