<p>....  I thought I had it, but upon final check (after correcting some points), I found that I
need to add a point ordering variable on the routes.  Apparently I can't trust mySQL to return the points in
the order I want after adding and deleting records.</p>

<p>Just a bit more cleanup on the interface, but hella closer than before.  Asymptote style.</p>
