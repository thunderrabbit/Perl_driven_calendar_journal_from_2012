<p>Good time with Mutsumi around Yoyogi Park today.  Actually we did a loop through Meiji Jingu,
taking ample time to scope the wooden plaque things on which people have written prayer request
type notes.  I always think I wanna write &quot;I pray that no one will cover this plaque with
another.&quot; or something like that.</p>

<p>Mu-chan is well; she's on vacation at this time and has another 10 days of freedom before
becoming a サラリガル again.  Pretty funny term, I think.</p>

<p>We got a snack in マック in Harajuku where she met Francois (after seeing him on the shirt
Hitomi made for me) and we took a couple pictures with Photo Booth.  And one with my camera.</p>

<p>We did a quick step into Yoyogi, where I was surprised to see NO stalls in the front entrance,
plus a sign that apparently indicates the police have cracked down on the vendors.  Wow.  I wonder
if that will affect the number of visitors to the park.  I really wonder if it's just a temporary
dance that will have the vendors back in a few weeks.  Didn't look too temporary; the signs were
posted on newly constructed wooden frames.</p>

<p>Mu-chan wants to go abroad so I encouraged her to take the plunge and go for it.</p>
