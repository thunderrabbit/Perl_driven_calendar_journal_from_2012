<p>Just met Kaoru for our first lesson; she lives quite close to Sakurashinmachi, so it's super
convenient for both of us!  Her English is money (as Frank would say), and pretty fast, so it was
hard at times to make corrections, but I found if I wrote them down, I could be of some benefit to
her English ability.</p>

<p>The first part of our lesson primarily involved me telling her that I want to
bring <a href="http://mkp.org">Mankind Project</a> to Japan.  As I told her about the organization,
she agreed it would be positive for Japan to have such an organization here. Awesome.  We
brainstormed some questions for me to ask Kim when I talk to him next week.</p>

<p>After that I was telling her about my shoulderific adventure, and she was quite surprised that I
had been willing to pay the entire amount and not fault the driver for it.  I mulled this over quite
a bit in my brain; I had agreed with the driver I would take care of my side, and he would take care
of his side.  At that time, I was in a bit of a hurry to get my shoulder fixed, and not cause more
conflict with this guy; I never got his contact information, etc.</p>

<p>I would like to offer him the option of claiming some of it on insurance.  Perhaps he is worried
about me. (*) Perhaps perhaps...   So, I want to present it to him gently... if he would like to
help, I won't be offended.  I don't want to go all armed with Police and Lawyers and fight him into
paying it, but.</p>

<p>(*) not <em>that</em> worried, or he would have tried to contact me...</p>

<p>At the end, we talked about places Kaoru might live; she wants warm weather and internet
access.. Hmmm; sounds about like me.</p>
