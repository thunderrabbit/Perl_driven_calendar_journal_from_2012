<p>Big fun hanging out with Yuka in Shibuya tonight.  We went to the
mexican restaurant El Torito and shared stories, then off to ice cream
but got to see Carla instead!  She happened to be walking to The Pink
Cow for a PB event/fundraiser, and we chatted a bit and missed the
closing of Haagen Daaz (sp) by about 3 minutes.  D'oh!</p>

<p>Headed to the other side of the Yamanote Line, through a tunnel I
had never previously used, and ate Haagen Daaz ice cream at Pronto,
while telling more stories.</p>

<p>By this time, I was thinking I for sure want to go out with her
again, but I shall keep such musings as just that (wtf does that
mean....?)  I basically won't jump on the phone and be like "how about
tomorrow" each day until someone is sick of the other.</p>

<p>Walked to Ebisu station while I told stories; I tried to give her
equal talk time, but I'm pretty sure I didn't, though we got some Yuka
stories near the end of the evening.</p>

<p>I am tired, and hardly making sense here.</p>

<p>When she accurately predicted the amount of time it would take to
get to Ebisu, I was like, "wow!" and "what reward do you want?" and
she said something and my tired brain interpreted it as an opportunity
to give her a kiss, but I worked hard to keep my brain in check and
just give her a story (rifle drop in Rice stadium) instead.</p>

<p>She told me about her huge husky running and accidentally tripping
a guy into a muddy rice field while her mom had been taken for a run
by the dog instead of taking the dog for a walk.</p>

<p>I look forward to going out with her again, but only in a 40 Year
Old Virgin type way.</p>
