<p>Wow!  I answered one their latest question on a whim and pretty
immediately received a response from a <em>human</em>, who not only
got my response, but read my website and asked if I would like to

Hey Rob

We noticed you're in Tokyo, and soon Bali -

We are always looking for people to tape questions remotely, and then send
us the footage to use...

Basically, Rachel would  introduce you from LA, we'd then cut to you for
your question, and then she'd pick it up from there for the rest...

If you have access to a video camera (any kind is fine) and are interested,
just let us know!

<p>Wow!!  Durn tootin', I'm interested!</p>
