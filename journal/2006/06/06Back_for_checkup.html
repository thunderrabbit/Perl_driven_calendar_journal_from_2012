<p class="date">9:42am JST Tuesday 6 June 2006</p>

<p>Back at the hospital (have been here since 8am) where so far I have
successfully registered and paid 50,000 yen toward my bill.  With
special thanks to Hitomi for that loan!</p>

<p>The weird weird weird thing is that someone paid 60,000 yen on 2
June, but I don't know who.  Michael?  Jesse?  Kellie?  No one else
was here that I know of (except everyone else who was in the hospital,
but no one else who knew me).</p>

<p>I have <em>almost</em> gotten an X-ray of my shoulder.  In line for
that now.</p>

<p class="date">9:51am</p>

<p>Make that <em>just</em> gotten an X-ray of my shoulder.</p>
