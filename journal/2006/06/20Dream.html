<p class=dream>Back at my parents' house, actually mom's, I had to
pee, so I was going to pee in the corner, but decided that would be
impolite, so I went to the restroom that was available from the
outside, and while I was seated, trying to get back into my new book
by Dan Brown (even newer than DaVinci Code) a guy walked by and peered
into the window.  I waved back at him to say HI and Occupied at the
same time, and he walked away.</p>

<p class=dream>Then a man came by wearing a huge Matrix black long
coat and carrying a huge machine gun with tripod, and I was like, "I
guess I'm done in here" and flushed the toilet so he could hear I was
done.  I came out, looking down as if I hadn't seen his weapon, but he
didn't seem phased, and said something in Chinese, but I understood it
in Japanese 今日早く.  His interpreter said thank you, and I said
sheishei in my best attempt at thank you in Mandarin.</p>

<p class=dream>They laughed as jovially as spies with huge guns
would, and I ventured to ask which way I should go to escape the
apparent onslaught.  The guy was like, "well, you know about the big
bomb over there," referring to a bomb that local rumor had secretly
discussed its whereabouts for years a few hundred meters away in the
woods, "that's been compromised, and today we'll be fighting against
an air attack over here," pointing in the opposite direction, and
just as he said that, dramatic music came on in the background as a
man (*) came up behind him with a handgun loosely deployed.</p>

<p>(*) just felt a pretty decent sized earthquake!  Nice.  It's been
a while!</p>

<p class=dream>My guy knew he had been caught, and continued to talk
to me as he was preparing to whirl around and try to disarm the guy,
but I didn't stay to watch, and just released the outcome and used
the opportunity to head outside.</p>

<p class=dream>Actually to the other room, where I slid underneath a
desk, then realized it was a bad location cause it's where the spies
used to hang out, so perhaps they would come back...  I recognized I
needed to find another place to go where I could read my book safely
plus have food for a while.  Ah - I should take TJ Bike down the hill
to the valley and community park, which was away from the compromised
bomb location and away from the planned air attack.</p>

<p>Woke up before I headed down.</p>
