<p>I just about have around 140 images ready for upload, but first, a
little jaunt to Roppongi to meet Hitomi for movie, dinner, ice cream
and discussion of medical bills.</p>

<p>Fun with Hitomi tonight!  I am super tired, but we saw The DaVinci
Code, which was better than I had expected; reviews have been
generally low.  I enjoyed it pretty well, though I got a bit confused
at one point.. how did Teabing get out of the trunk to kill his
servant?</p>

<p>We ate ice cream at Cold Stone Creamery.  Long ass line cause the
serving stuff were slow as Leap Year, but the ice cream was super
delicious.  I got the super biggest size and they practically freaked
out that I wanted it.  It's only a pint; my god.  I'll stop around a
half gallon, thank you.  Now start scooping!</p>

<p>Showed Hitomi pictures of my almost final TJ Bike adventure.  Super
duper duper super special thanks to her for letting me use her
computer!!!!</p>
