<p>I didn't get a photo (thank goodness?) until the glass was
discarded, but this morning I had a suprising stabbing feeling in my
toe when I shifted my feet under Jesse's desk.  It took a moment to
recognize that it really hurt way more than anything should have under
those circumstances.  I looked down to find a shiny blood dome
preparing to drip from the nail edge, held by cohesion.</p>

<p>Jesse said the likely culprit was from a break in the kitchen
about a month ago.</p>
