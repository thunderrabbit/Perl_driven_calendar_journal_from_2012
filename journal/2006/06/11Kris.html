<p>Enjoyed a 30 minute chat with Kris today on Skype.  She's going to
be doing a cool conference in Vancouver around the time Oh My Gaudrey
and PB 52 rolls in!  Told her about my upcoming trip to Bali, and she
seemed relatively entertained with my coin toss technique of deciding
if I should accept.  She told me a bit about the Pepy Ride she did
with Maryann and Pat down in Louisiana recently.  Sounds awesome!</p>

<p>She's going to apply for PB 55th I think.</p>

<p>Told her about my 1-day mystery shopper job in Harajuku tomorrow; I
hope it goes well!</p>
