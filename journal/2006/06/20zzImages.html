<p>Super tired, but got some good stuff done with images today.  Now I
have the framework so it checks for the existance of critical tables
in the db, and allows the user to enter admin-password to log into the
system.  The login will eventually allow the admin-user to create the
necessary tables.  Preferably with a slick interface, though I haven't
thought about how slick it c/should be.</p>

<p>But, the awesomest thing recently: if there is no admin password
defined in the settings, the admin function is totally off.  Null
password will not match the null password to let somebody in.</p>
