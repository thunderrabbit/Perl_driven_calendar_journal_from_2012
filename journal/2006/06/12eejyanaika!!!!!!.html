<p>HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.eejanaika.jp/">4th Dimension Coaster right
here in Fujikyu Highland</a>!!  How did they almost finish it without
me knowing <em>anything</em> about it???  Has it been that long since
I've been to the park??</p>

<p>Please forgive me, Fujikyu Highland!!  I will be there as soon as
possible!!  (after the ride opens, of course)</p>
