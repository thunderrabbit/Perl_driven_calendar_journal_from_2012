<p class="dream">Climbing a tree while on my own little adventure on
an island reached by PB, I happened to meet up with Carla, who had
just gotten back from her own adventure for a month camping.  I was
super happy to see her and gave her a hug and kiss and the kiss turned
to a tongue kiss which delightfully surprised me, though she had
apparently been unable to brush her teeth during the month, and some
of her front teeth were broken.</p>

<p class="dream">I really wanted to kiss her more, but also wanted to
get some breath mints in on the action, and since Carla is my close
bud, I addressed the issue directly.  "Your teeth are rotten, but I
still want to kiss you; there is some mint growing in a garden
upstairs," and we climbed further into the tree to a platform with bed
and potted plant, all of which was overlooking the island.</p>

<p class="dream">I saw a guy I hadn't seen since last year, and took a
second to remember his name, but he didn't see me at all, so once I
remembered, I called out to him and it was all good.  "Yo, Jamar,
what's up???"</p>

<p class="dream">He was like, "It's JAmar, not JaMAR."</p>

<p class="dream">Oops.</p>
