<p>Today I have been working on some new code, which, so far, does
nothing.  But hopefully I will come up with something that displays
the photos on my website.</p>

<p>I have decided to "fuck what other people think" about the photos,
when I was wondering if I should let people rank favorites and tag
them, etc... but I <em>will</em> make it essentially easy for people
to tag them via del.icio.us and/or other social bookmarking
systems.</p>

<p>Here is the <a

code</a></p>

<p>Right about now, I am designing the databases.  I'm trying to
design them so my journal entries could be displayed in a similar way,
allowing them to be linked to locations, events and tags.</p>
