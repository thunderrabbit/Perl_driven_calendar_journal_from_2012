<p>Great to see lots of PB people at the Hawaiian themed fundraiser in Takadanobaba tonight!  I enjoyed getting to see Natalie, Carla, Dan, Stacy, Kentaro, Yuki, Minoru, Misato, Rika and a couple others for the first time in months.  And got to see Kellie again for the first time in two days!</p>

<p>Told Carla about my crazy dream, and showed my X-rays to anyone who wanted to see.  Definitely enjoyed sharing the pics with Stacy, a fellow speed demon, who says my story may help him slow down his downtown skateboarding antics.</p>

<p>Wanted to chew on Natalie (of course), and was a bit envious to see her and Carla working together so closely.  They see each other each day at work...  Sigh.</p>

<p>Dan (my 3027 homie) told me about his awesome job and upcoming plan possibilities.  He doesn't want to put off going back to real life forever, but would like to do another voyage.</p>

<p>Carla told me that Carl (my other 3027 homie) engineered himself a job in the PB NYC office!  HOLY SHIT!!!!</p>

<p>I'm completely impressed by this.  She said he "wrote a bunch of proposals," ...</p>

<p>What does that mean exactly?  I can write a bunch of computer programs.  He can write a bunch of proposals...  I can write a bunch of stories...  what is a proposal and why are they so valuable??</p>

<p>Of everything tonight, that probably piqued my interest most effectively.</p>
