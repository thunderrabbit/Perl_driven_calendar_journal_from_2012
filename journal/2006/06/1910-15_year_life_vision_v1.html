<h2>10-15 year life vision (v1)</h2>

<pre>
&gt; Meanwhile, I suggest you also order them by basic overall relative value

I didn't understand the reason at first, but the emergency-triage
order is quite different from the new order:

Family
Spiritual
Career
Intellect
Play
Physical
Social
Art
Environment
Finance


&gt; Also go on ahead and try your hand at the begin of a vision for each

(1) Family:  my Life Partner has done and continues to do her own
personal work.  We share absolute trust, and are absolute best
friends.  We can be away and loving, together and loving.  Our
laughter, love, light and shimmering communication flow like manna
between us.

She is brilliant, healthy, wise, multi-lingual.  We each actively work
on the relationship, actively love each other.  Encourage positive
growth, address and forgive slips in behavior.  Communicate
warrior-within style; meditate together, play together, travel
together, meditate apart, play apart, when traveling apart.

We live close to our nuclear families, or at least visit annually for
more than a week at a time.

Kids TBD.

(2) Spiritual:  We have each developed our own spiritual practices,
which mesh well together.  I am in close communication with my angels
and positive higher beings.  Decisions effortless include positive
input from higher sources.  Nothing done religiously unless for
personally verifiable reasons.

(3) Career focuses on helping people grow healthier in spirit,
physically, and intellectually.  Able to open gaps in my schedule for
personal time.  My life work inspires myself and induces my own
positive growth.  Also inspires others to do even greater things.

I occasionally publish papers which bring benefit to peer/scientific
community.  My brother is proud of my work.

(4)  Intellect:  remaining up to date supports my career and inspires
further growth.  I continue to challenge my mind and brain with
learning new languages and new tricks and the latest technologies,
sciences, etc.  My mind is unwired, unmired, and easily groks
languages / concepts / names.

(5)  Play allows time with my partner, with silly spontaneous games,
to hiking weekends or putt putt golf and romantic dating activities.
I live joyfully as if no one is watching and inspire others to do the
same.  Dance, karaoke, swimming, skiing, skating, hackey sack,
ultimate frisbee.. Plenty of things that require none, renewable, or
very little natural resources.  Spontaneous play is very important!
Includes laughter and joy.

(6)  Physically healthy bodies spiraling upward with good food and
playful exercise (skating, swimming, etc).  Delightful sensual
physical sexual connection with my partner, also spontaneous and
magical.  Strong limber yoga/Pilate's bodies with clean clear natural
body functions inspired by clean pure spirits.

(7)  Social:  occasionally surrounded by loving friends for
non-chemically enhanced parties and playful fun of silent football,
dance, music..  grown up versions of kids games, intellectual debates
and discussions, presentations of latest findings to peer group
audience.  connected with warrior training and I-group and/or ABC type
things.

(8)  The creation of beauty for its own sake includes my website,
which requires little maintenance, and allows easy updates of journal,
creative writings, images, travel adventure logs.  Painting with
bright colors as gifts to friends.  Creative writings are on any
topic, in any genre.  Writing a movie script doesn't seem daunting.
Singing is part of play, and music is created with any little trifle
around the Environment.

(9) Environment is safe, owned, elevated from global warming seas, has
fresh drinking water.  If in a city, there is reliable mass transit
and city services.  If in a rural area, land encourages gardening with
trees for climbing and rocks for hiking.   A few semi-wild animals
come to visit, but not depend on us.  The climate is warm and wet more
than cold and dry.  Solar/wind/water/renewable/infinite power drives
or augments electric grid.   Few possessions clutter the energy.
Internet access is fast and reliable, but I'm not addicted to it.

(10) Financially independent; with 10% or more of all income flowing
out to support the world.  We are in debt to none, and don't keep
track of debts to us.  Money is like air or water: free to give and
receive.

&gt; These are bullets identifying the real
&gt; things that might well be present in your life then and qualities of those
&gt; things - manifesting the more abstract and intangible characteristics of
&gt; that life then that makes so extraordinarily and authentically successful.

Above is version 1.  I may revise it before you finish your silent retreat.

&gt; Ultimately, there is a second parallel path to move down, which launches
&gt; from the relative valuation and inventory steps in the 360 process together
&gt; with and along side the visioning process.
&gt;
&gt; This is the path of a needs assessment of how, based on your inventory your
&gt; life needs to be redesigned and energy and resources reallocated to better
&gt; get better met the key unmet or under-met needs that are made visible in
&gt; that inventory.

It seems I will need a bit more clarification on these two paragraphs.
 (i.e., you lost me)
