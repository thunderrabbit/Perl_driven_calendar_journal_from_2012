<p>Today I learned a semi-sad thing regarding <a href="http://furius.ca/curator/">Curator, the awesome static image indexer</a>:</p>

<pre>
I just read through most of the docs, and noticed a fundamental difference
in what we are trying to do.

(Damn.)

I am looking for a thing to generate indexes on my website in realtime.

I *might* rethink my workflow and incorporate Curator.   But now it
seems I need to rethink the original design and make sure I am on
track.
</pre>

<p>Past that, I have been writing my first python script.  It's *very* cute, and by cute, I mean small.</p>

<pre>
import cgi

print "Content-type: text/html\n"

fields = cgi.FieldStorage()
name = fields.getvalue('name') or ''
if re.search(r'[^ a-zA-Z0-9]',name):
    name = None

if name is None:
    message = "only alphanumeric"
elif name is '':
    message = "what's yer name?"
else:
    message = "hello %s! What's yer friend's name?" % (name)

print """
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
%s
&lt;form action="curating" method="post"&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;
&lt;input type="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; """  % (message)
</pre>
