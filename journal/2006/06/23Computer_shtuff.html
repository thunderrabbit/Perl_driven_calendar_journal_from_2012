<p>Jesse and I are going to Oimachi to hopefully find some cool,
inexpensive computer stuff ... for nerds.  (us)</p>

<p>I want a USB US style keyboard.</p>

<p class=date>3:02pm</p>

<p>Ended up getting a US style PS/2 keyboard, which I know won't fit
into my/Hitomi's computer without an adapter, but my gut said buy it.
500 yen.  And then Jesse pointed out that the keyboard features
Mac-style command key and stuff, and says Mac compatible on the back.
Nice!  I didn't consciously notice that before I bought it.</p>

<p>Also of note, the guy inadvertantly gave me the PS/2 cable that I
put on the counter with the keyboard.  Like before I said I was going
to buy the keyboard, he gave me the cable, apparently not knowing it
had been theirs.  I accepted it, which is one (conscious) reason I
bought the keyboard.</p>

<p>They had an actual Mac USB keyboard for 1200 yen, but it was
Japanese style layout, which I've already got with Hitomi's computer,
so I chose not to buy it.</p>

<p>Jesse thinks I won't be able to find an adapter for less than 1000
yen; I neither agree nor disagree.</p>
