<p>Just got back from chillin' with Aya (Anko's roommate on PB52) and
her friend Akiko in Shibuya!  Met at our friend ハチ公's place and
braved the crowds under Inokashira line for some chai, ice tea and
chatting about my crash and Aya's trip to Okinawa and their efforts to
get jobs as a nurse and a nurse, respectively.  I was well-surprised
to get omiyage from Korea and Okinawa from Aya!</p>

<p>To an okonomiyaki shop very close to 109, which was great fun,
because I love お好み焼き and found that I've grown to like もんんじゃ,
and we all helped cook it on the table while I told them about the <a
href="http://www.eejanaika.jp/cg1/coaster.html">new coaster at
FujiQ</a>, and debated Aya's driving skills.</p>

<p>Ice cream at Haagen Dazs; double for me and single each for
them. just chillin' outside in Shibuya.  I love that crazy city.</p>

<p>They had to rock out at 8pm to get home by last trains.   Aya in
Chiba and Akiko in Nagano.  Super glad they spent their last day of a
mini-vacation together hanging out with me!</p>
