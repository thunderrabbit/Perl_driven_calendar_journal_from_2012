<p>Hmmmmmm.  Got some code that doesn't crash, but also doesn't
display quite the way I want it to display.  Basically I want the
admin to be able to log in, and then update the tabs at the top of the
navigation bar to reflect that the admin can now log out (and no
longer log in).</p>

<p>But, as of <a href="/cgi-bin/images.v0.012">images version
0.012</a>, it doesn't work.  (password is currently "cat" but (it must
be submitted twice, and) it will change after I get back from Bali.)
Instead of working, the tabber tabs vanish after any password attempt,
whether correct or not.</p>

<p>I got it to work by refreshing the entire screen, but I'd like to
have it be slicker than that.</p>

<p>Oh wait; I might know why!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>nope!</p>

<p class=date>2:35am</p>

<p>And by "nope!" I now mean "yahooo!!!"</p>

<p>I just need to wait until the Ajax function call comes back before
trying to refresh the changing portion of the screen!</p>

<p>I saw a reference to some code that does that (I just slapped in a
setTimeout())...  I'll find it and add it when I get back!</p>

<p>still requires double entry, but I think I can fix
that..  actually I am certain I can; it's something to do with when
cookies are being written and read...</p>

<p>Dammit; I have stayed up a bit too late, and still haven't
packed.  I was just looking for a tutorial to add an Ajax activity
indicator in perl, but I can't find one!!!!  PHP, okay.  Ruby, okay.
But not Perl.  Not CGI::Ajax.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>

<p>Okay, panic pack starting now.</p>
