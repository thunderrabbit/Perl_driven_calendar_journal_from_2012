<p>Fun at Jesse's school today, but not as fun as last time, because
these three classes hadn't previously heard about me, so I was not an
instant star.  I told my story and we had them draw manga of the
adventure.  I'd like to post images of some of them up here, but can't
for privacy laws.  sucks.</p>

<p>After school, we carefully played hackey sack on the Musashi
Nakahara platform while waiting for the stupid infrequent Nambu line
to produce a train.  Went one whole stop to Musashi Kosugi for a happy
Takoyaki reunion at Gindako, and were surprised to find the seats have
been removed from their dining area and replaced with a ¹­Åç style
okonomiyaki shop, I think.</p>

<p>Still enjoyed our takoyaki; just ate on benches outside, which is
really inside-ish, under the station.</p>
