<p class="dream">A famous musician had basically shut himself off from
the world by staying in his room.  He was still loved by his fans, but
during his seclusion had apparently done some things that had
triggered controversy about whether or not he was gay.</p>

<p class="dream">I personally didn't really "know" him, even as a
performer, but I put myself on the list of people who supported his
right to do whatever the hell he wanted to do.</p>

<p class="dream">I imagine that's why I was selected to meet him
personally while there was an event at his house, or outside his
house, trying to get him to come out of his proverbial and literal
shell.</p>

<p class="dream">I was pretty much surprised and taken off-guard by
being ushered inside.  I had just been talking about him with Petra
and someone else, when someone whisked me into the private residence.</p>

<p class="dream">The man looked different than I expected; he seemed a
bit like the guy who played Frodo Baggins in the recent LoTRs trilogy.
Though I wasn't ready to go in when I went in, I tried to say
something useful that would help him.</p>

<p class="dream">I basically was like "we can live in this room or
live out of this room and the whole world will not care, except for
what they want to believe."  I then arranged two playing cards on the
table to represent the current room he was living in, and the new
additional room we fans had been building for him to expand his
private territory.  So my basic premise was like "it doesn't matter
what you do, so you might as well make yourself a bit better," and
offered a non-threatening way he could expand his horizons.</p>

<p class="dream">I then was trying to think of a way to say that I
imagined he had heard us talking about the rumors of his gayness, and
relate that in the same way, basically "whether or not anyone else
thinks you're gay, the truth is in your heart, and that's all that
matters."</p>

<p>But I woke up instead.</p>
