<p>Just spent about 10 minutes meditating, which became more an more
unbearable, until I was just crying.  I don't know what to do.  Like
now, in my life, like everything seems to be a tangent, taking me away
from my real focus, but I don't know what my focus is.</p>

<p>Touched briefly on ideas:</p>

<li>it's okay not to know</li>
<li>redesign my life</li>
<li>go back to what Kim taught me</li>

Hi Kim

I am Rob Nugen
Thunder Rabbit

trained to become a man among men
November 1997

I feel fear: given I almost don't remember the year, I must have
forgotten other critical elements of this training.

I just spent about 10 minutes in meditation that turned to 10 minutes
crying: I don't know what to do

"right now," I thought.  "What should I do?"

SO

I decided to look at each point of my life, and rate it on a scale of 0 to 100

then select where I want it to be

then think of one small step I can do in each point to move closer to my goal.

First step:

remember "the list of life points"

Family
Friends
Money
Environment
Job
Health
Art
Free time
Relationship

I judge that my list contains the things I can remember, and may be
exactly what I need to work on now, but it's not the same list you
gave me some years ago.

Like giving Dumbo's his "magic" feather,

will you send me the list of life points you use with clients?

Until then, I will use the one I've written above.

I'm in.
