<p>Thanks to my family back home, I am now the proud temporary-owner
of four international postal money orders for $700 each.</p>

<p>Going to the local post office now.</p>

<p>Done.</p>

<p>Converted $2800 to ±ß317,576 at the post office; paid the balance
of ±ß296,310, leaving me with ±ß21,266 to start paying people back.</p>
