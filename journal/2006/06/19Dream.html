<p class=dream>Outside a convenience store, I found that I could pull
loose change out of a slot where it had been jammed into a vending
machine of sorts.  The slot was way up by the roof, next to a light,
so that explained why no one else had tried to get money out of it.  I
climbed up the side of the wall, held onto the light with one hand and
held a card to poke at the money to dislodge it so it would come out,
but trying to be quiet about it so not too much would fall out at once
and be lost.</p>

<p class=dream>Really feeling happy with my newfound wealth, but then
realized that I must be dreaming.  Climbed down and decided I was, in
fact, dreaming, and I told one of my friends about the dream.  I
didn't feel too bad about losing the money, but it was still kindof a
bummer.</p>

<p class=dream>Finished talking to my friend, then woke up for real.</p>

<p>Woah.  I had a dream within a dream!</p>
