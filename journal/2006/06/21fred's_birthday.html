<p>D'oh!!</p>

<p>I got sidetracked in a religious discussion with Jesse, then
Michael; it was supposed to be just 15 minutes so I could call Fred at
midnight as his birthday began, but I <em>completely</em> forgot.  Now
it's been 2 <em>hours</em> and fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Meh.  I'll still call him.</p>
