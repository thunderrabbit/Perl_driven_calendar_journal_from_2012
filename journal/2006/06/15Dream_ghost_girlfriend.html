<p class=dream>I brought home a ghost woman named Amee.  We came up
the spiral staircase to the shared apartment, in which several guys
lived, all of whom were working on various projects, from programming
to music to cooking, etc.</p>

<p class=dream>Amee scared me at one point as we were outside the
door.  I locked the door so she could not get in; being a ghost, she
was not solid and couldn't unlock it (nevermind that she could go
right through the wall...), and she couldn't at first, but then she
could become solid enough to unlock it, and I got scared and shouted
inside, "Call Security!!!!" and then Amee said she just wanted to
listen to the music and chill out, so we went in together and I was
like, "ah, cancel that security call," but it was too late.</p>

<p class=dream>When we went inside, though, she started messing with
one of the computers that one of my roommates was using, but it turns
out she was using vast knowledge, and super quickly fixed an issue he
was having, trying to get some graphics thing working.  He was really
happy with the fix, and then we went into the scene on the computer
where there were old cars and people walking along a riverside.</p>

<p class=dream>Security came to the building through that riverside,
so before they even got upstairs, I flagged them down, "I was the one
who called you guys; I have this ghost, see," and waved my arms
through her, "and at first there was a problem, but now she just has a
question,"</p>

<p class=dream>And the cops listened to Amee talk for about an hour
about the nature of man and religion and all this philosophical
jabber that the cops understood, but I did not.</p>
