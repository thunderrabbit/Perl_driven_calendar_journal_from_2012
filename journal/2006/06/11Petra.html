<p>Enjoyed a 30 minute chat with Petra today on Skype.  She's looking
for a job and will be going to London soon, hopefully.  If not, she'll
move to OZ for a year, though I don't know what city.  I signed her
brother up for a gmail account.</p>

<p>She greatly encouraged me to *not* just get a teaching job at an
eikaiwa.  Suggested I would be happier working with youth or the like.
How fantastically right she is, that Petra.  Sigh.  Can I do it in
Japan?</p>
