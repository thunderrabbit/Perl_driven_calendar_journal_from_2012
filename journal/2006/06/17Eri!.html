<p>FANTASTIC DAY with Eri all day!</p>

<p>One sleep cycle, then <em>bang</em> awake.  Rolled out to Hachiko
at 6am, not 8.  She arrived with a hug at 7:15.  All day around
Shibuya:</p>

<pre>
Mickey D's breakie
scenery from floor 3
Yoyogi Park chatty
watching scenery
Harajuku freaky
Jonathon's chowy,
Meiji Jingu walky
saw marriages three
mentioned the frisbees
Yoyogi bikey and sleepy
away from the noisy
from this point very handy
Haagen Daaz creamy
Dinner Cow Pinky
began to get darkie
wander aimlessly
glass elevator ping 15
Sang karaoke
from Eminem's Bizzy
to Madonna's Crazy
and everything in betwizzy
so completely happy
even singing off key
walked back to Shibby
though it was rainy
to Hibiya °ì½ï¤Ë
no exit »ä
goodbye hug no kissy
thanks for the memories
until we meet again, miss Eri
