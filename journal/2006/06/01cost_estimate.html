<p>Jesse just left the hospital after hanging out for a while and <em>giving me a phone</em> for up to a month with the option to take over payment if I end up staying in Japan.</p>

<p>On his way out, we checked the likely cost, which took like 100 years for them to figure out:</p>

<p>430,000 yen.</p>

<p>that's about $4000.</p>

<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>Going to call my CC company (collect, on my handy new phone!) to see if I have any travel insurance.</p>
