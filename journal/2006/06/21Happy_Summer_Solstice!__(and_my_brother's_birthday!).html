<p><b>Happy Summer Solstice!  (and my brother's birthday!)</b></p>

<pre>Hello from Tokyo!

Super duper thanks to those who have supported my recovery from the shoulder
breaking antics; the hospital(s) are now all happily paid.  My debt now is only 1/3
of that when I left college.

Interestingly, the cost of hospitalization from this incident is almost exactly the
same (not counting inflation) as when I cracked my skull (literally) while skating
back in 1993.  Therefore, I can issue this Insurance Company Alert: I cost $4000
every 13 years!

Jesse, my friend who is hosting me during recovery, teaches English at a local high
school. I recently visited all six of his classes, as a show-n-tell of sorts. 
Showed the x-rays, told the story; we had the students each draw a comic strip of
the story.  (&#34;please use lots of English!&#34;)  Most of them are really great!

(( Unfortunately, due to super-strict privacy laws, I cannot post any of them on my
website (without a large set of approvals) ... sigh ))

A month ago, I had basically chosen to do a visa run to Korea. Soon after I made
that decision, Hitomi offered to loan me the money to visit Bali for a visa run.

Wow! Bali.  From Tokyo, I'm less likely to go to Bali than Korea, so...  I'm goin'
to Bali!  I am bummed to give up the chance to see DruDaddyG in Korea, but I know
we'll stay in touch as we have since we got to Japan 3+ years ago.

That's the short update; thanks to everyone who's been supporting me!

    Love Love
     - Rob!
