<pre>Hello from recovery road!

Over the past several days I've been overwhelmed with generosity of good tidings
and monetary blessings toward my hospital bill.  So far, 140,000 yen has been paid
of the 450,000 yen total.  I feel quite thoroughly blessed and continually thankful
for the support.

In 1995, after my double-concussion skating accident, I learned the importance of
wearing a helmet.  From now on, I may learn the importance of accident insurance.

I went to the hospital on Tuesday to let the doctor get another couple of X-rays
and see how the healing is feeling.

He said the recovery is excellent, pointed out that the wound is less than the
length of the plate, and that the fracture line cannot be clearly seen in the
X-ray.

Fantastic!

I have been living in Jesse's apartment, and will probably keep doing so for the
next 3 weeks.  The deadline for escaping the country is continuing its countdown;
looks like I'll be in Korea soon for a visa-run, as we call it.  That will reset my
90 day tourist visa in Japan.  Hopefully during that run, I'll be able to hang out
with DruDaddy G, and possibly make something happen toward a new job.

It's been realllly hard to move myself forward in the job-getting phase of my life.
I use the shoulder as an excuse, working on my website as a distraction, not
wanting another English teaching job as a deterrent, ... Lots of self-made
obstacles, plus a decent amount of indecision mixed in.

I have just uploaded pictures from the day of my accident and my hospital stay,
including X-rays!  Please note, some pictures were taken by the nurse *during my
surgery*, so I have made available two versions of the album:
