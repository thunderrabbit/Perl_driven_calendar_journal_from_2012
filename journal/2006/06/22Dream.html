<p class=dream>A reporter made a young boy famous after he (the boy)
survived a rough accident, and then went on to be a notable wind
surfer, and featured in footage from a helicopter during a pretty
decent sized hurricane along the coast.</p>

<p class=dream>The boy was given $250, which he donated to charity,
and a rock garden was named in his honor.  The rock garden was more
the size of a rock flowerbed, but the rocks were still nice.  Big
naturally shaped pieces of basalt.</p>

<p>Especially if basalt is rough black "lava" rock.</p>
