<p>Hung out with Yuka tonight; we ate dinner in an Italian restaurant
in Ginza, then scoped the view from a nearby 46 story highrise with
supa-fast elevators!  They didn't have super fast ac/deceleration, but
once they got going, there were pretty speedy.</p>

<p>We randomly sat in the various display model chairs on the 46th
floor; they seem inviting, yet a bit standoffish given a numeric
designation and nameplate above each one.</p>

<p>I enjoyed getting to see a part of Ginza I had never seen before,
and learning the location of the famous fish market.</p>

<p>Had fun chatting with Yuka about sem-random topics, from past to future.</p>
