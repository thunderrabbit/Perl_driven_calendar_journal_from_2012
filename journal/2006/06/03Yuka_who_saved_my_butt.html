<p>Was contacted by Yuka today!  At first I didn't know which Yuka; I
got a message on my phone, but didn't know if it was from Kellie or
Jessie or Michael, saying that Yuka wanted to talk to me.  I am going
to PCen tonight where Yuuka will be, so I thought maybe it was a
misspelling.  But it was Yuka who saved my ass from Japanese language
oblivion in Hakone and whose family got me all the way to
Shinjuku!</p>

<p>We will hang out on Tuesday night.  Woohoo!</p>

<p>I am trying to carefully balance paying-back, vs date... but really
should just call it hanging out with a new strangely-met friend.</p>

<p>I met Dude in a really strange way, so who knows???</p>
