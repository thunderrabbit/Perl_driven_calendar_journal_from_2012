<p>Damn.  I'm kinda bummed because I can't seem to get images working
at all.  It won't do what it did before Bali, and I can't seem to
find what I changed or anything.  Slightly less enthusiastic about
this project, but I sure would hate to let it falter completely.</p>

<p>Earlier today I decided to dispense with the admin-portion that
will automagically create the tables.  Just do that in mySQL... but I
can't get anything to work.  Crap crap crap.</p>
