I appreciate your willingness to support me through email.

This email will be in a few different parts:

A) initial sort of Life Topics
B) self analysis of each topic
C) answers to questions I think you'll have

-----------

A)  I sorted my list by how much the topic needs to be addressed:

1) Finance
2) Career
3) Spiritual
4) Physical
5) Social
6) Family
7) Environment
8) Play
9) Intellect
10) Art

------

B) These are my gut feelings about each item.
      + items labeled with plus are things working well now
      -  items labeled with minus are most in need of attention

1) Finance:  10%   fear, anxiety, courage
   I've been begging for money recently.  Currently -$5000 (negative)
   net cash.  No predicatble income
 + recently worked as a mystery shopper (one time deal, $45)
 -  critically need to get a job, but fear choosing the wrong one / wrong country

2) Career:  10%  unsustainable, low self worth, joy
   I have no job.  Been working on a project for my website.  The
   project will be given away free for other web designers, who will
   hopefully find it useful.
+  writing software to be given away free
-  need to work more with people, less with computers

3) Spiritual:  5%  sadness, joy
   Finished 10 day Vipassana meditation recently.  Already stopped
   daily meditation in daily life.
 + staying close to the idea of positive spiritual work
 - need to do daily meditation

4) Physical: 70%  growth, sadness, sloppy diet
   Poor food intake, not always cooking for self, limited exercise,
   broke left shoulder, but it is recovering
 + cooked for myself today;  drank water today
 - ate 110 grams of chocolate today

5) Social  20%  sadness, fear, stuck

   Been indoors a lot.  Went out with Eri all day yesterday and loved
   every moment
   Rarely talk to Jesse (apt mate).  Hitomi is probably mad at me
 + Fabulous day with Eri
 - it was yesterday  /  need to plan trip to Bali with Hitomi

6) Family: 60%  joy, sadness
   Close to Fred (brother), pretty close to Ma (mom), not so close to Dad (dad)
 + email works well with Fred
 - need other means to communicate with Dad

7) Environment:  30%  shame, blessed
   Currently living rent free with Jesse.  My room is messy
 + in a safe place with internet
 - I judge I'm not paying for it

8) Play: 100% joy
  almost 100% free time
+  can do anything
-  have limited money

9) Intellect:  70%  joy, sadness
   I keep stimuated with internet.  Don't watch TV.  I only have a
   bachelors degree.  not studying Japanese much.
 + internet for news
 - only speaking English on day to day basis

A) Art:  60%  joy
   I have lots of artistic ideas, but haven't really implemented many.
   Have classified my website as art, because I create it for its own sake
 + lots of time on my website
 - not painting recently

---------------------

C)  questions I think you will have after reading part B above

1) Finance.  I could get a job in about 1 day (if I sign a year
   contract), but I don't really want to work as a teacher anymore.
   Fear of missing the Best Job Ever keeps me from starting with a
   crap job first; I don't want to break a contract

2) Career: I want my career to be helping individuals' personal
   growth.  I would love to work with youth.  I have lots of
   judgements that I can't get that career started in Japan, and
   without more formalized training

4) Physical: The broken shoulder has very little affect on my outlook
   in this department.  It's mostly around nutrition and exercise.

-----------------

Thank you again for your quick support.  I feel blessed to have you as
a safety net so when I hit the bottom, I can get back up quickly.

(( I feel super doubly blessed that my "rock bottom" includes living
in a safe place, with food and internet, friends who love me, and
unlimited potential for growth..))

Blessings and Love
   - Rob
