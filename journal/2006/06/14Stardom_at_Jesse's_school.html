<p>Just got back from hanging out with Jesse, starting at the high
school where he teaches thrice a week.  He had told his students about
me and my accident; they all wrote get well notes which he brought me
while I was in the hospital.</p>

<p>Because he had told them all about me, I was pretty much like a
star for a day in those classes, with a lot of the girls squealing
and wanting to take pictures with me (or both of us) and stuff.  Two
of them asked me if I had a girlfriend.</p>

<p>It was definitely fun for a day, and I would definitely do it
again, but I can't imagine doing it all the time.</p>
