<p>Just spent about 3 or 4 hours talking to Jesse then Michael about
religion and spirituality and beliefs.  Michael listened quite
carefully to me explaining my entire belief system about God and
stuff, and pointed out a few apparent inconsistencies, which I must
admit are pretty apparent.</p>

<p>I was like, "well, depending upon who gives me feedback, I'll get
different answers: bible, koran, etc etc."</p>

<p>He was like, "I won't say the first step is The Bible."</p>

<p>"What, then?"</p>

<p>"Faith."</p>

<p>When I asked what he meant, basically, my paraphrase of his paraphrase:</p>

<pre>Know that I cannot live an optimal life without input from God.

Know that God is willing to be my constant advisor if I wish.</pre>

<p>Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Then I looked in terms of Vipassana:</p>

<pre>
Perceive reality in its infinite detail.

Experience that nothing is permanent.  Relax.
</pre>

<p>Hmmmmmm.</p>
