<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Summer Solstice is my favorite day of the year!  I love summer;
I love the sun; I love the most daylight hours possible.</p>

<p>It's ironic, then, that I have been inside on my computer for days
and days.  And living in a country where June is a rainy season.</p></li>

<li><p>21 June is also my brother's birthday.</p></li>

<li><p>21 June is also the day Wende and I plan<b>ned</b> to get
married.  In some parallel univii, we are celebrating our four year
anniversary.</p></li>

<li><p>I am in Japan, living rent-free in Jesse's apartment, using
rent-free Hitomi's computer, healing nearly-pain-free my left
shoulder, which is still in a brace (1 more week) after I broke it in
Hakone on 29 May.</p></li>

<li><p>Been working diligently on images, an image viewer to allow
viewing of images on my site via tags, events, locations, or dates.
It will be released as freeware when it's done.</p>

<p>So far, I have a framework that throws exceptions (Error.pm), knows
what tables are needed (next step will create those tables upon admin
login), uses CGI::Ajax for asynchronous coolness, uses Javascript
tabifier and tooltips, and can tell if we should be in admin mode or
user mode upon displaying the main screen.</p>

<p>Long way to go, but good framework, and hopefully one that will
allow me to redo my journal entry indexes (by tag, event, location,
date) as well.</p></li>

<li><p>To that end, I have just set up ~/.emacs to add</p>
<pre>
&lt;!tags: &gt;
&lt;!events: &gt;
&lt;!locations: Tokyo, Jesse's&gt;
</pre>

<p>to the top of each journal entry to make the indexing process
easier.</p>

<p>My idea now is to fill this in for all future entries, and past
entries as I feel the urge.  When it's time to index (the massive
initial load and then each time I upload thereafter), snag those
keywords into the db and then (probably) remove them from the file,
though that would be a good(?) backup of the information.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm using Hitomi's laptop because she is super considerate,
and knows how much I like working on my site.  It's a PowerBook G4,
12-inch screen, and Japanese style keyboard with the @ and &quot; keys
mixed up, the * and + keys in the wrong place, the _ and = and ' and
many others all in messed up places.  It drives me a bit crazy, but
is well-better than being on a Windows machine.</p>

<p>My HD also died in the crash, and Hitomi said she would try to get
it fixed.  Haven't heard anything back on that, but I think (in this
case) that is actually good news.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitomi and I are going to Bali (24-29 June) for my visa run.  I
have basically released the idea of working in Korea.  It may still
happen, but my visa-status is not tied to going there.</p></li>

<li><p>I have also released the idea of working in Japan.  This life
of being a bum is pretty appealing.</p>

<p>(But,)</p></li>

<li><p>After a bit of a mental meltdown a few days ago, I recontacted
my personal coach Kim Sawyer to get back into the process of designing
my life with purpose instead of just getting what is handed to me.
Part of me doesn't really want to do the work, but one little step at
a time, I intend for a bigger part of me to get it done.</p>

<p>I expect that process will give the answer to where I will work
next.</p></li>

<li><p>(I can argue both sides: I am deferring the decision to an
outside source, and I am deferring the decision to my own higher
source, with outside guidance.)</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday was Ma's birthday!  She is in St Louis at GA. (not
Georgia, General Assembly of the UUA)</p></li>

<li><p>Semi-foolishly, I have been on this computer so much that I'm
getting symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.  But, tonight, when Hitomi
and I meet to finalize Bali plans, she will bring the Mini-DIV to VGA
adapter that came with her computer, so I can put her computer as a
keyboard in my lap, and use Jesse's terminal as the screen.</p></li>

<li><p>If I had a bit more money, I would buy an external keyboard,
but I plan to put that off until I get a new computer.  (But
why?)</p></li>

<li><p>According to my Google spreadsheet, I am in debt 653,418±ß or
$5,736.45.</p>

<p>Basically all from my little Hakone crash, but definitely a
portion due to <em>not working</em> in 15 months!</p></li>

<li><p>Though not 100% abstinate, I haven't had sexual intercourse
since before PB52.  So that's 5 or 6 months now.  Definitely a recent
record for me.</p></li>

<li><p>I've gotten well-sidetracked in chat-mode (with Calder); I
think that's it for this entry.</p></li>
