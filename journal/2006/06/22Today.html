<p>Been a pretty productive day on my images code.  I printed the
code and gave it a good scrubbing, then figured out how to get a main
window alongside the sidebar.</p>

<p>Now I've just redesigned a way cooler way of determining what can
actions should be available at a given moment.  This technique will
allow me to remove a try { } catch { }; from within a catch { }, (I've
moved the original error detection to the outer try { }) and made the
status checking is more subtle; it will be able to more precisely
determine what we can do, including if we can do nothing.</p>

<p>During the day I've been using the monitor adapter Hitomi loaned
me, so I've been able to use Jesse's monitor with Hitomi's laptop in
my <em>lap</em>, which makes for happier shoulder(s), wrists, and
hands.</p>
