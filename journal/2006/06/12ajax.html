<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>I finally got my Ajax thing installed so I can work on doing some
interesting AJAXy type stuff.</p>

<p>The trick to get them installed:</p>

<pre>
0) in .bash_profile  PERL5LIB=~/lib/perl5/site_perl/

1) in unzipped module directory:
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
make
make test
make install
</pre>

<p>So I have smurfed one of their coding examples and come up with
this, <a href="/cgi-bin/rob_first_AJAX.pl">my first AJAX thing</a></p>
