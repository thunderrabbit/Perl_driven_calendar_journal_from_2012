<p>Got back from Bali this morning.</p>

<p>At Jesse's all afternoon after PB.  Haven't worked on images, but
have realized I need to do one more bit of stuff: need secure login,
which I hope to achieve with CGI::SecureState.</p>

<p>Tonight Michael hosted a bible study, which I attended to get the
free food.  I was hard pressed to gently ignore Steve, who I see as a
bible verse spewing nut at worst, and a better speaker than listener
at best.  I won't even begin to try and debate him; he has never
listened to my arguements before, but just whips out something that
starts with "well, in the bible it says..." even when I said I don't
take the bible as a book of truths.</p>

<p>But what really pissed me off today (I so wished Maruan had been
here) was when Steve was like, "the koran is a book of death written
by the devil," or some such nonsense.  I thought <em>have you ever
read the koran?</em>, but was completely unwilling to actually engage
him, verbally or otherwise.</p>
