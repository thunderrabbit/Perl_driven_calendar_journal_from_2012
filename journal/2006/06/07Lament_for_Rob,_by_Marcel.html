A [Manly] Lament for Rob
by Marcel

How long has Rob been in Japan?
Away from the States in a far away land?
Distant from friends and the ice cream man
He's gone, gone, gone

How do we know the emails we gets
And the website updates so-called "he" submits
Are really from Rob the friend we miss?
He's gone, gone, gone

Some measure time in days they've made
Or in weeks away or in paychecks paid
Or maybe even in women they've... dated
But Rob's gone, gone, gone

But me I don't count in days, weeks, or years
And I'm too sober to count time in beers
An' I ain't no sissy so I don't count tears
Tho' he's gone, gone, gone

As for me, how I count I'll give you a hint
I count kids that I've had since the day that he went
So far there's been two that Kayse and I did invent
Since he's gone, gone, gone

Maybe in the future he'll come back and we'll say
It's about time! or Yeah! or Hooray!
Even if he only stays for a day
But Rob's gone, gone, gone

<p>Oh, mate</p>

<p>You're the bestest.</p>

<p>I'm definitely posting this (with a tear)</p>

<p>I can clearly remember the fun times we had at your parentals, in
February 2003 just after the Colombia disintegrated, and just before I
left.  But especially I remember the last moment, saying bye to
Adrien, and him saying something that meant "I want to see you soon"
and me knowing that in terms of a young boy, it wouldn't be soon at
all...  but I wanted to see him again soon, too.</p>

<p>Such a crazy life I've chosen these past few years...  Would never
change it, but often wonder how my life would be different if Wende
and I got married and stayed in that house we both loved.</p>
