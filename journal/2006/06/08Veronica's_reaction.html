<p>From my friend Veronica, an MD, and married to Dude:</p>

Hey Rob I can't believe the docs agreed to take pics of you in the
operating room! I don't think anyone would do that for you in the US.
That fracture looked like it was probably pretty painful.  You
actually are lucky that you didn't puncture your lung.  Hope you are
recovering well.  When are you ever going to come back to the US?  We
miss you!
Veronica
