<p>Met Nachiko and Erika for lunch today!  The lunch had originally
been planned for Odawara, the day before I broke my shoulder.  Super
thanks to each of them for 1.5 and 1 hour train rides each way to
meet me near Futakotamagawa!</p>

<p>Rain forced us inside instead of a picnic by the river, but we
enjoyed chatting and chowing on one of the benches in the middle of
the prepared food counters featuring every imaginable overpriced food
one could buy in Japan.</p>

<p>Played a question-asking game that started out with softball
questions and then finished when I asked "who do you want to meet?"
and Nachiko was like Mother Theresa, and Erika was like, I don't know,
and I was like, "the person who orchestrated Airplane Day" and
explained why I smell a proverbial rat in the official version.</p>

<p>Nachiko's interest seemed piqued enough to do some research for
herself.  Rockin'</p>
