<p>My computer seems to be fucked.  I'm pretty bummed about this, and have noticed a distinct feeling of withdrawl without it.</p>

<p>(As I write this, it's actually 9am Saturday)</p>

<p>I looked a bit more carefully into my brain around why I want my computer, and it seems that I just want to write journal entries, .. like a compulsion to record each moment before it's lost in the continual changing of time.</p>

<p>Plus it really sucks to not have secure access to my website so I can be working on getting photos uploaded and stuff!</p>

<p>I am hoping / expecting some interesting Macintosh related news will occur tomorrow (Sunday) when I meet with Tomoko, Sumidasan and Hitomi.</p>

<p>What about just chilling and letting my shoulder heal????</p>

<p>Hmmmmmm.  interesting concept.</p>
