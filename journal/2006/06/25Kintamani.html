<p>I thought it was funny to sit in the restaurant and look across the
"valley" at a volcano... but then realize we were actually sitting on
the edge of the crater wall of a much larger volcano, and the volcano
inside the crater (valley) was just like a big pimple compared to the
one on which we were seated.</p>
