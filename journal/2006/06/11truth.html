<p>Just found this article, <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/us/11recruit.html?pagewanted=all">Online
Persona Undermines a Resume</a>, and wondered for one microsecond if I
should therefore remove any content from my site.</p>

<p>I realize I am not willing to remove anything in an attempt to look
good for employment purposes, yet at the same time I do sometimes
censor some things per the (implicit) request of other (innocent)
people involved.</p>
