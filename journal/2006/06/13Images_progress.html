<p>Been making forward progress on my images code.  Just now saving
table creation code, created by phpMyAdmin, which, despite its php
roots, seems to be worthy of use.  In fact, it's pretty kick ass.</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE `tags` (
  `tagID` INT( 6 ) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY ,
  `tag_sortname` VARCHAR( 20 ) NOT NULL ,
  `tag_displayname` VARCHAR( 25 ) NOT NULL ,
INDEX ( `tag_sortname` ) ,
UNIQUE ( `tag_displayname` )
) TYPE = MYISAM COMMENT = 'tags created with phpMyAdmin 13 June 2006';
</pre>

<p>Nice.  Now I've got the code so it's being run through CGI::Ajax,
which will allow me to do neat things without full browser refreshes.
The first neat thing I got it to do is pull up tags that match a
search query.  The query is run with each keystroke, so no need to hit
return.</p>

<p>It's not has fast as I would like it to be, but I pretty much ain't
even gonna worry 'bout dat.</p>

<p>Next step: to learn how to hide and display things.  Right now the
tag search field is hardcoded onto the front page. Instead, it needs
to have a hideable sidebar with various content in it.  Hideable is
optional, but gotta allow tags/calendar/event/random to be
browsed/searched</p>
