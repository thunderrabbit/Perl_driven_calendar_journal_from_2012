<p>Wow.  Now, thanks 100% to <a
href="http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/">Javascript
Tabifier</a>, the images code now has tabs that will eventually
display the different types of search criteria that can be
specified.</p>

<p>That worked so easily that I want to add tooltips to it with <a
href="http://boxover.swazz.org/">Boxover by Swazz</a>, but so far I
haven't figured out how.</p>

<p>Argh.  No progress made.  Good night.</p>
