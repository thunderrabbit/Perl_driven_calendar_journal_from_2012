<p>For me, the <a
href="http://www.baliadventuretours.com/BAT-Elephant_Park.htm">elephant
safari</a> was basically the best thing about Bali.  I had never
actually touched/petted/communed with an elephant before, and felt
complete love with these beautiful animals.</p>

<p>After talking to Eko (human) and Komeng (pachyderm) for a while, I
felt assured they were really genuine and Eko wasn't just using
Komeng to make money.</p>

<p>We rode around the "little" petting area, went elephant rafting,
and generally had a great time!</p>
