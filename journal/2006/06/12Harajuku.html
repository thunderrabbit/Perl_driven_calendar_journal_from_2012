<p>Did the mystery shopper thing at the Adidas store in Harajuku.  It
was generally pretty easy, and a bit... useless, given that the store
didn't stock 1/2 the products I was supposed to see if they knew
about, and the other 1/2 they didn't have in my size.  Ah well.  I
turned in the report and explained all that.  I hope the outcome helps
them out.</p>
