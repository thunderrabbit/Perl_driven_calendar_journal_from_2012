<p class=note>(transcribed from book)</p>

<p>According to the map, from Takadanobaba, 35km traveled.  From
Jesse's, an extra 15km backtracking.</p>

<p>Slept a few hours in my tent near a river on the border of
Atsugi-shi, maybe 10 or 15km from that McDonald's.  I can't find my
light, and can barely see what I'm writing.  Today I discovered that
while there is nothing like finding unclaimed money on the sidewalk,
there's definitely nothing like finding unclaimed <em>chocolate</em>
on the sidewalk!  I found two pieces, one wrapped and the other
ready-to-eat.</p>

<p>More sleeping now.</p>
