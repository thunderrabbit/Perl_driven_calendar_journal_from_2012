<p>I'm writing this entry to give a bit of props to the manager at
this McDonald's for the free ice coffee, letting me use the electrical
outlet, and running around to get me set up on their wireless internet
connection.  It is definitely most appreciated.</p>

<p>If I am able to get connected, I might be here for a while.  In
any case, I'm going to ask him how I can give him props: buy a
sandwich, write a comment form, etc.</p>

<p>D'oh; that didn't last long.  He's unable to get the password.
But he did try to find a local park where I can snooze, but came up
empty, but told me this area has had some incidents, so isn't exactly
safe.  I'm sure his idea of incidents is quite minor, but I'll keep
it in mind when looking for a place to snooze tonight.</p>

<p>I filled out a questionnaire, giving all positives and thanking
the manager for answering my questions about the area.</p>

<p>I'm a bit paralyzed with the anticipation of how cold it will be
outside; I don't really want to go freeze my booty off.  But it's
time to go go go.</p>
