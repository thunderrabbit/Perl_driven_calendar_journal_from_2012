<p class="date">4:08pm JST Sunday 16 April 2006 (day 13171)</p>

<p>I just spent like 4 hours slogging through the huge backlog of
emails that have accumulated during the PB adventure, and my
bicycling without wireless internet adventure..  Got from about 400
messages to 177 in my inbox.</p>

<p>Good to get in touch with some peeps I hadn't touched in a while!</p>

<p>But still, a bit disheartening to have not heard from Richard in
Kobe nor the woman I wrote to in Kyoto to see if I could sleep on one
of their couches (closer to the meditation center than here at the
farm).</p>
