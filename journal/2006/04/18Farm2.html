<p>This time was quite pleasantly non-difficult, a pleasant last(?)
time to work on the farm, where we basically just burned a lot of the
bamboo and hardwood branches and trunks I cut yesterday and this
morning.</p>

<p>I got an awesome splinter, a bit over a centimeter long, right
under the top layer of skin.  Bamboo splinters are really strong.</p>

<p><em>Bamboo</em> is really strong, and I have decided that if I
ever build my own house, especially in a bambooie climate, I'm going
to make it out of bamboo, or a good part of it.  Or at least the tree
house will be made of bamboo.</p>
