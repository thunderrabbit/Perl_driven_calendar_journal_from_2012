<p><b>back in Tokyo, just about to go go go!</b></p>

<pre>Hello from Tokyo!

I'm feeling like this is really and truly the most ridiculous thing I could do...
(&#34;stupid&#34; is the word that comes to mind).  I've told everyone that I'm going to
ride my bicycle (TJ Bike) to Kyoto.  Starting tomorrow.  Right after lunch with
Natalie in Takadanobaba.

How crazy am I?

I'm just paralyzed with fear of the thousand unknowns, not least of which is the
distinct absence of my map-book of western Japan, that part that includes Kyoto.

I just want to give up and buy a plane ticket and go home.

In other news, I am back from the 52nd Global Voyage on PB!  The latter weeks of 
the voyage were more relaxed for me; I began meditating each morning for 30 minutes, 
and that helped calm my brain from stressing about the end of the voyage.

I don't think I've fully acclimated after the voyage; I have been having dreams
about my fellow GET Teachers; I'm still really tired.   Haven't caught up on email
yet, and a multi-week trip to Kyoto for a 10 day meditation won't really help with
that.

It's not much of an update, but I just wanted to capture the self-induced turmoil
in my life and brain.

   Peace and Blessings to all!
