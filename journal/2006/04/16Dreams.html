<p class="dream">A bad guy was at the entrance to the cave at the
bottom of a beach and we had to get into the cave without him
shooting us.  The cave, however, was a dead-end, but I was assured we
could use the rocks in the back of the cave to block the front of the
cave in a way that he couldn't break through, not even during the
construction process.  But, in order for us to get back out again, we
would have to remember the technique we had used to place the rocks,
and the easiest way to do that, I was told, was to use a specific
number of stones on each level of building this wall.</p>

<p class="dream">I was asked to choose a number and stick with it,
any number would do, but it was of vital importance that the number
be remembered, and be accurate.</p>

<p class="dream">I couldn't understand how we were able to place small
stones or large stones, as I was doing, and the sizes not matter, but
just the number of stones.  To test the theory, I placed some really
oddly shaped stones, like vertical plates of glass from museum-sized
aquariums, little wedge shaped stones, and a revolving door.  The
theory held, but I found counting the stones difficult with all the
glass reflecting and refracting, and odd shapes in between.</p>

<p class="dream">We ended up with an escalator built into our cave,
going up to the top of the mountain, but didn't finish something, so
when we started back down, the bad guy was at the base of the
escalator waiting for us.</p>

<p class="dream">I noticed him before getting on the escalator, and
saw he had a small high powered rifle, so I backed up and wondered
how I could get away.</p>

<p class="dream">I recognized it was a dream, so I could just fly
backwards, and even if he tried to shoot me, I could slow the bullets
down like Bullet Time in The Matrix.  Then I realized it was my
dream, so I was as powerful as Neo: I just said, "no" and stopped all
the bullets.</p>

<p class="dream">I was in the bedroom of my ex-girlfriend, but with
whom I still hoped I could hook up.  She left the room, and I was
like, "I hope she comes back sits on my face," but then her younger
sister came in so I was like, "HI!" and all horniness vanished as I
was totally in babysitter-mode.</p>

<p class="dream">We dream-shifted out onto the sidewalk and the sister
was asking me questions, like, "when you are 35 do you start to have
dreams?"</p>

<p class="dream">and I was like, "still?"</p>

<p class="dream">and she's like, "oh yeah, when you are 35 do you
still have dreams?"</p>

<p class="dream">and I was all, "do you keep a diary?"</p>

<p class="dream">"yeah,"</p>

<p class="dream">and was about to say, "ever since I started writing
down my dreams, I remember more and more dreams, in more vivid
detail,"</p>

<p class="dream">but just then Christine was walking up with her
father, and I was totallly shocked cause I haven't seen her in years,
so I was like, "just a moment" and went up to hesitantly embrace
Christine, who didn't really hug me back, but as she walked away was
like, "call me tomorrow," as if I knew the number, and I rememember
the first part, but had to confirm the last 4 digits and ended up with
522-4333, and she was like, "yeah, I'll be free tomorrow [so be sure
to call]."</p>

<p class="dream">In a building that was being remodeled to fit a new
need, but the staircases were all staying in the same place, so it
was like being able to see from a new perspective what the building
looked like internally.</p>

<p class="dream">Where a wall had been was now a door which opened to
a staircase, which was adjacent to a set of low-angle escalators, one
going down, and the other up to someplace new.</p>

<p class="dream">Fred and I were going to race to point B, but the
rule was we had to get lost first by going someplace unknown by going
into the maze of construction.  We climbed over the stair railing onto
the down escalator and then to the up escalator and ended up outside
in a downtown city that I knew well, and the building way over there,
but in direct sight.</p>

<p class="dream">We cancelled the game because we hadn't really
gotten all that lost.  But then I realized I could win because I was
dreaming and could just teleport myself to the building.</p>
