<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I am living in Koji and Masako's house in Shima-shi, down about 3 or 4
hundred kilometers southwest from Tokyo.  Koji was one of my students on PB
52nd voyage in Fantastic Rabbits.  I've been here about a week now,
helping out on their farm (about a 2.5 minute drive from here).</p>

<p>It's been a really cushy lifestyle.</p></li>

<li><p>Their house features low ceilings and door frames low enough
that I still sometimes hit my head.  (This was the same in Millenium
House, but I remembered to duck after a bit.)  They've also got a
shower with hot water (water for washing dishes must be heated on the
stove), but the tiled bath (built down into the shower floor) has a
couple holes near the bottom so cannot be used to hold (much)
water.</p>

<p>And they have a toilet that never needs flushing!  It's a
composting toilet, with all the shit and stuff about three feet below
the floor.  The weather has been cold, so it doesn't usually stink a
lot, but sometimes it does..</p>

<p>I've got my own room and futon.</p>

<p>As my house slippers, I use the ug boots Bryn bought me from
Australia back in the day.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been without TCP/IP access for my computer since April
4th, when I got hooked up in that PC school.  Holy fuck - basically 2
weeks.  I may wander around this "neighborhood" tonight looking for a
WiFi signal.</p>

<p>I have, however, had basic email access with Masako's AOHell
account on dialup and Windows Sucks 98.</p></li>

<li><p>I've still been on my computer a lot, even without internet I
find it comforting.  Been learning/playing/tweaking Emacs a lot,
including having made several customizations to the sgml-mode.el file
to help make html pages (a bit) easier to write.</p>

<p>I have zone-mode on Emacs; it zones out after 2 minutes of
inactivity.</p></li>

<li><p>During all this emacking around, I have decided to make all my
code GNU Copyleft freeware, instead of Sford's almost freeware (give
me appropriate credit, and document your changes, don't make money off
my (or other peoples') work).</p></li>

<li><p>I've been cleansing old directories from as far back as 2002,
which I archived while working at FSD and nerding over at Dude and
Veronica's house.  Lots and lots and lots of pictures to go
online.</p></li>

<li><p>Also been reading The Fellowship Of The Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien.
On page 111, where Frodo, Sam and Pippin have just started their
journey from their homes, though they are still in the Shire.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not been using dvorak layout in a long time (basically
not since before PB 52nd voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I am "on a bicycle ride" from Tokyo to Kyoto, though I have
fully stopped here at Koji's, and no sign of emails from Richard, nor
a woman listed on couchsurfing.com, after asking each of them if I
could stay over a couple nights.</p></li>

<li><p>I did hear recently from Kazzah (Karen) from PB, saying I
could crash over at her place, but that will be after Kyoto.</p></li>

<li><p>In Kyoto I plan to do a 10 day silent meditation in the
Vipassana style: no reading, no writing, no speaking (to other
participants, though there is a nightly Q/A session with the leader),
and perhaps no alcohol, drugs, smoking, but those don't affect me.
Oh, and no killing any living creature.</p>

<p>The course is free, including food and lodging for the 10 days.
We can give a donation afterward if we found it useful.</p>

<p>Greg (teacher on 49th voyage) and Kentaro (CC on 52nd voyage) have
both done it and highly recommend it.  Kentaro said, "it's really
really difficult,.. but you should do it!"</p>

<p>I think Rochelle (Portland / Jerusalem) has done it, or at least a
similar duration meditation, and said it gave her some profound
experiences.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really meditated since PB.</p></li>

<li><p>It doesn't look like I'll be on PB 54th voyage with Natalie as
coordinator, and Carla (my favorite NOVA teacher) from Detroit/Canada
as repeater, but I will probably try for 55th voyage with Phil.  If I
don't get that, then I probably won't try again.  Not sure, though,
really.</p></li>

<li><p>In fact, I basically have no idea what I'm going to do after
the meditation.  Basic plan is to go back to Tokyo, perhaps via Kaz's
house in Nagoya, (possibly) Eri's in Nagano (if she ever responds to
my email), and Alice's in northwest Tokyo, but I basically don't
know.</p>

<p>I'm hoping for some brilliant awakening or inspiration or at least
an idea for what to do next while I'm in meditation.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't smoke (*), have never done drugs, basically never drink
alcohol, and have never been drunk.</p>

<p>(*) I can't say I've never smoked, because I tried it when I was
14ish, but never past that.</p>

<p>I do love sweets, though.  And sex.  Though I've officially not had
any since before 52nd voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I've got no girlfriend, no pets (it even seems I've lost touch
with Jennifer who is/was keeping Spot), no apartment, no job.</p>

<p>Just two suitcases at Jesse's house, TJ Bike downstairs, six small
bags (basically clothes and sleeping equipment), one beloved computer,
and 12,000 yen.  And Francois.</p>

<p>And some stuff in the US, according to this list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p class=date>9:02pm Sunday 14 July 2002</p>

<p>Maggie:
<br />Five boxes, including diaries, photo albums, some CDs, marble track, coin collection, high school and college files</p>

<p>Fred:
<br />purchased all my CDs for $100 (and will give them all back for
$100), modified ball clock</p>

<p>Suzanne:
<br />sacred box including Rabby, warrior photos, Jason's turtle-stick
from SWUUSI 1998</p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>Haven't talked to Maggie nor Suzanne in a while.  I hope they
are okay, and okay still holding my stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>I enjoy telling people what Fred is up to:</p>

<p>Designing a system by which heart surgeons can do a simulated
surgery on their actual patient's heart given a CAT scan (?) MRI (?)
of the patient.  This is his PhD project (in Computer Science,
Mathematics and Engineering), at he's <em>getting an MD</em> while
he's at it.</p>

<p>He may or may not agree with the deets, but that's what I tell
people.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is my Macintosh PowerBook G4 667MHz CPU, 133 MHZ
bus, with 512 megs of ram and 30 (27.94) gig HD (2.56 GB free), CD-RW
drive, 14 or 15 inch LCD screen at 1280 x 854 pixels and 32-bit color
that sometimes takes a bit of fiddling (gentle hits) to get it to come
all the way on, with two USB ports, 400 MB/sec FireWire port, AirPort
card (firmware 9.52), a modem I've never used, running OS X 10.3.9
(Panther, I think) on unix kernel Darwin 7.9.0</p>

<p>Right now with these applications:</p>

<li><p>I recently read The Gospel According to John in The New
Testament (English Standard Version), at Jesse's request, but I still
fail to be impressed that I should become Christian.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently I have begun at times to simply be aware of my
breathing, and aware of where I am / what I'm doing.  While weeding
today, I had the pleasant feeling of success: I have escaped the
cubicled world of computer programming every day; I am basically
carefree, chillin' in the sunlight on a beautiful day just picking
little tufts of grass from a bed of potatoes.</p>

<p>I began to thank each little tuft for having grown there just so I
could pick it and enjoy this moment.</p></li>

<li><p>After my most recent Rob Update, someone (and I'm embarassed to
say I don't remember who) congratulated me on "doing it.  Not someday,
but <em>now</em>."  I think that blessing had a big positive impact on
my way of thinking about my life at this moment.</p></li>
