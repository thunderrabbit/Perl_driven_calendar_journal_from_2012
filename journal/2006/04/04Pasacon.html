<p>Super thank you to the ももたろうパソコン教 <a
href="mailto:s-hadano$bl.mmtr.or.jp">s-hadano$bl.mmtr.or.jp</a>
(change $ to @), for letting me use their internet connection.  I'm
surprised they don't have a URL, but...</p>

<p>I scoped an email from Rie; her parents no longer live in
Mishima.  There goes that idea!</p>

<p>On my way out, I was invited to have a cup of coffee, so I asked if
tea was okay, but they repeated coffee, so I declined, but I should
have stayed and told my story and gave my business card.  Dammit.  I
was a bit embarassed to stay given how I think I must stink.</p>
