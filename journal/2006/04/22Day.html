<p class="date">1:39pm JST Monday 24 April 2006 (day 13179)</p>

<p>It's been a couple of days, so I don't think I'll try to do
justice to writing a full entry about it.</p>

<p>Suffice that the ride was long, and had a couple of great downhill
zooms, and I was really happy to see Richard again, and super thankful
to be treated to dinner, and to have a warm bed for sleeping
purposes.</p>

<p>I took pictures of different tunnels; I'll use those as
touchpoints for a story.</p>

     <br><b>boat on building</b>
<p>I was surprised to see this boat on top of the building, even
though I had seen an billboard for it a couple miles before.</p>

<p>I saw it and was like, "<em>that</em>'s worth a picture!"</p>

     <br><b>good night's sleep</b>
<p>I rode a realllly long time after the amazing gift of hamburgers
from Mamirun and friends.  At one point I stopped at a pedestrian
overpass, and sat on the steps and at one of the cheese burgers.  I
literally fell asleep while eating it!</p>

<p>Woke up, finished eating, continued riding; I wanted to get to highway 163.  Around
2:30am (April 22nd) I stopped to sleep here. I got up early; this
picture was taken at 5:24am on the 22nd!</p>    </td>

     <br><b>tunnel</b>
<p>This was my first tunnel of the day.  I don't 100% remember it,
but I think this is the one with  pretty tight turns on the hill
below, and I was a bit worried for my  safety.  But not worried
enough to slow down!</p>

     <br><b>road 668</b>
<p>Took this picture as a timestamp after the tunnel and subsequent
downhill run.  I estimate I averaged about 20 something km/hour.  Top
speed was probably 40+ km/hour.</p>

<p>I thought of Hannah in Memphis when I saw this sign for ninjas!!</p>

<p>Super happy and surprised to see a sign for Nara!  I consulted my
map and confirmed it's <em>the</em> Nara that janette and I visited,
with all the deer and the big Buddha and .... I had basically ridden
TJ Bike there!!</p>

     <br><b>long (1.1km) Kiyotaki Daiichi tunnel</b>
     <p><em>This</em> tunnel was *amazing* for me on bicycle.  Super
     long, super loud, *and* (if I remember correctly), I almost ate
     it when the sidewalk made a dogleg in the middle of the
     tunnel!!  I was like, "what's that up ahead?" as some abberation
     in the sidewalk quickly sped toward me...</p>

<p>OH SHIT!  THAT'S A RAILING!!!</p>

<p>And I slammed on my breaks (which didn't work for crap), and
slammed down my foot to drag and stop..  Whew!!!!!!</p>
