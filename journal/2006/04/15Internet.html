<p>Tony took me to the library today where I was able to use internet
on a machine that had a direct connection and a browser a bit more
supported than AOL.  Got a chance to poke around on google calendar,
and got a crazy idea of mirroring my journal on a public calendar.
The interface is not all that great for such things, and there's
really no *reason* to do it, but it was just an idea for a moment.
I'm sure I will not spend much more time on it.</p>

<p>Was impressed that google map was available on the location bar,
but ... of course it was available!  Then I thought it would be rad
to pinpoint locations easily from google maps to the calendar, but I
didn't see a way to do that.  Just a one way thing, from Calendar to
Maps..  In this case, "west of Kyoto" did not resolve to a location
anywhere near Japan, but came up with about four points scattered
across the US.</p>

<p>Didn't see a way to have something repeat an arbitrary number of
days; I'd like a 500 day counter for my days old, but that still
doesn't seem possible.  Have to write it myself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their computer wasn't able to read my USB keychain,
so I couldn't do what I had hoped: upload journal entries from the
past 10 days or so.  This is basically a longer break from uploading
than even during PB voyages!</p>

<p>So even if I write a Rob Update on my keychain, I can't upload it
via their machine.</p>

<p>I may try to wander around the neighborhood, looking for
hotspots.</p>

<p>Man, how I wish to have a little palm-sized WiFi detector that
would just vibrate or something when it detects a free connection.
Just have it in my pocket, walk around town for a stroll, and feel
when the love is in the air...</p>

<p>Though the sign read (in Japanese) specifically not to use mail nor
chat, I got to chat with Fred a bit; that was nice.</p>
