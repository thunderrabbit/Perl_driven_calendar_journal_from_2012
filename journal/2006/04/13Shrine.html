<p>There was some event today, perhaps featuring a parade/ceremony
that happens once every 20 years.  A sign read in part:</p>

<pre>
There is a rite which is called Shikinensengu that involves all the shrines 
within the Ise Grand Shrines being razed and then reconstructed on the 
designate [sic] site next to the present location every 20 years.  This 
traditional event has been continued for about the last 1,300 years.

<p>Today we saw a rather large crowd of people pulling a few wooden
carts as shown in the photo on the sign, so perhaps this was part of
the once-in-20-years event!</p>
