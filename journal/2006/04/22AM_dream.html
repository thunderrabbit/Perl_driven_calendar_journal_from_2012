<p class="dream">Woman asked about my toothbrushing - what time and
her English was perfect.  kept talking and she was fat and hairy,
misshapen, then became okay after she acknowledged it.  She gave me a
pager, and her hubby came.  She left and the pager went off with a
secret message (secret from him).  directions: take off jacket, go to
the post office, get a key, get mail, bring it to counter, etc etc.
I was slow to start because I wanted to be casual about it, and when
I arrived the post office was dark, but still open.  went in together
with the woman and the secret message was on a Scrabble game board,
so we could easily shake it up if husband came.  he came and message
was shaken, but not 100% gone.</p>
