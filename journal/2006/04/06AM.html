<p>I'm on route 394 now: I've broken free of 246 and chosen a smaller
road.  Standing outside a 7-11 after having some chicken and water.
Using their electricity for my silly computer Gone In Sixty Seconds
battery.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a map to Alice's house, but I didn't keep it
available.  I had gone past where she said, anyway, so maybe I'll
stop by on my way back to T-town.</p>

<p>Turns out that Naoko's house is in Shizuoka; I may say HI to her
on the way through.</p>
