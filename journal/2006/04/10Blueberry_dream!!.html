<p>Super-crazy dream this morning:</p>

<p class="dream">Outside a clothing store, I was between a highway and
the department store area, with a couple friends including Carissa
from 49th voyage, and there was a terrific earthquake slash fresh
blueberry storm, and everyone was basically blueberried (blueburied?)
indoors, unable to get out.  I wanted to see just how deep they were,
so I began to dig in front of the store, uncovering some drawers that
had come open during the earthquake, closing each of them as I was
able, and digging down deep enough to get to the sidewalk pavement.
I was basically standing in this hole (that maintained its shape,
unlike blueberries or other balls would) and used a measuring tape I
had conveniently uncovered (from one of the clothing store's drawers)
and measured the depth of blueberries at 94 inches.</p>

<p>This depth would put them well over my head, but in the dream it
was up to my shoulders, basically.</p>

<p class="dream">I announced the depth to Carissa and then went
inside the clothing store to find Kris (49th voyage) and teased her,
asking why she hadn't met me, knowing she couldn't possibly have
gotten out during the storm.</p>
