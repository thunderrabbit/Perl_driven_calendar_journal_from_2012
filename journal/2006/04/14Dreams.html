<p>So many dreams this night, but I didn't write them down as they
were happening; I kept thinking I would fully wake up enough to write
them, but no..</p>

<p class="dream">The bad guys captured a female hostage and took her
in a submarine, leading her inside the sub to the main bad guy, who
left in the back half of the submarine like a space capsule after
confirming she had been captured.</p>

<p class="dream">Turns out the rest of the guys left on the sub were
not bad, and were actually rescuing her.  We ran around joyfully (in
circles because the sub was so small), but then the bad guy came back
and was knocking on the window to be let in.</p>

<p>I had no schedule, no money, limited food, but a plan to meet my
PB friends at midnight, the same time that possibly, people from
ultimate were going to meet at this restaurant.  Josh had been
evaluating the feasibility of the plan, saying, "so tell me about
midnight," meaning for me to give him details about the plan.  I was
basically like, "I don't even know if they still meet there, but
whether or not they do, the location is just a restaurant, and anyone
is allowed to go; we may as well go and eat, and if we meet them,
that will be a bonus."  He agreed it was a sound plan, even with
unknown outcome, and we proceeded with it.</p>

<p class="dream">At 6 pm, I arrived and no one else was there; I fell
asleep at one of the tables and then was woken up around 6:30pm,
though it felt a lot later.  Lisa G was at a nearby table, so I went
over and sat with her.  She asked me about my bike trip so far, and
asked about the details of this plan we had planned.  A few more
people came up and we sat together chatting in good spirits.</p>
