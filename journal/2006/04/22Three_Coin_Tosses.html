<p><b>Three Coin Tosses</b></p>

<pre>Hello from Osaka!  (almost)

I enjoyed over two weeks at Koji and Masako's farmhouse, with three meals a day and
relatively fun work on the farm, that included weeding (from weeds to dead bamboo
and trees), cutting and burning dead bamboo and trees, planting blueberries, and
turning over compost.

Some of the work was heavy duty, but overall, quite a great bargain for me,
currently a bum!

I left their house by bicycle yesterday, headed for Kobe to meet my friend Richard.
After about 60km traveled, I stopped at McDonald's and ordered a cheap high calorie
meal.  On my way to sit down, a high school girl was like, &#34;excuse me&#34; in Japanese,
and asked something about where I had started.  She told me she had seen me
earlier!!  Wow!  I had my mapbook handy, and asked her to show me where.

(this is the amazing part:)

She hadn't seen me earlier that day; she had seen me two weeks ago on my way to
Koji's!!!!!!!   I was utterly shocked at the coincidence, and amazed she
remembered!  She and her friends bought me three (3) sandwiches (2 cheeseburgers
and 1 chicken) and an orange juice.....  Oh my gosh what an incredible blessing!!

I asked their names and sat with them a while, working across the language barrier
to communicate.  They gave their nicknames:  Mamirun, Ne-san, and Mayapon.  I gave
them each a card featuring Francois (made by Hitomi (with whom I have now 100%
broken up, for those keeping track)) and wrote on the back where the pictures had
been taken.

Quite quite quite an incredible meeting!

I rode well into the night, for going was slow and I wanted to get to Kobe by
today.  Slept just off the side of the road from 2:30am and got started again this
morning at 7:30am.

More slow going up hills and some super super fast going down down down the other
side.  My most recent was most exhilarating (mom, don't read this:) I was zooming
down with traffic on city-type highway going basically 50km / hour (given that was
the speed limit, and that's how fast traffic was going)..  Got to some lights and
had to squeeze the brakes fully *and* drag my shoe to stop in time.  Totally
Fantastic.

(I should get my brakes fixed; they don't work as well as new)

Before going up a hill, I found the sidewalk turned into its own little street and
broke away from the main road.  I followed it, enjoying a little break from
traffic, and assuming it would rejoin the road shortly.

I saw a squirrel, and a fowl, both running across the road, and heard countless
birds in the trees and bamboo forest all around.  Such a beautiful area!  The
little road didn't go anywhere near the big road, and soon turned into a gravely
muddy road.  I decided to flip a coin to see if I go on or not.  &#34;Should I go ahead
(or should I go back?)&#34;  Flip: Tails.  Go back.

I went back and found the main road wasn't a hard climb at all, and included a
great long downhill on the other side (nothing like as dangerous as the one
described above!)

Having not yet made it even to Osaka, and being late to meet Richard, I looked for
an internet cafe, where I hoped to get his phone number.  Found a cafe, but it cost
350 yen just for the Member Card, which included no internet access.

Found another cafe, and almost didn't go in.  But did a coin toss, just in case.
&#34;Should I go in?&#34;  Heads.   &#34;Should I pay for internet here?&#34;  Heads.

Went in.  290 yen includes membership, 30 minutes of internet, AND includes the
drink bar.

And the drink bar includes Soft Serve Ice Cream!!!!

I may be here all night!!
