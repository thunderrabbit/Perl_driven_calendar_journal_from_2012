<p>Anne, whose name includes an e, is pretty cool.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lived in India for a year.</p>

<p>Can speak Telegu (spoken in Andhra  Pradesh (middle of India))</p></li>

<li><p>Can make yogurt(!)  (oh my god!!)</p>

<p>Claims making yogurt is easy enough that even I could do it!
("Just type in 'make yogurt' online and probably 10 sites will come
up.")</p>

<p>She told me lots of detail about how to make yogurt to the point that
I imagine I could actually do it!</p></li>

<li><p>Is going to learn about bee keeping (if she's able to find
bees near her new home).</p></li>

<li><p>Knows of more than two types of tomatoes!!!  (I'm like,
"there's cherry and big tomatoes.." She's like "Oh my God, there are
<em>thousands</em> of types of tomatoes!")  Her favorites are black
prince and striped german.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>She's been very patient letting me yammer for hours about PB and
Palestine and stuff, but I just wanted to capture a few bits...</p>

<p class="date">1:06am JST Monday 10 April 2006</p>

<p>Really good times talking to Anne; I enjoyed being able to
perapera with a native English speaker; it was so unexpected and a
nice suprise, though I've just had perapera on PB, it was neat to
find someone so recently from the US, and I just didn't want to stop
talking to her knowing how much I won't be able to really communicate
in English for a while...</p>

<p>told me about Flea for Pope and times in Maine with freezing weather
and wasps in her front door</p>

<p>her time in India, and how a year was easier to enjoy the country
than just staying for a month and onlly getting the chaos of India
and not the goodness, but not really understanding people who *love*
India.</p>

<p>Talking about trains (good train system in Tokyo/Japan vs no trains in
Houston) and her trip to Beijing, where she experienced a huge mob of
people with no lines and no English direction (including no arabic
numbers) on the huge signboard of train times, and what a crazy ordeal
that was.</p>

<p>She's going back to Maine tomorrow and will have basically 30 hours
of travel before she gets back.  I'll send happy thoughts.</p>

<p>Once she gets back she'll be chillin' for a bit, then living this
summer in a place with no electricity and no running water and no
internet on this farm like 2 hours away from the town and library</p>

<p>Actually she said she'd be unable to do anything but pet the cat,
Flea (for Pope) when she gets back, so maybe she'll be going directly
to this farm place..</p>

<p>Showed me video of this CRAZY huge worm that her friend said is the
norm in Japan.  It looked like a garter snake!!  So big that it would
be the state mascot if it lived in Texas, where they claim everything
is bigger (except the worms, apparently!)  I shoulda copied the video
to my computer...</p>

<p>Showed her far tooo many pictures from Palestine and PB and my bike
journey here...  just didn't want to waste the chance to blabber
about everything and nothing...  So sad we only got 10 hours to hang
out..  didn't feel like that long  (a lot was spent eating, waiting
for me to chew)</p>

<p>Did you hear the Pope died????  Flea for Pope!  And the dog can be
his helper!</p>

<p>------</p>

<p>I was just giddy listening to her list the things she had done in
Japan: Kyoto, Nikko, Hakone, Kamakura, Akihabara, Asakusa, Ueno, WWOOF
(here at Koji's),</p>

<p>Don't know if I will wake up in time to see her off tomorrow.  Hope
so.</p>
