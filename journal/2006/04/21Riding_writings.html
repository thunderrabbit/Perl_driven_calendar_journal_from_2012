<p>Holy shit a girl here recognizes me from 2 WEEKS ago on highway
32!!!  She (まみるん) and her friends are buying me a drink (orange)
at McD.  Her friends are ねーさん and まゆぽん.</p>

<p>She called her English teacher to translate this 一期一会（いちごい
ちえ）, which I got to mean something like "take care of the
importance to meet once in our lives." (wtf?) and they told the whole
story including what they bought for me (2 cheeseburgers, 1 chicken
filet, orange juice (no ice)) I talked to him a bit and he explained a
bit about the class and the Canadian ALT who comes weekly.  It's a
cool high school, from the sound of it.</p>

<p>Ha!  ねーさん got picked up in a BIG truck.  So unexpected!</p>

<p>Shockingly tired and stopped on23 near where I had lunch on 9
April, but without consciously trying.  Just going to sit for a
bit.</p>
