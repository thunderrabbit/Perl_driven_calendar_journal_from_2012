<p class="dream">Fred had a cheesecake box in his room and I aquired
it through some transaction (maybe as simple as "here; have this
cheesecake", or maybe I proved he should give it to me), but then
didn't eat it; and when he fell asleep and I turned off the lights and
left the room, Fred had reaquired it.  I went back and couldn't find
it.</p>

<p class="note">(I'm missing a step in there; the cheesecake was in
the other room.)</p>

<p class="dream">Cameron Diaz close up, while being filmed in some
movie about how she thinks of kisses as little loops and sometimes
wants to get to the stuff after the loops, but then realizes the
loops are nice in themselves, and just settles into the loops..</p>

<p class="dream">Surprised to find that I had breasts, though they
were a weird shape.</p>

<p class="note">(then realized it was morning woodie)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>many many others, but I didn't wake up to write any of them..  I
don't feel like I had any lucid dreams from last night.</p>
