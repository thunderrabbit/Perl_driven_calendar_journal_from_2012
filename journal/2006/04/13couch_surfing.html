<p>Today I emailed a woman who has offered her couch in Kyoto on <a
href="http://couchsurfing.com/">couchsurfing.com</a>.  She's the first
person I've asked via this website.  Looking at the map, I see that
Richard lives vaguely close to the meditation center as well.  I don't
know exactly where this woman lives, nor Richard, but if I have the
choice, I'll prolly choose the one that's closer, with a heavy lean
toward Richard.</p>
