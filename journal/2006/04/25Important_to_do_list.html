<p>These are <b>Things To Do</b> that now seem worth doing (or at
least listing on a to do list) (the idea is that the list may seem
somehow (very) different after the meditation):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do any necessary maintenance on TJ Bike.  Buy an allen wrench
that will tighten the pedal bolt (my left pedal fell off last night on
the way to Pia's from Richard's work, and is loose already)</p></li>

<li><p>Write about my trip from Kobe to the meditation center,
including pictures, if any are taken)</p></li>

<li><p>Logging the receipts I have dutifully collected (including
20,000 yen donation from Richard, and 1,000 yen he gave me to buy
bread for last night, but I ended up buying 1,050 yen worth, and
kicking in the extra 50 yen myself.  (Damn, and I left the extras (the
non-baguettes) at Pia's house.  I hope คาคว ends up enjoying
them.))</p></li>

<li><p>Uploading more pictures from my hard drive: 

<ul>
<li><p>from the upcoming ride today</p></li>

<li><p>those that are in folders on the desktop (marble track, moving
from me-an-Wende's house, etc)</p></li>

<li><p>the final final ones from PB 52</p></li>

<li><p>the final final final ones from PB 49 (unless I did them
already)</p></li>

<li><p>the ones from Koji's farm</p></li>

<li><p>from riding to Koji's farm (unless those are done)</p></li>
</ul></p></li>

<li><p>Incorporating them into my journal entries from those
occassions.</p></li>

<li><p>Updating iPhoto to iPhoto 6 (if it's a free upgrade, which I
think it is)</p></li>

<li><p>Testing the output of saving for web and updating (or hopefully
scrapping!)  iPhoto_2_legible.pl as necessary.</p></li>

<li><p>Updating other system software on my computer (though I think
it's all up to date at this point)</p></li>

<li><p>(possibly) trying to figure out why Virex won't get new virus
definitions (has a subscription run out??)</p></li>

<li><p>Ask Zach from World of Where if I can get a registration code
(I helped him find some bugs in his previous version of the software
(and paid for a registration anyway after he gave me one free);
perhaps if I can find bugs in the new version...)</p></li>

<li><p>Write a State of My Life Address (post meditation
version)</p></li>

<li><p>Write a Rob Update</p></li>

<li><p>Decide where to go next if I continue TJ Biking: (basic ideas:
Nagoya to see Kaz, Nagano to see Eri, somewhere near Fuji to see the
peeps who I met on the last day of PB52 (afterward, perhaps Odawara to
meet Nachiko), northwest Tokyo to meet Alice and her husband, back
into Tokyo), OR escape the country OR plant myself somewhere.</p></li>

<li><p>Decide what to do next...</p></li>
</ol>
