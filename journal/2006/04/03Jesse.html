<p>While I packed, Jesse tried hard to get me to see the error of my
ways and become Christian, complimenting how far I've come in my
determination of the nature of God, but suggesting that I should
follow the teachings of the one man/entity/diety who said he is
God.</p>

<p>I am still certain Christianity is flat wrong (as are all other
religions that say we should worship anything), but he gave me a
little itty bitty teeny bible and said I should read the Book of
John.</p>

<p>We'll see how <em>that</em> goes.</p>
