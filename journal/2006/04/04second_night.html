<p class="date">7pm-ish Tuesday 04 April 2006</p>

<p>I am parked for the second night.  This time under a bridge (route
246) near a river that's basically too far down for me to reach.  It's
cloudy now - could rain tomorrow, which is why I picked a bridge.  Not
well protected from the wind, so I'm hoping it will be warm.</p>

<p>Today was the day a guy sorta-kinda fixed my brakes a little tiny
bit, but they were mostly just the same.  Good thing he didn't charge
me!</p>

<p>Also today an old guy drew me a map to a place I can camp, but I
didn't end up going that far back before I found this bridge.</p>
