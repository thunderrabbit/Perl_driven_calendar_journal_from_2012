<p class="date">7:35pm JST Wednesday 19 April 2006 (day 13174)</p>

<p>I think now I will begin carefully scoping a route to the
meditation center west of Kyoto, basically assuming I will not be
able to couchsurf with anyone in Kyoto beforehand.</p>

<p class="date">8:24pm</p>

<p>Aight; got it pretty well mapped out.  And at the very end, about
1 kilometer from the temple, there's a rather large park where I can
camp out if I arrive far too early.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I need to get a text copy of the directions to the temple,
and do a final match to double make sure I've got the location right
(though I'm sure I got it right while at Jesse's), and check to see if
any of the Kyoto couches came through.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Because I would eventually like to have my path mapped out online,
and I don't forsee getting a map set up on my site before I forget my
route, I'm going to spell out the route that I took from Tokyo to
ere, and then the planned route from here to Kyoto:</p>

<p>3:30pm(? I think) 3 May 2006 (page 39 of Touring Mapple 3
[TM3:p39]): From Takadanobaba (let's say from the station, but really
the PB office) 25 east to 305 south, down basically along the east
side of the Yamanote line to Shibuya, and then right (southwest) along
246.</p>

<p>[TM3:p26] 246 back past Jesse's house and the little southern jog
at Tamagawa station, then right angle right turn back to the main 246
just past the Tamagawa [river], then continue on 246 for a ways and
then a McDonald's stop on 246 just south of すずかけだい station where
I got a free ice coffee.  Was there from about 19:30 to 20:30</p>

<p>Then along 246 a little ways more till [TM3:p18] crossed a
southbound river (while 246 was directly E/W bound) between 51 and
129/601.  I can't read the kanji of the river.  The first kanji is 木へ
ん, then 目.  The second kanji is 木へん again, then a stack of three
radicals: grass, 日 and 大.</p>

<p>The night of May 3rd, I slept in my tent just inside the west bank
of that river, about 400 meters south of 246.</p>

<p>April 4th, I was basically on 246 the whole time, and basically
following the path of a big tollway named 東名高[]道路.  I don't know
how to pronounce it, but I know ways to produce all but the one
[missing] kanji.</p>

<p>Just after crossing under it the first time was where I watched
the old folks play croquet for a while.  That's where I was warned
about rain scheduled for the next day.</p>

<p>That night (April 4th), after a brief jaunt along 76 to escape a
treacherous part of 146, I slept under a bridge with almost this
kanji: 青水橋(except the 青 has the radical for water on the left),
just before a big tunnel, the kanji for which I cannot read (two
kanji: []間).  Approximately 39.1 degrees East longitude and 35.22
degrees North latitude.</p>

<p>It did rain the next day, and I stayed put, eating the rest of
Carl's donated Power Bars.  Also helped a guy finish a fence under the
bridge.</p>

<p>That night (April 5th) was colder than the previous night, but I
still just slept in my sleepin' bag, and no tent.</p>

<p>The next day (April 6th), I started at 2:30am and took 246 down
south a ways until veering souther on little 394 for safety in the
dark.  By the time it was light, I was riding basically around the
southeast side of Mt Fuji [TM3:p17], and it was certainly beautiful.
Rode past another mountain [TM3:p10] then got a bit lost trying to
turn East on Route 1.  Hit a McDonald's at 22 and 246 around 9am,
which I noted to be about 3km east of Mishima, where I had taken the
shinkansen to meet Rie and her parents a couple years earlier.</p>

<p>Tried to take 22 east, but ended up on Route 1, which turned out to
be great because along 1 there is a lovely lovely long bike path that
was sprinkled with cherry blossoms and shaded by cherry blossom trees
there were still coated in blossoms.</p>

<p>After a bit, though (if I recall correctly), 1 became impossible
for bikes, and I was forced off, and ended up on 396, I think via 76
south to 163 then east and it turned into 396.</p>

<p>On 396, I crossed a long bridge over a wide river
 (富士川（ふじがわ）) that flowed dramatically over some interestingly
shaped concrete tetrahedrons that I definitely want to climb some day
when it is warmer and less windy.  It reminded me a great deal of
White Rock Lake (is that the name?) in Dallas, where it goes over that
spillway near the small island covered in trees.</p>

<p>Then 396 and 10 and 1 and the tollway all converge by the sea
[TM3:p9].  Then down south and right where 1 splits into a big 1 and a
little 1, I met Shunji and Kaori around 4pm (guesstimate), then rode
maybe 10 more km [TM3:p6] (during which I got a bit stuck on the wrong
side of the tracks near しまず or しんしまず, but finally made it to a
sports park on 407/354 as it heads southwest, parallel to Route 1 (and
some train lines), in a V formed by 74 and a bypass, where I was so
exhausted that I planned to stay, but then felt good enough to go
after eating a lot of granola cereal, and immediately found a big
internet cafe, but ended up looking for a different internet cafe
after the guy told me the other cafe had showers.</p>

<p>Didn't find it, and just plodded on to 84, getting lost a bit
between 74 (going south) and 84 (going northwest), but getting finally
to Route 1 again, and going basically southwest, then west, then
southwest until I was just exhausted and ended up finding a
perfect-enough spot outside by a rest area along the freeway to sleep
on my 4th night (April 6th) [TM3:p6].</p>

<p class="date">10:25pm</p>

<p>This is taking longer than I expected, and I'm tired..  Going to
floss and brush and see how I feel.  Probably like sleeping, but I
think I'll sleep down here where it's warmer than in my room.
(Tonight is the night I'm sleeping alone in Koji and Masako's house as
they and Tony are gone to Nagoya for the evening for various
reasons.)</p>

<p class="date">7:43am JST Thursday 20 April 2006</p>

<p>Okay, back to work:</p>

<p>I didn't write much that day, but I was at Hamamatsu station at 5:30pm</p>

<p>I think I took Route 1 east and then went straight on 381 as Route
1 turned right/north [TM3:p5,6].  On 381 was a monster hill that I
didn't make it up in one shot, but had some granola along the side,
and watched heat waves on the street, and wondered about their nature.

<p>Back onto Route 1 and down past the big tollway [TM3:p2] and then
got excited about how far I thought I was and took a wrong turn north
for about 1.2km before reaching 86.  Back to 1, then into Hamamatsu
[TM3:p1,121], then pretty sure I took 152 and came to Hamamatsu
station from the north, where I called Naoko, but found she was still
in Nagoya.  Bounced north off the station and around via a little
green westbound road and then left/south onto 257 and stopped at
McDonald's from 7 to 8pm on 7 April 2006 [TM3:p1]</p>

<p>Took 1 east, then just before it turned right/north, I snuck
around the big interchange on 173, then back to 1 and northwest until
I was exhausted and found Toyohashi Park where I slept on the night
of April 7th ("in sleeping bag at 12:22am [April 8th]"). [TM3:p1]</p>

<p>7am start on April 8th [TM3:p1] northwest for a km but it started
to sprinkle, so I stopped and put on rain-slicker.  Northwest a bit on
Route 1 then [TM3:p4] crossed over to Touring Mapple 5 and went about
15km northwest before stopping to pee and eat for the first time that
day [TM5:p49].  Northwest along 1, within 10km of Kaz's house
[TM5:p59] in Nagoya (d'oh!), stopped at 1:48pm on Route 1 
near ちゅうきょうけいばじょうまえ station [TM5:p59].  Made it 8km in
1.5 hours due to brutal headwind.  [TM5:p58] Made it 15km in 2.5
hours due to amazing headwind.</p>

<p>Made it to [TM5:p48] just beyond とみだ station on Route 1 at
7:22pm, where I crossed over to Route 23 and went with the wind down
south where I simply couldn't make it up this hill and slept next to
23 at 553, starting at 9:35pm [TM5:p48].</p>

<p>Awake with the sun in the AM April 9th, swoop SxSW to
[TM5:p37][TM5:p38] lunch from 10:15 to 10:51 at 23 and 706.  Took 23 a
bit farther than I intended, but a guy was like, "it's all good" and
suggested I take 32 over the mountain, which I did, and it was hard
going up, but hella fun going down, then got a bit lost getting
actually to Koji's but made the last 2km in 1 hour, and arrived at
2:30pm [TM5:p29].</p>
