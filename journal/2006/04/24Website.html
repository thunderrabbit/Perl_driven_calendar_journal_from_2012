<p>Aight.</p>

<p>I have *basically* gotten a good start on the shiznit I wanted to
do.  Got some pictures up (22 April journal), made a new travel
section for Europe (for Bryn inviting me to <a
href="/images/travel/2002_march_london_paris/the_rest/">London and
Paris</a>) and for <a href="/travel/tjbike/kyoto2006/">tjbike</a> (my
Rob Updates from TJ Bike trip had been piling up in my PB 52
directory)</p>

<p>There are still a lot of pictures I want to put online, and
incorporate into my journal, and I want to transcribe Japanese
journal entries that I wrote while on PB.</p>

<p>But first, I need to eat (for the first time today), and go to
Richard's office (to meet him for dinner with Pia, who we met last
night after seeing some cool kites and going to an onsen (man, I
haven't written about *anything*!!)).</p>

<p>Oh shit; I better pack a good deal of my shit now cause I'll want
to get an early start tomorrow and have gotten plenty of sleep.</p>
