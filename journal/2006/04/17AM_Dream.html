<p class="dream">In a large room with maps, working out a way to ride
my bicycle to Amanda's house, but actually choosing to take the train
because I had to get there quickly.  I was going to take my touring
maps with me, though, so I could monitor the route with regards to
the maps and know what it would look like next time when I did ride
my bike.</p>

<p class="dream">Upon arrival, I was way down by a river, with a
supertall overpass passing over.  Maggie et. al. were all down by the
river, but Molly was up on the overpass with my computer, prepared to
drop it down to me.  I didn't want her to drop it, but she said she
wouldn't let it get hurt.  I consented and she dropped it, and Molly
(also) carefully caught it at the bottom, and tossed it over to me,
where it hit a telephone pole because I wasn't prepared for her to
throw it to me.  I heard a bad crack, and when I opened the screen,
the glass was cracked and broken and I was reallllly sad.</p>

<p>and really happy when I woke up.</p>
