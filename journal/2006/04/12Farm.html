<p>Went to the farm for about 3 hours of work between 9 and noon.  Not
that hard at all, actually.  Just moving some grainy gray gravel down
the hill to put a nice slope off the asphalt to the dirt, then
sweeping some other little rocks off the asphalt, then moving some
bamboo and brush and shit to a pile at the top of the hill.</p>

<p>Rain was predicted by Koji and Tony, so we headed back, ate lunch,
and I sent a happy birthday message to janette, who wrote me back!
Great to hear she is doing well, and moving to Austin soooon!</p>

<p>I answered a few more emails, including a little volley with
Kazzah, but then AO Hell kicked me off while I was reading about
Apple's iLife '06, and noticing that the biggest upgrades were to
iPhoto, which may in fact have completely made my little utility
unuseable or unnecessary.  I may not release it any further than my
journal.  We shall see.</p>

<p>We went back again for about 30 minutes, until it <em>actually</em>
started to rain, although now it seems to be abating.  I'm going to
work on iPhoto_2_legible again.  I seem to be addicted.</p>
