<p>I didn't write these when I woke up, but snippets remain in my
brain:</p>

<p class="dream">I was teaching English outside at a picnic table, and
Hitomi sat beside me, to my right.  I was surprised to see her again,
and was sure she would try something that would distract me.  She
tried to give me head and I was like, "whoah!" and made her back off;
I was totally freaked out.  She was all upset and I wouldn't talk to
her for a while.  I thought for a bit, then came back and decided to
finish the lesson as best I could, and showed a man some muffin trays
with rice and oatmeal in them and he was supposed to finish some
algebraic test with them.</p>

<p class="dream">Riding a roller coaster, and when it finished, I was
surprised to find there had been only 2 other people in the train.
All the seats behind them were empty.  We put the train away by me
pushing it back onto an offramp, and needed to lock it in place, but
the guys weren't able to figure it out, so I was like, " ", but I
didn't speak their language and I ended up just doing it myself,
though it was a bit of a pain to hold the train in place with one hand
and fish out the rope with the other.  I was finally able to do it,
and they were like, "ohh!!" cause they saw what they needed to have
done.</p>
