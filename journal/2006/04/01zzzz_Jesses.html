<p>At Jesse's house now; have just spent an hour or so talking about
our respective belief systems about God / religion / The Big Picture.
It wasn't the best conversation I've had on these terms; we both got
frustrated, partially because we are tired, and partially because we
didn't follow the ground rules of non-interrupting.</p>

<p>Jesse said he should have been taking notes from the beginning.</p>

<p>I would actually like that, because I haven't yet taken the time
to write down all my thoughts on this crazy topic.</p>
