<p>Haven't slept yet; I left the park and quickly found an internet
cafe open 24 hours and tried to negotiate cheap lodging there, but the
guy told me about another cafe with actual showers and I was like,
"hell yeah" and went out to find it, but couldn't.  I'm at another
McDonald's where I can use the electricity for the price of a vanilla
shake.  But no internet yet.</p>

<p>Saw some lodging by the river, あべかわ, but didn't join them.
Gotta roll sooooooon and try to find my own housing.</p>
