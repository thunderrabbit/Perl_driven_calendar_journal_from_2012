<p class="dream">I had just joined a prison camp, where work was
shared between everyone, but none of the rules were explained to me.
The camp was very eco-conscious, and the first book I had to read was
called _Green Sleeves_, written by a man who pioneered an
eco-friendly way of doing laundry.</p>

<p class="dream">They said it was a short read, but the book, once I
found it on the shelf, was huge.  Like the size of a newspaper, and 2
inches thick.</p>

<p class="dream">I hadn't been made to do anything, like put on a
prison uniform; all could be done at my own pace, but nothing was
enforced, and in fact no one was really paying attention to me at all.</p>
