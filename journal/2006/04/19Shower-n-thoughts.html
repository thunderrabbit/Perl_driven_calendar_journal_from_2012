<p>Took a nice warm shower this afternoon (during which I rested my
foot on the side of the tub to wash my leg and thereby stepped on my
glasses, which, fortunately, sprung back without more harm than I
could bend back into shape) and an idea came: what about "settling
down" again in Japan?</p>

<p>I could/should do some research on which city is best.... and as I
thought about what a difficult search that might be, and
semi-pointless to ask strangers' opinions of such personal taste, I
wondered about settling in Kyoto.</p>

<p>Kyoto... the ex-capital of Japan, where many tourists flock each
year because of its beauty, and by living there, I could say, "yeah,
I live(d) in Kyoto..." and tell about its wonderous sites.</p>

<p>Or what about <em>Nara</em>, a city I liked even more than Kyoto
when janette and I visited the area.  Nara has the big honkin' (*)
Buddha, and some interesting performance artists, including those
¥Ö¥Ã¥È artists that were so interestingly weird.</p>

<p>(*) actually it's quite silent</p>

<p>Hmmmm.. Nara.</p>

<p>Though I shouldn't make any <b>decisions</b> until after/during my
meditation...</p>

<p>But I can make a written statement of what I want my future to
be.</p>

<p>Also, it's raining outside.</p>
