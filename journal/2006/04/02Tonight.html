<p>Been slowly procrastinating before packing..  though it's been a
bit productive: I have determined that I don't have a map book for
western Japan, so I printed some maps from <a
href="http://mapion.co.jp/">mapion.co.jp</a>.  I've basically decided
to <em>not</em> start heading east to help Aya's family plant rice; it
would take basically four or five days out of the time I have
remaining to get to Kyoto (a full day to get there, two or three days
there to plant rice, then a day to get back).  Gotta be there by the
25th.</p>

<p>Ironically, though, she's the only person I've heard from who has
sent me a map (except Craig at the Vipasanna mediation center, thank
goodness) for how to get to the location.  I don't expect people to be
online to send me maps every day, but I'm just noticing the irony.
Also interesting: she is still in Tokyo, and not actually at her house
yet.</p>

<p>Anyway, who cares??? I have to pack pack pack, jack.</p>
