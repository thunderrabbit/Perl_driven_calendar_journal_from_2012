<p class="dream">Laura and family enjoying watching my trip play
itself out on maps over their kitchen table..</p>

<p>don't remember any detail on that one.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class="dream">Outside in a wooded area, chilling and waiting for my
friend's friends to arrive, one of whom had a bag of mine that I had
forgotten.  The Delorian drove up and I jokingly sat down in the
passenger's seat.  I was like, "ha; just kidding!" and he smiled
carefully as if trying to look like he understood the humor of it.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, "thank you for bringing my bag!" and he
then cheered up a bit more, realizing I was a friend of a friend; I
popped over to grab the bag as soon as he pointed it out, then went to
put it in Mr Van, who was my mode of transportation on my TJ Bike
trip.</p>

<p class="dream">He pulled out the stuff to take skiing, including a
multi-game pinball thing; he had dragged it out of his Delorian, and I
had never seen one before, but I recognized what it must be, given the
different faces I could see.  It had pinball, beanbag toss, darts,
pachinko, and a car racing game all built into different boards, each
of which could be (un)folded / rearranged to be on top for playing.
The pinball game had different maze-like paths, so at different times
the ball would vanish and go who-knows-where, and then reappear in
different places, or just be gone.  I was definitely not going to
play, as my budget was quite low, but my friend was happy to keep
pumping in the quarters.  I was surprised that a cat with a Delorian
hadn't made the game free to play.</p>

<p class="dream">The next morning came and they had all gone skiing; I
left my bags about, knowing that the likelihood of anyone taking them
was rather small, given we were in the proverbial middle of nowhwere,
and went into the cabin designated as restroom, where I found a huge
toilet that I had to use one arm to prop myself from falling into; I
couldn't reach across to use both arms at once.</p>

<p class="dream">I almost peed, but woke up in time.</p>

<p class="date">8:23am JST Wednesday 19 April 2006</p>

<p class="dream">Watching TV to see if there were any interesting
channels and came across some soft porn that was really bizarre, with
various gropings, but all with people and large stuffed animals.  I
switched the channel, but the next channel was the same, and the next,
and the next, until I realized that the channel changer was just
switching between 34 and 35, no matter if I went channel up or down,
just those two channels.  I pressed some other buttons on the control,
and found one that changed the hundred's place on the channel, but
even as I rolled up to channels 1500, the images were the same.
During the whole time a telltale heart staticky thud repeated itself
indefinitely.</p>
