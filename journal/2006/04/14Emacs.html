<p>Been messing with emacs a lot today.  Finally found the code that
does all the html customization; I originally wanted to find a way to
make the text in my editor somewhat match the text as it will appear
on the browser (specifically dreams), just as a confirmation that I've
used the right html.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to do that, but I did some other tweaks, including
moving some code I had in my ~/.emacs file into the sgml-mode.el file
so it probably works faster, but in any case, feels cooler to be all
official and shit, and even included in the menu bar above.</p>

<p class="note">(like that)</p>

<p>Was *not*, however, able to figure out a way to get my own
auto-insert text to work.  Not sure what was the issue, but I just
let it go, and left a note in the .el file saying what I tried and
what happened instead of what I wanted.</p>
