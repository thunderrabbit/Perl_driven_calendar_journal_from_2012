<p class="dream">I was showing someone how to load half-printed paper
into the copy machine so that it would be printed on the blank side;
in order to conserve paper, we were printing on used sheets.</p>

<p class="dream">Watching this copy machine work (not work) across the
street; when it did work, it was amazing, able to throw/spit/shoot
large sheets of paper into perfect stacks up by a telephone pole, but
when it tried to use the reused paper, the sheets that were creased
got caught and mucked up everything; the large sheets couldn't fly and
paper started to get misdirected all over the place.  D'oh!</p>

<p class="dream">Filming a scene for a movie, of this little car
zooming around and around an obstacle far huger than it, but the car
was fast and could get around it in about 10 seconds, but we made
many many rotations and then finished and went back out onto the
street in front of my apartment on West Gray and checked the footage:
nothing.  Fuck!  I told my driver that it hadn't been recorded, and
we would have to do it again, and she super complainy and I was like,
"I know, and I'm sorry," and I headed back between the buildings to
the parking area and she came up and was like, "I know you didn't
mean it," and when we hugged she was a young black boy, about 14 years
old.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, "how about we film something that
doesn't need that other character?" and she agreed, but then I was
like, "first I need to write the scene,"</p>

<p class="dream">Thinking of a scene, perhaps her as a fashionable
woman walking down the street, with voice over: "Meet Jane.  She's
fashionable, stylish," and she pulls out a tiny weapon and kills some
guy about 50 meters down the street without missing a step, "and an
assassin."</p>
