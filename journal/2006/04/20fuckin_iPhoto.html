<p>Dammit.  I basically am hating iPhoto right now.</p>

<p>(( I did, however, figure out why iPhoto outputs photo albums with
a single picture in front of the rest, out of order.  They are output
in the order they are selected.  So if that picture was selected and
then I select all, it will be put first.  So the solution is to
deselect everything, then select everything. ))</p>

<p>But right now I hate that there's no easy way to rename all the
titles... I want to remove all the underscores (which I had put in
there back in the days when I wouldn't use the webpage output
function because it stupidly-names the files 0.jpg, 1.jpg, etc.)</p>

<p>I want to remove all the underscores from the titles because they
look stupid in the photo album.  I tried changing AlbumData.xml, but
that didn't work.  I even tried changing iPhoto.db, but <em>that</em>
didn't work.  Where is this information stored?  And why is it stored
in so many places, but unused??</p>

<p>My solution, I realize while bitching about it, is to let my
iPhoto_2_legible do the work, basically removing _ from the titles
but adding _ to filenames.</p>

<p>Fuck; that's going to be a pain.  I might just do it with emacs.</p>
