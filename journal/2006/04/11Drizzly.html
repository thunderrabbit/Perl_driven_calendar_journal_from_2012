<p>It's a rizzly drizzly day today, and I don't really want to go out
into it.  But watching the weather last night I think it's going to
continue for a while.  Super glad I got here <em>before</em> it
started.  But I "have to" be somewhere, so I'm wondering about buying
a rain slicker and snagging some garbage bags to cover my bags and
getting the flock outta here.</p>

<p>Part of my anxiety is that I don't have a feeling that I'm really
helpful here;  I can't say that I feel unwelcome, but a part of me
worries that I'm welcome only through Japanese tatemae (sp).</p>

<p>I'm going to go try asking again if I can use the internet.</p>

<p>I didn't ask: the door to that room is closed (first time I've seen
it closed), and I don't see Masako, the apparent leader of the
house.</p>
