Dad!!!!!!

Really great to hear from you!

I have just gotten back from the second global voyage, and am
preparing for a solo bicycle ride to Kyoto (perhaps 600 kilometers,
but I'm not really sure), where I hope to do a 10 day Vipassana
meditation course.  15 hours meditatin' per day.  Wow.

I have applied for a course that starts April 25.  Interestingly, my
pocket calendar finishes with April, so the last days just have an
arrow drawn off the end of April into nothingness.  It seems poignant
in some way.

A few passengers from the voyage have offered me places to stay, which
is a real blessing.  I no longer have a cell phone in Japan, though,
so I'll be looking for internet access in cities along the way,
hopefully free WiFi, which is not uncommon to find floating around
near apartment buildings.

No work visa, so I have to leave the country within 88 days now and
counting.  Don't really have money to buy a ticket, but I trust the
universe to provide a pleasant way to escape this island.

Love and Love
    - Rob!

&gt; HI!  How is it going with you??? Where are you???  etc, etc, etc.  
&gt; 
&gt; just finished raising
&gt; the ceiling in the game room (it had sagged 2.5-3.0&quot; in the middle of the
&gt; room) then built a wall to break it into a 10X12 "bedroom" and a living area
&gt; around it.  We then replaced all the carpet in the house with slate. All
&gt; this was in a rush to get the house ready for visitors on April 8-9 when
&gt; Elise gets commissioned into the Navy (she is getting her MD/PhD paid for
&gt; and will owe the Navy 5 years then).  Just lots of stuff to do. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here's some info for you for yor Aussie friend.  When we went in 1985, we
&gt; drove from Sydney up the coast to Coff's Harbor, then inland to the top of
&gt; the coastal escarpment and stopped one "winter" night (it frosted, and we
&gt; were cold as ... in the travel trailer) in the town that has a University
&gt; that is Austrailia's "Cambridge" University.  The stars were sooooo
&gt; beautiful and bright.  I got everyone up and we all trooped outside (in the
&gt; 2AM freezing cold, shivering) to look at them.  We then drove back to
&gt; Sydney, then out to the Blue Mountains, then back to Sydney and flew home
&gt; via San Francisco.  Didn't know if you remembered all that. 
&gt; 
&gt; Love and Light!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know what your plans are if you would.
&gt; 
&gt; THanks...
&gt; 
&gt; Love, 
&gt; 
&gt; Dad.
