<p>Back on TJ Bike; slept at Jesse's last night, got up, laundry,
dishes, emails, Hitomi bugging to meet me, so now instead of going to
Jesse's to plan my route, contact peeps who offered housing, I
bypassed a lunch offer at Kellie's to meet Hitomi at Futakotamagawa
at 2:30pm, i.e. now.</p>

<p>Just chillin' occasionally remembering to be patient, but not
really wanting to fuck with her.  Maybe it will be fun.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  I'm recording Karen (Kazzah)'s
comment when I said I was scared about trying to ride to Kyoto,
afraid I might run out of resources (e.g. food) and just die.  She
said, "well, you're not going to <em>actually</em> die... and, it's
worth givin' it a go."</p>

<p>Brilliant.</p>
