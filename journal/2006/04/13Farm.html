<p>Did some actual hard work at the farm today: turned over a compost
pile, or basically folded it in half.  The tricky part: lots of vines
and long sticks in it made shoveling quite a pain.  Try to scoop, but
end up trying to lift an impossibly large section of dirt and compost
and muck.</p>

<p>But, on the good side, I found some HUGE grubs (eeewwwwww!!) that
Masako said were worth 100 yen each on the grub market.  Got some
pics that I hope to put on here someday....</p>
