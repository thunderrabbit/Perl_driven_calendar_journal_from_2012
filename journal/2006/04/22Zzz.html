<p>Far too tired to chronicle all that has happened today, but the
Rob Update did a good bit.</p>

<p>Met Richard at his station; he took me to dinner at Royal Host,
gave me money, put me up in his ex roommate's extra room.</p>

<p>I just finished three loads of laundry (including my sleeping
bag), and am just about to go to bed bed bed, and discover wireless
access available here in my room.</p>

<p>I may never sleep!</p>
