<p class="dream">Walking around, I saw Carl again, this time not
wearing a Santa suit.  He asked if he could stick his jacket into his
bag that I had been carrying, saying that it had been a pain to carry
it around all day.  I was like, "dawg; this bag has been a heavier
pain to carry around all day.." but the jacket wasn't all that much
heavier, so I didn't mind.  He asked if I was ready for that massage
(he was supposed to hire a masseuse for me), and I was like, "not
right now, dawg.. well, what time is it?  If it's before like noon,
and I'll have some time to enjoy it and shit, then let's hook it up."
I joyfully recalled the story we had experienced when Carl came up and
the guy I had been with ended up buying lunch for both of us.  Hence,
Carl owed me a massage from a professional.</p>

<p class="dream">Just as I got on a bus, I saw Kellie and a friend
getting on as well.  I gave her a flirtatious butt pinch or something,
but she didn't really respond.  As I was riding on the bus, I went to
sit down in an empty seat, which happened to be next to Petra!  She
was just about to get up/off, but came back to sit down and chat,
especially after I pointed out she had left her bag.  She asked why I
had been crying the last time she saw me, and I was like, "I was just
sad about the 52nd voyage being over, and this time, no real chance
for me to sail again.  I'm not as good of a teacher as you or some of
the others, and I'm just looking for a free trip around the
world..."</p>

<p class="dream">She didn't disagree, and I looked over and saw we
were sitting right next to a big bin of bulk chocolate pieces, which I
presently scooped up into a big bowl and she poured the soft drink
which had suddenly appeared, and then saw there was also orange drink,
and poured her lemon-lime back into the bottle and poured some orange;
it was to be a sugar-feast beyond recent memory.  She was like, "this
must be for people who don't know there's food in China Town."</p>
