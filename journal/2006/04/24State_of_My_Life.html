<ol type="a">
<li><p>Tomorrow I will ride to the meditation center and begin a 10
day silent meditation, 15 hours per day.  No reading, no writing, no
talking, no killing, no internet, no smoking?, no drinking?, no
nothing but chilling for 150 hours in 10 days.</p></li>

<li><p>I am hoping to gain some sort of insight or amazing experience;
I really have no idea what to expect, except what Kentaro told me:
"it's really really difficult..." then with a smile: "but you should
do it!"</p></li>

<li><p>I really hope it will change my life; we shall see.</p></li>

<b>10:34 AM me:</b> my ten day meditation starts tomorrow!

<b> Dude:</b> wow!! that's a long time
  what's the goal with that?

<b>10:35 AM me:</b> it's going to be nuts
  um,,, just to have a mind-bending experience... two of my friends have done it
  one other has done something like it, and they all say it was life-changing

<b>10:36 AM Dude:</b> what kind of results did they report?

<b> me:</b> "It was really really hard, but really really good."
  or some such... nothing specific
<b>10:37 AM</b> I imagine that....
  it will feel like 3 months on PB... Time goes by at such a strange
  rate. It seems to take a year, but once it's finished it seems to be
  over in a flash.
  People ask, "how was PB?" and I'm like... Um.... um..... it was 3.5
  months of wow on this big cruise ship around the world! No way to
  really summarize it.
<b>10:39 AM</b> So for just 10 days with NOTHING to do except be inside our
  own mind, trying to focus only on our breathing... it's going to be
  the same. Take forever, but be suddenly over, and the mind will be
  like, wtf just happened????

<b>10:41 AM Dude:</b> wow. sounds cool
  sounds exciting and scary at the same time
  good luck

<b> me:</b> thanks mate
  I am not sure how it will affect me
  and doubly not sure what I can write about it.
  I gots to get writing now
<b>10:43 AM</b> I'm actually going to use my answer to your question in my journal
  thanks for asking it! I'm trying to capture my brain as best as I can before I go into this thing.

<li><p>My message to Laura after she asked several excellent questions:</p>

<pre>
Hello LauraDear

Thank you for your message...  :-)  It helps me believe I'm on the right track!

&gt; I wonder:  have you given any thought to the specific
&gt; question of What God is training you for?

I have given hours and hours and millions of thoughts to what I Am
Supposed To Do in life,..  if that is what God is training me for,
then yes.  I've thought about that a lot.  A part of me imagines that
I will do something big and great, but I have no idea what.  I'm
hoping the meditation period will bring some insight on that question.

&gt; I was once tempted to
&gt; think that you were running around trying to avoid responsibility
&gt; and avoid settling down in a "normal" lifestyle.  I no longer think
&gt; that (never really did, just wondered what was driving you).

Back in like 1992, I decided I wanted to have a career that involved
travel and working with youth.  I found US Experiment, an organization
that sends youth to various countries for a couple weeks in the
summer.  I thought I would be a perfect leader for such trips, given
all the work I had done with youth programs at my church.  When I
contacted US Experiment, they were like, "which countries have you
lived in, and are familiar with their culture?" etc etc, and I was
like, "um...   I visited Australia for 10 days in 2001!"

So I decided I needed "in-country experience."  I could go live
somewhere for a year, come back, call up US Experiment and be like,
"I've lived in ____ for a year!"

At the same time, I knew "other doors" would be opened for me, though
I had no idea what.
(Peace Boat is one example of that)

&gt; Is God calling you for something?
Not like Joan of Arc voices, but I hope that I'm doing something that
will seem worthwhile when I look back on it, (perhaps when I meet God
once I'm done here on earth).

&gt; Have you been searching for yourself, or God, or both?
Yes, definitely some of both.  But more and more am finding that I can
just look inside my mind to find the same things..  (I'm trying to not
sound cliche)..  It's like I don't change..  well, okay..  I am
finding a core inner me, that doesn't change.

Even though I've met thousands of people and seen a lot of Tokyo and
snippets of 40 countries, sorta-tried to learn Japanese, Ride My
Bicycle hundreds of kilometers, blah blah blah and alllllllll this
crazy stuff,..  I'm finding there is still a core part of me that
doesn't change.

Still afraid of meeting strangers, still don't want to settle down,
still afraid of commitment in relationships.

Still able to be quiet and listen though I have thousands of stories.
Still able to touch that Thunder Rabbit sense of childhood and
freedom.  Still able to climb on a jungle gym and giant monkey net.

I'm discovering the core of myself, and learning to call it beautiful
despite flaws that I've been conditioned to see.

&gt;  re: gifts of food:  But I also see it as evidence of God's taking care of you.  I
&gt; wonder, do you consciouly ask for such gifts, or does your entire
&gt; being resonate in Oneness with God?

wow.  That seems quite lofty, though I have entertained the idea that
it's possible to live in Oneness with God.

For consciously asking for gifts, it's a litttttle bit different than that.

I have trusted my angels for a long time.  since before Japan.  To
guide me and help keep me out of trouble when necessary.  They are
always patient and love me even if I don't listen to them.

I think our thoughts create reality.  So prayerful requests (asking
for gifts) like "I need a car" or "I want a horse"  are answered
positively.  "Yes, you need a car."  "Yes, you want a horse,"  thereby
creating the experience of needfulness or wanting in our lives.

So I make prayerful statements like, "I am thankful for the blessings
I receive."  "Thank you, angels,  for the experiences I have."  "I am
thankful for easily gaining wisdom from my experiences."  Just
basically thank you thank you thank you thank you to angels, the
universe, God.

I hope I'm not blahblahing on the wrong track, but I have definitely
put a lot of thought into just these topics!

Most recent update, to sortof guide the gifts from God, toward looking
for a vocation/job/living, a friend of mine told me the mantra she
used:

"My heart and my income are connected."

I take it to mean, the blessings I freely give to the world bring me
blessings in return.  "Income" has a definite ring of cold hard cash,
but I'm not after that *per se*.  So I don't focus on the idea of
money coming to me, but just the things I need being made available.

I have been gently repeating this mantra for a couple days now
(something to do while riding a bicycle).

My friend said she found her calling that way after about a year.

Thank you for asking these questions; they have helped me capture the
state of my brain before I go into this meditation tomorrow!!

   Love Love Love
   - Rob!

<li><p>I have just made journal entry placeholders for the 10 days of
the meditation.  Looking at the dates on the registration, it's 12
days that I'll be at the center, with the first and last days not
actually full days.  So it appears the 10 day part will be 26 April to
5 May.</p></li>
