<p>Finished my planned work on the farm today.  Weeded the last
yellow flower bed, and cut all the bamboo into firepit sized
pieces.</p>

<p>Also went exploring a bit deeper into the property and ound an
orange tree and scooped up two oranges that had fallen, but were still
intactly edible.  Then found some old rooves supported with rusty
frames, but no walls involved.  There were ancient circuit breakers,
old hanging light bulbs, old mattresses, and a couple of farm
machines.  It would be <em>totally</em> spooky at night!</p>

<p>I looked for a place to sit and enjoy oranges and chillful reading
of the book, but found none under the rooves.</p>

<p>Back down to where we had the outdoor lunch and ate and read there.
The oranges tasted a lot like grape fruits, but I couldn't bear to not
eat them.  I found them basically palatable if I took off all the skin
around each slice, just eating the little juicy inner nodules.</p>

<p>Read a lot of the book; now The Nine are under the mountain, and
have not had any troubles inside.  I'm sure they will soon.</p>
