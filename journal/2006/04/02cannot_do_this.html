<p>I'm just sick with fear about starting my bike ride.  What the
fucking fuck am I thinking?  How the hell am I going to do this shit?
My back tire doesn't even stay inflated for more than a few hours, if
that long (I haven't tested). This is just stupid.  I want to give up
and just go straight home to Texas.  Or California.  Or Hawaii.  Fuck
this stupidness.</p>
