<p class="dream">With PB students I got in trouble for not showing up
for Fantastic Rabbits, but it turned out that Angelina had fibbed,
saying no one else showed up, so I just hung out with her.  Upon
leaving, I saw Rie (Carol (Monkey)) crying and walking home.  "Why you
didn't come?" she demanded, and I realized what must have
happened.</p>

<p class="dream">With college-aged peers, setting up this visual joke
to make it look like a friend of ours had been hung.  Sarah (Aussie
in Jerusalem) was like, "no no he needs to be pasty," and spent hours
coating him in paste - 4 distinct layers, then pulled it all off and
Angelina Jolie was like, "how about my face?" cause she wanted to be
called beautiful.</p>

<p class="dream">They were hanging him up in a tree and the neighbors,
like in a sit-com, were checking on their across-the-street neighbors
by changing houses, so they would be able to see the visual joke
setup, and either freak out and call the police or otherwise give it
away to the people for whom it was intended.  I couldn't ride back to
say anything without giving it away, myself, so I let it be.</p>
