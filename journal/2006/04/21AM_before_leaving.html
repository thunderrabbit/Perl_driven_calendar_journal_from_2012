<p>Okay; I have just finished two chapters of <em>The Fellowship of
The Ring</em>, and all but the last two chapters of Fellowship. And I
notice to the voice of my words has come a change.</p>

<p>(perhaps short lived though it may be)</p>

<p>Breakfast time now, then packing, then lunch and/or leaving.</p>

<p>I recognize that I have not filled in the blanks of my intended
journey to Kyoto, but basically I plan from here in Shima-shi, to take
6xx north to 23 northwest to 1 west, across downtown Kyoto, to 9 west
and northwest, to 7xx south and be there.  Just like that.</p>

<p class="date">9:25am JST Friday 21 April 2006</p>

<p>Chowed two eggs, rice, and a slice of cheese and read another
chapter of the book, one more to go.</p>

<p>Have basically packed.  The plan is to pack, hit the library to
confirm date and directions to the center, finish the book, eat lunch
and go go go!</p>

<p>But first, though it's an incomplete record, here are some of the
things I've bought with my 20,000 yen:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>April 3rd, from <b>AOI</b> bookstore in Takadanobaba:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Touring Mapple 5: 1 @ 1600</p></li>
</ul>
<p>total inc tax 1680 yen</p>
</li>

<li><p>April 6th, from <b>Aoki</b> foods:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Knusper Crunch: 1 @ 522</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Total inc tax 522 yen</p>
</li>

<li><p>April 7th, at some bike shop:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>fixed my leaky back tire: 1 @ 1200 yen</p></li>
</ul>
<p>total inc tax: 1200 yen</p>
</li>

<li><p>April 7th, from <b>Shizutetsu Store</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pocari Sweat mix: 1 @ 113</p></li>
<li><p>Fresh Granola: 1 @ 408</p></li>
</ul>
<p>total inc tax 521 yen</p>
</li>

<li><p>April 8th, from <b>hallo! foods</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pocari Sweat mix: 2 @ 125 yen</p></li>
<li><p>Fresh Granola: 2 @ 478</p></li>
</ul>
<p>total inc tax: 1,266 yen</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I started with 20,000 (and some loose change floating around in my
bags, where it remains), and right now I have in my wallet 12,369
yen.</p>

<p>That means I've spent 7,631 yen (62.3% of that on food). Total
above = 5,189 yen, so 2,442 yen unaccounted, but that is easily
explained in that I didn't keep all of my receipts; I know I ate a
McD's several times.</p>

<p>But I plan to keep them from now on, just for fun.</p>

<p>For the 6 days' travel time, I spent 4,751 yen on food: about 792
yen per day.  Big savings thanks to Carl's generous donation of
Powerbars. :-)</p>
