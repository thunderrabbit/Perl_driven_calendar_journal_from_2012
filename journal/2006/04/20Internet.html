<p>I'm going to go to the library now to try and research massage/body
therapy schools in Japan, and hostels nearby, and, hopefully, be able
to upload these past 17 days of journal entries.  I don't expect them
to let me, and their internet computer is right beside their desk, so
my hopes are not up.</p>
