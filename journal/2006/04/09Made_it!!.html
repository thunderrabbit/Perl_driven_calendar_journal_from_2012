<p>I've made it to Koji's place!  It took well over an hour to
navigate the final 2 kilometers, given the ridiculous system of
addresses that Japan still uses; I called Koji from a major
intersection about 1.5 miles from here and he didn't know where it
was.  I'm sure he does, but just not by the road numbers used on the
map I had.  Highways 32 and 167.  After he couldn't help me, I
confirmed with 3 people that I was in the right area, but none of them
knew where his address was.  The third person was a woman tending a
field; she took me down the slope to perhaps her son, and they
jabbered for several minutes over the map I had, looking for clues as
to where I needed to go.  I asked if they would call the number on the
map (after my first attempt of telling them that I had called the
number but was unable to communicate with Koji where I was when he
asked me (perhaps I used the wrong verb tense so they didn't
understand; I had been like, 電話をして、彼は「今どこにいますか」って、
私はわからなかった。) didn't prompt them to try and call again)
saying, "電話をした、彼は「どこにいますか」って、私はわからなかった。"
and they were like, "oh!" and the guy went inside and called Koji,
then came out a minute later and gave me directions to an intersection
where Koji met me.</p>

<p>Fan tastic.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see him walking up the road; I didn't actually
understand Koji would meet me; I thought I was supposed to find a
place to turn, but Koji rocked up; led me the final 50 meters to his
house and helped me get all my shiznit inside.</p>

<p>Met his wife (actually I don't know how to address her), and was
surprised when an English speaker popped her head out the door, "you
made it!"</p>

<p>Her name is Ann (sp); she's from the US, north central or north
east, judging from her accent.  She's been helping on Koji's farm for
the past couple of days, and she leaves tomorrow.</p>

<p>Ann and Koji's wife went (grocery?) shopping while I led Koji back
to the place where I had been helped; I understood he wanted to thank
the guy who had called for me.  We arrived within 50 feet of the
house and saw the woman (person number 3, above) and her friend, and
I was like, "ありがとうございました！" to her, and Koji looked
confused, and then I said to him "she helped me" and he said "ありがと
うございました！" as well, and we left.</p>

<p>That seemed really strange, so I tried to ask him if he was
satisfied with not having actually talked to the guy he had talked to,
but I couldn't communicate my question to Koji, so I dropped it.</p>

<p>Back to his place for a lovely shower (though I didn't have my
scrubby thing); I used my fingernails to scrape off horrific
layers of muck, enough to win a mudball fight, and write this.</p>

<p>But no way to get online, yet.  They've got dial-up internet
access, but I dunno if it costs them per use or per month or what.</p>
