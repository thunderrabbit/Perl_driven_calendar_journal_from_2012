<p>Just watched some old folks play croquet after meditating for a
bit.  Some of them seemed good at times and one seemed crotchety.
When he got to bonk another player's ball, he would knock the shit out
of it, even though the game boundary was just 3 feet away <em>and</em>
people standing in his line of fire.  I heard from a couple that
weather was scheduled to be bad tomorrow.  D'oh!</p>

<p>Just just ate at McDs again.  Foolishly, I don't have Rie's parents
contact info.  I might be able to get it easily if I can get internet
access.</p>
