<p>I guess I should get out of bed to see the family away; I won't
see them for two days, and they have given me run of the house.</p>

<p>(though yesterday, Masako noted that she didn't have unlimited
hours on internet; she never surfs the web, but just checks email.
Shit; I won't be using the internet any more here at all.  I'll go
try and scope email at the library (where it specifically says "NO
EMAIL and NO CHAT" in Japanese.))</p>
