<h1>What I Want In The Next Five Years</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I want to live in a safe area that I don't need a car.  A
bicycle is great.  Trains are great.  Buses are .. okay.</p></li>

<li><p>I want a job that will require/encourage me to use a spoken
language other than English.  Japanese is great.  Mandarin is great.
Spanish, ASL, Arabic are great.</p></li>

<li><p>I want a job that allows me to bring benefit to the world.  A
cool NGO, or a physical body therapist (massage, reiki, shitsu,
cranio-sacral, etc), or psychotherapist type job is great.</p></li>

<li><p>I want to live where friends are abundant and free to come,
visit, and go as they please.</p></li>

<li><p>I want fast, inexpensive access to the internet (TCP/IP for my
computer).</p></li>

<li><p>I want a new Macintosh laptop or a battery that will last a
decent time on this one.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It sounds like I should live in a hostel and go to school for
massage/body therapy.  Perhaps in Kyoto or Nara.</p>

<p>I will go to the library tomorrow and look for schools in Japan,
and hostels nearby.</p>
