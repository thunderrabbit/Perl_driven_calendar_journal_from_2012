<p>No foolin'; Hitomi and I have stated we are officially finished.
It only took 6 hours and 1 year to figure out how to do it, but it
seems to be done.</p>

<p>I really appreciate her efforts to speak English and give me her
opinion of how I can change myself and what I need to do to change
and become better in relationships.  I expressed my opinion of people
using my journal 'against' me.  Yes, I am the same fuckup in
relationships as I was 6 years ago.  Make that 10 years ago.  15+, if
you like.</p>

<p>As scheduled in Sakura Shinmachi station at 6:30pm, as of 8pm,
while sitting in McDonald's after I was already pissed off at myself
for having rearranged my schedule to meet her, (thereby giving myself
another night at Jesse's instead of getting on the road (during which
time I will hopefully be able to do a modicum of planning)), got even
more pissed when the manager wouldn't give me a cup full of shake, but
just 90% full, and gave me a big batsu with his arms, so I spilled
shake on the steps, (about as much as he wouldn't give me, I gave
back), Hitomi pointed out how I have anger management issues, and I'm
like, "oh you're a fuckin' genius," and how I don't communiate with
(but just have sex with) women who can't speak English well and she
looked so smug when I agreed with her on that one.</p>

<p>Cripes, this is a sorry sack of shit journal entry.</p>

<p>But I'm done with Hitomi.</p>
