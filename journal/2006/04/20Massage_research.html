<p>Got my journal entries uploaded with a stealthy CAT 5 cable
switcharoo.  Did some research and found the massage slash
psychotherapy idea would likely be a long process, unless I go to a
week long Thai Massage school in Thailand, a place I have wanted to
visit.  And cheap, too!</p>

<p>Wrote a quick query to Kathy Fey to see how she began her
career.</p>
