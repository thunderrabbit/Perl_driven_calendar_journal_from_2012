<p>Haven't taken a shower in a few days, but today Tony is treating
me to the public bath.  Lovely wash and lovely soak in the supa-warm
water.  Mmmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Back from the baths.  Feeling super relaxed, and sorta bloated
with blood vessels all gorged close to the surface.</p>

<p>According to the scale there, I weigh 76.5 kilograms.  Wow: that's
only 168.6 pounds.</p>

<p>I was like 180+ when I left Texas.</p>
