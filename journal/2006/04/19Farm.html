<p>I get another day (or few hours?) at the farm today; I hope this
will help me feel like I've given fairly for the free room and board
I've gotten here.  On their way out of town, they'll drop me off at
the farm and Masako will give me some direction: probably weeding
this and that.  If I feel up to it, I'll cut the bamboo into pieces
short enough to fit into the fire pit.</p>

<p>We'll leave in 30 minutes.</p>
