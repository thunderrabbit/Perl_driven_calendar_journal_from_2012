<p>Awake.  Basically.  Didn't really wake up with a distinct dream in
my brain, though I did have something going on up there.  I'm tired
for sure, but more anxious to be at the center on time,
and <em>not</em> sure about the hills ahead of me.  Basically at
sea level here in Kobe, and near where I believe the center is the
map is labeled 400 some meters.</p>

<p>Thanks to Richard's generous cash donation (20,000 yen), I now
actually have *more* cash than when I started in Takadanobaba on 3
April.  Like 22,000 and change now.  <b>Plus</b> my brakes now work,
and I have a new battery charger for my camera battery.  (I seem to
have foolishly left mine at Jesse's.)</p>
