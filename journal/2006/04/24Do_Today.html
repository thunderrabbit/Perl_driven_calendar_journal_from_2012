<p>My measurement on the map shows it's basically 90 kilometers to the
meditation center.  Not a short ride, but definitely doable in one
day.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em>, however, uphill for a lot of that.</p>

<p>If I leave at 7 or 8am, I should arrive on time.</p>

<pre>The course starts in the evening, so please come in the late afternoon.</pre>
