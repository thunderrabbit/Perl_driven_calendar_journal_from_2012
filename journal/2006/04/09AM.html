<p>That break last night lasted until 5:30am, when I woke up just
after the sun had come over the horizon, but not even above the power
lines in the distance.</p>

<p>Got up and moving and now I'm in McDonald's (in ¤Ä¤·, ÄÅ»Ô), using
electricity for the price of a egg-sausage-cheese-muffin (200
yen).</p>
