<p>Made it to さんのみや station in Kobe to meet Richard.  Many map
points indicated with timestamps.  2 days from Koji's in Shima-shi.
Wrote a Rob Update in Osaka-ish.  Richard will be here in 20
minutes.  Kathy Fey told me her life-calling search mantra "my heart
and my income are connected."  I have been using it today, including
out breaths for "my heart" and "are connected" and in breaths on "my
income" and my added "blessed be".</p>

<p>Sannomiya station is a happenin' place to be.  Borrowed a keitai
to call Rich with only 3 turndowns.  Wanna go back to internet and
free ice cream, OJ, hot cocoa!!</p>
