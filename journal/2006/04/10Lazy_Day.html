<p class="date">2:03pm JST Monday 10 April 2006 (day 13165)</p>

<p>Went with everyone (Koji, his wife, Tony (another guest), and Anne)
to drop Anne off at the train station.  Good luck to her and 30 hours
of travel to get home almost before she leaves.</p>

<p>Took a tour around the perimeter of this peninsula, including a
couple of stops at overlooks, and a stop where I snarfed a few sample
treats from each of the sweet-looking sample displays.</p>

<p>Back at the house, I read 60 pages of Fellowship of The Ring, and
note high quality writing when I read it.  Chowed some lunch (rice
and egg mix, plus hot water poured over de-seeded orange slices)
while watching what happened to be on TV, motocross stunt biking
stuff, my first time to see it.  Amazing tricks they were doing.  I'm
glad no one wrecked.</p>

<p>Now it's (brush teeth then) naptime; I want to stay bundled up
because it's pretty cold today.</p>
