<p>For some reason I just wrote a program called digits that prints
the sum of digits in a list of numbers; basically:</p>

<pre>
1 = 1
2 = 2
3 = 3
...
10 =&gt; 1 + 0 = 1
...
15 =&gt; 1 + 5 = 6
...
258 =&gt; 2 + 5 + 8 = 15 =&gt; 1 + 5 = 6
</pre>

<p>I don't remember why I wanted to write it, but I remember wondering
if the pattern was simple or complex.  It's simple.  I think I've come
up with a proof by induction that the pattern indefinitely repeats in
the way it does in the first, oh, 2000000000 whole numbers.</p>
