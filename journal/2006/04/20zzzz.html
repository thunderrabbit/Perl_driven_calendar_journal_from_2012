<p>I've promised myself to go to bed soooooon sooon sooon...  Been
sidetracked reading Fellowship of the Ring, and cleansing my computer.
But good news is that I've got 222 London + Paris pictures to put
online hopefully soon.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to leave here tomorrow or the next day.  I will
tomorrow if the weather is nice.  I will by the next day no matter
what.  Gotta get to Kyoto on time!</p>
