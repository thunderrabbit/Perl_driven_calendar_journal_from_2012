<p>Digging through more directories on my computer, I have uncovered
TONS of pictures that I would like to put on my site.  Lots of
YRUU-related stuff: pics from rallies and local YRUU (including some
of Wende!), and pics from when Bryn invited me to London and Paris
with her.</p>

<p>It appears that I'm finally going to start getting these online; I
have the tools just about built the way I want, but there's still the
tedious process of naming the images.... and a lot lot lot of these
peeps' names (especially all the mugbook shots from Houston Rally
(2002?) I don't remember slash never knew, though there are some name
tags involved.</p>

<p>But right now, I am too friggin' tired to do more; gots to go to b
e d.</p>

<p>And wake up tomorrow and write some dream entries with my new
automagical class="dream" tagger!</p>
