<p>Big chow and big fun at TGI Fridays with Tomoko and Sumidasan,
then big dessert and big singing at karaoke for two hours with them
at a karaoke place with a good number of English songs, but still no
"Rabbit Run" by Eminem.</p>

<p>Back to Jesse's now for final prep to TJ Bike my way outta here.
Not really sure if I should try to go north and plant rice at Aya's
first, or head more directly to Kyoto.  Sumida and Tomoko said they'd
enjoy meeting me in Kyoto before or after my meditation.  I'd like
that.</p>
