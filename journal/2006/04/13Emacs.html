<p>With lots of free time, but limited internet, I have spent a lot of
time playing with emacs, and some of its games.  I read dunnet.el to
see how to play the dungeon game (M-x dunnet); I had figured out the
bear, and how to start and login to the computer, but I gotten stuck
at the computer, and would never have guessed to rlogin / ftp to
various hosts to get past it.  I got bored once I got to the bedroom
and urinal; I dunno if I'll dunnet again, now that I've done it for so
long, but still couldn't do it.</p>

<p>I've played with M-x zone, M-x tetris, M-x snake, M-x life (though
I can't figure out a way to place my own @), and others.</p>
