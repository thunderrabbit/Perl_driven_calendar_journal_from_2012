<p>The wind has been <em>brutal</em>.  Bikes unattended rarely
upright.  I've given up on this stupid ride so many times, but I don't
want to admit defeat. <!-- (to Eri (wtf???)) --> I've considered
hitching a ride in an empty back of a truck.  I've considered taking a
train.  But, I'm still going, though not going strong.</p>

<p><em>Finally</em> found a grocery store on the side of the road
(not 2 km off course).  I had been getting pissed at the headwind and
the number of GAME CENTERS, and hating all the apparent free time
people have to throw away money when the world is going down the
sewer and maybe we can't save a starving kid in Forgetia, but someone
could give me a sandwich and then <b>Hallo! Foods</b> came into
view.  Beauty.  Two packets of cereal (cheap granola bars) and 2
packets of Pocari Sweat mix (enough to make a liter each).</p>
