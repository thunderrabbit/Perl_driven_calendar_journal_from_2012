<p>I made it to Hamamatsu (station), which is far bigger than I had
suspected; it sounds like a little rinky station, but has a shopping
mall built in, and a shinkansen line.</p>

<p>Naoko is still in Nagoya.</p>

<p>Pretty long ride today, including a nice up and zoooomdown AND a
long ass river crossing with no bike lane, but I'm ready to head
toward Koji's (after a break).</p>

<p>Oh, I got my back tire fixed.  It was needing air every hour or
so. 1200±ﬂ, the same price I did not pay for (and did not stay)
overnight at the internet cafe in Shizuoka ¿≈≤¨.  Been nice today not
to reinflate every time I take a break.</p>
