<p>Working on the farm today was a bit tiring, though none of it was
back-breaking..  I cut some dried bamboo so that it would fit in the
fire pit, did some light weeding in the beds of potatoes, cleared out
all the plants in one area to make a new bed, and then had lunch.</p>

<p>Lunch was quite a treat: the fire pit was used to roast vegetables
and a goose.  First, I washed the veggies in the same water we use to
rinse off the shovels and stuff each night.  It's murky water, but
cleaner than the vegetables had been.  Then the veggies and goose were
individually wrapped in about a centimeter thickness of wet newspaper,
and then aluminum foil, and placed in the hot coals of the fire for
maybe an hour.  Then we pulled them out and chowed.  Totally
delicious!  First time I had ever seen this done.</p>

<p>Back to weeding, and then carrying more dead bamboo that Tony had
cut out of the tiny grove of trees and bamboo near the entrance of the
farm.  He asked if I could pull down a vine hanging from one of the
trees, but I could not; it basically supported my full weight.  I
noticed the tree was dead, and should be removed entirely, so I got to
use my monkey-skillz and a saw and cut a significant amount of the
larger trunk-branches from this tree using the little hand saw
designed for cutting bamboo.  The tree was like a siamese twin joined
at the base, with each trunk about 10 inches in diameter.  There
weren't any real branches left, but the trunks each split a few times
and then just ended.  I made about five cuts and lopped maybe 12 feet
off the top of both trunks in a few triumphant crashes of branches
down below.</p>

<p>I hesitated before beginning to cut at the next 6 foot interval:
the trunk was maybe 8 inches thick and my sawing arm was getting
tired. Tony suggested we declare ourselves finished for the day and
head back home for dinner.</p>
