<p>At one point, highway 23 made a bigtime right turn that I didn't
think I should take.  Found no one to ask, rang a buzzer, and a woman
came out and confirmed I had missed my exit on 167 (because it's only
labeled 42), so I was going to head back, but her father came out and
was like, "keep going this way, turn right on 32 and cross the
mountain and then zoooooooooooommm down the other side and it will be
great," in Japanese as best I could understand, and I was like, "can I
do it on my bicycle?" ("heh heh, you said do it") and he was like, "no
problem; I've done it before!!"</p>

<p>So I did it.  Really nice hill.</p>

<p>I would love to zooom down it again, but <em>this time</em> with
my helmet on more securely; I had to slow myself down to keep the
wind from blowing it back like a parachute attached to my neck.  I
had had the straps looser because I had been wearing it over my hat
and hoodie hood.</p>

<p>Zooom.  Really nice run.</p>
