<p>In McDonald's in 町田市,小川 according to the receipt.  According
to my maps, and traveled 35km from 高田馬場, and an extra 15km if I
count from Jesse's to 高田馬場, though I perfectly back-tracked, so
my net distance today is 20km.</p>

<p>When I arrived here, super hungry, I asked the guy what had the
most calories/energy, and he suggested the double meat thing for 250円.
Chowed, told him I'm going to Kyoto and got a free ice coffee as a
result.  Chugged it down to get rid of it without tasting much, then
ate the rest of the chocolate from Natalie to cover the coffee
taste.</p>
