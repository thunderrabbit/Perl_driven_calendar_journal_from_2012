<p><b>showers and no showers</b></p>

<pre>Hello from Shima-shi!

TJ Bike and I have ridden about 4 or 500 kilometers (by rough estimate) basically
west by southwest of Tokyo.  We slept outside each night, and one of those nights I
slept in my tent.  Two nights and one full day I spent under a bridge due to rain;
thankfully I had been warned about the impending shower by some people I talked to
the previous day!

The other nights were spent next to a rest stop, in a park, and next to a field,
respectively.  No tent, but definitely sleeping bag; it's been cold!!

For that 6-day stretch, I had no shower, and my food intake was a bit sketchy. 
After finishing the Power Bars donated by Carl, (and peanuts donated by Jesse,) I
ate granola cereal most of the time.  I worked it out at about 100 kilocalories for
100 yen. I ate at McDonald's several times (cheap with free electricity for
journaling on my computer).

At one point, I was able to get free internet access at a small school to teach
people how to use PCs.

The past 2 nights I have been at Koji's house; he was one of my students in the
class called Fantastic Rabbits on the recent PB voyage.  I'm really thankful for
his (and Masako's) hospitality!

I have basically recovered now, but my legs were certainly sore upon arrival.  My
first thoughts when asked, &#34;how was it?&#34; were something like, I won't be
considering riding around the world anytime soon, but I just said, &#34;longer than I
expected.&#34;

Greeted by Koji, his wife, and then surprisingly, by a native English speaker!!  I
wondered if they had a previously unmentioned daughter, but it turns out she was
WWOOFing on their farm for a few days during her visit to Japan.

Anne is from Maine, and this summer will be living on a farm with no running water,
no electricity, and _no internet_.  The nearest town is 2 hours away.  I hope it's
a great experience!

For the past two days, it has been rainy; I'm thankful to have arrived before the
drizzly cold weather started.  Soon I hope to be back on TJ Bike, headed toward
Kyoto (where Tomoko and Sumidasan said they would meet me for dinner!), though I
haven't worked out a schedule for that.  I'd like to help out on Koji's farm as
well; hopefully the rain stops in time for everything to happen in dry weather!

I took a few pictures, but right now have no way to get them online.  They've only
got dial-up access here.

Thank you for encouraging emails!

   I hope everyone is well.
     - Rob!
