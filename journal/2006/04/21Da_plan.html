<p>The plan from here has changed a bit, I'm going to go to Kobe to
see Richard, and hopefully have no worries staying at his friend's
flat.  I think I can get there by tomorrow, if I get out of here
pretty promptly after lunch.  I had expected Masako back by now,
actually.</p>

<p>I've got a choice between a short curvy (hilly) road or a longer
maybe flatter road.  I'm going to go for the short one, and hope the
hills don't kills me.</p>
