<p>Finally finally got my shiznit packed, and got out of Jesse's.  On
the way, I looked for a phone to call ahead to confirm Natalie would
be available for lunch.  Feeling scared and blown by the wind
(literally) with TJ Bike weighed down significantly, I ended up
stopping at a grocery store, and happened to see an American; he let
me use his cell phone, for which I was quite thankful.</p>

<p>Shoulda given him my URL, but I didn't think of it.  Plus, I'm not
actually sure where my cards are.</p>

<p>Made it to 高田馬場（たかだのばば）at 12:15pm, and sat outside with
Liz for a bit because Nat had just gotten in (sick today, so she
(apparently) skipped the morning meeting).  We got foodage (and she
bought me some chocolate for the road) and ate out in the park, which
was a good idea in theory, but we got swamped with other Peace Boat
staffers, and didn't get to gossip as we had planned.  ah well.</p>

<p>Dropped her back off at the office and slowly headed out,
after <em>buying a map-book</em> down the street.  Carl walked with
me to do that, and gave me lots of kudos on the apparent courage /
craziness of my trip.</p>

Now lemme get this straight:  you've got $200 to last 20 days, you
have no idea where you're going to sleep, and you don't actually know
how to get to Kyoto.  Dawg, that is <em>awesome!!</em>

<p>Mr Dan was also there, so he, Carl and Phil came out to see me off;
I felt really happy and supported and empowered.  Phil took photos of
us 3027 guys and TJ Bike.</p>
