<p>I should probably study Japanese or meditate, but I'm in a nerdy
programmy mood, like I want to write some cool software, but I'm not
sure what I could realistically write in the amount of time this
feeling will last.</p>

<p>The smallest 'useful' project I've thought of recently would take a
date and return a list of 500 day anniversaries (on my local
computer), but even that doesn't seem useful anymore (it did while on
PB and people kept asking me how old I was, I told them in days and
then wanted to tell them how many days old <em>they</em> were,
especially those coming up on 10000 days, for maximum coolness)</p>

<p>Ah: I know: I can work on getting pictures ready to upload, which
will include some tweaks to my iPhoto_2_legible.pl, a program for
which I still haven't chosen a name I really like.</p>
