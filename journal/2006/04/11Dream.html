<p class="dream">Riding TJ Bike to some GET party or event or
something, but didn't have clear directions on how to get there.
Amanda (Goodie) was leading me for a bit, riding through some woods,
generally around a lake, and then she was like, "turn left up ahead;
you'll know where." and I thought "aight" then was worried and she
said, "no, really, you will know where."</p>

<p class="dream">And soon enough I came across a STAR WARS convention,
and knew that must be the place, given that one of the main reasons we
met was through Charyl, a lover of all things S W.  I turned toward
the source of Darth Vader suits and Leah outfits, and cars made into
various space ships to a police protected barricaded street where some
guy was talking to a cop, asking about his legal rights to video tape
the parade, then show it later to his friends.  The cop was saying
basically, "don't ask; just do it," and I crossed the street by
tossing TJ Bike over one of the rails (there was a gap available on
one side, but not the opposite) and then down into a ditch to get away
from the throngs of Chewies and C3P0s.</p>

<p class="dream">The kid finished his recording and wanted to use my
computer to do the editing, so I let him, but then there was some
conflict because he wanted it for a long time <b>and</b> wouldn't let
me (nor anyone) watch what he was doing, so I was like, "fine; you
can't use my computer," and, knowing it was a dream, I mentally erased
his data from my HD and erased him from my dream altogether.</p>

<p>That reminds me I had another dream-awareness moment earlier in the
night, but don't remember the deets.</p>
