<p class="dream">Saw a man preparing food for a bunch of people,
basically mixing white and brown sugar in a five gallon plastic
bucket.  I asked if I could help, and he was like, "yeah, mix this,"
so I used a metal bar and mixed, and he used his hands and feet
(while wearing socks) and there were sticks and leaves in it, but we
still just kept mixing.  I was a bit grossed out, but didn't say
anything.</p>

<p class="dream">It came time to cook our mix, which was not perfectly
mixed, but had some stripes in it and we just poured batter onto the
hot asphalt on the street, making about 200 pancake sized things,
blocking the entire ineresection next to some railroad tracks.  The
train was coming, so cars couldn't move anyway, though the road was
parallel to the tracks and a T intersection was involved.  Traffic
didn't mind our behavior, but just waited patiently.</p>

<p class="dream">There was even a truck bound for Lawson's, and
printed on the side of the truck was the time he had to be at the
store.  Only 4 or 41 minutes remained, depending on when I looked at
it.</p>

<p>(though I didn't trigger that this must be a dream)</p>

<p class="dream">I tried the first sugar pancake when it was done, but
it wasn't all that sweet.  Just basically like a tortilla.</p>

<p class="dream">My hair was getting longer, and I noted that the
roots were all white.  They all started at the same time to just be
white, and about a half centimeter of every root was just white.  I
wondered if I would feel embarassed to shave my head again and have
naught but white hair from then on.  I showed my friend the surprising
way the hair *all* changed at once, and it was agreed to be pretty
strange, but no decision was made about if I should shave it or
not.</p>
