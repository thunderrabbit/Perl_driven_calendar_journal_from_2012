<p>Around 6am, there was a big boom that sounded exactly like the
sunrise/sunset cannon we heard in Jerusalem during Ramadan.  It woke
me up, but I recognized the sound, so I wasn't too scared.  Then I
heard several more in the distance, from various directions, so I knew
either (1) they were loud but harmless cannons for which nothing
should be done, or (0) it was a huge attack on the city about which
nothing could be done.</p>

<p>They continued at various locations and intervals, and I had a
dream snippet for a close one:</p>

<p class="dream">a bomb was thrown near me and accidentally set part
of my sleeping bag on fire.</p>

<p>It's overcast and cold this morning.</p>
