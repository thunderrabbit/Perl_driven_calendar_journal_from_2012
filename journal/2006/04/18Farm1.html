<p>Back for lunch from working on the farm... today I climbed the
remains of the same tree from yesterday and cut out another rather
large branch..  I was amazed at how much I had to cut before it fell;
I woulda taken a picture, but basically the area of the cross section
was the area of my handprint (round and not handprint shaped), and I
had to cut all but a thumb print size of the wood before it broke.</p>

<p>Now <em>that</em> is what I call a hardwood tree.</p>

<p>I imagined having the time to cut a set of discs from the branch
and sending them to Fred as coasters, leaving the broken part visible
to indicate how much had to be cut.</p>

<p>Oh - the strength was apparent given the the branch was rather
long, heavy and angling out at about 40 degrees from normal.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After that I found a few more trees to cut, and one that I was
simply able to push repeatedly at its oscillation frequency until the
successive constructive wave additions shook the shit over.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Then I hauled all those branches up to the queue to the fire pit,
and two relatively long bamboo stalks(?)/trunks from where they had
been thrown down a hill beside the road.  Those were fun because they
were just heavy and long enough that I could barely get up the hill
without sliding down, if I turned my feet sideways and stepped quite
carefully.</p>

<p>Then, a big-ass trunk that was far heavier than I could actually
lift....  When I cut it down (thinking it would be easy because half
of it was rotten) it fell sorta on an incline so that I thought I
could perhaps get the wheel barrow under it and wheel it out.</p>

<p>Was in fact able to do that, though it took a lot of manuevering
and wiggling around to get the trunk past some other trees (like Pink
Panther trying to walk through a door while carrying a ladder in
front of him), and then off the rock wall onto the road (during which
process I had to dump the trunk because it was certainly going to
destroy the old wheel barrow as it went over the edge)...  No going
back now, the tree was blocking the road so we wouldn't be going back
home unless I got it out of the way.</p>

<p>Positioned the wheel barrow and barely was able to lift one side of
the tree to get it placed on there, and then with a surprisingly
perfectly-balanced lift, the tree was on the wheel barrow, balanced,
ready to move.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Two funny things while I was cutting the first branch:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Just</em> as I was set to make the first stroke of the cut,
my orange (planned to be my in-tree snack) fell out my hoodie
pocket</p></li>

<li><p>After I cut the branch, and was climbing back out of the tree,
a little branch sprang up and removed my glasses.</p>

<p><em>yoink!</em></p>

<p>I was basically sure they hadn't hit the ground (I know what they
sound like when they fall), but I couldn't see them, being pretty
blind without them.  What a predicament!  Tony was using the weed
eater in the distance, and would barely be able to hear me if I
yelled, and even if I yelled, I didn't know how to say what had
happened in Japanese.</p>

<p>Groped around a bit, then heard/barely saw them fall straight
below me.</p>

<p>Monkeyed my way down the tree and picked them up without actually
touching the ground.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We just had lunch (spaghetti and miso soup and tuna on lettuce
salad); we'll go back for more farming antics at 2:30.</p>
