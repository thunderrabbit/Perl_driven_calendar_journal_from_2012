<p>Special thanks to Shuji and Kaori for being so helpful in getting
me oriented after highway 1 split disorientingly.  That was 10km ago;
I've been rolling slowly since I'm exhausted.  In a sports park in
Shizuoka now on 407 between 1 and 74, and bypass.  I'll be here all
night unless someone kicks me out.</p>

<p>By rough count, 70km traveled so far today.</p>

<p>By careful count, 100km.  Feels like a jillion.</p>
