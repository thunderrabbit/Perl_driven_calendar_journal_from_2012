<p>Oh shit!!</p>

<p>I found a WiFi signal about 1 minute walk away from here, next to,
of all things, a flag advertising Yahoo!BB (Yahoo! Broad Band, which
is basically *the* high speed connection used in residences in
Japan).</p>

<p>Also, ironically, next to three side-by-side cigarette vending
machines, at which Tony sometimes stops to get a pack while on our way
to the farm, and I've always thought, "ew what a disgusting habit..."
My internet addiction can be filled in the same place!</p>

<p>But, *just* as I was about to upload journal entries, my battery
decided four minutes was enough; it was going to sleeeeeeep.</p>

<p>I've switched batteries to the one I got from Paul(? (but I thought
he quit Gaba)) via Jesse; I hadn't used it in a while because it also
had a short life, but when I put it in, it said 78%, and has been
climbing relatively (*) slowly as I type this entry.</p>

<p>(*) slow compared to my other battery.</p>

<p>quick breakfast and then go back to that hotspot...</p>

<p>Went over, and got the WiFi signal, but</p>
