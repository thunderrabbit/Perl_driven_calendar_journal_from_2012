<p>km 291 passed recently.  In Aichi Prefecture on Route 1. Just found
some stairs with space underneath.  No sleeping bag, but just sit and
relax, with teeth brushed and mouthguard in, just in case I
snoooze.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>That lasted about 20 minutes - too cold with traffic induced wind.
It's 12:30am now, in Toyohashi(?) Park, the sign for which came as a
beatiful blessing for my sleeping pleasure.  In sleeping bag at
12:22am.</p>
