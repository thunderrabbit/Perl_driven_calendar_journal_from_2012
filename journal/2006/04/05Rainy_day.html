<p>It's quite a miserable day for bicycling, so I am thankful for my
shelter under the bridge.  I had a great idea of doing laundry and
taking a shower, but highway runoff water is disgusting.  The rain is
just a sprinkle, so it might take forever to simply fill my container
(the same one that got confiscated on my way out of Valparaiso (I
think)).</p>

<p>At minimum, I will unpack and repack my stuff in a more useful
manner, so my business cards and light are on top and my undies are
on bottom (no pun intended).</p>

<p>Today I plan to meditate, study Japanese, read the gospel
according to John and relax the rain away.</p>

     A guy came to work on a secion of fence behind me.  At first I was 
like "oh shit!" and quickly packed, but he paid no notice. Second I was
        nervous / embarassed to ask if it was okay to chill where I was.  
      Third, I saw he could use a bit of help, so I went over and I was 
   able to help him a bit.  He thanked me and I no problemed then I was 
      okay asking if I could stay.  He said it was no problem but I was 
       like how long will it rain? He said only today 「今日だけ」。I was 
      happy to hear it.

<p>Still under my bridge.  It stopped raining a bit before dusk, but
I chose to stay another night.  Didn't want to be stuck looking for
a place in the dark.  Early start tomorrow.  Looked at maps and see
George is NOT in 1 or 2 day  ride from here.  I told him I might make
it by tomorrow night (HA!)  No way.... But Naoko (Jerry from Fighting
Goats) is within a long day ride from here.  Hmmm.  Shizuoka.</p>

<p>Alice, who said I could stay at her crib, didn't write her address
down in my notebook.  It's on my laptop, but my super-suck 1 minute
battery won't let me look at it.</p>

<p>All of Carl's food is eaten.  Only Jesse's peanuts and Tomoko's
candy remain.</p>

<p>Plus 1.7 万</p>

<p>I chilled all day yesterday under a bridge.  Left around 2:30am
this morning after a significant number of short naps.</p>
