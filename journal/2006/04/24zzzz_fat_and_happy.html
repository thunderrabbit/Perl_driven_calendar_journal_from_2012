<p>Gotta leave in like 6.5 hours.  Gotta pack.  Gotta sleep.</p>

<p>So fat and happy - had a fantastic meal at Pia's with Pia, Valerie,
Richard (who spoke mostly in French with Valerie), and ひで.  Rice and
ikura with salmon, beef salad, cheese with sauce on french
bread.....  <em>then</em> <b>dessert</b> of chocolate fondue, with
fruit and crepes and Nutella and a game of kiss the person on your
left each time a piece of fruit is dropped into the chocolate.</p>

<p>I read <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> first treasury (almost finished
it) and fell fully asleep on the couch as the rest played music and
looked up lyrics online.</p>

<p>ひで got a bonus as well: Pia has an extra room available; he's
going to stay there for the next few nights before
continuing <em>his</em> bicycle trip (that's how we met him; he's got
the same bicycle bags as TJ Bike!!!) to Okinawa.  Wow!!</p>

<p>Blessings to him and I gave my cards to everyone and it was just a
great night.</p>

<p>I was just telling Richard my thoughts on next steps:</p>

<p>I would like to continue studying Japanese no matter what country
I end up in.  If I stay in Japan, I'll just have Jesse takubin my
bags to me wherever I land.  If I escape Japan, I guess I'll get the
bags and take them as luggage.  But what about TJ Bike?  No matter
what I do, I'll likely be in negative finances for a bit, so I'll be
needing' to make some cash when I settle.</p>
