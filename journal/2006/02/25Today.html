<p>Today has been pretty productive, not counting a complete lack of
preparation for classes.  I studied / practiced Japanese for 2.5 hours
with Akane, including writing addresses on the 6 postcards Hitomi so
kindly made for me to send to Cheerful Dancing Fellows, drew two title
images for the daily paper (so now all three that they have in their
queue were drawn by me), filled in the sunrise and sunset times for
the title image drawn by me with Maruan's help (playing DOTS in the
background) that will be used tomorrow, had Saki do some accupuncture
on me, gave her a massage (and she asked if I have actually studied
massage), missed the GET Meeting (that I thought was canceled because
we met earlier today), ate dinner with Erika, determined that my
computer doesn't have the motion detection hardware, and probably a
couple other things.</p>

<p>Now it's showertime and bedtime.</p>
