<p>We've arrived in Ushuaia, the southernmost-ish city in South
America, it seems.  I haven't done any research on it, but there's a
sign in the city visible from the port: [The end of the world, the
beginning of everything.]</p>

<p>This is Patagonia land, where the hiking gear company gets its name.</p>

<p>I'm not yet sure what I'll be doing today, but I may tag along
with Kellie on the train to the end of the world.</p>

<p>Parts of me are tempted to go out alone; that's what I told Petra
I'd be doing.  I wanted to cry after I said it, but her hug helped.
When I think about how miserably cold it would be alone, I don't want
to go.  But I would like some meditative time today.</p>

<p>There's a really big ship next to ours.  It's called Majestic
Princess or something.  It's pretty ugly for a cruise ship, but it
has four interior decks that start at our top deck.</p>
