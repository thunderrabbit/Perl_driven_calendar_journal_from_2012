<p class="date">9:35am ART Monday 20 February 2006</p>

<p>Ate with 理恵（りえ） in Yacht Club and made a plan to meet her for
T-time.  She'll be going to Panic Art tonight, the performance by Kim
Chahen (sp) the Korean-Japanese cat who won entertainer of the year in
2002 and 2004 or something.  He's the one who did the impossible with
the diablos (oversized yoyos) on a string.</p>
