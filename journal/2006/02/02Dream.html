<p class="dream">I was jumping down from a roof onto the ground
outside in front of someone's house.  As I jumped, I thought it would
be a good opportunity to test if I was dreaming, though I felt
certain I was awake.  I jumped while I was falling, and lo, I stayed
in the air.  Holy cats it wokred1  I was dreaming!  I felt really
excited; this is th e first time I have tested to see if I was
dreaming while I was dreaming; it worked!  I flew around the area a
little bit, but soon faded back into sleep.</p>

<p>Most remarkable about the experience is how surprised I was to
find I was actually dreaming.  I felt certain I was just practicing
dream-testing while awake.</p>
