<p>Last night, in a state of super-tiredness, I recognized that I
should not hang out with Rei because I would probably try to kiss her
or something foolish like that.  So I told her I should go to bed
instead of hang out as we had planned.</p>

<p>We <em>talked</em> today after I wrote her an apology note last
night (not for not hanging out, but for not leaving right after I
recognized the need), and she was like no biggie.  I had asked one
question at the end of my note: basically if she wanted to know what
craziness goes on inside my brain.  She was like, "yeah," and that
basically confirmed that I can be Just Friends with her.</p>

<p>I don't necessarily want to be Just Friends, but I think it's 100%
better overall.</p>

<p>But, when I started to talk about my sex addiction recovery stuff,
I realized oh my god how much I miss my I-group and that source of
stability in my life.</p>
