<p>Good news and bad news about Hitomi's camera: I took it apart all
the way to operating the lens extension by hand.  I accidentally got a
fingerprint on the inner lens, but I think I cleaned it off.  I got
the camera back together and it works as well as it did before I took
it apart.  But it still doesn't work as well as it did before I took
it sandboarding.</p>

<p>Super thanks to ¤¢¤«¤Í for helping me put it back together today.
She's the one who unwrapped several of the teensie little screws that
I had individually wrapped and labeled.</p>
