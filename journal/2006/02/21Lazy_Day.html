<p>Today has been super lazy.  Upstairs with gorgeous view of the
Patagonia fiords and a big-ass glaciers, I have been chatting,
studying and writing in Japanese.  Pretty good practice for me.</p>

<p>I'm pretty way behind in transcribing what I've written in Japanese
to here...  Basically the entire voyage worth, I believe.</p>

<p>Up to this point, Carla has been the winner for laziest day.  She
went upstairs, ate with her students, went 10 meters to the back deck
and sat for a couple hours, went 10 meters to the other side of the
back deck and chatted for an hour, came 10 meters back inside for
lunch, and went back to the back deck for about 2 hours and has just
come back to her room.</p>

<p>Seven hours of just eating and talking within about 300 square
meters.</p>

<p>I didn't do a whole lot more, but my range was larger: I went to
the Sunshine Bar to study for a bit, after I heard the jacuzzi was
open, and visualized finding Isabel there so I could kill her in the
007 game.</p>

<p>She wasn't there, though.</p>

<p>Part of my study was the 地球ー宇宙 book that I bought with Hitomi
some year ago or so.  It's full of ふりがな to help me read the
kanji.</p>

<p>Last night Aya asked me if I could count in Japanese.  I was like,
"yeah; can you??" and she's like, "of course; I am Japanese."  So I
basically challenged her to count higher than I could.  She knew the
word for 1,0000,0000,0000, which I didn't know, so she won.  She
didn't know the next one, though, so I told her it was her
homework.</p>

<p>I learned it before she did, though.  京（けい）= 1,0000,0000,0000,0000.</p>
