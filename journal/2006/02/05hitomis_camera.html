<p>Mate.  Modern digital cameras are pretty densely constructed.
Tonight I began taking Hitomi's apart so I can clean the sand out of
it after our adventure in Namibia's sand dunes.</p>

<p>(( I should have used <em>my</em> camera, in its waterproof and
sandproof case. ))</p>

<p>It's taken me a couple of hours to get 33 some-odd screws / pieces
apart.  After about 12 screws, I went back and labeled each screw
(wrapped each one in tape and labeled the tape) because they were too
similar to readily identify specific ones as needed.</p>

<p>So far, I basically have the flash unit off - the flash and
capacitor are like a set.  I am close to getting the screen off the
back, but am a bit stuck on that.  I locked the screen back down and
wrapped the case back around the gutted camera, put that in its
fake-leather holder and put everything into the extra safe in our
bedroom.</p>
