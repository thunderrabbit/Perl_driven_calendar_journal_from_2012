<p>As I fell asleep last night, I cleared my brain save awareness of
my breath.  There were moments that I felt thoughts come up, and I
seemed to actually feel a physiological difference, like a
brain-muscle contraction when my brain began to think words.  If this
was in fact happening, then it should be possible to tell with some
sort of brain monitor if someone is thinking or not.</p>

<p>But better than that, I believe I have the beginnings of a
physiological technique to control my own mind.</p>
