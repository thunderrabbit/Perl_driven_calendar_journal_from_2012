<p>Woke up with a dream pretty vividly remembered, but didn't record
it.  Something about being somewhere or something.  (wow)</p>

<p>Classes were like bang-bang-bang-bang finished.  Fighting Goats at
8am were vaguely talkative, then 9:30am Fantastic Rabbits, while
designing Peace Boy, were super talkative, but in Japanese, then
11:05am for Intermediate Open we used "How about ________-ing ..." to
give suggestions, with りえ as CC (Rie who shaved us last night) and a
contiuation of that grammar plus "... in the Sports Bar at 7pm?"  for
the Advanced level open.</p>

<p>りえ from 49th voyage said HI after the lesson and we went to
Topaz for lunch and then took a walk on top deck until she had to go
to port orientation for Ushuaia.  I was gonna take a nap, but decided
to get some more foodage, cause Yacht Club offered pizza for lunch
today.  Now it's naptime until CC りえ comes to meet me about the
open lessons we'll be doing tomorrow.</p>
