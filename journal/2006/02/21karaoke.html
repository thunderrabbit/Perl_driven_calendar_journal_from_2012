<p>People had fun at karaoke tonight.  I left at 11:30 because it was
all stinky-smokey, giving me a headache, plus there were no songs I
really wanted to sing, and there was a queue of songs long enough that
it filled the rest of the remaining time.  And I wanted to leave.</p>

<p>There were no Eminem and no Beastie Boys songs available.  That
sucks.  In the shower a bit ago I did Business and Rabbit Run.</p>

<p>And washed the disgusting smoke out of my clothes.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is classtime again.  8am start.</p>
