<p>Rei just invited me to join her, Yuuka and others out and
about...  sounds great!</p>

<p class="date">11:09pm</p>

<p>Back on the ship at 10:20pm; it was Rei, Rie, and Yuuka; we sought
a tango performance, couldn't find one, and ended up at the same
restaurant where Rei, Rie and I et. al. ate yesterday.  This time we
ate upstairs, and didn't get too much food like we did yesterday.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the delicious grilled cheese most of all.  Note: this
was not a grilled cheese sandwich, but grilled cheese.  Just cheese.
Provolone, to be precise.  Thick, yummy, grilled perfectly.
Mmmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Our waiter called a taxi for Yuuka at 9:30 and for us at 10pm.
Everyone got back on time, and all is good in Buenos Aires.</p>
