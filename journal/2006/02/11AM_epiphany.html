<p>As of last night at midnight, we switched to a new timezone.</p>

<p>I just had an epiphany.  I've already known for a while that I seem
to be attracted to women who show some interest in me.  I just
realized that I can show interest in women who don't appear to show
interest in me first.</p>

<p>This amazing leap of logic came when I was wondering about ways to
prepare for my Rapa Nui port orientation.  I plan to interview
someone who knows more then me about the port and what will be
happening.  I thought I could ask Chika, the CIQ woman, and some
wires crossed in my mind: she's attractive, she seems professional
and stable, she hasn't shown any interest in me, she could possibly
be single,...  wait a minute!</p>

<p>epiphany!</p>
