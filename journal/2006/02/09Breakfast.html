<p class="date">8:40am HAST Thursday 09 March 2006 (day 13133)</p>

<p>Sat down with Kellie who was working on her schedule (planning for
hula lessons around our next surprise port) and then we were joined by
CC Erika, and I chatted with her a bit, then noticed she'll be 9500
soon, and started to calculate her 10,000th day (but didn't tell her
I was doing so, plus I don't think she was interested anyway, because
she said something like, "I know..." that sounded like <em>I'm not
looking forward to it</em>) and while I was doing that, she got up
and joined Saki, who had just come in for her breakfast.</p>

<p>Saki smiled at me across the back deck, and I was too
proud/silly/at-peace-with-myself that I didn't go over there and join
them, though part of me really wanted to.</p>

<p>Felt the jealousy in my body; interesting stuff, that.</p>
