<p>Carl borrowed my keys to get into the room, I came downstairs to
go to bed, found the door locked, moped for a bit because I didn't
want to go back upstairs, felt it was unfair to have to go upstairs
and considered falling asleep by the door as a martyr of sorts, but
went upstairs anyway, got the keys, found that the USB chip is no
longer in its Winne The Pooh branded USB case.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>
