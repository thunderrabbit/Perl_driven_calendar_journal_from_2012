<p>Rio de Janeiro!</p>

<p>With Kellie, internetted then taxied to the base of the Jesus
mountain where we found Petra and Liz.  Taxied up to the base of the
statue with them, stopping at a yellow house that our driver claimed
was the home of the man who founded Rio de Janeiro.  Then up to a
helicopter pad for some pics.  Jesus was shrouded in clouds, but we
could still see him decently well.</p>

<p>It's interesting to see police and think about the corruption we
saw in Favela Rising last night.</p>

<p>I was decently able to speak to the taxi driver across
languages... me using bad Spanish and he using slow Portuguese.
Kellie was better at interpreting him than I was.</p>

<p>At Ipanema beach in Rio de Janeiro with Kellie now and loads of
people, most of them in bikini/beach wear, and some vendors of
various goods:  sunglasses, sunscreen, food, bikinis, drinks,
coconuts, food of various types.</p>

<p>We each ate a grilled thing that tasted like cheese, but had the
consistency of hard tofu.  It was quite good.  Especially neat that
the guy was carrying a little grill around with him.  It cost 3R.
(Real is the name of the Brazilian currency.)</p>

<p>Chillin' on chairs made of 2 liter plastic bottle with Rei, near
whom I danced most of the concert on the balcony for AfroReggae,
along with Yuki and Stacy, when he wasn't taking pictures
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The music was supa dupa awesome and had me bouncing with new
levels of Rob Crazy Dance, including landing hard on my heels with
the beat, vibrating the balcony.  (it was wooden deck on heavy duty
steel tubes, so not detrimentally affected by the thump)</p>

<p>Even more incredible than the band was the juggler, who did 3 yoyo
things at once..  Way way way beyond believable the shit he did.  But
I got a lot on video.  Nice.</p>
