<p class="date">2:31pm ART Monday 13 February 2006</p>

<p>I'm in a park in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I recognize this must
seem amazing to the me of 10 years ago (or even 5), but here I am, all
the same.</p>

<p>"Why am I here?" I have been asking myself, which is exactly the
reason I came to this park, to ask that question.  I wonder if this
little play on words is a perfect analogy to life, or perhaps it's
meaningless, or some of the infinite shades of gray in between.</p>

<p>where was I?</p>

<p>Yeah. the park.  Where *am* I, I should ask.</p>

<p>Not in the same space I was when I asked the first question, as
Einstein pointed out that we are continually moving relative
to <em>something</em>, so we are never in the same spot twice. But I'm
still here in this park, and still babbling instead of writing what I
intended to write.</p>

<p>I've been wondering why I am here on earth.. or actually, I haven't
been wondering that so much .. I've been designing a paradigm for my
life.</p>

<p>((( <em>That</em>'s the word Fred spelled!  I don't think I
remembered it when I told that story recently. )))</p>

<p>......</p>

<p>I've been thinking of short and hopefully profound summaries of my
life, and short and hopefully useful rules to guide me.  </p>

<p>Sometimes I think I'm just flailing through life, not doing
anything of worth..  Cripes, I basically *always* think that, so I'm
looking for some sort of catchall rule to guide me when I feel lost
slash don't know what to do.</p>

<p>Christina (of my old school YRUU days) said her rule was to think at
each junction / decision in her life "what will bring my closer to my
goal?"  (I think) or maybe it was, "what decision will I be proud of
later?"..  maybe it wasn't either of those; I remember thinking it was
pretty simple and profound, but each of these suggestions just seem
like something I would think of.</p>

<p></p>

<p>ANYWAY</p>

<p>"Meditate every day."</p>

<p>This for a long time has been my most commonly cited rule for how to
live that would solve all my woes.  "Whenever I try to figure out
what I should do <em>right now</em> my angels say "meditate" and I say
"no no no, what should I *DO)???""  I have said that for years.  And
it comes up again today.</p>

<p>Think of a GOAL - something to which I am driving, for which I am
striving..  something I can latch onto as the REASON for waking up,
for being, for living.. If I had that, then man,.. look out.</p>

<p>What are some possible goals?</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
<li><p></p></li>
</ol>

<p>exactly.</p>

<p>So, well, I can fall back onto my men's group Mission
Statement.  <em>As a man among men, I bring joy to the world by
playing within the world.</em></p>

<p>That's the statement I most often used when we stated our mission
statements.  Well, I'll be durned, look at me enjoying myself in
Buenos Aires. That counts as pretty far away, out in the world.</p>

<p>Hang on, what's this Far Away business?  Peace starts within.  Life
is within.  Doesn't matter where I am, Assuming I'm still animating
this human body, I am In The World, and it doesn't have to be Buenos
Aires</p>

<p>Well, there is something to being in Buenos Aires, so far from my
peeps back home, so close to my peeps right next to me.  (This is
presently a short list of Francois, but my GET Ts and other mates are
out enjoying themselves equally well, I imagine.)</p>

<p>shit I'm losing the point.</p>

<p>What if writing this journal is my life project?  I sure have put a
lot of time and energy thought etc into it.  Far too much boring
rubbish for any sane person to read it all, but perhaps, hopefully,
somehow it will be of value to future me or future humanity or
alienity or diety and not just so much toiletry and wasted memory.</p>

<p>When people have asked me what I will do after this voyage, I have
come to invariably say (in either English or Japanese) that I will ride
my bicycle from Tokyo to Kyoto and spend 10 days in meditation there
at the Vipasanna meditation center.</p>

<p>I'll be flat honest, I hope it changes my life.</p>

<p>I hope it infuses me with such insight or such experience
or <em>something</em> that I find a new direction in life.. or find a
direction in life</p>

<p>I've thought about ways to do that</p>

<p>sorry my brain got ahead of my fingers.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about what the experience will be like, and
thinking about ways to represent the supposed/suspected/desperately-sought change in my life.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The best I've come up with is a ten day GAP in my journal
(absolutely unheard of for years, now) with bookend States of My Life
showing the dramatic difference.</p>

<p>My greatest fear is that there will be no difference, and that it
wil seem like just a ten day stretch of desperately antsy sitting and
a waste of ten days.</p>

<p>(and the same old me on both sides of the 10 days)</p>

<p>We (as I understand it) are not allowed to write or otherwise
record , or rather we are greatly encouraged not to as it supposedly
detracts from the experience of stillness..</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>There have been a couple of conversations I've had with four
different people that make me... give me... offer me hope that, one
day, I will be on the right track.  or that the track on which I am
will feel right.</p>

<p>Char, who would always look at my crown chakra (my interpretation
of where she looked) while we talked, said, "oh, you will be able to
astral project, in fact that will just be the beginning."  or
something quite close to that when I told her how desperately I wanted
to be able to astral project, to step out into the astral plane.  But
then she continued, "but right now,I see a need for patience."</p>

<p>Patience?</p>

<p>Patience?????</p>

<p>Okay.  later.  As in I look forward to astral projection when the
time is right.</p>

<p>Is the time right?  Have I been patient enough yet?????  How
about now?</p>

<p>After I bonked the shit out of my head and had a full recovery
despite the odds, I knew there must be some reason I survived, fully
intact.</p>

<p>My dad said he came into the ICU to see me and he perceived a white
light around me.  When he asked how he could help, he got the answer
back from me, "I can handle it, dad; don't even worry about it."</p>

<p>After that accident, I talked with Rebecca, my professional psychic
friend who seemed to appear and disappear from my life some years ago.
"When you were unconscious, your angels told you what you are supposed
to do this lifetime.  When you're ready, you can do into meditation
and ask them to tell you again."</p>

<p>After that was Richard Unger talking to me when he looked at my
fingerprints during my first palm reading with him.  "You're asked to
build something for the world."

<p>"I knew you would say something like that!"</p>

<p>Wende suggested that I have latched onto those last four as proof that
I am supposed to do something big, but that I don't see the bigness of
the things I'm already doing.  Like my work in YRUU.  Five years in a
fantastic organization, helping to support as best I could,
affectiving the lives hundreds of youth in hopefully the best way
possible.</p>

<p>"But he said 'show them blueprints'"</p>

<p>As in, I am supposed to design it from nothing.</p>

<p>What if I write a book?  What is my
big issue with doing that?  Certainly I've written enough to fill a
book, but I doubly certainly don't think it would be interesting to
enough people to make it saleable.</p>

<p>That part of me that I describe as Aires slash A+ blood type slash
perfectionist needs it to be the number one surprising hit of the
century, like Eminem exploding onto the scene, sweeping all the number
one spots with his own wack style.</p>

<p>Eminem.</p>

<p>Now there's a cat that I look up to because he had some focus.  He
knew he wasn't perfect, but he was damn determined to be the best at
his thing.  And he did it.  Good job.  Big props.  Big fame, and maybe
a few dollars along with it.  But he fucking did what he set out to
do.  It seems.</p>

<p>Lee Hirsch, who I just met...  He had a big project in mind and
spent 10 years working on it, against lots of adversity and it cost
him a million dollars, but now... it's done.  he did it.  Kick
ass.</p>

<p>"What has the gene pool gained by having a guy float around and
decided what's not good enough to do?"</p>

<p>"The good thing is, when you finally settle down on a project for,
say, 2 years," (laughter from the audience), "it will be a fine
project."</p>

<p>"So your job right now is just to be open, to be looking for your
project, and to discern carefully the different messages you'll receive
to listen for the right one" (I just made that last part up)</p>

<p>In a way, I am looking for that project now.  In a way, that search
is the reason I broke up with Wende.  I often wonder what our life
could be like, but I know beyond all that I would wonder MORE what my
life could be like if I had stayed wit her.  (sorry for dangling /
misplaced language)</p>

<p>I certainly don't want to repeat the same difficult thing of
breaking up with a fiance.  That shit <em>sucked</em> </p>

<p>So I want to make it worthwhile to have broken up with her.  I want
to be settled in myself before I get engaged again.  I want to trust
myself before asking another to trust me.</p>

<p>I want to feel worthy of a relationship.  ...  wow.</p>

<p>that one is huge, buried all the way down here...  I seem to think
I'm not worthy of being loved, even after my friends and girlfriends
have said I am, some of them specificall during a two-person
conversation around this topic.</p>

<p>I have this PROJECT tied to my feeling os self worth.. and I know
in my mind my worth is not dependant on this project, even if my
pereceived self worth is.</p>

<p>I basically know from experience that no matter what project I do,
it won't actually change my perceived self worth.</p>

<p>SO.</p>

<p>What does *that* mean?  How did I get to this thought anyway?</p>

<p>Oh yeah... finish a project before I am worthy of a relationship.
That one.</p>

<p>Sometimes I get the next thought, "what if the
relationship <em>is</em> the project?" ..  but I quickly dismiss it as
absurd, as I can't imagine a way a couple-ship could positively affect
the world.  I can see how two people can affect the wordl. but not
because they are a couple.</p>

<p>But damn.. wouldn't that be smooth?  They loved each other so much
that it <em>made the world better.</em> </p>

<p>(insert several minutes of writingless reflection here)</p>

<p class="date">4:01pm</p>

<p>Allllll of this writing started when I got an email from Hitomi
today suggesting that I could be approaching relationships in a better
way.  And life onboard the ship in a more meditative way.  I thought,
"ah, fuckoff," but I wondered just what it would be like to _meditate_
on the ship.  Or in a park.</p>

<p>So, what will I do when I'm feeling angsty on the ship.  Angsty and
tired and horny, uncontrollably antsy?</p>

<p>sleep?  meditate?  sleep?  go chew on some cutie?</p>

<p>Better yet, how do I keep from getting to that unstable state?
Meditate?  sleep?  Forge friendships with people I won't be tempted to
chew on?  Actually plan some curriculums and work for a living?</p>

<p>Of utmost concern, as of yesterday, I switched from hots-for-Rei to
hots-for-Saki, the non-CC woman who was in our group yesterday.  She
seems stable, seems to like me, seems like she knows some stuff about
meditation,...  apparently is a massage therapist and accupuncturist
and shiatsu-ist, all things that I am interested in checking out to
see if I want to become proficient in them.</p>

<p><em>Hmmmm.. maybe she could shiatsu me and it would lead to some
chewing and</em>... oh my gosh what I conflucgupulation that would be.
She doesn't speak English well, so we have said that we'll trade
language for shiatsu.  Can we keep it professional?  Can <b>I</b> keep
it professional?</p>

<p>I have *got* to talk to Rei (*) slash Kentaro slash Maruan slash
Tony slash Carl slash Dan slash someone about this.</p>

<p>(*) Yes, she does know about my shit, and has offered to be a
listening ear.</p>

<p>I think that brings me to completion on this topic. I just want to
own that I'm in concerned about repeating the same thing as before
(finding and chewing on the next girl), but also own the golden shadow
that I am getting better.  I told Rei before too late: no broken
hearts needed.  I haven't told Saki, but we haven't *done* anything
yet.</p>

<p>Actually, shit, we have - we've hugged, which for Japanese culture
is a pretty forward thing to do on such short notice.</p>

<p>I have been upfront with people about it.  "I kiss and run," and K
said that wasn't good enough, or ..  that doesn't make it okay to do
the behavior anyway, "well I <em>told</em> you I kiss and run".  I need to not
kiss, or not run.</p>

<p>or find a balance. kiss and walk away.</p>

<p>or hug and run.  </p>

<p>now I'm just being silly.</p>

<p>So, Saki.</p>

<p>I have kissed and run.  I want to stop that pattern.  Stop smiling
at me like that.</p>

<p>I can't change the other perosn.  How can I change myself?</p>

<p>Rob, stop being affected by her smile.  Stop wondering if she is
the one and wondering if I'll overcome all odds to cross the language
gap and both of us become bilinguagal - fuckiit - tri - quad lingual.
We've got *nothing* right now.  Except an unwritten future as
individuals on the same ship, and in April, on the same island called
Japan.</p>

<p>My want is that I look back on this voyage with pride, so right
now, I need to act in ways that I am proud of.</p>

<p>I'm Rob Nugen, Thunder Rabbit.  And I'm in.</p>

<p>Ho.  (4:31pm)</p>

<p>ps: I'm incredibly thankful for my computer battery to have lasted
through this entire blabbering composition.  It went from 98 to 62
percent in 2 hours.  Pretty darn good, especially if it actually has
two more hours to go.</p>

<p class="date">5:01pm ART Monday 13 February 2006</p>

<p>I considered variants of ways to get this online, but I chose not
to pursue it relentlessly.  I felt strange asking the girl in the
Sheraton business center if she'd let me use their internet 
<em>again</em> after I had already.  (That's how I uploaded all the
past month worth of entries (month??) and renamed my Rob Update
mailer.  She was like, "what's yer room number?" and I told her I
wasn't actually staying there, and she said, "well I have to ask you
to keep it to fifteen minutes.")</p>
