<p>I had Petra's classes for Guest Teacher Day, and I am SO happy to have
my own classes back tomorrow (actually the day after, cause tomorrow
is a day off).  For her first class, especially, I was
like, <em>yikes stripes!</em> because I like my class so much better!</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing my Fantastic Rabbits tomorrow.  I love
them all so much!</p>
