<p>Despite the "very clear" message from the Runes, I haven't gotten
closure with anything before stepping into something(?) with º¸µ®,
although I have been slowly backing away from interest in doing
anything interesting with her.</p>

<p>I helped her with some English today, although it seems she is
more interested in the idea of knowing English than actually studying.
I totally understand that, and am maybe projecting my own feeling onto
her.</p>

<p>Today classes were held again for the first time since Rio;
Fighting Goats played the game they wrote last time and Fantastic
Rabbits basically worked on Peach Boy, an adaptation of a play they
want to do.  It looks like they will be able to get something done,
though I don't know how well it will turn out.</p>

<p>I wrote a bit in Japanese today and Hime checked it; Akane was
supposed to but she felt sick about 30 minutes before our lesson and
chose to go sleep.</p>

<p>Just after 2pm I went up to Yacht Club to study and I found Kiichi,
my Staff GET student there.  I had totally forgotten about our 2pm
lesson, but just magically luckily got there close enough to the time
to make it look like I had not forgotten, and not even late enough to
make an issue of it.  Woah.  Thank you, angels.</p>

<p>I need to get cracking on my Palestine presentation.</p>

<p>Except that tonight is the night ¤ê¤¨ gets to shave chests: mine,
Carl's, and Phil's, I have told people I am done for the night.  I
want to take a nap now.</p>
