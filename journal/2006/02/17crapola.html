<p>Fuck.  Crap.  Shit.  What a depressing way to end a day.  I have
just spent four and one half hours taking apart and putting back
together the camera that I fucked up with sand in Namibia.  Now it's
more fucked up than it was before: the lens or light detector or some
critically important shit is fucked up and it can't see anything at
all.  Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p>I downloaded the pictures that it took; given that they are not
all the same slash exactly black, I know it's on the light-gathering
end of things that it's fucked up.  That's the part about which I
know the least.  Argh; dammit.</p>

<p>We'll be in Ushuaia in a few hours.  I could have used this time to
write emails or postcards, but I was hoping to get the camera fixed.
Now I've got nothing but a tired brain and a whiney journal entry.</p>

<p>Shitballs.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  I take it back, a little bit.  I tried again and got a bit
of an image that changed when I flexed the camera a little bit.  Now
I think the problem is with the backend, which will be far easier to
diagnose and fix than the front end.  And I have a 90% sureity that I
know what is the problem.</p>

<p>But right now I'm going to sleeeeeeep.</p>
