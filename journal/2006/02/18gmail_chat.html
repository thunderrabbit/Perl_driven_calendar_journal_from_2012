<p>Gmail jumped from a gig to 2 gigs on their first birthday.  The
gigs have been ticking upward so they're at 2.696 gigs now.</p>

<p>I wondered what they would do next.</p>

<p>What they did is absolutely, just, utterly...</p>

<p>fantastic.</p>

<p>gmail now has chat.</p>

<p>And it's not just chat.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It automatically saves chats with the date, the person's name
(not their userid, but the name I use to remember them by), and the
number of lines.</p></li>

<li><p>The chats become like gmail messages, fully searchable and
instantly accessible.</p></li>

<li><p>Or it *doesn't* save the chats, depending on the users'
preferences. (each pair of users decide together, and gmail remembers
from then on)</p></li>

<li><p>It just works.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>The interface is simple.</p></li>

<li><p>It requires no download.</p></li>

<li><p>If one person writes two lines before the other responds, they
are labeled only once.</p></li>

<li><p>I can chat in a new window or in the same gmail browser window</p></li>

<li><p>I can switch a chat back and forth between the same gmail
window and a separate window.</p>

<p>Without connecting to the internet.</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>The chat-enabled gmail interface cleanly checks for an
internet connection at slower and slower intervals until it checks
once every 3 minutes (with the option to 'Try now').  No more 404s
when the page tries to refresh.</p></li>

<li><p>It cleanly handles disconnects (*)</p></li>

<blockquote><p>(*) I'm offline now and tried to chat with Fred in the window
that's still available.  I wrote something like, "I'll be impressed
but not actually surprised if this message is queued and sent
later."</p>

<p>It didn't seen to queue the message for later, but did inform me in
noticible red text that the message was not sent.</p>

<p>It wrote "Fred did not receive your chat." though his name is Fred
Nugen on the title, it knew to just be casual and use his first name
for the message.</p>

<p>Though I'm still not connected, I can still pop the window into
and out of the main window, and it keeps track of the number of messages
Fred didn't receive.</p></blockquote>

<li><p>It's magic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My god this makes me happy for the future of the internet.</p>
