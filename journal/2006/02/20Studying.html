<p>Studied Japanese with Akane for about 2.5 hours, then spent about
15+ minutes chattering in English about ways she can keep practicing
English when she gets back to Tokyo.  Don't go to an 英会話, but look
for some English speakers with shared interests.  Look in Metropolis
Magazine; go to The Pink Cow.</p>

<p>Then I learned she didn't have a web based email address, so I
encouraged her to go for the googlemail option, or at minimum to
check it along with checking out some others.</p>

<p>While we were talking, さき came over and in the form of cookies,
apologized for having forgotten our 2pm meeting yesterday.</p>
