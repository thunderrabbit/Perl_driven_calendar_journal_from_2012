<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I am on PBs 52nd Global Voyage, basically hitting Africa and
South America.  Tomorrow we will be in Valparaiso, Chile.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really kissed anyone on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>I officially haven't spent any money on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really planned lessons in several days.  Part of me
is concerned that I'll be called a bad teacher, but the students seem
to be happy, and doing what they want to do.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been talking to Saki, the passenger who is an
accupuncturist.  She's going to accupuncture me at 4pm today.  I think
it would be quite beneficial to keep it strictly professional, though
part of me has designs on other options.</p></li>

<li><p>玲 invited me to have a brownie in Hemingway, though I haven't
taken her up on it yet.  We've got it planned for tonight at 8 or
after Valparaiso.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't worked on my port orientation for Rapa Nui yet.  I've
got initial data collection done, but not sifted through it.</p></li>

<li><p>Gmail has chat, but I haven't used it past sending Fred a few
lines for which I have not seen his response.</p></li>

<li><p>We GET Ts did our crazy dance last night.  It turned out
pretty well.</p></li>

<li><p>Just today Maruan and I finished a game of DOTS that is the
background for a 52 TIMES newspaper title image.</p></li>

<li><p>Seeing DOTS written in all uppercase gives me a なつかしfeeling
for the game I wrote in Pascal in 1990.  I'd like to write a version
for the web.  I'd like to write a version that has a computer
player.</p></li>

<li><p>I've transcribed 4 songs for Danny, the waiter upstairs.  I'm
going to work on some more now.</p></li>
