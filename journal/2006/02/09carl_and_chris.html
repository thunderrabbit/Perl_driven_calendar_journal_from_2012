<p>My roommate Carl's brother, Chris, is onboard as a guest speaker
for a few days.  He knows a lot about USAID, especially as it relates
to Iraq.  Today is his first full day onboard, his first lecture, and
his birthday (Dan and I shared his big piece of cake in Topaz Dining
as he had to leave for the lecture).  I fell asleep during the
lecture, but people asked some good (but long) questions at the
end.</p>
