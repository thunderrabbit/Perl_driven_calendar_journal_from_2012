<p>Watched _The Corporation_, a 3 hour documentary that talked about
the history of corporations, how corporations have the rights of
people but not the souls of people, how corporations are legally bound
to watch their bottom lines, and how people have been able to fight
corporations into doing something closer to the right thing.</p>

<p>It talked about sustainability, and suggested that basically no
corporations are sustainable.  They are plundering the earth of its
natural resources: minerals, plants, animals (including humans), all
in search of the might profit.</p>

<p>I wonder how sustainable my life is.</p>
