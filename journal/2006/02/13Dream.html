<p class="dream">Leaning over the rail in the back of the boat, we
were going super slowly through super clear water; I could see all the
way to the ocean bottom, which was about 20 feet.  I had my gilligan
hat and used it to scoop up water.  I briefly let it go to see where
the water would take it, and it seemed to be pushed toward the ship
and down into the water.  This seemed a bit strange, but happened each
time I tried it, so I guessed the effect must be real.</p>

<p class="dream">During my experimentation, I thought it would be
quite detrimental if I fell into the water, so I put on a life jacket
to give myself some chance at survival should that occur.</p>

<p class="dream">Joel came out and saw how much fun I was having and
decided he wanted to go swimming.  He began to strip off his clothes,
but someone quickly stopped him, saying he could be fired if he
intentionally went swimming off the back of the boat, or if he
stripped naked.  He agreed that wouldn't be so good for his career so
he just stood wearing swim trunks in the ankle deep water and told
jokes. </p>
