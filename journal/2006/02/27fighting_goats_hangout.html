<p>Hung out with Fighting Goats (not including Eye, who is on a tour)
in Ann's room tonight after she said her roommates were all out for
the next few days.  We may have class in her room on the day after
tomorrow.  We would do it tomorrow, save that it's Guest Teacher Day,
and I don't want any other teacher to have such an easy class.</p>

<p>We shared stories about the craziest things we've done, and I told
them in bad Japanese about the time I jumped my dad's truck over the
railroad tracks.  Also how I used to be barefoot all the time and how
I ended up in Japan.  I wanted to use Japanese to show them it can be
done, and I can have crappy Japanese and still get the point across
and still ask for help if I need it, etc.</p>

<p>Also calculated their next 500-day increment celebrations.  Some
of them will be 10000 days old soon.  Ann just turned 10000 about 200
days ago, I think.</p>

<p>I hope classes with them are are more talkative and relaxed from
now on.</p>
