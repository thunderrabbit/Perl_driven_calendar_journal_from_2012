<p>Carl taught my classes today; I missed them!  Both my Fantastic
Rabbits and my Fighting Goats.  Maybe we'll have a party tomorrow
night in Ann's room, plus have class there tomorrow.  I'll ask her if
they have made such a plan.  Turns out two of them slept over in her
room last night after our party finished.  Rumor has it they were up
to 3am!</p>

<p>Carl was like, "holy shit!" when he rocked into Fantastic Rabbits
with a plan and they were like, "booyah!" and told him what the hell
was up, directing / creating Peach Boy play.  I love my Fantastic
Rabbits!</p>
