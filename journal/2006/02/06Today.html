<p>Teaching kept me pretty busy today (two classes plus Super Beginner
and Beginner opens, with Kentaro as CC because Misato lost her voice
overnight), and then preparations for All Japanese Day plus All
Silent/English Day had me even more busy, and then lesson with Akane
(turned into a small discussion during my camera repair workshop) and
then helping fold and staple the Survival Spanish / Portuguese guide
that we'll sell for 500 yen to those who have five dollars worth of
desire for a copy.</p>

<p>Dinner was in Topaz, sitting between Pepe on my left and Carla on
my right, Kellie, Petra, and Isabel across from us.</p>

<p>I've got to prepare for Intermediate and Advanced opens for
tomorrow with Chieko, but I'm too tired to do it now, so I'm going to
sleep for 4 hours, right through the timezone change, wake up at 2am,
write it and put a copy under Chieko's door.</p>
