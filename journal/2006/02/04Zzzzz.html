<p>Today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I studied a lot of Japanese with Akane and separately with Mami
(who calls herself Hime).  Getting into some new grammars.</p></li>

<li><p>We played dodge ball today in the sports deck.  Good fun.
It was quite warm today, and we ran around and sweat a lot.</p></li>

<li><p>No GET Meeting.  Yay!</p></li>

<li><p>Hung out with Rei for the first time since Namibia on her
10,500th day.  We talked about dodge ball and the southern
cross.</p></li>

<li><p>Summer festival was on top deck.  I skipped most of it, but
watched a bit of the movie "Waterboy," a terrible Japanese comedy
about 5 teenage boys who overcome all odds to become synchronized
swimmers.  All the characters were portraits of idiocy.</p></li>

<li><p>I showed people my short Japanese story of the time I almost
fell while running with traffic.  Everyone who read it seemed to
enjoy it.  I may transcribe it.</p></li>

<li><p>We played Family Feud in Theater today from 2:30 to 3:30.
Super kudos to Carla and Laura for all their work setting it up.  I
got to introduce the game and be the answer announcer.</p></li>

<li><p>I felt a bit uncomfortable when Hime offered to teach me
Japanese.  She is quite attractive, and when I was feeling tired, my
brain started to wander.  She is quite touchy feely, and I get
memories slash vibes of Kuni from 49th voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I missed a cool shooting star that Rei saw.  We both missed an
amazing shooting star, its worth based on peoples' reactions.</p></li>

<li><p>We gained an extra hour.  We are now 9 hours behind
Japan.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm really tired.  Today was a case of having a 25 hour day and
using the extra hour to become more tired instead of getting an extra
hour of sleep.</p>
