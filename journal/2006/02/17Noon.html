<p>Just chowed in Yacht Club after teaching from 8am to 12:20pm.  Same
as yesterday: Fighting Goats, Fantastic Rabbits, Intermediate then
Advanced opens.</p>

<p>The opens were not as awesome as I had hoped; we had a good
language point, but not a good reason to use it.  The point was
describing people, but there wasn't much supporting dialogue around
it.  I think the students still got something out of it.  Definitely
more than last time I did a similar lesson.</p>

<p>During lunch, I saw º¸µ® sitting with some peeps and then saw her
sitting with another guy; I was intrigued by my feeling of jealousy.
Where does that come from?</p>

<p>In a couple minutes I have to go back to Yacht Club to meet
Kiichi, my Staff GET student.</p>
