<p>Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm</p>

<p>Just watched the latter 3/4ths of <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>,
from the point that he plays the music over the entire prison
intercom system.</p>

<p>Today wasn't <em>exactly</em> productive, but I chatted with Carla
a few times, and noticed that I've been desiring a
couple-relationship with a woman to act as a stable rock in my life,
but I could use (any of) the GET Ts as a friendship relationship
stable rock in my life.   hmmm.</p>

<p>I'm jealous of Maruan + Kyoko and Stacy + Yuki.</p>

<p>Today was the day some people said we  were "in a river," which is
true, if, by "river," they mean a body of water 150 miles wide.
After much debate, I've accepted that we are in an estuary, but *not*
a river.</p>

<p>The ship isn't going all that quickly, but occassionally is like
grruuguguggguguggggg, shaking as if it's going quickly, or getting
some sort of turbulence (from the bottom) or something.</p>

<p>Today was the day my newspaper title image wasn't accepted on first
submission (it was my fourth one, and I spent quite little time on it,
relatively speaking: just outlined words written 4 times in
highlighter.</p>

<p>I took it back and drew dots all over it, outside the highlighter
lettering.</p>

<p>Also felt rather frisky today, and therefore enjoyed the attention
from д╥дс and sorta hugged on Laura and Karen and Carla.</p>

<p>Tonight was the night I chatted with tall beautiful Sabrina in
reception before going to Sunshine Bar to hang out with peeps up
there.  Also, several big ships sailed <em>right</em> by us in a
surprisingly close manner... Carla and I were under the Sunshine Bar
awning for a few ships' passing, but then went to the rail and watched
lights, talked about stuff, and waved at three guys on a tanker that
sailed right by, as the others had.</p>
