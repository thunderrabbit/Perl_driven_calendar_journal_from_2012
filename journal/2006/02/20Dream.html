<p class="dream">In a labrynthian hotel slash school I needed to go
number 2, but I wasn't able to find a bathroom without people all
around.  I walked through a multi-level bathing area with streams of
water and baths, looking for the toilets, but didn't find them.</p>

<p class="dream">Down a hallway around another corner I found Petra
talking to some of her friends.  She wanted to talk to me about
something so I was like, "walk with me to a bathrom as we talk" and
we found one shortly, but she wasn't done with her story so we walked
a bit further into a scary dark construction area of the hotel and a
water guy was just zipping up his pants as he came back to his post
by the door and we stood nearby and talked, but then heard a voice
coming from behind me in this cupboard, from underneath some plastic,
accusing me, "why did you do this to me, Rob?"</p>

<p class="dream">I was scared shitless and disclaimed any wrongdoing,
"I just cloned you; it wasn't my fault!" and ran with Petra back down
to the restroom we had seen and I pulled her inside and into the
shower behind the curtain while I sat down to take care of business.
I locked the door, but it was glass and I was totally afraid the
monster clone girl would come get me.</p>

<p>So scary!!</p>
