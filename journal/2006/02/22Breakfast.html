<p>I have eaten breakfast in Yacht Club basically every day of the
voyage.  E In general, I have been getting way more sleep than I did
on the 49th.</p>

<p>Yacht Club has the same breakfast buffet each day: granola cheese
slices, salami slices, various breads (raisin bread, raisin cinnomin
twists, sometimes croissants, sometimes corn flour sugar rolls)
jelly, butter, orange juice, yogurt.</p>

<p>I usually get granola, a couple rolls, strawberry jelly, two or
three (small) glasses of orange juice, and yogurt.  Mix the jelly with
the plain yogurt, mix that with the granola, chow.</p>
