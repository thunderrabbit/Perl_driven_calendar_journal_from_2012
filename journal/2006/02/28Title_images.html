<p>I have drawn 7 title images that have not yet been used in the
daily paper.  I went and asked for two more blank sheets and Erika (*)
was like, "we have many of your title images so we might not be able
to use them all," and I was like, "oh!" and "then I won't do
anymore," being careful to check my vibe: prefering <em>I don't want
to waste time / put you in a position of having to choose</em>
over <em>fine, fuck you then; I won't do any more.</em></p>

<p>(*) one of my shy students, so I was really happy that she spoke up.</p>
