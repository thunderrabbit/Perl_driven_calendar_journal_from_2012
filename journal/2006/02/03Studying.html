<p>Most of my free time has been spent studying.  We've just been
formally introduced to our Japanese teachers, all various passengers
who have volunteered to spend some time teaching.  Many of them are in
turn GET students, though none of us are being taught by our own
students.</p>

<p>My teacher is あかね, who does not use kanji in her name.  The
first time we met was at Chat With; she was super chatty and had lots
to talk about.  She went straight to work on calculating my age when I
gave her my days old, and later I told her I would try to choose her
when we got the chance to choose our Japanese teachers.</p>

<p>The first time I told her that I had, in fact, been able to select
her, she used a lot lot lot of English, and I was like, <em>oh
shit</em> because that certainly won't help me learn Japanese.   But,
the first time we actually met 'formally,' I was like, 
日本語だけいいですか and she switched immediately to all Japanese
with very few slips into English.</p>

<p>AND, even better, she has said she'd like to meet every day, which
is just fine for me.</p>
