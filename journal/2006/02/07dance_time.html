<p>Took a lot lot lot of pictures with Kellie's camera during the
performance tonight.  Luckily, I switched sides of the ship and got
some good pictures of Rei during the beginning of the samba
performance.  If that rockin' marchin' music is samba, then I really
like samba more than I ever thought before.</p>

<p>Big props to AfroReggae, the band featured in the movie we watched
today.  We're going to go see them live tomorrow!!  wow wow wow!!</p>
