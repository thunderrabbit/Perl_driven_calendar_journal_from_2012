<p>The last couple days (couple?) seems like they've been really
busy; I've hardly had a moment to write.  Primarily, my free time has
been given to studying Japanese, and the recent push to disassemble,
clean, and assemble Hitomi's camera.</p>

<p>There are several things that I'd like to do before we arrive in
Rio tomorrow, starting with setting my clock to the correct time
after our timezone change last night.</p>

<p class="date">2:33pm BRST Tuesday 07 February 2006</p>

<p>Things to do "today":</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>* get my curriculums caught up</p></li>

<li><p>plan a time to work on Opens curriculums</p></li>

<li><p>*? write a Rob Update</p></li>

<li><p>transcribe the Japanese diary that I've written over the past
few days</p></li>

<li><p>update my old journal entries to embed photos from the first
month of the voyage</p></li>

<li><p>* dump pictures onto my computer</p></li>

<li><p>label pictures to be uploaded tomorrow in port</p></li>

<li><p>* write an email to Hitomi</p></li>

<li><p>* write emails to other people who have emailed me</p></li>

<li><p>write postcards to CDF, perhaps with Akane's help in
Japanese</p></li>

<li><p>* Go to a lecture at 5:30, a movie at 6:30, dinner at 7:30, a
performance thing starting at 8:30.</p></li>

before yesterday and yesterday.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Update on Hitomi's camera: it doesn't focus, and now the battery
won't come out.  I don't know what I did to cause that.  Fuck; it's
getting worse, and I don't really want to buy a new one.</p>
