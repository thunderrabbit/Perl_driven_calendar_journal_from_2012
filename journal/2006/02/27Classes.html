<p>Fighting Goats was like Pulling Teeth today, but we'll probably
have a good time tonight in Ann's room for a roommates-are-away party.
She wrote in the class diary that we should come over anytime before
Rapa Nui, so I took that as a big hint and suggested we have a party
there tonight.</p>

<p>Fantastic Rabbits worked on Peach Boy; we have basically nailed
down everything, we have all the lines, almost all the pictures, and
I'll make sure they can finish the last few pictures tomorrow.  Just
gotta have Carl bring a tripod into class so they can get some stable
photos.</p>
