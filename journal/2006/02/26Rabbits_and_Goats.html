<p>Just finished Fantastic Rabbits class; they mostly worked on their
Peach Boy play the entire time.  We basically had two groups going:
Alice and Kelly working on sorting pictures, then Angelina, Michelle,
and Carol asking Angelina about her trip.  George is on his own tour
now; he'll join us in Rapa Nui.</p>

<p>Fighting Goats was a more challenging class; basically I had them
asking questions about Sugar's overland tour, and I transcribed slash
edited their questions and her responses into basically natural
English.  They ran out of questions after a while and I focused on
some of the grammar points with which they had had trouble.</p>

<p>I think/hope they were happy.  They seemed to be, and when I asked
them, they said they were.</p>
