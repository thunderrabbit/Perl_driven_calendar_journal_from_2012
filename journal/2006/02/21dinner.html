<p>I invited º¸µ® to dinner tonight but she declined.  Happened to
sit near Îè but at a different table.  We happened to both get up at
the same time and I left and she sat where I had been sitting, and
talked to peeps who were there.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel so inept at conversation, so engrossed in my own
thoughts, so me-centric that it's just embarassingly disabling in
normal life just to have a fucking conversation.  Why can't I just
relax and talk to people about things?</p>
