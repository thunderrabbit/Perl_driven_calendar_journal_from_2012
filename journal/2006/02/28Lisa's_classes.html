<p>Lisa's classes were not the problem I thought they would be.  I
could even imagine teaching them again, and would actually prefer one
of her classes over one of mine.  (WTF is <em>that</em> about?)</p>

<p>One of her classes featured three students, who arrived on time, 3
minutes late, and 6 minutes late, respectively.  I told them I felt
bad for Lisa because it's so hard to have to start over a class for
each new student who comes in.  I asked them "do you like Lisa?" and
they were like, "yes" so I suggested they come on time to class
tomorrow.  They all seemed interested in doing that.  I wonder if
she'll notice.</p>
