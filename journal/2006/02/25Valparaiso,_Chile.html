<pre>Greetings from Valparaiso!

During this voyage, as opposed to the northern hemisphere one (May - Aug 2005), I
have done very little planning before each port.  On that voyage, I pretty much had
a decent idea of what each port was like, or a bit about its history, or some
such.. but this voyage I have just gotten off the ship with a plan to wander
around.

It's generally worked pretty well, and has worked well again today.  I tagged along
with some students de Pepe y Isabel's clases de espanol; we took a train to Vina
del Mar, and then a bus further north along the coast to a seafood restaurant that
was completely drenched in all things nautical, focusing on the fishing industry. 
Wooden carvings of fish augmented the nets, bouys, compasses, barometers, ropes,
bottles, cages, and countless things I couldn't even name even if I could remember
what they were!

The orange juice was freshly squeezed and full of pulp.  The fish fell off the
bones in delicious chunks.  The semi-minced shrimp with mayonnaise dressing was...
interesting.

Right now I'm in the port terminal, uploading pictures taken between Capetown and
Ushuaia.  If you want to check them out, visit this URL:
