<p>I don't know if I'm going on a 2 person date with Hime, but I told
her I would meet her for dinner; she said she was feeling bad and was
considering leaving the voyage in Tahiti.</p>

<p class="date">9:33pm CLST Tuesday 28 February 2006</p>

<p>Just got back from our dinner (where we sat across from two old men
who complained quietly yet rudely about the food) and chillin' out on
the front deck (where we determined my 13500th day will be 11 March
2007 (which didn't ring any bells though I've done the calculation N
times already, so either it's wrong, or my bells are broken) and her
8500th day to be 2 May 2006) while the sun took its sweet time to set
at 9:15 (though we didn't stay out that long).</p>
