<p class="date">9:38pm ART Sunday 19 February 2006</p>

<p>Today has been pretty chill, both temperaturally and schedually.
We have been sailing through fiords all day, and people have braved
the cold to take pics and scope rainbows and waterfalls of glacier
melt.</p>

<p>We received our 007 assignments; we are playing two concurrent
games of assassin: one with just GET Teachers, and one open to the
entire ship.  For the GET Teacher game, I am supposed to kill Isabel
in the spa with a daily schedule.  I assume by "spa," it means "hot
tub."  Even so, I've never seen her in the spa, it's far too cold for
*anyone* to be in the spa, AND the spa is closed.</p>

<p>Maruan thinks it's good enough if she is just touching the steps.
I don't expect to be able to kill her, esp. considering I almost
never talk to her.</p>

<p>My other one will be easier: Matt in Windjammer with a daily
schedule.</p>

<p>Are they both daily schedules?  Hmm.  Maybe I'm supposed to kill
Isabel with a spoon.</p>

<p>Saki stood me up today at 2pm.  I've seen her in passing since
then, but she didn't say anything.  I haven't seen her closely enough
to be sure she's seen me or to call her on it.  Dudn't really matter,
though; off the list is off the list.</p>

<p>Carla asked if I can get pics off her camera today, so we scheduled
a time, she came over and ended up falling asleep on Carl's bed in
like 2 minutes, so I just continued working on my iPhoto updater code
until time for GET Meeting, which ended up being cancelled.</p>

<p>We did the camera thing then, but my computer was being stupid and
was taking FAR too long to get its shit straight and just grab the
pics.  Like "this sucks" slow.  Ripped the USB out and did it on
Maruan's computer in about 4 minutes.</p>

<p>But the good thing is I finished my iPhoto cleanup code.</p>
