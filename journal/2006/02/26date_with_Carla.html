<p>Went to dinner with Carla tonight; we got our own table and
enjoyed chatting about the cruise and GET Team.  I asked how her
experience has differed from her pre-cruise thoughts, and she said
it's like she's a teacher on a cruise ship, and not on PB.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Yes; I can see that.</p>

<p>We wondered if it could be helped or changed or what.</p>
