<p>Rei and I will be meeting for dinner in Yacht Club at 5:30.</p>

<p class="date">6pm</p>

<p>She didn't actually eat since she had just eaten, but we chatted
some.  She was busy writing a postcard, though took some time out to
talk to me, and then to Rie who came up.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if I'm just a bother.</p>
