<p>Wow!  The PB is next to Regal Princess <em>again</em>!  We left
about 5 or 6 hours after they left Ushuaia, but 
from the stacking of the ropes, it is apparent we arrived in
Valparaiso *first*.</p>

<p>I imagine, because I (guess) they plan these things pretty
carefully, their ship will leave first, given their ropes are hooked
on top of ours on the pilings.</p>

<p>On a train now with Rie and her Spanish class peeps, trying to
speak a bit of Spanish.  Getting out of the port, I was told I
couldn't bring food out... I had made a little lunch box from food
from Yacht Club, but they were like, "oh but now.."</p>

<p>Ooops.. I forgot this is a tight port like that. I hope PB doesn't
get in trouble.  I hope *I* don't get in trouble.</p>

<p>Right now we are chillin' with Soledad, a woman who patiently
answered all our questions about the area and was interested in
learning a bit of Japanese.</p>

<p>She's telling us about cool restaurants to check out in the area.</p>

<p class="date">11:47am ART Friday 24 February 2006</p>

<p>Despite Soledad's suggestion to walk along the northern coast of
the city, we went to Wulff Castle, which has awesome wave action
pouring between the main building and a tower thing.  I could just sit
and watch it for hours, like in Costa Rica that time back in the
day.</p>

<p>The castle is free to visit, and sports artwork on the walls, and
lovely views of the nearby beach.</p>

<p>The castle looks rather new, but is in an old location; I saw an
abandoned staircase cut into some rocks; about 8 steps remain, but
the rest have been taken by the sea.</p>

<p>We (me, Rie, Ryo, Mieko, Koko, and Toyo (who are all from the same
Spanish class on PB)) are in a restaurant in Vina del Mar (perhaps (I
haven't been in charge of navigation, even a little bit)), overlooking
a beach with horses we may ride later.</p>

<p class="date">6:41pm ART Friday 24 February 2006</p>

<p>Back in the port terminal, plugged in electrically but not
internetally.</p>

<p>Pretty much had fun today, riding horses along the beach; mine
(Simone, or something like that) was keen to stay out of the surf,
even in the shallowest bits.  Afterward, we took a few minutes to look
for Koko who seemed to have disappeared, but she was fine, across the
street where the rest of my group had started to look, and not along
the beach, where a guy had told me she went.</p>

<p>The train line along the coast is modern and clean, with a
decently short wait time.  It doesn't have the hoity toitiness of
Singapore, but seemed somehow friendlier.  Perhaps it was because we
talk to people to get tickets, instead of machines that can't make
change of more than like a dollar.</p>
