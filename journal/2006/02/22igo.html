<p>Rie bought me a drink in Sports Bar, and I suggested we go play
Igo.  She totally dominated the game, but she says I did better.  I
felt really amazed at how she could start from the same simple setup
and destroy me, while I could start from the same simple setup and not
kill her territory.  In so few moves, too.  Each time I was like,
"what happened????"  It was like I need to draw a picture and write
down each exact move and see what differed.  It was really weird,
actually.  Even she had a hard time seeing what we did differently:
why she did so incredibly well compared to me.</p>
