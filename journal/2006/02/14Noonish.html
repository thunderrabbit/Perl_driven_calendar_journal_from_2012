<p class="date">1:55pm ART Tuesday 14 February 2006</p>

<p>Today has been a day off for us.  I was the only GET who showed up
for the Meet The Guests thing, and I was late to that.  Been working
a bit on curriculum for open lessons for tomorrow and the next day.
I am supposed to do two more Intermediate/Advanced lessons.  I may or
may not do the one I planned for tomorrow; my days to do it are the
day after tomorrow and the day after that.</p>

<p>Today several people are wearing numbers.  If two people each
choose each others' numbers, then they will be announced as
Valentine's Day matches tonight between 11pm and 1am at some event on
top deck.  I haven't decided who I would even choose if I saw their
number, but we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>I finished 2.5 title images for the daily paper today.</p>
