<p>My chest is shaved.  Carl's has some bald patches where they used
wax to rip hair out.  Phil has the kanji for love shaved into his
hair.</p>

<p>At Phil's suggestion, I have shaved except for my moustache.  I
remind myself of some of my gay friends back in Houston.</p>

<p>At my own suggestion, I shaved my head (actually buzzed, not
shaved).  Thanks to Dan for cleaning up a couple of missed spots.</p>

<p>As Carl was lounged on his bed, rubbing aloe vera onto his chest,
he said, "man Rob, you look so weird right now."</p>
