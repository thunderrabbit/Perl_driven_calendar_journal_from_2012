<p>Tonight is the night Maruan, Dan and I played Texas Hold'em poker
(Dan and I had never played before.)  Picasso joined us; he also had
never played.  Maruan won, then Picasso won.  We were using chips as
money, and all were the same value.</p>

<p>Afterward, I tried to kill Matt in Windjammer, but he wouldn't go
in.  Then I sat with Erika for a bit, and then helped a girl named
Akane with a diablo (yoyo thing) that Kim CH is so good at.  I spent
over an hour, and it was frustrating at first, but she really did well
by the end.  She was correcting mistakes on her own, and I was pretty
damn happy.</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep here.</p>
