<p>Today several of the GET Ts are only allowed to speak Japanese
between 9am and 6pm.  I got an early start and felt pretty good with
it, but then I got trapped by an old cat who I think meant well, but
was just blabbering on about stuff that I could just understand the
topic, but not the details... he was talking about 新しい vs 新たに
which have the same meaning, but were used at different periods of
Japanese history, I think.  He was telling me that I should ask people
what was the difference between these two words and that no one would
really know and that I should find that interesting, and he proceeded
to flag people down and ask them as if I wanted to know and I couldn't
gracefully duck out; god it was just a mess for a while.</p>

<p>I did escape after a bit and was nearly bummed out enough to *not*
play dodgeball with a lot of dodgeball playin' peeps, but when Petra
was like, "where ya going?" (in Japanese), I explained that I didn't
want to play cause I was wearing my glasses and my back hurt blah
blah, and I realized I was relishing being in a victim role, so I cut
that shit out, went and put on my contacts and played.</p>

<p>My back still does hurt, but not terribly.</p>

<p>So far I have collected about 9 smiley faces and 0 Xs on all
Japanese day.  In a bit, to take care of myself, I'm going to create
some art, specifically for the daily paper, which always has an
artistic title image on the front top page.</p>

<p>I got 30 smiley faces today.  Lisa got 32.  Neither of us got any
Xs.</p>

<p>I drew an image type thing for the newspaper: the first 'o' of "Go
To Times" is an image of the earth with a rocket launching from
Florida.  (not to scale)</p>

<p>I've got two other ideas for images and two other 1/2 ideas.
Started to draw one of them and decided to revamp it.  Just need to
be careful not to turn it too much into work, or to totally neglect
my GET duties.</p>

<p>Silly <em>teaching....</em></p>

<p>Had a meeting in Sunshine Bar from 3 - 3:30 (GET Open Curriculum
planning), then a pile of meetings in T-Club room today: 4-5:30 Walter
Penge, 5:30 - 6:30 Port Orientationa and GET meeting.  By the end of
all that my brain was just like ugh.</p>

<p>Came down to the favela and found Rei was available for dinner!
Chowed a bit with her in Yacht Club (in the shaded breezy part, cause
it's been hot recently, but we are headed to colder
latitudes... brrr!)  To the front top deck for a bit and now writing
this in her room while she imports pictures.  About to go eat in Topaz
now...</p>
