<p>Worked on the Praise You dance in Sunshine Bar, and I almost got an
opportunity to kill Isabel, but she didn't touch the spa.  Doeth!</p>

<p>The dance is doable; I think we'll be able to kick it tonight.
After karaoke from 10pm to midnight.</p>

<p>Worked on video project some today; they have gotten a pretty solid
(?) script and scenes set up for Francois' debut film performance.
The first scene we'll film will be tomorrow in the laundry room;
Francois needs a bath.</p>
