<p>Matt loves the Fat Boy Slim video thing of "Praise You (like I
should)" with a dance troupe doing some wack looking dance, but in
unison, so we know it's intentionally wack.</p>

<p>We are going to try to perform that dance on stage tomorrow in
Broadway.  Wow.  I'm not certain I'll be able to get all the moves
down, but we'll see how it goes.  I must say I feel more likely to
practice Japanese than the dance tomorrow.</p>

<p>Sabrina came up from Reception to watch us dance in Winjammer.</p>

<p>Man - how lucky is Matt that I was already killed in 007 today.  I
would have had the *perfect* chance to kill him, in front of all the
GETs....</p>
