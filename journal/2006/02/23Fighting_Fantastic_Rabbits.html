<p>Fighting Goat were vaguely talkative today; we continued answering
some questions in the form "have you ever _______?" and they were
asked to tell a story if they have done it.  The questions were rated
with more points for more unusual things.  I was stunned and amazed
that none of them had eaten dog food.  Or cat food.  Or bird food.  Or
any animal food.</p>

<p>Fantastic Rabbits seem happy, and are super talkative, but not
super talkative in English.  We are working on a play, using photos
and live action; I'm not sure how it's all going to come out.</p>

<p>Kelly's カタカナ pronunciation is driving me crazy, especially
knowing that she's doing it partially on purpose (she thinks it's
snobbish to speak with correct pronunciation, so she purposesly uses
poor pronunication.</p>

<p>I think I'll make a new NO Japanese box.  I think it must have been
thrown away when we had to clean the rooms.  I didn't clean it because
basically everything was Lisa's stuff and I was a lazy cow and just
didn't help.</p>
