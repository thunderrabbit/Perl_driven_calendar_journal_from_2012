<p>I'm so so so tired.  Working on pictures from between Capetown to
just before this port, but not able to stay awake.. like I literally
began to fall asleep at the comma after port.</p>

<p>I am glad I got journal entries uploaded, experienced the new chat
in gmail, and got some pics named and described on my local
computer.</p>

<p>Falling asleep again.</p>

<p>I think I'll nap for an hour, then eat dinner and watch departure,
then sleep some more.</p>
