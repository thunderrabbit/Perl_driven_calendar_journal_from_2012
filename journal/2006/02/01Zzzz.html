<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Got all my people interviewed, finishing with Kentaro in his room
with Tony, Misato and some other cat chillin' out in their welcoming
space, and then Ai, up in P-sen, who had been talking to Carl about
his brother coming onboard in Rio de Janeiro.  I asked a final
question at the end, "what two things does Rei like?" because Ai and
Rei went to uni together and were on the same windsurfing team, and got
an even more fantastic answer than I expected.</p>

<p>Rolled downstairs and found their door open with Stacy at the
hands of nurse Yuki, and Rei working on some translation work.</p>

<p>Right now, though, I gots to go to bed bed bed.</p>
