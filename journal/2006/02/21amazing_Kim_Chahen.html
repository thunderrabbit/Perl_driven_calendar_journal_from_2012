<p>Kim Chahen's crazy mad skills were crazy mad cold dope awesome
tonight.  Most amazing were his yoyo shenanigans, which in a way, were
even cooler than with the diablos.  They seemed to be doing even more
impossible stuff than the diablos did.  Wow wow wow wow.  Most amazing
was vertical yoyoing and him <em>doing somersaults</em> while
yoyoing.</p>

<p>And he was doing some phat balancing while on this rocking ship.
Yowzas!</p>
