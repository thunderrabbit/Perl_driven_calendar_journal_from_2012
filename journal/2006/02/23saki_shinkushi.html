<p>Met Saki for an accupuncture session today, although I think she
didn't actually accupuncture me: she just used the little
heat-treatment points, though I'm still not sure what it's called in
either Japanese or English.</p>

<p>She felt my back and immediately noticed my injury from 1993.
She's the first person to notice it, not including my chiropractor
who worked on it right after it happened.</p>

<p>I told the story and she was quite positively responsive in a way
that made me feel all yummy inside, like she really heard me and
understood.  Wow.</p>

<p>She treated me like a paying patient, asking several questions
about my overall lifestyle: do I sleep soundly, do I have headaches,
do I have soreness, etc.  She took notes, and I told her how to ask
the same questions in English.  That's basically my payment for our
session.</p>

<p>Awesome.  And totally professional.</p>
