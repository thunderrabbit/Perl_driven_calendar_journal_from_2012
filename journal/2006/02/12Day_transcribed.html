<p class="date">Buenos Aires 10am ART Sunday 12 February 2006</p>

<p>Chat n chillin' in Argentina's cafe mas antiqua with 玲, まいこ, 
りえ, えりか, ちえこ, さき, all CCs save the last, no pun
intended.</p>

<p class="date">13:00pm</p>

<p>At a flea market with the girls now.  Learned that さき just
turned 10,000 dyas a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>あなたは日向の中にいます。日向（ひなた）日陰（ひかげ）</p>

<p>Took a picture of a frog for Fred.</p>

<p>タンゴと言うはTANGLEみたい。</p>

<p>legs get tangled in the tango</p>

<p>To be clear, I have definitely been flirting with さき.  I need
for nothing more to happen, but she's smiling a lot.  We've been
wandering around these streets filled with vendors, shops,
chicken-sounding toys (yank a string).  Lunch plans are in the
making.  Cobble brick streets in the same fan pattern as in Bergen,
Norway.  Similar vibe to La Rambla in Barcelona.  Very few poor
areas/people encountered.</p>

<p>ブイノスアイレス今日は楽しかった。</p>

<p>I had a bit of an opps at the internet - I didn't log off my
rob_update_mailer.pl before I got logged off when I was told to
switch machines cause gmail.com wouldn't work on the machine I was
on.  But I sent a Rob Update - and realized I need to run the index
updater each time, else the entry won't be available
under <b>journal</b>.  But it is under <b>travel</b>, at least.</p>

<p>Before that time (is recorded a bit with the Rob Update) I enjoyed
walking with the girls through the park and back perfectly the way I
came, past the funny people-art of Boca Barrio.  We met near the
water at 8pm and bussed to close to where we had started walking,
walked, hit a supermercado, taxied back to the ship.</p>

<p>I'm looking for an internet point to fix that oops.  Primary
solution is to rename the .pl file.  Backup fix is to have the cookie
expire after an hour or something.  I'll add a 'remember me' checkbox.</p>
