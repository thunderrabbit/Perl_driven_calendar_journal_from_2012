<p>I was all stylin', sportin' my new Francois T-shirt and strolled
into the GET Meeting 5 minutes early, and was surprised that everyone
was already there, and Matt was looking at his watch as I walked in.</p>

<p><em>no way can I be late; my phone-clock is on time</em></p>

<p>"Oh.  Oops!"</p>

<p>It had just finished.</p>
