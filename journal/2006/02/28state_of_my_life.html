<p>Given that it's just about a new month, and I have free time, I'll
work on a</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>I'm on PBs 52nd voyage around the world.</p></li>

<li><p>We will be anchored outside Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in two
days.  We will get about 8 hours on the island.  This will be my first
time to Rapa Nui.</p></li>

<li><p>We have 8 or so more days of GET classes, the speech contest,
group project presentations, graduation and prom to go, and then
we're Off The Boat!</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really kissed anyone on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently got an email from Katt from the 49th voyage; she
just wanted to say HI and see how the voyage was going.  I hadn't
heard from her in a while, after I said No and ever since she got off
my Rob Update list, I thought I might not hear from her again, so I
was glad she wrote.</p></li>

<li><p>One of my trusted friends said she got a weird vibe from one of
my romantic interests on the ship.  Every time female friends have
given me such warnings, they have turned out to be right.  Well, both
times.</p></li>

<li><p>Rei and I haven't really talked in a while, save a bit of
chocolate exchange, but we haven't spent any time together
really.. definitely no dates, and I think it will stay that way.
sigh.  I still really think she's supa awesome.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still using my first Macintosh laptop: G4 Powerbook with
677MHz CPU and 512 Meg ram and 30 Gig HD.  14 inch screen that
flickers at the bottom and I have to hit the side of the computer to
get it to turn on.  Touchpad mouse, non-touch-sensitive screen (I'm
expecting touch-screens will be the norm "soon"), only rudimentary
voice recognition (not good enough to use), no external mouse.</p></li>

<li><p>My website is robnugen.com.</p>

<p>thunderrabbit at-mark gmail dot com is my email storage address,
and anything at my domain is forwarded to that address.</p></li>

<li><p>robnugen.com refreshes to my daily journal.  The journal is
indexable by about 8 different topics, including YRUU, dreams,
ultimate, nihongo, sleepy, all, and maybe others.  Also available on
my site: my blog, travel entries (which are now updated automagically
with my Rob Update Emailer), YRUU (primarily Silent Football), and
writings (primarily old crap).</p>

<p>My journal and travel writings are updated regularly.  All the
others are collecting dust.</p>

<p>Images are not easily accessible from the top navigation, but there
are pictures available, embedded in my journal, or if people hand
enter robnugen.com/images</p></li>

<li><p>My journal entries are archived daily and emailed to my gmail
account.  Each archive is about 4 megs.  I think there are a lot of
pictures included, back when I put images in the same directories as
my journals.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't worked for money in nearly a year.</p></li>

<li><p>Not sure what I'll do when I get back to Japan.  I told Matt
that I'm interested in doing the 54th voyage, and in an "I'll do
whatever brown-nosing it takes to do that" way, I've said I am
interested in doing the pre-departure GET classes, but I'd actually
like to just ride TJ Bike to Kyoto, do the 10 day meditation, then do
fuck-all and ride around the country, seeing if I can sustain myself
off the generosity of strangers.</p></li>

<li><p>Shit; I just realized I haven't given Matt my email to
Natalie expressing my interest cited above.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't found (and don't expect to find) my 512Meg keychain
USB card (which fell out of my Pooh Bear branded plastic case after
not taping it back together in Buenos Aires).</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still using my J-PHONE from when I first came to Japan in
March 2003.  I probably got it around 2 April 2003.  I'm not sure if
it will work once I get back to the country. (since there is no money
in my bank account, but Vodafone still wants to be paid..)</p></li>

<li><p>I didn't get much of an email from Hitomi in the last port.</p></li>

<li><p>I still haven't spent any money on the ship.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm wearing no jewelry; I have no piercings nor tattoos.  I
forgot to ask Hime about her tattoos; we got sidetracked with
calculating our respective 500-day anniversaries.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer gets too hot, especially when plugged in, so I
have a fan that plugs into the USB port.  I don't use the fan all the
time, but when I do, it often sounds like the bearings are going bad
in one of the fan spindles.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have a pilot's license, and basically no plans to get
one, though sometimes I think it would be neat.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have a driver's license in Japan, and plan not to get
one because I don't want to drive on the left.</p></li>

<li><p>I do have a scuba diver's license.  Mine.</p></li>

<li><p>I am still looking for my next big project in life.</p></li>

<li><p>I gots to go to bed.</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes I look back on my life and see janette as the best
girlfriend I've ever had.  I think I should go back to her and be
settled.  Then I think about Paige and wonder if <em>she</em> could
be the one, 'cept for the detail that I don't really know her.  Then
I wonder if I'm just on the same pattern with no end in sight.</p></li>

<li><p>I floss my teeth at least once or twice every day.</p>

<p>I brush my teeth at least 2 or 3 times every day.</p>

<p>I've been wearing my mouthguard every night since before I broke up
with Wende (therefore since before September 2001)</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't heard from Wende in a while, but I wrote to her on
24 Feb, for her birthday.</p></li>

<li><p>I just brushed my teeth and noticed my chest hair is about 1
cm long, after being buzzed about 2 weeks ago.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been using a USB phone charger that Jesse gave me before
this trip.</p></li>

<li><p>I've not taken any pictures recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I forgot to bring Francois to the video team meeting at 3pm
today; I told them I would at least bring him, but didn't know if I
could attend.  I guess I couldn't attend.</li>
