<p class="date">9:21am ART Sunday 26 February 2006</p>

<p>This term my classes start at 9:30 for Fighting Goats, and not till
12:30pm for Fantastic Rabbits.  Ate breakfast in Yacht Club at Yuuka
and James' table, then Kellie replaced Yuuka as they were talking
about my title image being used for the daily paper.</p>

<p>Last night I filled in numbers on the one Maruan and I drew, but
they used a different one of mine instead.  If they hadn't used one
of mine I'm sure I would be more freaked, but still, I'm surprised
that they decided to use it, especially since I had written (FEB, and
then crossed it out and wrote) MAR, so they had to cross it out and
write FEB.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll get pictures of these title images here.</p>
