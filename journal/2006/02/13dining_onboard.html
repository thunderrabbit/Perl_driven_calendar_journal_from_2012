<p>Matt happened to be on the bus from the terminal to the ship; he
seemed surprised that I would *come back* to the ship for dinner.  I
reminded him that he enjoys food; I just like to eat.  If it's free, I
will enjoy it that much more.</p>

<p>Unless it's vanilla ice cream, and then I'll pay a bit for the
delight.</p>

<p>Ate with Yuri and Rie (Carol from my class), and their two
roommates, whose names I don't know.  Good to see Carol so happy
after her overland tour.  Yuri had already eaten, so she just had tea
and dessert, but she kept holding her stomach as if she was in pain.
I was like, "かわい胃そう," a pun on "you poor thing" but using the
kanji for stomach in the middle.  They taught me the use of さむい to
describe such おやじ gags.</p>

<p>Dinner was good, too.</p>
