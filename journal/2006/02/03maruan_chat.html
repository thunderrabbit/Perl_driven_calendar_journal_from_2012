<p>Maruan, Laura, Carla and I chowed at Yacht Club again tonight
after the GET Meeting, during which time Maruan was like, "alright,
someone tell us a secret," and I busted out with what's been on my
mind regarding Rei.  They listened intently and we headed down to
Hemingway for a bit more conversation and people watching.</p>

<p>Later, after James' lecture on Latin America (being screwed over by
the US), and after the GET / CC nomikai (( during which time (1) Yuki
asked if I did any ¼«¼ç´ë²è on the last voyage and I was like, "Silent
Football," and told her the rules after she asked the innocent
question "how is it different than regular football?" and (2) Maruan
chatted a bit more with me about the rumblings in my mind and then ))
Maruan offered to walk outside with me to see how my chat with Rei
went.</p>

<p>We didn't specifically confirm anything, but we will likely go for
a walk tomorrow.  Basically I am caught up wondering if I have blown
any chances of long term connection with her, when that's actually not
even the question I am really worried about.  I'm actually wondering
if I "should" try to have an open-hearted relationship with her
despite my fears and hangups, etc.</p>

<p>And I'm wondering what I am "supposed" to be doing in the world.</p>

<p>Kyoko came up at that point and I ended up with the homework of
looking through my pictures from Palestine.  Maruan suggested that
Francois' name be in the title of the workshop.</p>
