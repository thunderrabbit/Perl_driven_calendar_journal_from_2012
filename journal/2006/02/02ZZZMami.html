<p>We changed timezones last night.</p>

<p>After Francis' performance, I was surprised to find Hime É±
interested in me.  She was a bit touchy-feely, with her hand on my
leg a little bit, and she ended up wearing my jacket overnight.  She
has tattoos, which triggered thoughts that she could be a bad girl,
or maybe yamamba-esque.. she has a cute upturned nose and smile that
I like.</p>

<p>She helped me with Japanese, and when she ran off to the toilet
(after a decent amount of study), she came back with a bit of a snack.</p>

<p>We didn't kiss, and I am afraid I won't keep her away from me.
Please help me find the strength to keep distance.</p>

<p>I need to talk to some of the other guys.</p>
