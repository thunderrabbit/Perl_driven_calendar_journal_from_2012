<p>I basically ran out of Yacht Club after my Japanese lesson with 
あかね, my Japanese teacher onboard.  I have really enjoyed having
her as a teacher, given that she's willing to meet me each day to
help me study.</p>

<p>Today I read part of the daily paper, and learned some new
vocabulary:</p>

<p>太平洋（たいへいよう）</p>

<p>大西洋（たいせいよう）</p>

<p>And maybe some others that I can't remember now.  (It's actually
12:41am)</p>

<p>Oh, wait...</p>
