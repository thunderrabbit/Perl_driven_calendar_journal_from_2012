<p><b>Buenos Aires!</b></p>

<pre>This city is really cool.

It reminds me of a friendlier? smaller? less expensive version of Barcelona.  There
are street vendors like on La Rambla, performing music, doing tricks, dancing tango
and everything else...  Food is quite ample and quite inexpensive, especially if
one enjoys large slabs of beef.  We were served one nearly as big as Francois!

We wandered for some hours down a street with tons of flea markets.  I thought of
janette in Dallas a lot, given that´s her business...  I wonder if the prices here
are low enough to warrant an antique business trip!

We chowed ice cream and a young woman from Argentina who now lives in Miami
commented on my Don´t Mess With Texas keychain on my bag.  I didn´t get her name,
but gave my Francois card... If you´re reading now, welcome!

I had been running around today with 5 CCs and 1 passenger from the ship .. our
party has sortof broken up to do our own things for a bit and regroup later
tonight.

We walked through a hoppin´ park near La Boca- the park that overlooks the fancy
blue Russian Cathedral sports a lovely combination of tropical trees, historical
statues, plus musicians performing for couples and families chilling on benches or
the ground.  Really relaxed .. perfect weather .. it´s just Nice.

Fortunately, we will be here overnight and have all day tomorrow to play in this
beautiful city.

I am unable to check email now, but I send everyone love and blessings...

     Love Love
      - Rob!
