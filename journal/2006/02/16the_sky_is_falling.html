<p>I see technological changes happening around us every day.  There are people
who say the rate of changes is increasing (*).</p>

<p>(*) In short, things are changing quickly, and tomorrow they will change even
faster than that.</p>

<p> One essay I read in particular pointed out that there have been major
technological shifts that change the face of society, and these shifts have been
happening on a predictably shorter time scale.  Basically, (and I mean really
basic):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>humans ran around chasing animals to live</p></li>

<li><p>they invented agriculture and people stayed in stable communities</p></li>

<li><p>people invented language and people began to record history</p></li>

<li><p>someone harnessed metal and made weapons</p></li>

<li><p>the steam / combustion engine create commerce</p></li>

<li><p>airplanes brought the world together</p></li>

<li><p>silicone allowed computers to keep track of numbers</p></li>

<li><p>computers were merged into the internet</p></li>

<li><p>multi-computer technologies are allowing us to play with DNA
and stuff</p></li>

<li><p>DNA and bio-enhanced technologies will sweep through our
lives, changing all that we think is stable</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I predict: there will be no secrets.  Tiny tiny cameras pointing every
which direction, recording everything, pored over by computers or people with
lots of time on their hands.... .. we won't be able to hide anything.  Every
transaction is recorded, all our personal data is recorded...  I fully believe
every single dollar bill (cold hard cash currency) will be individually tagged
and traceable with remote reading technologies.</p>

<p>It will be possible, therefore, to get a device that can literally be
carried through the streets that will tell who is carrying how much cash.</p>

<p>With face-recognition technology, we can be enhanced to "remember" everyone
we meet.  Our little earpiece or retinal implant will tell us who is coming
toward us, when we last saw them, and any other pertinant information.</p>

<p>I'm getting tired and losing the original point to where this essay has
become a useless blob of crap, but the punchline is that (I hope) there has got
to be something human/spiritual/real that lives behind/beyond all this crazy
computer stuff.</p>

<p>I think the key to keeping our realness is through connection with the
divine / spirit / god available to all of us.  Meditation, breathing, awareness
are key to a stable life.</p>
