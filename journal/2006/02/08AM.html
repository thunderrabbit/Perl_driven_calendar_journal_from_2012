<p>Randomly met Kellie on the way to Sports Bar where the US citizens
were to meet before we get interviewed.  Chatted with her and Stacy
about our coolest jobs.  Kellie was a flight attendant for 4 years
between Honolulu and Las Vegas.  Stacy said his coolest job is PB, but
his cushiest job was as a teacher in JET.  About 17 minutes after we
were supposed to meet, Chika came in (she's the hardworking CIQ
(Customs / Immigration / Quarantine) person on this and 49th voyage
(and maybe others)) and said they didn't need to meet us after all.  I
gave her high five and chowed in Topaz Dining with Kellie.  She had
been awake since before sunrise and showed me the pictures, which were
basically hazy views of clouds.  Saw the huge statue of Jesus on the
hill about the size of a +.  (On the way downstairs Emi (KSB leader on
49th) saw me and was like, "HI!" and gave me a hug; it took a second
for me to come up with her name, but thankfully I did in a short
amount of time.)</p>

<p><em>Then</em> randomly met Fumie, who is Carla, Rei and Yuki's new
roommate!  I took her to reception to get checked in and tried to
speak a bit of Spanish with her to explain her room is across the
hall from mine, and her roommates are super fantastic.</p>

<p>Now we're about to head out and go climb the hill of Jesus and
then do other stuff.</p>
