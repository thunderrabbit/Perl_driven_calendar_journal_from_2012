<p>Kellie and I went to the end of the world, apparently, although I
didn't see an edge, or even a particular boundary.  Took a taxi to
tren del fin del mundo station, but the train had just left.
Continued our taxi trip to the other end of the line, with a few stops
along the way for pics featuring Francois and various trees,
mountains, lakes, and in one case an actual rabbit.</p>

<p>Met a woman named Jo from Adelaide who had a bear named Montgomery
who, through personification, is enjoying a trip around the world.
She's a teacher for 16 students at a school with 60 students.</p>
