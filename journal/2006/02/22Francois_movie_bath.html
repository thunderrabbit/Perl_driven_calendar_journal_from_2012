<p>Just filmed Francois going into the laundry machine.  It's our
first day of filming Francois' first movie, but this is not the first
scene.  I just wanted to wash him before we filmed everything.</p>

<p>But that's not the best part.  I asked reception if I may buy a
laundry token with cash.  I may not.  Hmmmmm.  I asked if I could
bribe them with chocolate.  I could not.  I explained my predicament.
"I'm doing a really weird thing... I'm not spending any money on the
ship; my balance is zero," and I made an O with my hand.  "But we are
making a video that includes the laundry machine."</p>

<p>"You don't have to actually <em>buy</em> a token..."</p>

<p>Nice.</p>
