<p>Our dance came out perfectly, including our big timing mistake!</p>

<p>The video I saw from the dance was taken practically in extreme
closeup mode; we could never see all of the dancers at once, and
could basically never see the dancers on the end.</p>

<p>But we could see that we were pretty vaguely decently doing
something that resembled something that would have required
practice.</p>
