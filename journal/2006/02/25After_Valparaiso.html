<p>The ship is pretty rocky today.  I'm enjoying it.</p>

<p>Today is our day off after Valparaiso.  Tomorrow the third term of
classes will begin.  I'm on the late shift of classes, and have a
shload of Afternoon GET to do.</p>

<p>I have a bit of a concern that I may miss something that I'm
supposed to do, but for now, everything is a-okay.  Not really enough
time to take a big phat nap like I'd like to do, but I'll mindfully
write a to-do list and see what happens.</p>

<h3>Things to do "today"</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>* write to Natalie saying that I'm officially interested in
being on the 54th voyage, and pre-departure GET.</p></li>

<li><p>give my note to Natalie to Matt</p></li>

<li><p>write to Paige to say HI</p></li>

<li><p>call Kiichi to coordinate a meeting time</p></li>

<li><p>* interview Phil about what to do in Rapa Nui</p></li>

<li><p>* Japanese lesson with Akane</p></li>

<li><p>transcribe Japanese journal entries</p></li>

<li><p>* write a reminder about Speech Contest info meeting tomorrow</p></li>

<li><p>* contact Saki about English / energy-work exchange</p></li>

<li><p>try AMS2HID on Carl's computer (*)</p></li>

<p>(*) Fred showed me a cool thing called AMS2HID, which converts
physical orientation information into mouse movements in different
applications.  The coolest application that uses this is a ball
rolling app, so the ball appears to roll according to which way the
computer is tilted.</p>

<p>I just spent maybe 45 minutes cleaning up the chat with Fred so it
could be archived below.  I hope I appreciate this later.  Or at
least I hope someone else appreciates it.</p>
