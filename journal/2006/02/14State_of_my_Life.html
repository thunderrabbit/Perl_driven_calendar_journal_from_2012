<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>This was going to be a State of My Valentine's Life, but I
quickly decided I don't want to write about that (exclusively).</p></li>

<li><p>In fact, I may not be in the mood to write much at all.</p></li>

<li><p>I have labeled myself as a sex addict at various times in my
life.  I've been to SLAA (Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous) meetings,
though I haven't worked through the 12 steps, nor ever had a sponsor,
etc.</p></li>

<li><p>I have tended to continually seek the next woman, then the
next, the next, next, next, etc. never finding 100 percent
compatibility or perfection or whatever it is that Happily Ever After
is supposed to mean.</p></li>

<li><p>I know (?) that something has got to change inside me before
any real resolution can occur in this pattern.</p></li>

<li><p>On PBs 52nd voyage, I met Rei across the hall from me, found
her to be quite dateable, told her I still had unresolved issues with
Hitomi back in Japan, ended up somewhat broken hearted in
friends-only mode.</p></li>

<li><p>Just 2 days ago, on our first day in Buenos Aires, I met Saki,
in whom I became interested when I learned she is trained in
accupuncture, shiatsu, and hot coal therapy (I don't know a name for
that in English or Japanese).  She's also tall and has a nice smile,
and apparently well-versed in some form of Buddism.  But, we don't
speak a shared language.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Crap. Should I just give it up?  Not according to <em>If the
Buddha Dated</em>, which I'm using as my dating bible these days.  I
just need to try and keep open communication and not jump into the
sack with her.</p></li>

<li><p>We are scheduled for dinner tonight at 7:30, and will possibly
both choose each other's names in the ドキドキ Valentine's thing
tonight.</p></li>

<li><p>I have flipped a coin several times about this issue and it
keeps saying Don't Go.</p>

<p>Three Rune Spread for the issue of My Relationship with Saki:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Overview: Algiz <b>reversed</b></p>

<p>Control of the emotions is at issue here.  During times of
transition, shifts in life course and accelerated self-change, it is
important not to collapse yourself into your emotions, the highs as
well as the lows.  New opportunities and challenges are typical of
this Rune.  And with them may come trespasses and unwanted
influences.</p>

<p><em>Algiz</em> serves as a mirror for the Spiritual Warrior, the one
whose battle is always with the self.  The Warrior's protection is
like the curved horns of the elk, or the warning rustle of the sedge
grass, for both serve to keep open space around you.</p>

<p>Remain mindful that timely right action and correct conduct are
your only true protection.  If you find yourself feeling pain,
observe the pain, stay with it.  Do not try to pull down the veil and
escape from life by denying what is happening.  You <em>will</em>
progress; knowing that is your protection.</p>

<p><b>reversed</b> be thoughtful about your health and do not add to
the burdens others are carrying.  Look carefully at the associations
you form at this time.  If you see fit to become involved with people
who are using you, remain conscious of that fact and take
responsibility for your own position; then you can only benefit.  And
yet, regardless of whether your enterprise prospers or suffers, do
not be overly concerned.  You may not win, but you will never lose,
for you can always learn from what takes place.</p>

<p>Temperance and courtesy are the sinews of this Rune's
protective powers.</p></li>

<li><p>Challenge: Ansuz <b>reversed</b></p>

<p>The keynote here is receiving: messages, signals, gifts.  Even
a timely warning may be seen as a gift.  The message may be that of a
new life unfolding.  New lives begin with new connecitons, surprising
linkages that direct you onto new pathways.  Take care now to be
especially aware during meetings, visits, chance encounters,
particularly with persons wiser than yourself. When the Messenger
Rune brings sacred knowledge, you are truly blessed.</p>

<p>Loki is the ancient trickster from the pantheon of the Norse gods.
He is the <em>heyeohkah</em> of the Native Americans, a mocking shadow
of the creator god, as will as the bringer of benefits to humankind.
He is a reminder that even scoundrels and arch-thieves can be the
bearers of wisdom.  When you draw this Rune, expect the unexpected:
The message is always a call, a call to new life.</p>

<p><em>Ansuz</em> is the first of the thirteen Runes that make up the
Cycle of Initiation--Runes that focus directly upon the mechanism of
self-change--and as such, addresses our need to integrate unconsious
motive with conscious intent.</p>

<p>Drawing <em>Ansuz</em> tells you that connection with the
Divine is at hand.  It is a signal to explore the depths, the
foundations of life, and to experience the inexhaustible wellspring
of the Divine in your nature.</p>

<p>At the same time, you are reminded that you must first draw
from the well to nourish and give to yourself.  Then there will be
more than enough to nourish others.  A new sense of family solidarity
invests this Rune.</p>

<p><b>reversed</b> You may be concerned over what appears to be
failed communication, lack of clarity or awarensss either in your
past history or in a present situation.  You may feel inhibited from
accepting what is offered.  A sense of futility, of wasted motion,
may overwhelm you.  Remember, however, that what is happening is
timely to your process.  If the well is clogged, this is the moment
for cleaning out the old.  Reversed, <em>Ansuz</em> is
saying <em>Consider the uses of adversity.</em></p></li>

<li><p>Appropriate Action: Inguz</p>

<p>The Rune is akin to the moon, the intuitive part of our nature,
with its urge toward harmonizing and adjusting in the sphere of
personal relationship.  <em>Inguz</em> embodies the need to share,
the yearing to be desired, a search after similarities.</p>

<p><em>The completion of beginnings</em> is what <em>Inguz</em>
requires.  Drawing this Rune may mark a time of joyful deliverance, a
new life, a new path.  A Rune of great power, receiving it means you
now have the strength to achieve completion, resolution, from which
comes a new beginning.  Above all, completion is crucial here.  It
may be timely that you complete some project now; if so, make that
your first priority.  Perhaps a difficult sate of mind can be
clarified or resolved.  The appearance of the Rune indicates that you
must fertilize the ground for your own deliverance.</p>

<p>All things change and we cannot live permanently amid
obstructions.  <em>Inguz</em> signals your emergence from a closed,
chrysalis state.  As you resolve and clear away the old, you will
experience a release from tension and uncertainty.</p>

<p>You may be required to free yourself from a rut, habit or
relationship; from some deep cultural or behavioral pattern, some
activity that was quite proper to the self you are leaving behind.
The time of birth is always a critical one.  Movement can involve
danger, and yet movement that is timely leads out of danger.  The
time has come to enter the delivery room.</p>

<p>Another of the Cycle Runes, <em>Inguz</em> counsels preparation.
Being centered and grounded, freeing yourself from all unwanted
influences and seeing the humor, you are indeed prepared to open to
the Will of Heaven and await your deliverance with calm
certainty.</p></li></ol>

<p>Dinner was with a tableful of people instead of just two people,
but that's cool; I heard a rumor that she drinks more than I might
appreciate so I was like, <em>ain't no way I'm dating her</em>, but we
went out to the top deck anyway and looked at stars for a
while.</p></li>

<li><p>Also, we agreed that we would not go to the ドキドキ thing on
top deck; we don't want to be "announced" as a couple.</p></li>
</ol>
