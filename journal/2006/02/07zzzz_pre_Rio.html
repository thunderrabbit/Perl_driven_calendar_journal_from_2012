<p>I'm falling asleep as I realize there's a mistake with pictures'
names on my local computer.  I am too tired to fix it now, but it
basically means that I won't be able to embed more pictures in my
journal than I have already until its fixed.</p>

<p>Thanks to the US shafting Brazilian tourists, we Americans have to
be interviewed at 7:30am tomorrow, which means I have to be awake
awake at 7am-ish.  Dammit.</p>

<p>good night.</p>
