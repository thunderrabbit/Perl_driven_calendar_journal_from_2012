<p>Fighting Goats were quiet today.</p>

<p>Fantastic Rabbits were fantastic today.  They made a gameboard,
and played it, getting about halfway through.  They'd like to finish
up the game tomorrow.</p>

<p>I studied a lot of Japanese today, although my 'official' teacher,
Akane, didn't show up.  I think she is busy with Global University
stuff.  Instead I let Mami check my work the second time she came by
to say HI.</p>

<p>Did laundry by hand in the shower.  When I stepped out, I
announced, "my clothes and I are clean."</p>

<p>GET Meeting was soon thereafter, and then dinner (formal dinner
tonight; I put a suit jacket on over my t-shirt, shorts and sandals.
No tie.  No socks.  No belt.  I went in with my student Tamami
(Angelina), who was wearing casual cotton).  Ate a lot lot lot of
food.  The vegetarian meal was quite huge, filling and delicious.  The
girl across the table from me was wearing a shirt depicting Pong, as
in the original video game.  I told her I liked the shirt, and then
explained to them what it was.  Basically, they were born around the
same time as that game.</p>

<p>Just a bit ago, I finished my plan for the open lessons I've got
to do tomorrow.  I'll be sharing the plan with ¤ß¤µ¤È at 10:30.</p>
