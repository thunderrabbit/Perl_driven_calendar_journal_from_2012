<p>Today was the first day of Term 2.  Fighting Goats now meet at 8am,
and Fantastic Rabbits at 9:30am.  For Fighting Goats, I used Kellie's
food names and description game, and had them make various sentences:
Kimchi is spicy.  Oranges are sweeter than lemons.</p>

<p>Fantastic Rabbits were more self-directed; I had them basically
plan out the next 6 days of their lessons using "how about we ______
on (date)?"  This worked well, I believe.  Then we played
pict-o-grams, and then a round of boggle.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will play more boggle and perhaps more pictograms.
I'd love to play pictograms with the GET Ts and CCs.</p>

<p>Immediately after classes, Kyoko and I taught Super Beginner and
Beginner GET Opens.  I got to use the clock I made (and Kiichi
laminated) and it worked quite well.  Hooray!  I labeled it "Here's to
good times on all past, present, and future voyages.  - ROB and the
52nd GET Team"</p>

<p>I hope it will be used for years.</p>

<p>Lunch with Kyoko after that, and I gave her the plan for tomorrow's
lesson.  It's much less spelled out than the one I wrote for today.
I'm sure it will go quite well, though.</p>

<p>Naptime after that and now awake for a little bit of バラバラ stuff
this afternoon.</p>

<p>Pretty much have gotten everything done today except laundry and
something else.  Carla reminded me that we (me, Carla, Laura) are
scheduled to do an event on February 4th: we're going to play a Family
Feud style game, so tonight at dinner we sorted out the questions
we'll be asking and split up the GETs and CCs and a couple of the
staff to ask questions.  I've just got two more people to ask:
Kentaro and Ai.</p>

<p>I've already asked Phil, Carl, Dan, Pepe, Nori, Stacy, Joel, Tony,
and myself.</p>

<p>During the day today I meditated a lot on my reactions and
sensations regarding changes of pace in relationships.  Really
interesting to catch feelings just as they come up.  I'm sure I'll
get even better at this with a bit of practice.</p>

<p>I invited the 3029 girls to dinner, though I didn't know if the
3027 boys would be able to join.  Carl, for one, was not.  Neither was
Dan.  Francois is still in my pants pocket, so he didn't come.  But I
was there, though in the meeting with Carla.  Rei as well, and we
talked as much as was reasonable for sitting somewhat far from each
other.</p>
