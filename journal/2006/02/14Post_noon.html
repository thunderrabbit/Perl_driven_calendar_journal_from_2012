<p>Found Saki up on top deck, when my original plan was to meditate;
ended up talking to her and her peeps for a couple hours.  Mostly not
talking; the language barrier is a challenge that I don't know if I
want to face, although ¥È¥Ë, one of her friends, speaks English really
well.</p>

<p>I told her that I generally want to bite her neck, but that would
cause hella problems, and friendship first would be a better idea.
We are scheduled to go to dinner this evening at 7:30.</p>

<p>In the back of my foolish mind I am concerned about what I told
Hitomi (no g/f on PB) and Rei (I would commit to her no matter what
she said (she said friends only)).  Am I foolish or a fool for
thinking I'm foolish?</p>
