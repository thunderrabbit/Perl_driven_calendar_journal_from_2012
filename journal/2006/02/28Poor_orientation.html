<p>I was supposed to do the port orientation for Rapa Nui today,
which I did, but don't think I did a particularly good job at it.  I
did better than last voyage, when I discovered I was supposed to do
the port orientation NOW, had to run down to GET Street, print out
the rough information and run back upstairs and fumble through not
having read it and having plenty of repeated information; this time I
was on time, had editted the document carefully, basically knew what
it said, but I still didn't feel like I was one with the information;
I didn't feel comfortable talking about it because I haven't been
there yet; I just have this general idea....</p>

<p>*I* know what it is!!  I don't prepare *anything* for the ports:
my plan is always, "walk around, see what I find,"...  so in that
light, I've done a fantastic port orientation!  Wow.  Yay me!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But the port orientation was dominated by a misdirected discussion
about plastic obento boxes being used in Rapa Nui.  Roberto, who
successfully sued Costa Rica for supporting the US in Iraq, PBs newest
staff member, was all like, "why do we have plastic containers?" in
all sorts of concern for the environment, etc, all things with which I
agree, BUT it's too late to do anything on this voyage; Japanese
decisions are made centuries (*) in advance, and are hella slow to
change.  He'll need to bring his arguments back to Tokyo and make
changes there.  No way anything will substantially change on the
voyage.</p>

<p>NOW, I grant that with my attitude <em>nothing</em> will change,
and I best be thankful for people like him in the world.</p>

<p>However, at least, I have chosen not to use a plastic box lunch on
Rapa Nui; I'll just happily starve for 8 whole hours until we get
back to the ship.  Or buy food on the island.</p>

<p>(*) or less</p>
