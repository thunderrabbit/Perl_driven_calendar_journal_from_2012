<p>In Namibia I bought some white chocolate to share with Îè¤Á¤ã¤ó,
and ended up overtly giving it to her a couple days ago.  Today or so
she said I should snag some, and just a bit ago I heard her come by
her room so I took her up on that offer, getting 4 of the last 6
squares.</p>

<p>It was really nice chocolate.</p>

<p>I haven't really talked to her in probably a week, which equates
to about a month in Tokyo time.</p>

<p>She said No Music No 52nd event has been cancelled, which furthers
my resolve to just go to bed bed bed.</p>

<p>After a shower.  I'll wake up early and do something interesting,
perhaps.  Especially since we're getting an hour tonight.</p>

<p>New time:</p>

<p>Wow.  That took a while to get sorted.  Timezones on this computer
are not easy to set to Rapa Nui time.</p>
