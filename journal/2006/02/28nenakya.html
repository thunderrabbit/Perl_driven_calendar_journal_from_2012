<p>Afterward, I walked Hime to the PA room 行かなきゃ！ and found あかね nearby so I helped her with a couple vocabulary words
("inspirational" and "sum up") from the article she's reading.</p>

<p>I thought I had seen 左貴 on 7th floor, so I went back, aware that
I was basically stalking when I need to be sleeping, but it wasn't
her.  Went down to Ann's room to see if she really wanted us to meet
there for our class tomorrow, but she wasn't there, so we'll meet in
our classroom and then move if inspired to do so.</p>

<p>I <em>nearly</em> checked 左貴's room on the way to mine, but
somehow kept myself from checking; it seemed too creepy for me to show
up there unannounced; we're not actually friends, and it would just be
ooky.</p>
