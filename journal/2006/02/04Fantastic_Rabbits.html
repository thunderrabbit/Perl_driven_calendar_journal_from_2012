<p>Met with 5 of the Fantastic Rabbits and had a pretty cool
conversation with them regarding things I don't like about Japan:
primarily the way women are regarded (must be married before 30 years
old or it's too late) and the widespread availability of comic books
depicting underage women in sexually comprimised positions.  These are
sold in convenience stores, and are not "behind the counter," but
available from the rack at hip level.</p>

<p>Most of this conversation was done in Japanese, I am proud to
say.</p>
