<p>I drew a third title image for the daily paper.  There's a part of
me that wants to put them in here for posterity; I might.</p>

<p>Went looking for Kellie, Laura, Maruan at 11am for our meeting but
couldn't find them until I found Kellie and Laura in Kellie's room
watching <em>Mr and Mrs Smith</em> on Kellie's computer.  It's a
pretty funny movie, so I watched it with them.</p>

<p>I've got some other junk I need to be working on, but I haven't
really taken time to categorize, prioritize, summarize and finalize a
list.</p>

<p>But, pretty soon I've got to go to Yacht Club to meet Kiichi for
our Staff GET lesson.  I've told him I can only meet him for 30
minutes; he never has anything to do/say/work on, so the lessons are
pretty pointless and boring, I reckon.</p>
