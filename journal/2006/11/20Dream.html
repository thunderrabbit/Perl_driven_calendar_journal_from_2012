<p class="dream">China invaded our city in the form of millions of Chinese citizens just marching
in and kicking people out of their homes and apartments.  Just through sheer numbers they were able
to do this.  We had a bit of an advanced warning, sorta like a tornado or hurricane warning; the
surge will arrive in about 10 minutes.  We left our homes and went to a room where we found a map
of China that was actually China and we could scrape it with sticks and affect the war, killing
hundreds of thousands of people with a single easy stroke.  I scraped clean one area of China, then
really got into it and carved up a layer of the map and burned it in the campfire pit.</p>

<p class="dream">Some pictures that we had been asked to take the previous day were featured in a
magazine advertising porn movies.  We hadn't really done anything but pose in funny positions, but
they looked really sexual in the photos.  I wondered if I could make big money as a porn star</p>

<p class="dream">Some of my friends were on PB's current voyage; actually I was on the ship as
Sabrina was leaving the ship.  I was walking behind her for a moment and hoping to talk to her when
she saw Melvin, and did a 180 to go talk to him.  She saw me when she turned around, but did not
stop to talk.  I blew her a kiss and waved bye.</p>

<p class="dream">My friends were on the current voyage and the ship was being treated as a ferry,
or in some unique manner for this voyage only.  I asked Matt what country they were in now and he
knew right off the cuff, but I don't remember now.</p>

<p class="dream">I was taking a standardized test, the first part of which was also a psychological
exam designed to see how / if we try to optimize things.  The first transaction left us with a
certain amount of change, and the second transaction could be paid for with either 1 coin and
receive change, or with some of the other coins we had, and not receive change.  I went with the
second way, trying not to receive change back.</p>

<p class="dream">The next part of the text was just fill in the bubbles, which I finished and was
painting clean the parts I had not filled in, as other people were talking about the rest of the
test, which was essay, I realized there must be more test to take, but I now had a scoring sheet
that was wet with paint so I couldn't turn it over to write my answers for the essay part.  Yarg.</p>
