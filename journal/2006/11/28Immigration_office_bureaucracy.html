<pre>now serving number 75</pre>

<p>I'm out on the Rinkai line, in east Tokyo at the immigration office of some rather large
semi-modern building that features a Dentention Center.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>In the spirit of saving time, I grabbed a number at the number-printer next to the information
desk, which had a line of a few people in front of it.  That saved me one place in line by the time
I got through the information line, but, it was the wrong line.  Ah well.</p>

<p>Upstairs to counter B, which is the Immigration Application Counter's bouncer, which has its own
bouncer at the end of its line.</p>

<p>I got bounced, having not filled out the forms whatsover.  Ironically, I <em>don't</em> have my
pens today; I usually carry two, but I left them last night because I was late leaving and for some
reason consciously decided to leave them on the table for tomorrow.  Basically I had been thinking
it would save me that much energy to not carry two pens home and back.</p>

<p>The bouncer for counter B didn't have any pens available, so I went in search of a pen and found
some amid ample counter space.  Began to fill out the form, but soon got bounced from the counter,
and was asked to leave the pen.</p>

<p>I borrowed a pen from some non-Japanese looking guy resigned to chillin' in the chairs with
little hope of his name ever being called.  I filled out my forms, during which time his name was
called, and he sat back down to wait for his pen.  Ah well; I thanked him and he said
&quot;cheers&quot;</p>

<p>Back to the bouncer for counter B and made it into the counter B line, though I hadn't quite
filled everything out.  I borrowed a pen in line (with my newfound term いただ<b>け</b>ますか) and
filled out some details I had missed.</p>

<p>To counter B where that bouncer (for the main cattle-herding area) pointed out a couple of
mistakes and other lines I needed to fill out.  He gave me a numbered ticket for my waiting
pleasure (number 138)</p>

<p>Back to the ample space counter, I borrowed the same pen to stick it to da man and filled out the
remaining points and made the corrections.</p>

<p>(( just got a call from my Japanese teacher; I forgot our lesson this morning (usually it's at
2pm on Wednesdays, but today at 11 (on Tuesday)). Fuck.  And today was the day she brought the CDs
so I could listen to Japanese while on the train or falling asleep (or both) ))</p>

<pre>now serving number 91</pre>

<p>Okay, so in 21 minutes, they went from serving number 75 to number 91.  That's .7 per minute,
which means I'll be called in 35 minutes.  I have time to get the forms again and fill them out
again.  Which I <em>might</em> just do.</p>

<p class="date">11:17am JST</p>

<pre>now serving number 97</pre>

<p>Aha.  Now I know why I had a feeling the building was weird, where I wrote
&quot;semi-modern&quot; above:  There is 1 escalator between the first and second floor.  I was
able to easily go up, but had to walk to the other side of the building to go back down.  The
escalator will go down later this afternoon.</p>

<p>And, there's a convenience store in the building.  They know where the market is: people with
nothing to do but wait and eat and buy pens to fill out forms.  I bought a pen and a ピザマン
(heated moist bread roll thing with pizza-topping like filling).</p>

<pre>now serving number 102</pre>

<p>and now I will fill out the form that has several scratchouts.</p>

<p class="date">11:31am JST</p>

<p>Except that it turns out I bought I pencil instead of a pen.</p>

<p>I rocked back downstairs with my profound knowledge this building's layout and escalator times
of operation to the convenience store where I snagged a pen (same price as the pencil) and
presented both at the counter with my receipt.</p>

<p>Simple exchange?</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p>(( usually, packing in Japan has a specific &quot;neat&quot; (as in tidy) way of being opened.
The package in which the pencil came did not have such (a resealable flap would be more likely than
not).  So, I had had to actually rip open the package. ))</p>

<p>The hole I ripped into the package was tiny.  Just big enough to squirt the pencil through.  I
didn't even use the notch at the top of the package to rip the whole thing apart.</p>

<p>The guy was like, &quot;blah blah blah blah blah blah&quot; which I would translate to &quot;it
happens to have been ripped&quot;, not overtly blaming me for the rip, but overtly not allowing the
exchange.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>What kind of fucking customer service is this?  I was pissed.  Pissed at having 'wasted' a
pencil; I don't need a pencil.  I don't actually need a pen either, but (I ended up buying the pen
(and I tried to fluster him by giving him 10,000 yen note, wait for him to count the change, and
then give him 110 yen; it didn't work), but I think I will take it back (unopened), and perhaps try
to sweet talk them into taking the pencil back, but that might be impossible because) I was pissed
and accidentally dropped the ピザマン remains (had already taken a bite) and when I picked it up, I
squeezed the shit out of it and put it on the counter on my way out.</p>

<p>God I'm an idiot, what did that fucking prove?  What good did it do for the world?  Why did I
even try to buy a pen in the first place?</p>

<p>I feel really embarassed about my stupid antics.  But goddamn why wouldn't they take back the
pencil?  Shitty customer service.  Fuck you, Da Man, with your huge factories billowing pollution
and plastic products in plastic packaging.  Fuck you.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But, a real whiz-bang ringer is when I left the first time, there was a new bouncer for counter
B.  I walked back past him no problem the first time (with my pencil).  Then I left *again*, right
in front of him, and then when I came back (with the pencil *and* the pen), he was all like, [just a
moment, do you have your paper?] and I was like, &quot;what do you want?&quot; claiming ignorance,
but pissed at him for half-way doing his job (not stopping me the first time, but this time not
letting me go through).</p>

<p>Showed him the unfilled out sheet, along with the 2 filled out sheets, and he <em>let me go
through</em> (with unfinished sheets??), giving me a nice *new* lovely blue plastic folder (one of
which I already have) and telling me I should go to the Counter B Bouncer to get my number.</p>

<p>Thank you.  Very much.  I've been here before.  This is my third time in front of you.</p>

<p>I just realized that I can present the pencil to Reiko (receptionist) as a gift; she uses pencil
every day, every hour, every student.</p>

<p class="date">11:59am JST</p>

<p>And, for the record, I <em>don't actually expect</em> this will work today, given that the name
on the form my boss gave me is not mine, but Mr Nguyen's</p>

<pre>now serving number 133</pre>

<p>And it's now 12:00pm.  Will they stop taking numbers and go to lunch?  I pretty much expect them to.</p>
