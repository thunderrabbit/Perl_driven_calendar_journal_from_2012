There is a direct connection between events that happened more than fifty years ago, and the war in
Iraq today.

In 1953, the Prime Minister of Iran, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Mossadegh">Mohammed Mosaddegh</a> became extremely irritated the British
were ripping off his country's national resources; he wanted a greater share in it.

The British came to the new President Eisenhower and asked for help on this.  Eisenhower very
conveniently declared Mosaddegh to be a communist.  And we then set the CIA to overthrow him.

     &quot;Three days of bloody rioting culminating in a military coup..&quot;

The result was we brought the Shah to power and he created an extremely repressive regime that
within 20 years had led to a revolution against him.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini">Ayatollah Khomeini</a> creates a
government that is violently anti-American.  

     &quot;Khomeini said, quote I pray to God to cut the hands off of all those foreign advisors..&quot;

In the After Action report by the CIA on what they had done in Iran in 1953, they said, &quot;we're
going to get some 'blowback' from this.&quot;

We then made a puppet out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> in Iraq, who was a friend of ours.  He was an asset in
the CIA's computers.  We did so because he was anti-Iranian.  He was very fearful that the
revolution in Iran would spread into his country.  He therefore went to war with Iran.  The war was
extremely bloody and went on throughout the 1980's.  Unfortunately for Saddam Hussein, he began to
lose the war.  At that point, in comes the United States in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_hussein#The_Iran-Iraq_War_.281980.E2.80.931988.29">Donald Rumsfeld sent to
Saddam Hussein by President Reagan</a> to tell him, &quot;we will supply you with intelligence; we will
supply you with the weapons you may need through covert means.&quot; It is why cynics in Washington
say, &quot;we know Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; we have the receipts.&quot;

This is what we mean by &quot;blowback.&quot;

He remained a friend of ours right up to his invasion in the summer of 1990 of Kuwait.  We became
alarmed when he invaded Kuwait that he could also go on and invade Saudi Arabia itself, the largest
reserves of oil on earth.  We stationed troops in Saudi Arabia; it was a mistake in every sense of
the term.

Remember, Osama Bin Laden had said, &quot;I resent the government of Saudi Arabia for using
Americans to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq.&quot;  We began to fear that we were going to lose
our position in Saudi Arabia.

Well the second largest source of proven reserves on earth are in Iraq.

This leads us now to demonize our previous ally, and to prepare the American public for the thought
that we must take him out.
