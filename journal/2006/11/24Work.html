<p>Just got back from work; I was quite tempted to bring my marble track home, but left it there; 2
days with no marble track activity planned.</p>

<p>During my last lesson (with Ia Shu, who is not Japanese, but I don't remember where she's from;
perhaps Taiwan) I started sneezin' like a mo fo.  Not fun, but I seem to be cleared up now.  It was
weird.  And sneezy.</p>
