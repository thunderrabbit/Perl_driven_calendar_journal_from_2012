<p>No pics here, but just a whine:</p>

<p>Yesterday, after having gotten into trouble about sexually harassing a student by touching her
hands (probably saying, &quot;you can do it&quot; or &quot;oh, I'm sorry to hear that,&quot;) I was
quite proudly focused on *not* scoping women with covert glances at variously accentuated lines and
curves.</p>

<p>A girl just walked by and I could feel me going back to my old scoping self.  Her hair was all
crazy tall and blondish and her eyes super made up.  Maybe it's okay to stare at freaks, but
basically I thought she was hot.  In a freaky way.</p>
