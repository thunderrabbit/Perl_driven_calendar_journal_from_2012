<p>Ug.</p>

<p>I don't like being sick.  I don't like calling in sick to work.  I'm really sad and yucky.</p>

<p>I'm thankful she came over and brought medicine and pudding.  And actually going back out to get
more pudding and some spinach.  I'm not really sure what else I should eat.  Got lots of liquids:
green tea, lemon aid, orange juice, green tea, some gargle that looks like Betadine.. then some
solids: ginger and, uh that's it.</p>
