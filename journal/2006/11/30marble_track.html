<p>Aha!</p>

<p>I figured out an optimal solution for the big marble switch!  Instead of swinging an angled
toothpick (which disallows a stable backboard (and requires an extra switch for the backboard
stability)), I will swing a single toothpick with its outer limits the outer rails..  basically
just like a railroad switch.</p>

<p>Poifect!</p>
