<p>Just had lesson with Kaoru for 1.5 hours in McDonald's.  Gushed all about Aiko and still feel
like crying.  I just don't know what to do.</p>

<p>Just finished two hour lesson with …¿Ó¿Ë¿∏.  At first I was messed up, but did better after I
settled into being funny with the language.</p>

<p>Because I work on Wednesdays now from 5pm, we are going to have only 1.5 hour lessons starting
next week.  That way I'll have more time to get ready and go.</p>
