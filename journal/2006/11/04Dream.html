<p class="dream">Met with Laura (Guennie) at her company's well-planned office that was only 1, 1,
3 and 6 hours' walk, respectively from 4 amusement parks in Chicago area.</p>

<p class="dream">When I arrived, however, I realized I was only wearing underwear and hadn't
brought my camera nor computer.  Still had plenty of time, so I decided to go back to my house to
get these items, but soon enough the problem was solved internally.</p>

<p class="dream">I headed to a government department that was so poor it could only afford used
cardboard boxes to make ts sign on the door.</p>
