<p class="dream">Headed cross country on foot, starting in New York City, I was in a bad
neighborhood and just trying to get to more familiar territory when I stepped out through a window and
came across some kids who I asked in Japanese if they spoke English.  Turned out one of them did,
and spoke German as well, so I ended up staying with them for viewing of a distribution video
thing</p>

<p class="dream">We were in the movie theater and the kids were fluent in three languages wile the
mom was there proudly watching over them.  I asked her a few questions as the kids too to a game a
hyper-active teddy bear.  as it became time to leave that job, I didn't want to go, but I knew I
had to.  Got back into m ca, and Shell was in the driver's seat, but only if you couldn't do it any
other way&quot; and she was 0 seconds away from implosion when the flood gates released and she
zooomed down the road past several kids who included one future cop and the rest future thugs.</p>

<p class="dream">I was a bit nervous about going too fast, so I was like&quot;um&quot;/p>

<p class="dream">as the corner came up far too quickly but she slowed suddenly and we redited
slowly forward and a cop car stealthily crept out from the trees and was pursuing the
previously speeding car.  I got out of my car near a college campus, and the car self-transforming
into  wamda, but I decided to do it anyway.</p>

<p class="dream">it transformed into a self-protective shell o whk co with y,ooo X  only to have the actor search in
.</p>

<p class="dream">A cop came up, unimprssed with the parking skills, until  added:</p>

<p class="dream">the cop was going to give a ticket to the car until it posted a fence sign near it is and sied a
loop explaining why it was allowed to park there.  The cop backed off and call </p>

<p class="dream">One more switch and I was walking upstairs into an old movie set and the kid with Down's
Syndrome lunged at me and the time I was too little to munch so I wrenched away, grabbing his
glasses and threw them across the room.</p>

<p class="dream">My phone thunked loudly across the room and woke me up.</p>
