<p class="dream">Amy Baby was giving me some suggestions which I tried to follow</p>

<p class="dream">I ended up going to a movie with two guys at a cheap movie theater.  I was walking
down the hall, not quite sure for whom I was looking, but he saw me around the same time that I
thought I recognized him.  Turned out to be the right guy.</p>
