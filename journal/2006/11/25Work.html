<p>Had to deliberately drag my butt outta bed this morning, but ended up actually getting the early
train in both Sakurashinmachi and Shibuya, the express train from Shibuya leaves a lot later than
the train I took, but arrived just 2 minutes after mine.  I argued in my head it was worth having
taken the slow train because I got to sleep decently on the train, and I was relaxedly on time.</p>

<p>On break now.  Just before my last break I had Akiko (!) <!--  Honda -->, who I had previously met at
Shibuya, so I was confused as to why I recognized her though my name was not on the lesson record
page of her file.</p>

<p>She speaks French better than she speaks English, so occassionally French responses come first.
Per example, for example.  That discussion helped me remember that what we had talked about in
Shibuya.  I had said I would have trouble *not* trying to toss in some French words, not that I know
many, but would do my best to stay in English mode.</p>

<p>Today I told her about Richard the Kiwi in Kobe, who's ペラペラ in Japanese, and has apparently
been fluent in French, given that he was practicing French with Pia's (?) friend Stephanie (?) when
Hide and I were individually invited to her house for the fabulous free dinner back during my TJ
Bike adventure.</p>

<p>After said break, I had Chika and Mari (sp), who I &quot;barked at for not knowing what they are
doing nor why they are here.&quot; Today I made them practice 何回 a thing until they memorized it,
but after it became apparent they couldn't memorize it, I switched to just easier parts of the
grammar: &quot;Francois is bigger than Jamie's clock,&quot; and (upon her invitation:) &quot;Michiko
is the cutest person in this room.&quot;</p>
