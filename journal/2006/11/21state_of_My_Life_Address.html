<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I live with Michael in Sakurashinmachi, 4 local stops from Shibuya, a popular station on the
Yamanote Line in Tokyo, Japan.  Rent is 80,000 yen per month (each) and about 7,000 yen in
utilities (each)</p></li>

<li><p>I work at EV, a company I'm not mentioning because I didn't have a work visa when I first
started working for them.  At this point, I still haven't finalized the work visa procurement</p></li>

<li><p>I'm currently about $4000 in debt, mostly due to breaking my shoulder in May (fun times) and
not having insurance to pay for it.  (oops).  Now that my work and budget have stabilized, I have
been paying about 60,000 yen back per month (since last month).</p></li>

<li><p>I'm currently girlfriendless, but I am dating a woman who has asked for anonymity in here.</p></li>

<li><p>I am currently interested in dating Aiko, a woman who lives in Okinawa.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is my white MacBook with 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo, 1 GB of SDRAM, 75 GB HD (7 Gigs
free), running OS X 10.4.8</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access is pretty high speed at the apartment.  Our fiber is pretty fast; mostly
it's the speed of the server we're talking to that is the limiting factor.  Regularly get 150KB/s
download and sometimes 1MB/s download</p></li>

<li><p>I-group meets twice a month, but I fucked up and didn't request the days off at work, so
I've had to work this month instead of attend I-group.  Damn.</p></li>

<li><p>I just finished being sick last week though; I cancelled everything and *could* have gone to
I-group, but I wasn't in the mood to do diddly squat.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been working with Kim Sawyer, and have finally gotten to a stable pattern of meeting him
once a month over Skype.</p>

<p>We will meet for three more months, during which time we hope to get my next couple of life
steps mapped out, and hopefully a 10 year plan as well.</p>

<li><p>I have not done any volunteer work recently.</p></li>

<li><p>My Japanese study has hit a wall of sorts; I'm pissed at it and ready to stop <em>and</em>
ready to start over, but this time actually study.  It's weird; I think I now know, after all this
time, what it will take to learn this crazy language.  Am I ready to do it?  Hmmmm></p></li>

<li><p>I have been working on a Flash game for Michael's friend of a friend's project thing-a-ma-job
dealio.  Can't go into much more detail than that.  But it's called pic-words.</p></li>

<li><p>My website is robnugen.com, and I've been consistently journaling for quite a while on it.
Like nearly 10 years.  (Haven't really checked recently).  Have semi-short-term plans to get my TJ
Bike trip mapped out, and then semi-long term plans to get my images easily viewable, and then past
that, plans to re-do how my journal entries are indexed.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets, though Spot is still kickin' it in the US with Jennifer from Paint This!</p></li>

<li><p>My marble track II is now like 23 days old; I need to take some pictures of it soon to keep
up my consistent picture takin'.  It's coming along nicely, and has plans for its first two
switches, but neither of them have been actualized yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Otherwise I'm not really doing any art projects (unless I count my website as art, which I do).</p></li>

<li><p>I currently like Japan, and part of me could see me living here for a while, but I miss my
family and would like to go back to school to become a psychologist and get some skizzles in the
mind-helping department.</p></li>
</ol>
