<p>Aw cripes I am falling asleep pretty effectively on the way to work.  Today might be tough.</p>

<p>I made it through the day; a cancellation and Ami helped.  I was a semi-bad teacher for her
because I was focused on my marble track for probably too long.  I semi-jokingly gave her 10,000 yen
from my wallet (the smallest/only note I had), and fortunately for my budget, she did not
accept.</p>

<p>The marble track now has four endpoints, one at each corner.  Running four tracks on that
tiny-ass board will be a trick, especially given two large marble tracks.</p>

<p>Also had Tsugumi, the JR line programmer; we talked about shinkansen videoing and such.  I gotta
get on that if I'ma do it.</p>
