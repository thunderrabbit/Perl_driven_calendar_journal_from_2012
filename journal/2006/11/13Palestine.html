<p>From my friend Suzanne in Jerusalem</p>

Hi all,
I copied some links to three short films (each one between 7 and 10 minutes long) that are linked to
the two articles I have written so far. They have been made by the Palestinian/Israeli Alternative
Information Centre and are an explanation of the situation here in the words of Palestinans
themselves, rather than journalists and foreigners like myself! Really good films, take a look!
Hope you're all well.

Another family in East Jerusalem facing the demolition of their home. The Jerusalem Municipality
claim that the house was built only 4 months ago, and even though the family have proof that it has
been there for over 10 years, and even though the family have won one court case, their home remains
under a demolition order.

A 10 minute look at how the wall and Israeli colonies in the West Bank are being used to push out the
Palestinian residents of both Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
