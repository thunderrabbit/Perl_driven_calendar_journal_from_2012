<p>By my boss I was informed of the complaint email he received a couple days ago.  He let me off
way easier than Reiko (receptionist).</p>

<p>First student is late. (*)</p>

<p>For the record, Koji Suzuno chooses my lessons exclusively.</p>

<p class="date">10:18pm JST</p>

<p>Pretty good day in the end; I had (*) two cancellations right near the beginning so I went outside
and meditatively scoped part of Shibuya and occassionally repeated the mantra &quot;My heart and my
income are connected.  Blessed be.&quot; and occassionally followed my breath in a vipassana type
way.</p>

<p>Worked on my marble track some; now I have incorporated two of the three long sticks a student
brought from Starbucks.  I had asked her to write her name on them, but she wrote &quot;sakura&quot;
&quot;red-leaves&quot; and &quot;water&quot; ... I think I used &quot;sakura&quot; and
&quot;water&quot; today.</p>

<p>Chatted with Juno a bit, which also helped my mood to just be able to blather with another
teacher.  He's taking 4 hours of Japanese per day... so <em>that's</em> how he speaks so well!</p>

<p>Told him I may wanna go to school to be a psychologist cause I wanna help the world by helping
people.</p>

<p>He was like, &quot;kinda like the YMCA.&quot;</p>

<p>Haha.  yeah.</p>
