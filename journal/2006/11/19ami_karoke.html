<p>Went to Shibuya to meet Ami for Karaoke; she's been consistently taking my lessons for some weeks
now, twice weekly for an hour each time.  At first I had a huge crush on her, but now it's just a
mild flirtatious thought, and soon will ease into a friendship of acquaintence.  Our respective
second languages aren't good enough for it to go much beyond that.</p>

<p>Anyways, Karaoke was fun; we were there for two hours.  Francois head-banged to several songs,
break danced to another, and did crazy cartwheels during Livin' La Vida Loca.</p>

<p>Ami found Shima Uta, a song I could only describe as slow and from Okinawa.  I couldn't remember
the melody, but I knew it had &quot;kaze&quot; and &quot;noru&quot; in it.  I think I will remember
the title from now on.</p>

<p>After karaoke, we visited Donki Hotte (misspelled due to transliteration of Japanese) where I
bought an optical external mouse for 1998 yen including tax.</p>

<p>Francois decided to spend the night with Ami.  I hope he doesn't get into (nor cause) too much trouble.</p>
