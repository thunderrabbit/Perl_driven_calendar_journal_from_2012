<p>Just leaving the US Embassy after successfully finding out that I <em>don't</em> need to visit
the embassy to get my work visa sorted out.</p>

<p>I basically had low / zero expectations of anything but a wasted morning, given that my boss
whined like a baby, &quot;it's not my fault&quot; when I pointed out my name had been misspelled as
Nguyen on the work-visa approval certificate.</p>

<p>He was like, &quot;you should try anyway,&quot; and I was like, &quot;I don't fucking want to go
down there and waste my time and train tickets,&quot; etc etc empty threats, and then I was like,
&quot;ah fuck; I'm sorry; thanks for letting me work illegally.&quot;</p>

<p>And then I went and the Embassy was closed, and then I went today and it's not the right place
to go.</p>

<p>At this point I am going to have Reiko (receptionist) call the form given to me by the woman at
the embassy as the correct place to go/contact regarding the visa / name screw up.</p>
