<p>I'm in the train station Tennozu Isle, and the next train that leaves for Shibuya will leave at
12:42, requiring 14 minutes to Shibuya.  Then 5+ minute walk to my line,  minimum 10 minutes to my
station, 8 minutes to my house, = 1:20pm at my house.</p>

<p>Shit.  That is cutting it <em>incredibly</em> close, and it's a basic minimum.  I might be able
to shave off time by changing to Yamanote line in Ebisu, but that's a theoretical possibility.  It
would make it faster only if I perfectly got on the Yamanote line to Shibuya.  The time would be
saved in the much shorter walk within Shibuya station from Yamanote line platform to my platform,
instead of from..... ooooh I know what to do:</p>

<p>The next train from here goes to Osaki...</p>

<p class="date">12:32pm JST</p>

<p>Okay.  I'm on the train for Osaki, which is on the Yamanote line.  I can switch at that station
(instead of waiting for 10 minutes for the next train to go all the way to Shibuya) to the Yamanote
line (which leaves like every 5 minutes).  I am 99% sure Osaki is on Yamanote line.</p>

<p class="date">12:43pm JST</p>

<p>This is working nicely.  The Yamanote train in Osaki was basically perfectly timed.  I will be
in Shibuya in 7 minutes from now, or 12:51, so I can get to my line by 12:55, especially if I can
remember which end of the train is closer to my line.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I know which end is the correct end, but there's not enough time to get to that end to make much
of a difference.  I moved forward one car worth in Ebisu station.</p>

<p class="date">1:30pm JST</p>

<p>Made it with time to spare.  I've already been home, showered, came back, got a piece of chicken
for a dollah, and made it onto the 1:29 train.  I could catch the 1:38 train and still get there on
time.</p>
