<p>Ended up catching Chris and Levi leading a posse of PB peeps to a nomihodai food fest, and told
Chris how I promote PB to basically all of my students, and some of them seem quite interested.  He
said PB is seeing the need for word of mouth advertising, so they may be developing ways to
facilitate that.  I'm thinking just some old advertising flyers would be hella great, and he pointed
out I could use those in lessons for tons of different grammars, vocabulary, etc.</p>

<p>I left them to it, feeling a bit poor and late for work (having to start at 2pm) and then
remembered I had told Reiko specifically to block my lessons until 3pm!  Whoohooooo!!  I hesitated
before heading back, but then decided I could just say that I called work and found I had no
lessons, so I closed them out.</p>

<p>Great fun at lunch; got to meet Mary a bit more (CC and staff), Yoko (whose name I had
forgotten <em>again</em> until Levi told me).  (I always think her name is Maya, and he agreed she
would be a good Maya, very earth energy...), Shuichi, Shian, and Wataru.  Wataru was hyper-genki,
along with a guy named Pete (&quot;pe-te&quot;) they held their own circus amidst the tables and
innocents.</p>

<p>&quot;Chief&quot; Shizuo was there; I sent regards from Petra in England (I could only think of
London, but I'm pretty sure that's not right, yet).</p>

<p>Food included individually baked (?) spaghetti noodles with salt, so they were sorta like french
fries, but brittle.  And hella long and skinny.</p>

<p>I drank mostly nothing, then orange juice, tea, orange juice, kalua milk, and something that
looked like strawberry milk, but was alcoholized in some manner.</p>

<p>Rocked outta there a bit after 2pm, and good thing too... even on the supa-express train (I love
love love love Tokyu Toyoko line) I'm barely making it to Shibuya on time.  It's 2:51pm and we are
stopping in √ÊÃ‹πı now.</p>

<p>Zoom!</p>
