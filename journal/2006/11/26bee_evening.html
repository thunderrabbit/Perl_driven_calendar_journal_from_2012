<p>I watched the David Blaine Street Magic video on veoh.com; the full 40 minute version is
available for download there.  Amazing stuff, though I actually still like the tooth one best.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>I studied some, basically semi-memorizing the sentences Shinpei helped me write last night, and
then watched the David Blaine vid, and then read Pirori's email after her BEE bicycle ride.</p>

<p>I want to do that next year.  It requires several dollars of fundraising, but I think it would
be quite a wonderfully wonderful experience.  Perhaps even better than my TJ Bike adventure.  They
rode 4000km.</p>

<p>But I don't know if that's just a big distraction from real plans of going back to school.  WTF
should I be doing?</p>

<p>So now I am going to sit quietly and meditate.  Plan is for 30 minutes; perhaps an hour.</p>

<p>We'll see how long I make it.</p>

<p>It's 6:30pm now.</p>

<p>15 minutes until I started falling asleep.</p>
