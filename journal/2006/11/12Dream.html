<p class="dream">Dropped off in an old neighborhood where I had been one time before, and barely
remembered where I needed to go.  I did remember and a quick question to a guy confirmed my guess.
Got to my friend's house just as they were about to watch a movie, so I went around to the back and
was talking to my i-group, who were standing on a balcony overlooking a canyon.  There were some
guys chillin' in the shade, and one guy standing with a cup of coffee enjoying the sunlight.  I
walked over there because it afforded the best view of the valley, about which we soon started
talking.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;where would you go, given a choice anywhere in the valley?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And I chose a particular hiking trail, which apparently a couple of others had also
chosen.  There were rumors that whales had fallen from the sky and landed on the mountain across
from us, where they were found by hikers recently.</p>

<p class="dream">In fact, in turned out, there was a whale right here, within viewing distance from
the balcony, though it was on the other side of the valley and I climbed down to go stand by it with
Francois to get a picture.</p>

<p class="dream">The whale was facing downward, with its belly still lodged in the rocks.  It was
still fresh, but dead, as it didn't react when I put Francois on its fin so that Francois' ears were
pulled down by gravity.  I took the picture facing upward, facing their faces, but with the ears
explaining gravity or a strange backwind/current.</p>

<p class="dream">I wanted to get a picture with me standing next to the whale, but I woke up.</p>
