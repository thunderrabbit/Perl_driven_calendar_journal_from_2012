<p>Tonight I wasn't 100% genki with Shinpei at our language exchange, and I decided buying a new
book and starting from &quot;scratch&quot; was just the thing I needed to do.  We headed to Book
First in Shibuya and I decided on Minna No Nihongo, even though I didn't like the book when I first
started studying, but perhaps this time with the workbook and CDs to go along with it, I'd enjoy it
more.  I can listen to the CDs at night; they contain only spoken Japanese and no pesky English
translation.</p>

<p>Totaly price for the two books and 4 CDs: $95.</p>

<p>Didn't take the plunge.  Wanna try to get some of dat shit used.</p>

<p>Just looked on Amazon and found basically the same prices and 4 to 6 weeks delivery.  Sigh.</p>
