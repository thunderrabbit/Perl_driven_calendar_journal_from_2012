<p>Today has been (and should continue to be) a pretty awesome day at work.  No show to start, and
basically all of my students are mid to high level English speakers, not including one, but she's
happy just by reading reading reading reading despite super low comprehension.  I've learned to not
correct more than pronunciation, which often includes corrections like pronouncing &quot;New
Year's&quot; as &quot;New Year's&quot; instead of &quot;New York&quot;</p>

<p>My next student (4:20 ~ 5:00) has been here 8 times including his level check, and taken my
lesson every time.  Perhaps he just locked on to me after luck-o-the-draw I did his level
check.  Anyway, in our lessons, he always seems to be in an arm crossing competition, trying to
seem the least interested in the conversation. </p>

<p>He cancelled.  A whole new level of disinterest has been reached!</p>

<p>Wow; so far three no shows today!</p>

<p>Last few lessons were lovely; I especially enjoyed cruise ship chat, days old chat, marble track
chat, TJ Bike chat, diary correction and something else I forgot.</p>
