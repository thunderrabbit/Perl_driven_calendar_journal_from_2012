Hello all,

So today is day two of the federal troops entry into Oaxaca.  The people
put up incredible nonviolent resistance.  Folks were laying in front of
bulldozers and other military machinery to prevent it from entering the
city.  They held them off for hours.  The barricades were reinforced with
many people.  A friend that came into town by bus on the first day said he
saw a march of 2,000 people walking in to the city by foot from their
rural village to show support, they were over an hour away at the time so
who knows how far they walked.

Three have been killed by the police including a 12 year old.  Atleast 36
have been arrested.  At one point they were entering private homes and
searching for people.  They have reclaimed the center square and destroyed
all the tarps and such the teachers were living under. They are blockading
all entrances to the center square in atleast 8 areas by standing shoulder
to shoulder with full riot gear.  They have cleared out some barricades
but many still remain. Thousands of people responded today with three
marches that came together at a local church.  The teachers who have been
displaced by the police are setting up a new encampment by the church.
Tonight they will sleep with few blankets or tarps but tomorrow they told
us reinforcements are coming.

My biggest worry right now...the main communication for the movement is a
radio station at the university, the head of the university has taken a
stand stating that they are autonomous and thus the federal police can't
occupy the campus.  Which has held them off...they have surrounded it but
not entered but I worry about if that will last.  They cut the electricity
yesterday and the station was down but within an hour they had a
generator and were back on the air!

I can not see the point of this federal intervention.  If they truly
wanted to "restore order" they would remove Ulises and his corrupt
violently repressive government as the people are demanding.  They are the
ones that killed Brad Will and 15 others.  Instead the federal government
has come in and carried on the same human rights abuses as the state
government.  And you can not stop a movement of people standing up for
their rights with violence.  Instead the movement has become more unified
and more determined.  I have no idea how this will end or how the federal
government could ever proclaim that they have achieved their goals.  But I
do know the acheivements made by the movement can not be underestimated
and that how ever this chapter ends the struggle will continue.

Right before the federal police moved in I wrote this piece for Left Turn
magazine, I tried to compare the neoliberal plans for Oaxaca with those of
APPO, might be helpful background info as you hear about the current
events...

A popular uprising, shaking the roots of a long held exploitive power
dynamic, is occurring in Oaxaca, Mexico.  Not only is it threatening the
corrupt and repressive government that has held control of the region for
years, the movement is also creating an alternative structure for popular
governance. Beginning as a teacher's strike and evolving into a full scale
popular struggle, the movement has relied on creative nonviolent direct
action to stop the state government from functioning and to demand the
resignation of the current Governor, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  The impact of the
struggle is reaching beyond the state of Oaxaca, adding strength to
movements rooted in the poorest classes throughout Mexico.

Ripe for Revolt

Extreme inequality combined with a history of exploitation and resistance
has made the Oaxaca community ripe for revolt.  A system of popular
education providing widespread understanding of the roots of the situation
has helped lay the groundwork for today's mobilization.  But what takes a
movement over that edge, where the status quo of society is interrupted,
and those involved are willing to sacrifice everything for change?

Seventy percent of the 3.5 million people who live in the state of Oaxaca
are indigenous.  Over half live in poverty, 35 percent do not have piped
water in their homes.  In 46 percent of the households there is at least
one person who has had to migrate to the United States due to government
reforms which have destroyed the economy in their community through the
implementation of free trade agreements and other neo-liberal policies.
These policies have removed subsidies for basic needs and have forced
Mexican farmers to lower their prices to compete with U.S. farm exports.
Publicly owned enterprises have been privatized and sold to foreign
investors, destroying unions and jobs opportunities.

The right-wing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held control of
Oaxaca for the past 80 years.  The current governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz, a
carbon copy of the most corrupt PRI leadership, has worked hard to
implement these neo-liberal projects, lining his own pockets while
repressing all public opinion against them.

Unable to be elected democratically, Ulises was forced to steal his
position through vote buying, ballot box tampering and computer fraud.  On
December 1st 2004, his first day as Governor, 40 armed men occupied the
offices of Noticias, the states largest daily newspaper which had
documented the election fraud.  After six months in office Ulises has
already received warnings from eight international and national human
rights organizations.  The exact numbers are hard to determine but it is
estimated that 38 people have been killed and 130 have been imprisoned for
political reasons since he came to power.

The murder and imprisonment of social leaders in Oaxaca is necessary for
the implementation of Plan Puebla Pananma (PPP), a neo-liberal development
project strongly supported by the United States.  The PPP states as one of
its main goals to improve the conditions for the people of the region,
however, in actuality, it will steal land from indigenous people for
infrastructure projects and commodify their culture for the tourist
industry.  One of  the plans with huge implications for Oaxaca is the
creation of a super highway at Mexico's skinniest point, the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec, in order to move resources more readily across the land from
the Atlantic to the Pacific and into the hands of multinational
corporations.  This transportation corridor will be surrounded by
sweatshops, maquiladoras, free of labor and environmental laws. According
to Florentino Lopez Martinez, a member of the movement, "For all of these
objectives, the government of Oaxaca is key, so that these projects can be
realized."

Teacher's Union Strike

For the past 26 years Section 22 of the National Union of Education
Workers has held an annual statewide strike. The Mexican constitution
demands that all children have the same access to education, and yet today
in Oaxaca the average person spends only 5.6 years in school, two years
less than the national average. Rural schools lack basic infrastructure.
Children often come to school hungry and barefoot and have to work without
desks, books and pencils.

Section 22 has had a strong and radical history standing up to the
privatization of education and has become a powerful force in the
state-wide struggle for social justice. The teacher's themselves are often
community leaders, in the unions history over one hundred teachers have
been killed standing up for much needed change in Oaxaca.  The demands for
this year's strike include raises, basic supplies and breakfast for the
students.  Each year the teachers camp out in the main square of Oaxaca
city until an adequate compromise is reached.

This year, rather than continuing negotiations, the government chose
repression as a means to end the strike.  At 4:30 a.m. on June 14th while
40,000 teachers and their families were sleeping, thousands of police
raided the encampment, burned the teacher's belongings, injured 100 people
and fired teargas into the crowd from police helicopters.  During the
attack the teachers resisted with sticks and rocks, reclaiming the square
later the same day.

Formation of the Popular Assembly

Outraged at the repression, two days later 400,000 people participated in
a mega march to show support for the teachers and to call for the
resignation of Governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  A new entity, the Popular
Assembly of the People of Oaxaca (APPO), was formed of the 350 social
organizations that mobilized alongside the teachers' strike, soon to
include Section 22 itself.  "APPO does not set out to impose any
decisions," Florentino explains, "what we want is to integrate all the
people so that together we can organize and govern the state."

The primary strategy to achieve the resignation of Ulises Ruiz Ortiz has
been to create a state of ungovernability through non-violent direct
action.  To stop the current state government from functioning
encampments of hundreds of teachers and supporters have been established
outside government buildings preventing employees from entering.  Without
any other choice, the state government has attempted to meet outside the
city in fancy hotels, but the movement has been quick to organize and
prevent such gatherings.  Additionally, government vehicles have been
"reclaimed" by the movement,  state-wide strikes have been orchestrated,
banks have been shut down and major highways have been blockaded. Radio
and TV stations have been taken over to provide means of communication and
coordination for the movement.

Repression Continues

Resorting to the usual tactics, Ulises' government issued arrest warrants
for at least 80 movement "leaders," including members of the teachers'
union.  Five have been abducted from the street by unmarked vans, photos
of two severely beaten were seen in the local news, and plain clothed
state police and soldiers have killed eleven, attempting to instigate fear
and intimidation.  Publicly Ulises has tried to play down the impact of
the movement and claims to rely on peaceful dialogue to solve the
conflict.

Nowhere are movement members safe from the threat of armed attack.  People
have been killed while simply handing out coffee to late night barricades,
while participating in a march, or while leaving a neighborhood APPO
meeting.  On October 27th Brad Will, a New York City Indy Media journalist
was killed while filming a barricade attack by plain clothed police.
Death threats are not uncommon.  A website called Oaxaca en Paz shows the
faces of APPO members with their names and home addresses, encouraging
people to "find and detain them."  Those already killed were marked with a
large red X across their faces.  Remarkably, through all of this the
movement remains strong and dedicated to not taking up arms.

 Federal Government Intervention

The threat of a large scale federal repression has been looming throughout
the length of this struggle.  As the media repeats President Fox's
reassurances that the federal government will not resort to violence,
thousands of soldiers and police have been relocated to the region.
Attempts have been made to create justifications and to garner support for
federal intervention.  Men claiming to be guerilla resistance fighters (in
their oddly shiny new boots and uniforms) were reported to be gathering in
the Northern mountain villages.  As expected the federal government has
found support from the upper classes for intervention, although some
members of the business community have made a stand against such actions.
 "We, the business community, have been asked to support the entrance of
government forces with the pretext of re-establishing law and order,"
explained Luis Hogarte Chea, however he can not support federal action
"knowing full well that these laws have been violated and broken on many
more occasions and in ways much more grave, by the government itself."

Recognizing Ulises as an illegitimate power, APPO has refused to negotiate
with the state government since the 14th of June.  Federal government
negotiations have failed repeatedly as government officials have offered
only minor compromises, refusing to address the demand that Ulises resign.
 The Mexican senate, sticking to party lines, also refused to remove him
from power, just after 5,000 teachers walked the entire 280 miles from
Oaxaca City to Mexico City with this demand.

Persistence and Alternatives

Whether or not Ulises leaves office and whether or not this phase of the
struggle results in violent federal intervention, the achievements made
for the people of Oaxaca by Section 22 and APPO can not be underestimated.
 APPO has moved full speed ahead on creating a new structure of
governance, a means for millions of new voices to be heard.  "It is
necessary to have a government that is more inclusive, plural, just,
respectful of constitutional guarantees and human rights, more
transparent, with more input and participation from the citizens,
respectful of culture, languages, traditions and symbols of identity"
states the summary from one of their initial forums.

Multiple dialogues and forums have been held throughout the struggle to
increase national and international solidarity with the people of Oaxaca
and to continue to formalize APPO's plans to create a Constituent
Assembly.  This assembly will be made up of democratically elected
delegates from communities, neighborhoods and workplaces throughout the
state of Oaxaca.  The indigenous people of the region have a long
familiarity with this type of consensus based organizational structure;
many municipalities are still run by the general assemblies under the
traditional native customs of "usos y costumbres."  According to
resolutions from the first state assembly, "The character of APPO should
be broad, popular, inclusive, democratic, anti-imperialist, anti-fascist
and anti-capitalist."

Although APPO's program of struggle is still in its initial stages of
development, insight can be gained on the change of direction they have in
mind for Oaxaca's future.  The four main components of APPO's current
program are "the defense of national sovereignty," "a new model of
economic development," "popular democracy" and "social justice."  The
recognition of self determination is stressed as well as the elimination
of the "political, economic, and military subordination of Mexico to the
US empire and to the international financial centers."  The program also
calls for the cancellation and rejection of all future "pacts of
subordination," such as the PPP and free trade treaties.  Instead, APPO
calls for community based economics and an equitable distribution of
wealth for all, as well as the nationalization of natural resources,
energy, monopoly businesses and banking institutions.  Their alternative
vision also includes redistribution of land from wealthy land holders to
poor farmers, the move toward food sufficiency and organic agriculture,
and the development of worker created small businesses in the rural
communities.

To Act As If Free

Clearly the time has come for change in Mexico, and Oaxaca is serving as
an incredible model of a people demanding change and creating a new
structure of popular governance in the face of repression.  The depth of
need for this sort of grassroots alternative can be seen in the recent
creation of assemblies modeled after APPO in 11 of the 33 states in
Mexico.  Four have been created in the United States in New York,
California, Illinois and Texas.

The globalization of our economic systems is nothing new; the structures
of exploitation and of control are well established.  Struggles, like the
one in Oaxaca, are eroding these relationships, attempting to return power
to the masses and prioritizing the needs of the community and human rights
rather than profit margins.  And these struggles too are beginning to
globalize.  Mass migration and means of global communication, both created
by global capitalism, are now being used to increase cross border
solidarity.  No wall between the U.S. and Mexico can separate the millions
marching for US immigrant rights from  the people struggling here in
Mexico.  The scope of change required may seem unattainable and utopian in
the current political climate, but so many lessons can be gained from the
people in Oaxaca, from the teachers who have slept on the street since
May, from the neighbors who created and tended to over a thousand nightly
barricades to protect them, and from the sea of fists held high as yet
another casket passes through the center square.  As Howard Zinn
eloquently puts...
"after recognizing we are bound,
to act as if we we're free,
leaps in social evolution have come this way."
