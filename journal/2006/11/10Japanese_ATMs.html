<p>In Japan, ATMs rule.  They aren't always free like in the US, but they do so much more than ATMs
back in the US.</p>

<p>Like in the US, they dispense money.  But unlike in the US, they dispense coins as well.  So if
I'm down to my last 3 yen, no worries (except that I'm down to 3 yen); I can withdraw them.</p>

<p>Like in the US, they accept deposits.  But unlike in the US, they count the cash.  Bills and
change.  Count-em-up, instant confirmation of the amount deposited.</p>

<p>They update my account book.  I insert the account book, and it prints a line for each
transaction that's transpired since the last time I inserted the book.  (And in my case, it had
been <em>over one year (!!)</em> after I got back from my world travels.)</p>

<p>I can transfer cash to other accounts, including at other banks!  I don't know if this can be
done in the US.</p>

<p>AND; I just found this out today: if I need to set up a repeating cash transfer, they will print
a card with the information imprinted on it so I can just insert the card and then the cash and
zippity zoom, transfer is complete.</p>

<p>And, for that reason, Hitomi will be getting 60,000 yen each month until I finish paying her
back.</p>
