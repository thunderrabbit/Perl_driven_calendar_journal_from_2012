<p class="dream">Looking for a place to sleep in an abandoned amusement park ride, I found a hidden
room and decided I would sleep there for the night, but was surprised that four other people had
already made it their permanent home.  They were all sleeping on various couches.  One of the girls
woke up and beckoed me down, but then one of the guys woke up and was like, &quot;no fuckin' way
you're coming down here,&quot; and I was immediately like, &quot;I'll report you to the police;
you're not supposed to be here, either.&quot; but that did no good and I ended up waking up before
we resolved that.</p>

<p class="lucid">I became aware that I was dreaming while arguing with him, and wodered what would
be a better way: because it was a dream, I could just barge down with no worries, but perhaps I
could practice people-handling skills, or maybe because it was *my* dream, I could surgically
remove him from it.</p>

<p class="dream">Kris from Canada cuddled up behind me while I was looking for a place to nap in a
large room with variosly shaped stairs and chairs.  I didn't know who she was at first, and was
pleased when I turned around to find kris.  I tried to rearrange us so we'd be able to talk, and
she suggested we cuddle up in the sphere segment shaped chair near us.  When I got up, my underwear
was wedgied so hard I couldn't subtley wriggle it out, and everyone was watching..  I woke up</p>
