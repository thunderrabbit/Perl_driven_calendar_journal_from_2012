<p class="date">10:15pm JST Tuesday 21 November 2006 (day 13390)</p>

<p>Work was pretty cool today, though I misremembered my age as 13380 for one of my students, but
I'm sure it's of limited consequence, though it would please me to no end if she emailed me of the
mistake.</p>

<p>Anyways, I determined one of my students was like 13032 days old today, and will be 13333 days
old on 18 September 2007.</p>

<p>Met °¡Èþ during my break; she returned Francois (who I jokingly sniffed a few times in a
suspicious manner) and joined me for 12 minutes during my break while I chowed in the back of
Lawson's next door.</p>

<p>I had Yuka, who's worked for Google Japan for 4 years; I was happy that she scheduled 80 minutes
worth of lesson with me, and we ran through several different topics, including Google, my marble
track, her upcoming business trip to Mountain View, her husband's job, ways she can study, etc
etc.  Good times.</p>

<p>My last student is a guy who at first I didn't really know how to handle, but have got lessons
with him figured out.  He loves to just read the book and I make corrections while working on my
marble track.  It's a perfect system.</p>

<p>He stayed several of the minutes I had free after the lesson and asked questions about the
marble track as I worked on it.</p>

<p>A different woman I'm growing to like; at our first lesson she told me about a disease she had
that disabled her extremities for like 6 months, but now she's basically fully recovered, though
there is still some residual damage to her fingernails.  She's been writing diary entries and
bringing them to lessons for correction; the stories are generally interesting and/or hilarious;
really fun to teach.  She told me she gained weight during her malady; I think she's quite optimal
now, though she still wants to lose some.</p>

<p>(( I'm reminded of the time Fricke looked down at Spot, not knowing he was my cat, and said,
&quot;that cat is of optimal weight.&quot;  Awesome.  ))</p>

<p>Overall pretty good day today.</p>
