<p>Went to PB departure ceremony today, but super tired last night being up until 2am so I fell
asleep on the train, missed the stop and ended up at the next (主点) station on the line, which
wasted about 8 minutes.  Running up to the port, I passed 背が高い Levi, and thought it was him, but
didn't think <em>he</em> would be late.   He caught up to me, &quot;I couldn't stand to see Rob
running past me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, it <em>was</em> you!!</p>

<p>We arrived about 3 minutes before 11am, but the ship left a couple minutes late (as in 2), so we
still got to see a few peeps on the ship.  I didn't spot Kazzah nor Pat, but I saw Sabrina (up on
the crew deck), Rei (front and center on stage for the ceremony), and Phil (after they were about
100 meters away).</p>

<p>On the land-side, Carla, Roberto, Ai (who is now <em>pregnant!!!</em> &quot;does this change
your plans to be on the upcoming voyage?&quot; (yes)), Maiko, Erika, Levi, Chris, Tomoyo, Maria,
Jen, and probably others.</p>
