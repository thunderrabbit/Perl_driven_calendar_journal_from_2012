<p>Akiko gave me a free Japanese learnin' magazine; I was super super really happy about it!  I was
just like, &quot;oh my god thank you; this is perfect!&quot; because I've been looking (?) for
something like this for a pretty long time.  The Japanese is pretty high level and the magazine is
designed to draw people into their subscription based web site, but I think it will be beneficial
for me.</p>
