<p class="dream">In a cafeteria after having seen Wende for a little bit and knowing we couldn't get
back together,  but sorta  wanting to  get some ice  cream or  something, I was  in a cafeteria and
invited to a table with my mom and dad; along the way waking over there I saw Amy Baby, and was like
&quot;HI Ami&quot;  and she was like, &quot;Ami?&quot;  and I walked away  semi-disgusted and walked
back, &quot;HI Amy&quot; and she was happy I remembered her name and said we needed to catch up.</p>

<p class="dream">Then over on the other side of the room I saw Ryan McCarthy collecting spinach
which apparently hadn't gone over well with the patrons, as he had been able to collect enough to
make a banana tree well taller than himself.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;yo Ran, if you get any extra, I need some spinach,&quot; and he
was like, &quot;is it bothering you guys?  it pretty much reeks over here;&quot; and  was like,
&quot;naw, it's okay, but I wanna get a picture&quot; so I took a picture of Ryan and is tower of
Spinach and then some others started to take pics of it as I went back to my table.</p>
