<p>Pretty cool at work today once I got started.  Bonus at the end, Tatsuya and I worked on my
marble track for about 25 minutes, 20 of which were the end of his lesson.  Definitely his choice;
plus he got to install and sign the long piece that starts at what will be a two-way split-sorter:
small marbles will go one of two ways, and big marbles will be forced along one of those ways.</p>

<p>Before that, ░б╚■ gave me chocolate, and I semi-jokingly asked when we would go to елещеке▒; she
was like, &quot;Sunday,&quot; when I expected a non-answer meaning &quot;never.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow. Serious?</p>

<p>Yeah</p>

<p>So we'll meet after ultimate.</p>
