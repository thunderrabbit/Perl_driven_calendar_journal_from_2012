<p>This morning I had a dream, but got stuck online reading
about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Sacha+Baron+Cohen&sourceid=robnugen.com">Sacha
Baron Cohen</a>, the guy who plays Ali G, Borat, and Bruno.  I vaguely knew Ali G was a character
and had seen an article about some other cat wanting to sue over the character Borat.</p>

<p>Cool that Sacha has gotten paid to be silly.</p>

<p>I pulled myself back into my own reality as I know that's a key to my happiness and success.  I
had laid out several Things To Do, which included write a budget for next month.  I did that, and
even put it on <a href="http://docs.google.com">google spreadsheets</a>.  (I wonder if/when that
will be the norm)  (really excited about the idea of gDrive)</p>

<p>I fucked up and didn't pay Hitomi 20,000 yen last month... but I had paid her 40,000 yen the
previous month, and I intend to pay 40,000 again this month on the 12th or so (and next month).</p>

<p>I'm a <em>little bit</em> early in Shibuya so I can go to Tokyu Hands to get a shelf and levels
for my marble track.</p>
