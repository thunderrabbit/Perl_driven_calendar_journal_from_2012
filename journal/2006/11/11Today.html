<p>Definitely sore and swollen tonsils today.  I cancelled my after-work language exchange with
Shinpei.  Thankfully, two students in-a-row cancelled their lessons today.  I just chilled out and
watched <a href="http://jonstewart.notlong.com/">Daily Show on youtube</a>.</p>

<p>Tracy and I had lunch together and talked about sex.  Not as in we are going to have any, but
interesting stories from each of us.</p>
