<p>I think I've found the perfect solution to trains that will take me to Kichijoji conveniently and
on time.  Catching the 9:08am train in Sakurashinmachi allows me to easily reach the 9:23am express
train in Shibuya, a train that features plenty of empty seats for my writing and front car viewing
entertainment.</p>
