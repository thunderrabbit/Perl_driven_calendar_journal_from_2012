<p>So far today I have successfully cooked/eaten breakfast/lunch, featuring cheese
toast by Michael and watched an episode of Myth Busters</p>

<p>Recently I was struck pleasantly by noting we will soon by in 2007.  Wow.  On the day of
(others') hangover recovery, I will begin stating my age as 37 years old.</p>

<p>Before Michael's bible study on Friday, he cleaned up the place a bit, including tidying up my
mess of junk on the table in the dining room.  Using that tidyization as a starting point, I have
placed a shelf thing on the table to raise my computer up to eye level.  This way my posture can
stay healthy, using the wireless keyboard and optical mouse I bought recently for 1000 yen.</p>

<p>The shelf thing is a cardboard box; I'm happy with the setup.</p>

<p>I just took a pic, plugged in my USB card reader, pulled it out before putting the card in,
plugged the reader back in, and the computer isn't reading it.  It's as if it's not getting a
signal or power or anything.  Stupid machine.</p>

<p>I'm just recording this as a single data point of the state of technology in my life now.</p>

<p class="date">3:48pm JST</p>

<p>I switched the mouse and card reader to the opposite USB ports, and now the mouse doesn't work
either, in either USB port.  The light comes on when I click the mouse buttons, but it's doesn't
seem to send click or motion data to the computer.</p>
