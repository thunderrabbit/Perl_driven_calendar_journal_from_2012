<p>While working at EV, I have invited several students to come watch/play ultimate.  Yuuko took me
up on the offer, and after 2 misfires (working for Jamie on Sunday, and getting sick last Sunday),
we connected today, just a week before a tournament for which they've been practicing pretty
seriously.</p>

<p>This was the day we walked all the way to where ultimate is usually held, found pavilion tents
and crap on top of our field for some annual marathon thing, walked all the way back and found
ultimate guys playing in the first field on the right; I hadn't seen them when we walked in.</p>

<p>I stumbled through explanation of rules in Japanese/English mix and she seemed keen to play.
Today was sloppy icky wet and cold, plus they were gearing up for the tournament, so we didn't
play, nor even practice tossing around.  Just took turns holding the umbrella and talking to a few
cats on the sidelines: Brady, Bruno, Jolyon, Yuki, Koki.</p>

<p>Headed back to the station once the coldness overcame the interestingness of the game; found
Koki, Kumi, and Myu-fa in KFC.  First time for me to meet Myu-fa; she's Korean and seems to speak
at least 3 languages well.  Koki I've known for a long time, and Kumi I first misremembered as Yumi
- she's got long arms and sometimes refers to herself as a monkey, which I like.</p>

<p>We chowed and were basically quiet cause I couldn't think of much to say in Japanese, and was a
bit embarrassed of my language inability besides..  I talked to Kumi briefly and she got to talking
with Yuuko, which I appreciated.</p>

<p>The other three headed out a bit before we did, after which we visited Sony Plaza for a second (a
store I had never visited in a shopping center across the street (that I've been to one (1) time
(with Nachiko (who helped me with TJ Bike after my accident) and Carol (Rie) (from Fighting
Goats)))), supporting my disgust with consumerism.</p>

<p>Said bye and stuff then I came home for a phat nap from which I have basically just awoken.</p>
