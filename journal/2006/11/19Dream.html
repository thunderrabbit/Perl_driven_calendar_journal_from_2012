<p class="dream">In line to ride a roller coaster, but e knew the ride operators, so we were allowed
to climb on the structure of the ride a little bit while we were waiting for the train.  One guy
was telling us to be careul that although we had permission, the train would still kill us or break
us if we were in its way.  I told my friend where she could safely stand out of the way, and
explained what type of injury she could expect if she got hit by the train.</p>

<p class="dream">We waited up near the top of a slope, but when the train came back around, it went
past us to the next section to pick up passengers.  We marched down the track a bit sheepishly and
piled ourselves into the train with a bit of discussion about who should get to sit where.  I had
immediately chosen the back left seat, and there was no question about whether I'd be allowed to
sit there.  Two more seats were available in the back.</p>

<p class="dream">As we started to ride, the train didn't go fast enough so we weren't going to make
it over a loop, and a guy was showing us a model of the track and where the loop was arranged.  The
track model was weird; the loop was a ring and I couldn't see how the train could get either into
our out of the loop.</p>

<p class="dream">I noticed a part where the track flattened; it was usually an inverted V shape
like a ^ so like a monorail, but then it flattened out to a __ so perhaps the train could slide
horizontally onto the track.</p>

<p class="dream">As they were discussing the track, I pulled away from the scene and found we were
in Shibuya and my dad had bought land there.  I was really happy and asked him never to sell it.</p>
