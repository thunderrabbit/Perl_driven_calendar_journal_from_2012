<p>I haven't noticed my age the past week or so; I guess being sick just made it seem
uninteresting.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'd like to get the textbook, or perhaps get …¿Ó¿Ë¿∏§Œ input on getting another
textbook vs just using the book I have already, etc etc.</p>

<p>And I need to go to the embassy to get my work visa sorted.</p>

<p class="date">1:31pm JST</p>

<p>Man, this dumb train is a <em>6 door</em> train, which means each car features 6 doors on each
side, and, therefore, only <em>30</em> seats in the entire car.  This is great for rush hour, but
terrible for daytime usage; there's practically no one on the train!  But there's more than 30
people per car; I had to stand for a bit until a seat opened up.</p>

<p>Today I think I start at 2:20pm at work, but I'm getting there at 2 just in case.  Actually I'll
be plenty early, so I can get some foodage from the conveni, and wait around outside the elevator
and out onto the staircase landing talking to whoever else shows up until Reiko arrives unless she
gets there early as well, which happens on occassion.</p>

<p>Then no break unless I have a cancellation or no-show (please oh please) until 7pm, at which time
∞°»˛ will come by with Francois; she forgot him yesterday, and has to cancel our lesson on Friday,
so I was like, &quot;it will be a <em>week</em> until I can see Francois again???&quot; .. so we
coordinated a rabbit-return during my break.</p>

<p>My sense is that it's been a while since I've done a State of My Life Address; I don't really
have battery-life available to do a real one (nor much actual time before work), but perhaps I'll
do one tomorrow.</p>

<p>Shibuya now.  peace.</p>
