<p>Fuck.  got in trouble at work today; a student complained about one of my lessons but they won't
say who.. how the fuck am I supposed to &quot;defend myself&quot; if I don't know who complained?
no I don't remember what happened.  No I don't know if I agree that I did anything wrong.</p>

<p>Bah.  stupid Japan and tatemae.  Why didn't the student just fucking tell *me* they didn't like
the lesson?</p>

<p>But why not enjoy it now?</p>

<p>My last lesson was with Ami; she scheduled me for an hour, and had an extra 20 minutes at the
end unscheduled, so we hung out and worked on my marble track.  Actually went 6 minutes past 10pm,
so Reiko (receptionist) may not have appreciated that, especially after I had gotten into trouble.</p>
