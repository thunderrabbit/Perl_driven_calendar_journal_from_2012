<p>D'oh.</p>

<p>I saw an interesting thing: the express train passing two workers in the tunnel, with the tunnel
lights turned on.  Just after the fact, I decided it would have been a cool photo.  So cool, in
fact, that I decided to (skip the presently waiting local train, and) stay an extra 15 minutes until
the next express went by.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (after the local train left), the workers turned off the lights and exited the
tunnel.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>now I know where the light switches are in the tunnel.</p>

<p>Hmmm!</p>
