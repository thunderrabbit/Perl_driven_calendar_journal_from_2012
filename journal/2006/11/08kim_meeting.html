<p>when I receive a compliment, just say &quot;thank you; it's true.&quot;  I need to make that a
confirmation instead of an affirmation.</p>

<p>become my own best friend so I can discover the positive qualities of myself and come to
recognize what I'm made of..  begin to have feelings of affection for myself that come from
intimacy.  If I don't treat myself as my own closest relationship, then how will I like myself?</p>

<p>To like something is to &quot;value&quot; something.  not just think it's cool.  When choices
have to be made among people, pick yourself.  Value means when actions need to be taken, you choose
yourself.</p>

<p>We can say we value ourselves, but if my actions pick someone else, then it won't be true.</p>

<p>Today I'm going to choose to do my Japanese lessons in an enjoyable and mindful way.  As an
expression of love and care for myself.  I may choose to do it again tomorrow.</p>
