<p>Finished work a bit ago and am waiting for Tracy to finish so we can chatter a bit on the way to
the station.  My lessons were basically in order of fluency, so I just kept that in mind as I
painfully slogged through the first five.</p>

<p>I told Jaime I would cover for him tomorrow in Shibuya.  My change of heart happened after a
student reminded me of the concept of just supa-working to an end goal.  Wanna make that green, so
I was like, &quot;I gotcha back jack.&quot;</p>

<p>Tracy and I went to lunch together and she told me a super embarrassing story: her b/f Ryo, who I
had just met two days before, said HI to me in Shibuya and I didn't recognize him.  Night mare.</p>

<p>But on the good side, she recommended me to one of her favorite studientes, Tazu, who's quite fun.</p>

<p>Wow!  That was definitely worth the wait!  Although we only chatted for about 5 minutes, during
that time Tracy showed me a <em>super secret</em> new way into the station!  I had been using the
main entrance, which requires walking further to the school than going the other way and into the
side entrance of the station even though it's on the other side of the station, due to the
station's shape, that side is closer to our front door!</p>

<p>Wow!</p>
