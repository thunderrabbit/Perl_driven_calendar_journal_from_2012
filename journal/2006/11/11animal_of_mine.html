<p>Since Kim's suggestion that I treat myself as my own best friend, I have started to take into
consideration ways I would treat my best friend if my best friend were myself.  Like when I lay
down to snooze, I realized my lips were a bit chapped and they'd be worse in the morning, but I
couldn't bear to get up to find my chap stick... but then I realized I'd do it for my best friend.
And I did it.  And I appreciated it.  No chapped lips the next morning.</p>

<p>This arrangement has transformed a little bit in the past couple of days to treating myself as
<em>me</em> inside an animal named Rob.  Sometimes I let Rob be a slob and just veg out.  And
sometimes I try to crack the whip and get some action going on.</p>

<p>Or inaction, in the case of me cancelling my Japanese lesson for tonight, and cancelling my
meeting with Yuuko tomorrow to play ultimate.  Animal Rob wants to meet, play, do, kill, but I
won't let that happen.  The last one is pretty easy to strike from the list, but the first three
are still there, especially since I don't remember what she looks like and can fill in the blanks
as attractively as desired.</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>I still haven't written the email yet.</p>

<p>And animal Rob doesn't want to.</p>

<p>Perhaps I don't want to.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is just a ridiculous concept that deserves no further thought, except it is actually
what I believe: we are each souls temporarily inhabiting these human animal bodies.  Certainly
there can be exceptions, but as a rule, that's what we be, says me.</p>

<p>But is it a beneficial way to think of my Self?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I wrote to her to cancel.</p>
