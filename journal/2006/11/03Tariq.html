<p>Just met with Tariq about the games we are designing.  I asked him &quot;what is the secret of
your success?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do a little bit of everything, and don't stop.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm 32 years old.  If I'm not successful by the time I'm 45, then I'll just let it go.  I
gave it a shot.  But until then, things like days off and downtime don't mean anything.  Why waste
my time?&quot;</p>

<p>interesting.</p>

<p>He encouraged me to look into pod-casting in order to publish my stories.</p>
