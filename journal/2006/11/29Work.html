<p>Finished work; last lesson was with the lovely loud Akiko, whose English is pretty darn great.
She listened compassionately to my story of getting in trouble yesterday, and then my story of Aiko
and how I'd like to get to know her more, but then mostly I talked about my experience in Jerusalem,
about how great and terrible it was; the Palestinians so beautiful, the soldiers and settlers so
horrible (as a hugely crude estimation).  Told her about Damascus gate bustling with commerce and
the funny guy at the bread shop helping me learn to count and tossing worthless money over his
shoulder; about Bethlehem strangled by checkpoints, and my bold dumb attempt to damn the damn system
by jumping the gates.  It didn't work for long.</p>

<p>Our lesson ended, and Reiko informed me that my next lesson had been cancelled, so Akiko and I
went back to chatting for about 20 more minutes; this time *she* got to talk, telling me about her
nephew's acceptance into university, and how (now that he might just slack the rest of his senior
year), he might start coming to language school to get hooked up with some English speakin'
skizzles.</p>
