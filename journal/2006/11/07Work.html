<p>Tired.</p>

<p>A bit distracted on the way home by making a paper crane for some sort of peace project for
Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  It includes a bicycle ride, but I don't know where the cranes will be
presented.</p>

<p>Not sure how I got on the Express train today; I thought the sign said local.</p>
