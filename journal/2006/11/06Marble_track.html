<p>I'm at the coffee shop where the woman ordered craft sticks (*) for me.  I've got my fledgling
marble track here, but I'm a bit embarassed to show her.  I'll do it anyway, just because.</p>

<p>(*) this name just came to my brain; it's what they were called when I bought them at the art
supply store back back in the day.</p>

<p>That wasn't so bad.  She seemed duly impressed, and asked to be shown a picture when it's
finished.</p>
