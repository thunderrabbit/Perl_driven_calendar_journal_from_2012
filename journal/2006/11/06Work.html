<p>Went 10 minutes overtime with Yuki because (I like her, and) she's working on a really difficult
English paper.  It's basically a freshman college level paper, and her English is at about 4th
grade grammar.  (wild guesses)</p>

<p>In lesson with Ami now.  She did homework and I gave her more.  We're talking about Francois now
and doing whatever.  I just turned this on to show her the hook on the bottom of the C of Francois'
name (in French).</p>
