<p>I've spent the last hours.... like 4 or 5 hours I guess trying to
evaluate various photo album software.  I found three basic genres
(not including non-free software): perl / PHP / wordpress.</p>

<p>I basically decided I didn't want to go with a wordpress solution
because I so rarely do anything with my blog.  I definitely don't
want a PHP solution because I don't know PHP for shit.</p>

<p>I found three free perl versions.  Maybe four.</p>

<p>I spent the most time looking at <a
href="http://dev.bobbitt.ca/">album.pl</a>, which seems pretty
powerful, but pretty fucking difficult to set up.  I have spent the
last few hours digging through the config file and the album.pl file
making config changes and spelling corrections (the latter I plan to
send him), but in the process of making these changes, I see the code
doesn't look like it will actually work as I have it.  There are some
"hacks" in the code that overwrite variables set in the config file,
and are overwritten in a way that is not compatible with how I've set
things up.  I can't recall for all of them if the default config will
work with the hacks, but I imagine they would have.</p>

<p>So, I don't know if I should remove the hacks and let the config
file do its thing, or hack the hacks to match my config file, or
change the config file to match the hacks, OR to just scrap the whole
thing, saying <em>thank you very much,  but I've had enough</em></p>

<p>I also looked at emAlbum, Free Perl Album, and Birch, but they
won't handle directory structures I have.</p>

<p>It has begun to appear that album.pl <em>also</em> won't handle my
directory structures.</p>

<p>Hmph.</p>

<p>In any case, it's time for bed.</p>

<p>But I've still gotta do dishes; Kazzah made food for us for tomorrow!</p>
