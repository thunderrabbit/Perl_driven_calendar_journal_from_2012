<p>Nice.  I just tweaked my 404 handler to allow me to move the entire
directory of pics from <a href="/images/YRUU/SWUUSI2002/">SWUUSI
2002</a>!</p>

<p>Actually (surprisingly), all the files were duplicated on my
server.  They were in the location listed above *and* in
/images/journal/2002/07/SWUUSI/ and I found google had indexed those
pages so I couldn't just wipe them out without causing a lot of
404s.  Definitely didn't want to make millions of changes, so the 404
handler was the only way to fly.</p>

<p>Thanks to perl, it was easy squeezy.</p>

<p>I've been hesitant / unwilling to post the code because it
includes some of my directory structure, but I can post a slimmed
down version.</p>
