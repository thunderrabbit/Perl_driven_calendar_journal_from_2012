<p>This evening I worked on setting up <a
href="http://emalbum.com">emAlbum</a> on my site.  I couldn't get past
one of the directory configurations; I am trying to set it up in
directories that *I* want it to use, and apparently something doesn't
quite work with what emAlbum wants.</p>

<p>The internet connection I was sponging suddenly vanished, so I
have half a screen of code in an emacs window that was remotely
opened on my server.  Looks like this (the first line being emacs'):</p>

<p>Then bang; no connection.</p>

<p>Read some cool geeky articles from space.com, and was surprised at
the number of pluralizations errors in the articles.
(What's <em>that</em> about?)  Then about OpenLazlo and something
else.  The guy is claiming that OpenLazlo is the wave of the future,
and I'll admit it looks pretty cool, but it has PHP at its core, so
I'm a bit not wanting to learn.... At the same time, I want to "keep
up with" web technology, but I don't want all sorts of ridiculous
flashy visuals.  Just want a photo album that works the way I want it
to work.</p>

<p>emAlbum will need some tweaks (or major overhaul) to make it do
what I want, but it was pretty damn close, so I'm going to fart
around with it for a bit.</p>
