<p>Kazzah and I are back at her apartment; we just work work worked
all day; I got a lots of pictures shifted around on my website,
putting them into directories that I think I'll be happy with in the
long run, though some of them are in long spindly directory structures
like thin vines with flowers on the end.</p>

<p>A kinda weird thing happened; I installed the latest security
updates that had been recommended, and now Software Update cannot
reach the internet.</p>

<p>Try again tomorrow and see what I can figure out.</p>

<p>I wanted to run Software Update again to get the latest iPod
updates, which I had been ignoring until Kazzah let me borrow the iPod
Nano that her school loaned her (as they loaned one to every other
language teacher and student).</p>

<p>Now: bedtime.</p>
