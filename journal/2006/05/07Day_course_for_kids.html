<p>Today, which seems like <em>ages</em> since the ten day course
which ended just <b>yesterday</b>, I was blessed with the opportunity
to be a server for a single day Kids' course in Vipassana
meditation!</p>

<p>I was quite hesitant to join, given my Japanese is not all that
great, and offered to just help in the kitchen, but I was assured by
both Toa and Yoshiko that it would be just fine for me to work with
the kids.  So I did.</p>

<p>And it was great fun!</p>

<p>We did basically all the same things we had done yesterday (about
which I have not yet written, but plan to, so I'll just summarize
here): made pencils, watched the fox-and-crow play, chowed absolutely
delicious (sweet) curry, ran around in the garden (I took a picture of
one of the stools I repaired), painted and finger painted, meditated
for an hour total (four 15 minute sessions), and did progressively
more difficult memorization games after each meditation.</p>

<p>Memorizing the numbers was pretty easy for me because I chose and
drew/painted more than half of them.  The numbers were 2, 7, 8,
11, <b>25</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>88</b>,
and <b>91</b>, all drawn on heavy stock art paper, and shown to the
group in order.  Then the kids were asked to write them all down.  I
don't know about the three girls (basically students here (and even
residents, to a great extent) are separated by gender), but two of the
boys (てんぺい &amp; けいた) got all ten, and ゆうき missed one.  (80
instead of 88).</p>

<p>The symbols were a bit harder for me (triangle, two concentric
circles, yen symbol, left arrow, U-turn arrow, @, music clef,
upside-down T-shaped block, U-shaped block, do not enter sign (white
horizontal bar on red background)), but the pictures were basically a
breeze: fox, black bird, yellow bird, bread, strawberries, lemon,
flower, tree, pencils, gong.  The first four were from the play,
Buddha is said to have become enlightened under a tree, we made
pencils, and the gong is gonged before every meal and every group
meditation period.</p>
