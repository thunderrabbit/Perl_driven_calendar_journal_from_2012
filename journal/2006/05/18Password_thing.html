<p>I am now pretty likely to use this <a
href="http://labs.zarate.org/passwd/">secure password creator</a>
from <a href="http://zarate.org">zarate.org</a>.  The only issue I
have with it is entirely my own: choosing a master password that is
hardcore but that I'll still remember it for certain.  I've got one in
mind, and I think I have it memorized, but it's still only in mid-term
memory, and not yet sealed in finger-memory nor 100% in long-term
memory.</p>

<p>One of the characters is not one I type all the time, so my
fingers sometimes miss it.</p>
