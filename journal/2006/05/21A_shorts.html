<p>I've had these shorts since before I came to Japan, so that's
three years and counting.  My supply of shorts brought over from the
US has been dwindling.  I had two pair on the PB when we started, and
one pair when we ended.  During my TJ Bike trip, the remaining pair
has developed a rather large + shaped hole near the pocket, where the
fabric has worn thin due to being worn with thick amounts of stuff in
the pockets.</p>

<p>I forgot to get a photo of the hole before I started to sew it,
but perhaps later, I may appreciate even a mid-project photo.</p>
