<p>I think this dream came after I was just sitting on my arse last
night evaluating photo album software while Kazzah cooked dinner.  I
seem to have really felt guilty about that.</p>

<p>Granted, I did go shopping for the food and did do all the dishes
last night (and I do mean night: 1:30am), but still felt weird playing
while she was working.</p>

<p>I was just so focused on using the wireless signal that had become
available and then sucked into going through all the delicious source
code...</p>
