<p>I've made it to Mapple 3 (which includes Tokyo), and am on page 2
A:3 at McDonald's.  I plan to ride 3 more km tonight to a river for
sleepin' purposes.</p>

<p>70km tomorrow to Shizuoka, then I can make ¾®ÅÄ¸¶ pretty easily in
a day, I believe.</p>

<p>I've just transcribed all the journal entries from last night and today.</p>
