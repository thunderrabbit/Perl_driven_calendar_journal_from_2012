<p>I'm pretty much super tired, and am not even sure if I am allowed
to be writing on my computer (but I'm leaving tomorrow and I have my
own room tonight (and last night)), but</p>

<p>I have overall really enjoyed my time here.  The 4th - 8th days of
the course my have super sucked, but the 10th day was magic, and
playing like kids after the 10th day was delightful, and the kids'
program today was great.</p>

<p>I'm feeling closer to the people who have been the backbone here in
these past 2 weeks: Toa, the man who was sat at the mens' registration
table and was basically the mens' side leader is pretty cool and likes
to laugh a lot.  Takaki has a shaved head and pretty good English and
is generally friendly and funny.  The guy with spikey hair makes
people laugh almost every time he speaks.  He's the one who made a
cell-phone shaped pencil.  "あっ、もしもし？" with a little clay
rectangle and long pencil lead antenna.  Hilarious!!  The chef, quiet
with bald head, has been preparing the most fantastic meals every day
since I arrived!  I believe he's going to shave my head tomorrow.
Akira, who I didn't really like at first because he talks too much, I
now find generally friendly though he just tries too hard to be
friendly, but always with good intentions.</p>

<p>On the womens' side, Karina from Argentina seems cool, sitting
through today's meeting with her eyes closed, but still smiling each
time something funny was said; the older woman from Germany who has
been in Japan 30 years talked with me at length the few times we were
able to speak; Yoshiko, our teacher for the 10 day course and the
kids' course is becoming more approachable; a woman whose name I don't
know but lives in Tokyo asked about language lessons for her husband
(I believe); とっこ (actually としこ) is friendly, plus tall and has a
cute big smile, like Tomoko the member of staff at 川崎 NOVA.</p>

<p>I'm probably going to head out tomorrow after breakfast, group
meditation, and head shaving.  I'll try to write/send a ROB Update
before I go.  Plan to go north to the Sea of Japan, then west to 琵琶湖
(びわこ; I think the kanji is correct), the biggest lake in Japan),
then to Nagano or Nagoya; I guess I'll miss Osaka and that fabulous
ice-cream-filled internet cafe....</p>
