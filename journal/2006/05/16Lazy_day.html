<p>Today has been a good lazy day so far; slept late, ate soba and
salad for brunchfest; Karen gave me some music from her huge

<p>I just cleaned up the dishes and now I'm going to take a shower
and sort through pictures on my computer; try to get past the lump I
was stuck at last night.  (determining which pictures are on my site
and which are not and why/if/how some albums have changed locally but not
on my site.</p>
