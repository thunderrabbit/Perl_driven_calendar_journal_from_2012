<p>At Tomato and Onion in Obama after a nightmare bit of tunnels with
no sidewalks and rain to boot.  But a beef patty and cheese to soothe
the antsy tired brain.</p>

<p>Just checking to see if there happened to be an internet
signal.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>I'm in TOMATO &amp; ONION, the sign for which I scoffed when I saw it:</p>

<pre>
TOMATO &amp; ONION
 ^ 22 KM
</pre>

<p><em>twenty two kilometers???</em></p>

<p>Welp, it's the only restaurant in this town.</p>

<p>I think I'm in Obama, on Route 27 on the north coast of Honshu.  I
Highly DO NOT RECOMMEND bicycing on 27.  At least not between Maizuru
and Obama.  I'm not sure when it ended, actually, but recently I have
had no sidewalk, not even in the tunnels.  And I went through 3
tunnels in the last 20 minutes.  Nightmare.  and 1 tunnel a couple
hours ago.  It's raining again and TJ Bike is covered and I brought my
backpack with computer inside.  Don't see any outlets through.  I'm
ready to be done for the night, but no sleep spot in sight.
Well,. there is a wide pedestrian tunnel nearby.  I may use it.  No
signs say д└дс.  Rode 60km so far today.  30km to their house.  No
worries.  If no rain.....</p>
