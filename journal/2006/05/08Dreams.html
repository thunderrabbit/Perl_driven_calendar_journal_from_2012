<p>I remember having four dreams during the first 3 or 4 days of the
course.  I don't know how much I remember of each..</p>

<p class="dream">Cuddling on the couch with janette, noticing the fish
in the tank had swam out and into the plant in the corner of the room.
I recognized it must be a dream and was like, "I'm really glad we are
dreaming so" and I was planning to say so we could see the fish
swimming in a plant, but just started bawling crying, "so I can be
with you cause I just miss you so so so much" crying crying crying
crying over janette.</p>

<p class="dream">In a shopping mall where some YRUUers were going to
camp out for the night in the camping section of a large sporting
goods store.  Walking to the location through a wooden railroad
display of the kid type railroad with various curves and hills that
all fit together with simple interlocking pieces, but entire sections
at a time had been removed from the display to allow walking space; I
could see where the different sections ended abruptly and which
pieces could be used to reconnect them into a working system.</p>

<p class="dream">A guy came up and confronted us offhandedly to his
friend, "these kids are trying to camp out and probably leave the
store in ruins,"... and then looked at me accusingly, "and there's
the ringleader himself..." and I noted that I was naked, though no
one else cared, so I didn't worry too much about it, but once we
started walking again, I casually closed my bathrobe.</p>

<p class="dream">We got to the store and saw Shunji, the genki 74 year
old student from CDF on 49th voyage, who was getting into a space
capsule on the side of the store that turned out to be an escalator
folded up out of the way until it was needed.  He said hello, but that
he had to go, and stepped into the escalator (like into an elevator,
but it was an escalator).</p>

<p class="dream">Walking along some railroad tracks, a woman on a
scooter riding on one rail zoomed by, then her husband, then their
daughter, but the daughter had huge (HUGE) wheels on her scooter and
couldn't fit through the tunnel they had used.  She had a great deal
of gumption and got through.</p>

<p class="note">(this dream is from just last night:)</p>

<p class="dream">At an inn / museum-ish restaurant, I learned that
janette was staying there, and was in the back garden!  Super excited,
I ran sneakingly around the back and saw her sitting on the wall..  I
planned to run up and surprise her, but she saw me before I got super
close.</p>

<p class="dream">Or maybe she didn't see me; she didn't react.  I got
up in front of her, "HI!!" and I could see why she didn't react.  She
was pissed.  "Do you know what it feels like to have " something
something something something..  and I couldn't understand what she
was saying; I couldn't understand what could have upset her... I was
certain I hadn't done anything wrong since we last talked very
happily.</p>

<p class="dream">I remembered part of Vipassana training and remained
calm amidst her storm of anger, and then slowly woke up.</p>
