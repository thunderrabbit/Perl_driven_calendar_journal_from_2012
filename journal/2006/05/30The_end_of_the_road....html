<p><b>The end of the road...</b></p>

<pre>I have bad news (and good news).

Bad: TJ Bike trip is over.  I had an accident in Hakone and broke my shoulder.  The
rest of the bicycle trip is cancelled and I am now back in Tokyo.

Good: I am basically okay.  However, thanks to the Japanese medical system, I
cannot get my arm fixed until they open tomorrow morning.  Yeah.

[[ I was just 120km short of Tokyo after traveling over 1000km,,,, and down to my
last 1300 yen, when zooming down a hill (too steep or too curvy or both) I almost
avoided hitting a car as I couldn't stay in my lane on the curve.

bump!

(tip)

sprawling slide, left shoulder first.

Ouch. ]]

Good news: I got some pictures, including of the X-rays and of the police loading
TJ Bike into their car to take it to the Odawara police station until I (or a
friend) can get it.  But I don't know how long they will keep the bike until
discarding it.

Bad news: I dunno when the pics will be posted; my computer doesn't seem to have
survived the crash. I am on Jesse's computer now.

Good news:  I have been thoroughly blessed by English/Japanese fluent angels for
translation and transportation;  Yuka translated at the clinic in Hakone and she
and family escorted me (and paid my way) all the way back to Tokyo (Shinjuku) where
Jesse's friend Michael took over and paid for taxi to hospital (where they said,
&#34;sorry we can't do anything.  That will be $100, please!&#34;), and to his house.

More good news:  you can help, too!
I am officially begging for donations or loans (please indicate which) to offset my
sudden deepening deficit of, so far, $500, which is likely to skyrocket if I go
into surgery tomorrow.

I will accept any amount thankfully, and pay back all loans, though I don't know
when.  <a href="http://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.cgi">http://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.cgi</a>  and click [make a donation] link in
top left corner.

Good news:  now I can empathize with others who break their clavicle.

Love and light
-  Rob!

oh, ps:  I don't have any idea if I will be in Japan, Korea, or Texas next month.  
About 33% chance for each one. (My Japanese visa runs out on 28 June.)
