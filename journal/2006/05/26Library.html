<p>I left Kazzah's today at 1:07pm and am now at the library where I
tried to use internet last time I was here like a week &amp; 1/2 ago,
the day I called Kazzah all, "I'm 3km from your house!" and by "her
house" I mean her <em>old</em> house.  D'oh!  That day the library
was closed so I didn't go &amp; today the building is open but turns
out <em>not</em> to be a library, so the woman at info desk directed
me to the real library, which is closed.</p>

<p><em>So</em> closed that the elevator doesn't go to that
floor, <em>and</em> there's a sign outside and a sticker inside the
elevator explaining why.</p>

<p>The building is good for one thing at least: restrooms.</p>
