<p>It's pissing down rain, so I'm really thankful for my new home in
Higashi Obara station.</p>

<p>I'm outside, but under a roof.  The wind is blowing mist at me,
but not too much.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>for the record, last night cops came and got my information while
I was brushing my teeth for bed.  They bid me a good night and didn't
discourage sleeping here, though I hadn't actually told them I
planned to..  Just said I was still looking for a place.</p>

<p>They checked my visa and passport.  I definitely can't go runnin'
around as an illegal!</p>
