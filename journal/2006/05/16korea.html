<p>Korea.  Small country just west of here.  North side; south side;
Seoul.  I, for one, have never been, though it is, relatively
speaking, pretty close to where I've been living for a while.</p>

<p>I've got to escape Japan soon... and it gives me an idea: I'll
change my days old thing to a Days until I must escape Japan
countdown.</p>

<p>ANYWAY; I must be out of this country by 28 June; I'm not willing
to become illegal and face the bad side of Japanese bureaucracy.  Or
I must get a job in Japan.</p>

<p>I decided during the 10 day meditation that my next project would
just be making money for a year or so and get out of debt again and
then do something interesting.  (actually I just added "and do
something interesting," but that is the general idea.)</p>

<p>I heard from Richard that Korea is cheap and we can save more money
there than here.  He also said he can get me a job there.  I wrote to
DruDaddyG who said basically said both the same things.</p>

<p>I flipped a coin and it was HEADS: go to Korea.</p>

<p>Korea.  Korea.  Korea?  Korea!</p>

<p>I need to go just to see wtf it is; people say Koreans are ruder
than Japanese (certainly everyone is ruder than Japanese); Japanese
are passive aggressive and Koreans are.. active aggressive.
Interesting.  Dru says he likes Koreans in general better than the
fake niceties of Japanese culture.</p>

<p>Korea?</p>

<p>Hmmmmmmmm</p>

<p>Basically if Sumidasan can't slash won't sponsor a visa for me in
Japan, it looks like I'm going to Korea.</p>
