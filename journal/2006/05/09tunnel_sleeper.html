<p>What's funnier than sleeping outside without a tent?</p>

<p>Sleeping under a tunnel <em>with</em> a tent!!</p>

<p>I'm in my tent now, set up inside a tunnel under the train
tracks.  It's a dark and spooky tunnel without lights, but with my
handy head light (not TJ Bike headlight), I was able to walk through
without a problem.  The tunnel is just wide enough for my tent to be
set up next to the stream that's flowing through the tunnel.  I'm in
the tent because the tunnel is dripping with condensation / water
seeping through the rocks.</p>

<p>TJ bike is under the bike bag that I got from the BEE Bicycle for
Everyone's Earth guy (forgot his name); I used it for the first time
today.  Twice.  Once when I went up to Amanohashidate, and the second
time now.</p>

<p>Instead of frogs, the babbling stream is my lullaby tonight.</p>

<p>(oh, I stopped in a little alcove (?) thing to meditate, but was
just flat falling asleep, and almost falling into the stream, and
only made it 45 minutes.  Note to self: don't wait so long to
meditate in the evening.</p>
