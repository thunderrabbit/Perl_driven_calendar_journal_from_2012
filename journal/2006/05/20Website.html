<p>Pretty much have spent all day on my website today, shlogging
pictures from /images/journal/YYYY/MM directories to directories that
describe the pictures' subject.  The moves necessitate finding and
changing the journal files that link to them, so it's a bit of a
trick.  However, thanks to emacs, I have been able to set up some
macros that do the tedious work for me (because emacs rules).</p>

<p>I basically needed to set up five different macros, but until
earlier today I only really knew how to work with one at a time (the
"most recent" keyboard macro).  I had saved some macros in the past,
but it took a long time to figure out how to do it.  This time that
learning curve was quite short, and may even be locked into
relatively longterm storage in my brain.</p>

<p>That's the good news.  More good news is that I moved 5
month-directories worth of files into about 8 different
category-directories.</p>

<p>The bad news: near the very end, I got a bit sloppy and deleted an
image file.  Fuck.  I stopped at that point, checked google and
archive.org for copies, but didn't find one.  Ah well.  It was a photo
taken with a cellphone, so not of high resolution, and there are
several other photos from that night (night of a typhoon
super-flooding the river in Tsunashima), BUT it was the only photo of
the driving school flooded.</p>

<p>Wrote to my website provider to see if they could recover it, but
told them I wasn't willing to pay any money.  If they can get it for
free, then great.  If not, then I'm lettin' it go.</p>
