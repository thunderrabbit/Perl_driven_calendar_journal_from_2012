<p>The weather became less and less threatening until it was actually
sunny and hot just before I arrived in wherever I am now.
Ishiharasan came to where I ended up to lead me to his house (again
the result of the ridiculous Japanese system of postal addresses),
where I took a shower and did laundry, then he treated me to a drive
around the northern part of lake Biwa!  It's realllly beautiful, but
a great irony is I don't really feel the need to ride the same path
on TJ Bike.  I've already seen it, so I can just head to Kazzah's.</p>

<p>He let me watch a video about lake Biwa and how the Japanese are
soooo in touch with nature all through this area, and I was like,
"yeah, right," knowing the amount of rubbish and litter I've seen
here.</p>
