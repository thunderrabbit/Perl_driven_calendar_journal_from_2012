<p>At 6:45, a man opened the heated waiting room and encouraged me to
sit in there instead of outside in the cold.  I did <em>not</em> try
to refuse.</p>

<p>He said the rain is supposed to go until noonish today.  That would
be awesome.  It's 7:02am now.  It's not actually raining at this
moment; I'm going to meditate for an hour, and if it's <em>still</em>
not raining at that moment, I'll head out.</p>

<p class="date">8:04am</p>

<p>It's misting like crazy.  Coin toss was tails: stay on
my <em>tail</em>, don't <em>head</em> out.</p>
