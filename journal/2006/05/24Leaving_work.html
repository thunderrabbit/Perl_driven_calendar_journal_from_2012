<p>Today I got emAlbum "working" on my site, in that it can display
images in its own little test album setup, BUT, according to the
author, it won't handle sub-sub directories..  I've got
sub-sub-sub-sub-sub directories in some case (haha like it's a
bigdick contest, right?)</p>

<p>Last night I finished moving all the files out of /images/journal,
a notable task.  Today worked on getting more images from my computer
moved online.  I lost a lot of time by not backing up marble_track
images before running iPhoto_2_legible on them, and it fucked up the
names because I hadn't re-written the regex that wipes bad characters.
I've got it <em>removing</em> ? ( ) / ' etc, but then I keep coming up
with filenames with more fucked up characters : \ etc, so I need it to
only <em>allow</em> :alphanum: and be done with it.  Just wipe
everything else out.</p>

<p>Gotta add that to the list for tomorrow. brb</p>
