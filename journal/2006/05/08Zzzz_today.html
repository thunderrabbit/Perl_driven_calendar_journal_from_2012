<p>Stopped to meditate in a cool street slash mall and did 30 minutes.
Then ate a smiley-face onigiri made by someone who did not take credit
for the work, and delivered by Akira.  Received a magazine map of the
area after asking a man if he could help me locate my present location
on my Mapple book.  The magazine map they gave me includes detail of
this area and Amanohashidate.  Perfect!</p>

<p>Rolled on, and didn't try to sleep at a temple (one rejection was
enough today), but enjoyed the chorus of frogs for <em>miles</em> of
rice fields.  Stopped again on an elevated sidewalk on a left hand
curve on road 281(?) but not pinpointed on a map yet.  About 8km from
Yura Beach, which I was hoping to reach, but just can't now.  Fell
asleep on stairs during meditation, and now it's nearly midnight.
Bedtime.  Haven't locked TJ Bike today: MiniMart with cat, °Â¹ñ»û
temple, shopping area meditation, now.</p>
