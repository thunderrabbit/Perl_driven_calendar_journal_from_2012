<p>Have been chillin' for a few hours at Yura Garden and Sea, writing
computer code and wanting to photograph the single-car "trains" that
occassionally go by.  The hazy misty weather has turned to partly
overcast and foggy on one side, clear on the other.  Bust mostly:
wow!  I bicycled to the Japan Sea!  Meditated from 5:31 to 6:31am
with 2 peeks at clock on camera.</p>
