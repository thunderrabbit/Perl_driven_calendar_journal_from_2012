<p>So super tired.  Been reading Coppermine documentation, labeling
photos, wondering if I want to use Coppermine; wondering how to speed
up the batch upload process; wondering how to set up categories and
albums.</p>

<p>Not logistically how, but conceptually how.</p>

<p>I fell asleep during the middle of that sentence.  It's 1:09am
now.</p>

<p class="date">1:21am</p>

<p class="note">(and then everything changed after I read "just one
more window")</p>

<p><a href="http://furius.ca/curator/">Curator</a> looks nearly
perfect.  The description is just about exactly what I woulda
written.</p>

<p>Only difference: it creates thumbnails on the fly.  I will tweak
it to look for thumbnails and create on the fly if necessary.</p>

<p>And it's written in Python, so it should be a fun intro to the language.</p>
