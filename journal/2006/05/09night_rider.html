<p class="date">8:27pm JST Tuesday 09 May 2006 (day 13194)</p>

<p>Aight; I've been in the McD's for a while; my computer is charged;
I'm full (and overfull with shake); my camera battery is fuller than
it was..... and I would like to call my next intended indoor stop
before it gets too late.  Hisataka (from the meditation center) gave
me his parent's digits and said I should call them a day or 2 in
advance of when I can swoop by.  They live near the north side of ÈüÇÊ
¸Ð (Biwako) the biggest lake in Japan, a place recommended by Anne at
Koji and Masako's.</p>

<p>I'm a bit nervous calling them, afraid of a miscommunication due
to language barriers, plus not knowing them, etc.</p>

<p>So, I'm heading out in search of a payphone.</p>

<p class="date">8:56pm</p>

<p>That was easier than I expected!  I'm to arrive on the 11th
between noon and 7pm.  Gotta get going!</p>

<p>Should be no problem.</p>
