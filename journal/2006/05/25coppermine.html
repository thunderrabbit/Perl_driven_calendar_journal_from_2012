<p>I've <em>installed</em> <a
href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/">Coppermine</a> photo gallery
thing, which looks Really Really good.  However, I haven't set it up;
just six pictures are available so far.  It doesn't have a way to use
the thousands of thumbnails that I've already got on my site.  I'd
rather not create all new thumbnails.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to figure out a way to organize the categories
and albums the way my brain sees them, versus how they seem to be
displayed by Coppermine.</p>

<p>I wonder how to construct a search to find an answer to my query.</p>
