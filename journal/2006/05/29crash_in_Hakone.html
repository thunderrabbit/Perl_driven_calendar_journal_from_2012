<p>I had been okay with the idea of my journy being terminated by the theft of TJ Bike.  I rationalized I had ridden over 1000km and it cost less than $1000 so that was less than 100 yen per kilometer.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>Now I'm being okay with termination of my journey due to crash and clavicle displace-fracture.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>The 14:30 entry was, in fact, basically the top of the hill, and I had a decent slash awesome zooom down Highway 1 to Hakone lake.  Then a bit of a
climb to 732, which, on the map, *appeared* to be a vaguely straight shot to Odawara, but, actually, has curves SO TIGHT that they don't show up on the
map whatsoever.</p>

<p>My angels had warned me twice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The guy who confirmed that was the road I was looking for said basically "use your brakes a lot"</p></li>

<li><p>Once I got started on the road, speedy zoom, then suddenly dismounted as I couldn't turn tightly enough and hit the embankment.  Dirt, dismount,
whoops.</p></li> </ol>

<p>I shook it off, got a photo, hopped back on.</p>

<p>Short zoom, then couldn't turn tightly enough to stay in my lane and *almost* avoided hitting a jeep directly on its door, but just sideswiped the
very back of it.  Bump, tip, boom slide for many feet.  Like 20 feet.  Thankfully the pavement was basically smooth.  Then hefted TJ Bike up and to
the side of the road (with my new broken clavicle (and TJ Bike wasn't any lighter than before)) and sat down.  Put my right hand on my sore left
shoulder and noticed a bump that hadn't been there before.</p>

<p>Oh shit.</p>

<p>I knew it was either broken or dislocated, and I remembered Phil telling me how he had dislocated his arm in Japan, but it took the doctors forever
to fix it and how it hurt like hell.</p>

<p>I was in the edges of passing out, but held on long enough to be thankful the driver had stopped.  I told him in the most directly understandable
way I could, "please use your phone; I broke my bone." (*) I didn't know the word for shoulder.  "kata"</p>

<p>(*) In Japanese, it didn't rhyme.</p>

<p>Anyway, he called and an ambulance came, wiggled me around to see what hurt, locked TJ Bike (at my request/direction) to the roadside guardrail,
whisked me to an outpatient clinic where I met Yuka, a patient, who happened to be there for some pain in her neck, who happens to speak perfect
English, who happens to live in Tokyo, and who happened to have a car available (with mom and brother) and offered to take me back to Tokyo!!!</p>

<p>"That would be a blessing."</p>

<p>Took the car to TJ Bike; the police unlocked TJ Bike and took it to Odawara police station until I / a friend can get it (because they couldn't
reach Nachiko); went with Yuka et. al. the rest of the way down the hill to Odawara.</p>

<p>I could see the road and see on the car navi that the road was SO curvy that the curves didn't even show up on the map.  Just
switchback-switchback-switchback-switchback like the last bit of cake batter pouring from the bowl.  Oh my god ... so steep.  so curvy. There's
basically *no* *way* I could have made it all the way down without an incident.  100% anti-recommendation from Rob to you: don't ride a bicycle down
732 from Hakone lake to Hatajuku.</p>

<p>In Odawara, we dropped off the rental car; they bought me a personal sized pizza while I contacted Carla (left a message "Hey Carla!  I am one half
okay; only *one* broken shoulder..  So, um, I'll talk to you later!") then Jesse to see if he could meet me in Shinjuku station, which he couldn't but
Michael could.</p>

<p>I am so so thankful for such wonderful bilingual angels taking care of me after my silly accident.</p>
