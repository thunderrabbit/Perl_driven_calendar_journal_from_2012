<p class="dream">I was driving Scottie, my favorite car, in Japan, and
having some challenges remembering which side of the road to use, but
I got it right as I went through a short underpass, then turned left
up this hill, and had to shift through the gears up the hill, but my
feet remembered how to do that.  Up the hill and into this little
covered area where I needed to turn left into someone's garage, but it
was blocked with an inflatable mattress standing vertically upon which
my G hoodie was hanging to dry.</p>

<p class="dream">I stopped and snagged the hoodie and went into the
garage to thank them for drying it and was ready to be on my way, but
the guy was like, "that's not dry yet [like  you said it was]."</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, "oh, don't worry..."</p>

<p class="dream">but he was totally into drying it, and set up a
heater to make it dry more quickly, so that I could use it while we
go on this camping trip, but then the dryer wouldn't work and he
constructed a replacement fan to fit into the end of a pipe (with
screened output on the left), but for some reason *that* wouldn't
work either, so he fashioned a small fix to fix that, and it was
quite close, but not perfect, and he cut out *more* plywood and made
a whole new exhaust fan unit, and had to install it backwards due to
some issue, and it therefore required ordering some really long
threaded bolts, and I was thinking, 'holy shit; all this just to dry
my hoodie; this guy is really determined..'</p>

<p class="dream">but I wasn't sure *why* he was so determined.  Was
it a cultural thing - take care of the guests, or an honor thing - he
said he would do it, so he's doing it, or did he just like
construction projects?</p>

<p class="dream">I came back into the room to help him and soon woke up.</p>
