<p class="dream">I was doing my second Vipassana course, and sorta
ruing that I couldn't eat fruit during the evening meal.  Some of my
friends were there, but they were not following the Silence rule, and
I was pulled into their conversation.  I pulled out my last 10,000 yen
note and put it down, saying nothing, but intending she also put down
10,000 yen and we bet on who would speak next loses the money.  She
took the note and was like, "thanks!" and that she would donate it to
the center.  That wasn't what I had expected, but I chose to continue
my re-found vow of silence.</p>
