<p>I've previously ranted that there is simply no way a passenger
airliner hit the Pentagon.  Recently, I heard about the third WTC
tower collapsing.  Actually WTC7.  Look it up.</p>

<p>I've been reading about Airplane Day and watching videos and
shit...  Trying to think of a way to archive things in such a way
that it's not all just copied to my site, and that image and videos
on other sites won't end up as broken links.</p>

<p>For me, video is the best; I may just snag some vids and keep them
somewhere.</p>

<p>I am now convinced that the pancaking theory of the WTC towers
collapsing is just rubbish.  Remember how <em>quickly</em> they fell?</p>

<p>From perfectly pristine buildings with relatively small holes near
the top, to FREEFALL speed collapse.  Did the jetfuel just *melt* the
enterior structure from top to bottom?  Not likely.</p>

<p>Plus, no steel girder building has <em>ever</em> fallen due simply
to fire.  Even jetfuel.</p>

<p>I'm just tossing these little snippets out to pique your
curiosity.</p>

<p>Do a little googling; the official story just doesn't add up.</p>
