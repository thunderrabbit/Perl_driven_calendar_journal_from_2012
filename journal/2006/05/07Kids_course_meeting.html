<p class="note">(transcribed 12:13pm JST Wednesday 17 May 2006)</p>

<p>We just finished a 2.5 or 3 hour meeting reviewing every detail of
the Kids' Course vipassana day camp thing from today.  13 to 17 people
(some of them had to leave to take care of things around the center
(cook, answer phone, escape the meeting?)), all (but one) of whom
listened intently to every bit, including a recording of the play (15
minutes), and to each persons' overall thoughts about the day.</p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> listen to every bit intently, but I tried to.
The meeting was held completely in Japanese, and I basically couldn't
follow any of it, but I knew it was about the camp from today.
Essentially none of the 2.5 to 3 hours was taken up in translating to
English, except when it came around to my turn to give overall
thoughts.  Each person was speaking in turn for like 3 to 5 minutes
and then it was my turn.  I was like, "what's the question?"</p>

<p>My comments were translated to Japanese, so that took an extra 2
minutes tacked onto the 2.5 or 3 hours.</p>

<p>Soon as the meeting was finished, our leader Yoshiko said in
Japanese and then in English to me, "now we are going to sit
[meditate] .. from 7:30" (five minutes from then)</p>

<p>I was like, <em>whoah</em> [blink] "okay!" with all the positive
energy I could muster.</p>

<p>Didn't we just sit for 2.5 to 3 hours??</p>
