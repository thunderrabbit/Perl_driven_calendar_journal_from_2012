<p>I've progressed maybe 10km today, but am now chillin' in a bus
stop on 175, just east of 560 (Mapple 5:64 L1) eating granola and
sticky candy (coated in granola by tossing them in and mixing), while
waiting for less rain.</p>

<p>basically no rain.  I wrote a good deal on S00p3r s3cr33t password
stuff and added the idea of session_id to stop username tamperage.</p>
