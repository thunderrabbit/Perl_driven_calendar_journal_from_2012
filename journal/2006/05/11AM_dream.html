<p class="dream">James Bond was just about to hijack the vehicle in
order to keep everyone safe from an oncoming helicopter, when the
pilot/captain of the vehicle was like, "hey; who could that helicopter
be after?" and James Bond thrust his knife into the wall in answer,
and everyone remained calm and he got them out of the situation.</p>
