<p>Today was pretty much productive; I starting building
a <em>cheesey</em> website <a
href="http://thunderrabbit.googlepages.com">thunderrabbit.googlepages.com</a>
to store Airplane Day stuff.  Very low likelihood that it will grow
into anything worthwhile, but it's a pretty funny option, I think.</p>

<p>Made carrot cake!!!  The oven was a bit hotter than the recipe
wanted, apparently; I had it in for a bit less than the requested
time, but the top got a bit burned while the center wasn't cooked all
the way.  It was still quite quite delicious!  And it was actually a
vegan carrot cake, so I could just chow the uncooked batter with no
worries.</p>

<p>Found some pictures for janette on my computer that I couldn't find
on my website; they are from her and Fred's visit here and of the end
of my NOVA days (and Olivia's, coincidentally), plus my transition
from Bell Wistaria to Millenium House.  A lot of my favorite pictures
feature Dan, especially the one with him riding Bluey through the
house in the background of a picture labeled "my old room" !!!</p>

<p>I've spent a long time preparing them for upload; they weren't in
iPhoto any longer, so I spent time smurfing the existing iPhoto-output
webpages to cull out some of the weak photos, and rename the poorly
named photos, and with some emacs macros, got all the links to link
back up after taking some of the pages out of the linked list.  Emacs
rules.</p>

<p>Kazzah and I had a generally lovely time after her work: we went to
the supermarket and bought a lot of half price veggies and came back
and she sorted out some meals with them, starting with stir fried
chinese vegetables and a delicious pudding that I really have no idea
how she made.  It didn't have quite the right flavoring: she tried
adding cinnamon, allspice, and considered adding ginger, but nothing
was working quite right (the almond powder she had used at first was
just about tasteless) so I ground an apple into it and that basically
seemed to do the trick.  We'll find out for sure tomorrow!</p>

<p>I chopped the veggies and we cook-camped on her newly fueled gas
stove in the living room as we made fart jokes and just flat had
fun.</p>

<p>Talked about some real life stuff; breaking up with loved ones is
never easy.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I've got permission to be at her work on the
internet <em>all day!</em>  I'm hoping to get a lot of shit done on my
website.  Mostly just uploading shloads of pictures to get them off my
computer, basically as insurance against a catastrophic failure, and
to get pics on my website!</p>

<p>Although, I still don't have a well-functioning picture viewer
yet; that is definitely an issue.</p>

<p>aight; bedtime!</p>
