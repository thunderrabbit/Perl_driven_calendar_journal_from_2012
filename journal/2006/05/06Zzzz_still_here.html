<p class="note">(transcribed 1:02pm JST Monday 15 May 2006 (day 13200))</p>

<p>I am still at the Vipassana center.  Really inspired to serve in
some way.  Repaired 3 wooden seats from deterioration outdoors in the
garden area.  Cut 8 pieces of wood from a flooring slat that had
served its flooring duty.  Bit trick to cut them lengthwise safely
and accurately with the available radial saw, where I needed a table
saw to do the cut.</p>

<p>I cut and lodged a piece of wood back behind the fixed metal
plates for bracing the wood.  This way I was able to line up my
strips with the saw blade at one end, and the blade's intended
destination at the other end for basically perfect cuts.</p>

<p>(Wish I had gotten pictures of the fucked up seats, and hope I
remember to get pictures of the finished product tomorrow when it's
light.)</p>

<p>Then lunch, then "rehearsal"'s meaning revealed.  Tomorrow is a 1
day kids' meditation camp, including a puppet show and several
memorization activities.  I helped paint and decorate and draw
numbers 42, 88, 36, 25, 50 and 91.  <em><b>Lovely</b></em> child's
play <b>fun</b> <em>all day</em> today!!</p>

<p>People I really met today and yesterday: Will, who wore the Aesop
Rock T-shirt so I really wanted to talk to him first on Day 10.  Dave
who I ended up connecting with even more, with cool world politics
knowledge and is a chef and lives in 高田馬場.  Masa had long hair in
almost dredlocks.  Shoulda gotten pics.  Prolly never see Masa
again.</p>

<p>Sent 8 emails tonight with permission.  Have NOT opened my
computer, but only because it's sealed in plastic airtight bag and
fully <b>off</b> (as of Day 1), and because I am not allowed to.
Argh!!</p>
