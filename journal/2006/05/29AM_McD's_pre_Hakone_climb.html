<p>At McDonald's in Fuji-shi Mapple 3p 10,D:3 at 396 crossing a tiny
curvy train line.  The woman spoke English carefully and brought water
to my table while I was washing my hands.  So awesome.</p>

<p>40km to Odawara, but Hakone in between has got me mentally stuck.
I don't want to climb that shit again, but we're gonna go for it
right.... now.</p>
