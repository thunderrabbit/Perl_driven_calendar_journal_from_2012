<p>Looks like I have stopped for the night.  30km traveled today.  I'm
under highway 1 in a cool <strike>bridge</strike> tunnel with a
grate-covered sleuce (sp) with ample water running through it.  I took
the opportunity to pee under a bridge like a bum, but without concern
that it would stink later.  Through the grate and whooshed away with
the current.  What a great grate!</p>

<p>I ate some of the veggies, cheese, eggs + sausage that I left raw,
grated, &amp; cooked this morning, respectively.  (( As I cooked, I
could tell Kazzah had, as planned, bought organic veggies.:  A little
baby slug was in the base of the stalks.  I didn't take a photo
(though it was cute) but tossed the stalk end + slug out into nature
(from the 7th floor; I assume it landed safely.)))</p>

<p>I am near ふじかわ station and totally called the next two trains
after R -> L slow then L -> R fast. (R -> L fast and L -> R slow at
the same time)</p>
