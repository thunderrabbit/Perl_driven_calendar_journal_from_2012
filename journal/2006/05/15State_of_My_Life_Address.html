<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I have just gotten up from my first night crashed over at
Kazzah's new apartment in Nishin (in Aichi, Japan (home of the 2006
World Expo))</p></li>

<li><p>I have ridden about 900km on my TJ Bike trip from Tokyo,
through Odawara, Shizuoka, Nagoya, Ise (down in Mie-ken), Kobe, west
of Kyoto, Amanohashidate, northwest shore of Lake Biwa, and now back
as far as Nagoya.</p></li>

<li><p>Kaz said yesterday I could stay as long as I wanted.</p>

<p>"Well, not years, but you know what I mean."</p></li>

<li><p>She doesn't have internet access available in her apartment, so
I probably won't stay too long.</p></li>

<li><p>She's basically vegan (but sometimes eats cheese), and we had
the most delicious meal last night: basically all vegetables, with
some beans and yeast and it was great!  I could be vegetarian with
meals like that!</p></li>

<li><p>TJ Bike sustained his 5th puncture (all on the back tire; I
wonder if that's because I have so much weight back there slash no back
suspension..) yesterday which I fixed with my last patch.  Was
fortunately able to buy more before another blowout.</p></li>

<li><p>I have finished the 10 day Vipassana meditation course.  That
was the stated main reason for riding TJ Bike to Kyoto, so I guess
from here, it's mission accomplished.</p></li>

<li><p>Since the course, I have found myself generally to be more
mindful, and more often relaxed about things, though I still have had
issues.  But waiting a day for rain wasn't a big deal, and the flat
tire wasn't a big deal, and the backtracking required to get to
Kazzah's wasn't a big deal</p></li>

<li><p>Also, I have felt little or no need to have a girlfriend
recently.  Not sure what part the meditation played, PB52 played,
etc, but I'm pretty happy with having no girlfriend right
now.</p>

<p>Not just no girlfriend, but no intimate kissing type connections
of any sort.</p></li>

<li><p>TJ Bike and I rode past the site of the 2006 World Expo.</p></li>

<li><p>During the meditation thing, I had a little switcharoo around
making money.  I'd like to follow the suggestion of giving 10% of my
income to others.  Giving / working selflessly for others was a
significant part of the teaching.</p></li>

<li><p>At the same time, I felt a great need to spend a year+ working
(possibly starting my own Amway distributorship (again)) and
generating money to get out of debt and have a way to support further
adventures.</p></li>

<li><p>I have felt a <em>great</em> desire to have a GPS during my
adventure, so I can display on a map at minimum different points of
my journey, and hopefully a complete track.</p></li>

<li><p>Still would like a helmet mounted video camera for some of my
downhill thrills.</p></li>

<li><p>Have semi-released the idea of having the next supa-newest
Mac.  The new Intel machines seem supa-phat, but..... this one does
what I want to do (see previous SoML for specs).</p></li>

<li><p>Only change of note: I now have 3.26 Gigs free HD
space.</p></li>

<li><p>During the meditation, I really pondered why I wanted to
write; what is the dealio with my website, yo?</p>

<p>Came up with an answer: my website is like an ongoing art
project.  I can keep adding to it and sculpting it and making tweaks
and changes, and it's just my little place to be textually creative.
Languages of HTML, English, Perl, Japanese, mixed with a bit of
mySQL and Javascript, all morphing together into a thing I can call
my own.</p>

<p>or some shit like that.</p></li>

<li><p>Have decided all code should be free, and plan to make all my
futurely written code be free.  My journal code is still not free
because it's not as secure as I'd like.  I don't want anyone figuring
out how to view private journal entries.  If I can lock those down,
then I'll release that source code as well.</p></li>

<li><p>Some forward progress has been made toward making pictures
visible on my site.  Starting with my iPhoto_2_legible code, and now
recently finding the FPV (?) Free Picture Viewer I think is the
name.. it's pretty close to what I was planning to write, and the
Full Version sounds pretty much exactly like what I want to write, so
when it is released, we may be rockin'.</p></li>

<li><p>I have until 28 June to get a work visa or escape Japan or
become illegal.  The last option is basically not an option, but I'm
not sure yet which of the first two will happen.  I'd rather not get
a job at a language school again, but I may have to.</p></li>
