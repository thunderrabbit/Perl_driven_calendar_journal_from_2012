<p>Kazzah got off to a late start this morning, like "oh shit; it's
8:30!" when she usually tries to leave by around then, but I think
she still left for work on time enough to make it on time.</p>

<p>I basically woke up, meditate/slept sitting up for 50 minutes,
then slept for another hour, and now am awake for sheezy, about to
bring the pudding and chinese veggies we/she made last night to her
office where I'll have internet all day.  yay!</p>
