Subj: SNS Memorial Game for May

Well, this is a bit of a long shot, since presumably up to 60% of you
have something better to do (note to Jerry: an EQ raid on the Infinite
Plane of the Howling Dogmen does not count) on a Memorial Day weekend
than to squander precious beer-drinking time on Ultimate. Also I am
confident that many of you will also be supporting the troops in some
fashion. Of course, none of this applies to me because I hate beer AND
America. So I will be ready to play. And by "play", I mean "stand
about talking feeble smack as assorted geriatrics wheeze past me".

Committed to a game this coming Saturday are:

1) Me
2) Chadwick
3) Steve
4) 0% of Andy

Please respond if you can make it. And agitate amongst your friends,
vassals, and allies and see if some them can be tricked into
attending.
