<p>TJ Bike just got a flat tire.  The back tire again.  This makes 5 times
for the back and 0 times for the front.  I wonder if one of my
patches came undone.</p>

<p class="date">8:23am</p>

<p>My patches were fine, thankfully.  I just put the last patch on,
so I hope I don't have another blowout before I get some more
patches!</p>

<p>It was a piece of glass.</p>

<p>An old man walking his dog came giving me advice in Japanese about
something I could not comprehend whatsoever.  I tried telling him I
didn't understand.  I did understand when he told me I needed to put
air in the tire.  I had just put the wheel back on, a process for
which I left the tire deflated so it would fit between the brake
pads.  He assured me I needed to put in more air, squeezing the front
tire, and then the back tire and announcing 「ほら。」, basically
"see?" and I started to get angry with him - just leave me the fuck
alone; I am not sto0p-3d; I know the tire needs air.</p>

<p>I sat down, meditatively breathing, trying to calm myself, wanting
him to continue his walk.  I don't have the polite Japanese language
to say I'm okay; please continue walking your dog.  He continued to
stand there (wondering what I was doing?), and I realized this was
not going to handle things quickly, seemed passive-aggressive, and
generally not helpful.</p>

<p>I got up, started to inflate the tire and he was like, [oh!  that's
an air pump], and I was like, [oh, you're right!] and after it was
about 40psi, he gave each tire a squeeze and was like, "stopu! stopu!"
telling me to fucking <em>stop</em> inflating the tire and I'm like
getting really pissed; and finally let him have it:</p>

<p>「これは五番目のプンク。前の一か月八百キロに乗った。東京から京都、今
帰ります。ぜんぜんできる。」(*)</p>

<p>And I felt bad; he's just an old man who's been through a lot of
shit in his life, seen the post war reconstruction of Japan, and he
was just trying to help,... but I didn't stop myself.</p>

<p>no way to take it back</p>

<p>(*) [This is my fifth flat.  In the past month, I have ridden 800
kilometers.  Tokyo to Kyoto and now back.  I can totally do this.]</p>

<p>He left; I finished putting my shiznit back together, then rolled
out. </p>

<p>I rolled on a bit nervously hoping to find a bike shop to buy more
patches, but they were basically all closed on Sunday..  Just came
across a shop where the owner was outside puttering around outside.
He was able to understand what I wanted, and offered me 6 large size
patches for 200 yen.  Awesome!</p>
