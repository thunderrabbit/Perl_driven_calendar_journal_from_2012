<p>meditated from 19:00 - 20:00.  Super good position where my legs
didn't hurt at all.  Legs not crossing, but bent in front of me with
right toes tucked into left knee bend.</p>

<p>My good 0.5mm pen broke, so I'm not using Kazzah's book to write.
this pen is too fat.  Though of something else to write, but can't
think of it now, it seems.  P, then bedtime.</p>
