<pre>g -

These are things I did not get you in Japan yesterday (*).  The house
puzzle boxes on the left are far more complicated to open than say, a
soap bubble.  They require 2 moves.  The box on the right is 21 moves.
I asked the woman about the biggest and she said 74 moves.  I was all
like, "hand it over, jack" and she said she didn't have any available.

"Just how big are these Supa Seventy-Fo's?"

She indicated with her hands about 24 X 18 X 12 inches.

Nice.

"Just how much are they?"

She indicated with the calculator on the counter: 57,000

(yen, that is)

I didn't buy you one of those, either.
