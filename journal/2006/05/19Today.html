<p>Gotta bunch of crizap done on my computer and site today.
Basically clearing pictures off my computer and making sure they're
on my site and moving some to new locations that better fit where I
think they should be.</p>

<p>I don't want to store images in /images/journal/... anymore, but
would rather classify them as a type of image instead of just a
date.</p>

<p>To this end, and in a big near-flub-up, after I named and uploaded
a whole shload of pictures from when janette brought Fred and I was
leaving NOVA and moving to Millenium House and all this stuff, I
realized many of those pictures (from different parties) were already
on my site (in the aforementioned /images/journal directory)
so.... despite the possibility of getting 404s, I deleted those,
pointed the journal entries to the new versions (that now have
human-readable names instead of 0.jpg, etc) and wiped them all from my
local computer.  That took a pretty long time, but is definitely in
line with getting shiznit sorted out on my site.</p>
