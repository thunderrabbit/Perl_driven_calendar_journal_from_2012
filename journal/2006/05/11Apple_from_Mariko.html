<p class="date">6:22am JST Thursday 11 May 2006 (day 13196)</p>

<p>Here at 東小浜駅 (ひがしおばまえき), a woman named Mariko has
blessed me with a large golden delicious apple for breakfast.  I tried
gently to refuse it, "but that's your lunch!..."  though I didn't try
too hard cause I'm definitely hungry.</p>

<p>She's an English teacher at a junior high school.  Her English is
realllly good, though she claims she's not ペラペラ.</p>

<p>She said the weather was scheduled to be rainy today and
tomorrow.  Erg.  I wonder if I'll choose to がんばって to Hisataka's
parents' house today.</p>

<p>Our conversation was cut short by the supreme accuracy of train
departure times in Japan.  6:22am, bound for Tsurunga.  I hope she'll
be able to decipher my URL that I wrote on her hand in the last few
seconds before she had to jump onboard.</p>
