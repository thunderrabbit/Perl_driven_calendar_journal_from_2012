<p class="dream">Someone telling the epic tale of how Bart Simpson won
the trust of the king and used the power to overtake the castle and
king's authority.  This was the long version of the tale, including
how Bart waited for each horse to be saddled up and each general to
get alerted of troop readyment, and then the signal was given to
deploy and Bart asked the king if he could borrow the keys to the
country, and the king, thinking no ill will, complied and then
promptly was asked to step down, which he had to do.</p>

<p class="dream">Bart had taken over the country without lifting a
sword, nor having any opposition to his new position.</p>
