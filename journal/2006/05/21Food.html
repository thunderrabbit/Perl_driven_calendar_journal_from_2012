<p>I made breakfast for us today; stir fried vegetables with ¤ß¤ê¤ó
(sweet alcohol flavoring).</p>

<p>Kazzah directed me in cooking rice (without a rice maker which we
forgot to bring home from her office), and it turned out quite
well.</p>

<p>Kazzah has just made lunch for us: miso soup and tomatoes plus the
rice.</p>
