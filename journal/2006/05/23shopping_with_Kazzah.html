<p class="date">8:00pm JST Tuesday 23 May 2006 (day 13208)</p>

<p>After work (study for Kazzah, website for me), we went shopping at
Apita, where they feature 1/2 price Tuesday.  It's a bit of a ride to
get there, and it was a bit rainy (big drops, though sparse) so we
were pleasantly moist going into the store.  It happens to be
downstairs in the same mall area from where I called Kazzah "across
from 'America' video store" on the day I arrive in her hood.</p>

<p>Walking past Starbucks, Kazzah looked for Leslie, who often chills
there.  Not there.</p>

<p>Instead we came across Leslie at the entrance of the store; she
came for celery (and got two big stalks at 1/4 normal price) and found
water on sale as well.</p>

<p>Kazzah and I separated and she focused on vegetables where I
focused on dairy (ice cream, cheese, and eggs) a bit of meat (if by "meat" I
mean "remains of animals pressed into little sausages") and granola.
Then I remembered wanting carrot cake, so I sought the necessary
ingredients for that.</p>

<p>Found (oh, I shoulda taken a picture) a display called "Home Made
Cake" which features little itty bitty packets of raisins and nuts
and sprinkles and sugar and stuff to make cakes.  Cupcakes, probably,
but yeah.  I talked to the guy who had previously shown me to the
eggs, asking him if they had anything bigger than the little packets
available in that section.</p>

<p>No for walnuts, but yes for raisins, and as he led me over there, I
noticed the ice creams I had picked up (3 * 200ml for 88 yen each)
were even *more* on sale if I buy <em>five</em>, so I grabbed two
more.</p>

<p>As we converged in line, Kazzah reminded me she didn't have much
of a freezer, but I told her it shouldn't be a problem. (*)</p>

<p class="date">8:15pm</p>

<p>(*) I have just finished the last of the five ice creams.  One
liter of vanilla ice cream goodness for 418 yen!  (At convenience
store prices, they would be 515 yen.  I saved money by gorging on ice
cream!  Whoohoooo!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Anyway, headed out and it had basically stopped raining.  Kazzah
went ahead when I had to stop to tighten my pedal (argh), and I
zooooooomed along with sparse traffic back to her apartment.  Didn't
pass her and didn't find her at the apartment.  I ate an ice cream
while waiting, and then another, and then guessed (correctly) she had
gone to the other grocery to look for more veggies (said the selection
at Apita wasn't that great today).  I started to head out in search
just in case, she showed up just in time.</p>
