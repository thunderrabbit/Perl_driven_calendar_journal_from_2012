<p class="date">3:13am JST Wednesday 17 May 2006 (day 13202)</p>

<p>I have combined my To Do list that I wrote under the bridge, and
the todo list I had written before the meditation, basically all of
which seem to be important, except perhaps asking Zac for a free
registration to WoW; with my newfound sense around money, I may buy
another one.  But I'll still ask him if the one I bought is supposed
to work with the upgrade.</p>

<p>plus adding a few extra items, of course.</p>
