<p>Slept until 1am, peed, slept again and rain (drizzly) started.  By
dawn, woke up to check stuff and found rain water had encroached both
ends of my sleeping mat.  Had thought I'd be safe up on the elevated
concrete, away from apparent water stains, but turns out the ground
(slightly (5 inches) elevated) closer to the river seemed drier.  Coin
toss said stay put, so I systematically moved my stuff out of the
water, then set up my tent and moved into my new home.</p>

<p>Basic plan is to stay here till it stops raining (maybe another
night) then head to Kazzah's.  For food, I have 350 grams of granola,
330 grams of peanut-choco blobs, 500 ml of veggie-fruit juice, 2
liters of water, 200 grams of dried nuts, choco-chip melon bread, and
5 packets of Pocari Sweat drink mix, good for 1? liter each.</p>

<p>Behind me the downspout splash tells me the bridge is still being
drained.  I can't really see a drizzle, but it is still bloody cold.
Maybe 10-15C and windy.</p>

<p>Just woke up after a few hour nap.</p>

<p>Still under my bridge in Kohoku, still drizzling, though it slowed
at one point, then picked up.  My food has been consumed down to 4.75
pocari Sweat packets (4 unmixed), 80 grams of dried nuts.  I flossed
and brushed and mouthguard in to help deter any further eating.</p>

<p>Still under bridge.  Still drizllin'.  I imagined making a new
marble track, with dates written in fluorescent ink and the marble
parking area aesthetically pleasing and easily accessed, circular
level installed on day 1, built-in leveling screws, that optimally
would be automatic.</p>
