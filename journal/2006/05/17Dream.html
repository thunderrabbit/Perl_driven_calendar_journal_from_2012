<p class="dream">Working for a survey company, but with VAX
equipment, I saw little snippets of log files and knew a user was
going to have a problem, and I knew the solution, but I had just
crapped my pants and had to go clean myself up.  IJust as I was about
to go to the shower room, the problem with the user hit and people
were dumbfounded and I stopped and went in and was like, "right this
is what happened" and they were like, "who died?" and I was like,
"me; now shut up and I'll show you what happened" but it had been a
while since I used the system so I had to call tech support to see
what hardwae to use to login to the system.  They said the DEC
terminals would be fine, and I was like, "aright" caused I had used
them in college. なつかし</p>

<p class="dream">Showed them how to solve the problem, then headed to
the head and realized I was on the next voyage of PB, and we set sail
on 12 September, which, after I got cleaned up and settled in my room
I noted and was like, "woah! Today is Captain Costas' birthday!" and
went up to give him greetings and best wishes.  I was quite happy to
be on the voyage with him again, althought there was some confusion as
to who was the previous captain; they were saying Costas was repeating
this time, but the previous time for me was the othe captin who I
didn't like and didn't even know the name</p>

<p class="dream">Went up and some other people knew it was is
birthday and were having a celebration / ceremony and he was busy
piloting through a pretty tight channel, but still smiling nd waving
for everyone who came up.</p>

<p class="dream">To get to the helm, I had to go through a crew area
and I saw a woman strapping herself into a swinging suspended hammock
thing with three seatbelts that she systematically locked down to get
hrself in a little coccoon of safety.  Walked past her and hoped I
wouldn't wake her, but still bumped her hammock a bit.</p>
