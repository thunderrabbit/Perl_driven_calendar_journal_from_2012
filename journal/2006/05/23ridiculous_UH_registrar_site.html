<p>That's about the worst way I can imagine presenting a phone number.
Cute little fucking phone button images?  How utterly inconvenient:
can't cut-n-paste them anywhere; website to speech software probably
won't easily tell a blind person the number; can't increase the font
size of the numbers for a semi-blind person to read the numbers, and
even to an average website reader, they require extra brain processing
to figure out why it is seeing pictures instead of text.  And, even
after recognizing the numbers within the pictures, they are hard to
read as 7137439050.  They should be formatted with hyphen separaters
as normal numbers in the US.  713-743-9050.</p>

<p>Now isn't that easier to read???</p>

<p>User Interface Rule #1:</p>

<p>The user shouldn't have to think to use the interface.</p>

<p>With my fax, I will include a note that mentions the same points
as above, but in gentle way.  I wonder if they'll change it.</p>
