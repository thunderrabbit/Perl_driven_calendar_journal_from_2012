<p>I found this after a mistype of the variety C-\ instead of C-&rsqb; to
replace the escape key (sometimes it registers two (or more) ESC's
when I hit the escape key, so I've turned to C-&rsqb;</p>

<p>Anyway, C-\ is toggle-input-method, which put me into typing
Japanese, which was annoying for a second until I remembered what I
had pressed to get into that mode, and pressed it again to get
out.</p>

<p>Then I had to check wtf happened.</p>

<p>C-h c</p>

<pre>Describe key briefly: C-\</pre>

<pre>C-\ runs the command toggle-input-method</pre>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>BUT, <em>that's</em> not why I'm writing.</p>

<p><em>Previously</em>, I had been changing the keyboard input at the
OS X level, and emacs would handle it by giving me an external bar
into which I could type, and then it would put the characters into
the buffer.</p>

<p>It worked perfectly well, like this:</p>

<p>ひらがな、カタカナ、漢字。</p>

<p>But it's a bit annoying to have to look in a different line-window
to type, etc.</p>

<p><em>Now</em>, I can just type C-\ and type right in the big
window, like <em>this</em> ひらがな、カタカナ、漢字。</p>

<p>Wow!  And this way, when I type control characters to add
html-markup, it knows not to try making those into Japanese at first
(though it gracefully recovers even if I'm in line-window mode).</p>

<p>This is totally phat.</p>

<p>Emacs rules!</p>

<p>Holy shit; I just noticed one more thing: when I type something
like this: てすと, and then hit the space bar, it gives me a
selection of choices in the bottom line, [1 テスト]which I can choose by typing
the identifying number of the item I want, or by repeatedly typing
space.</p>

<p>Oh, wait; I have to hit the spacebar a couple times before that
comes up.  It's to save keystrokes (and not waste processor time)
because usually one or two SPCs will get to the desired kana or
kanji.</p>

<p>The only limitation I see: up to 10 options are available at a
time, even if there are more than that many options.</p>

<p>But still, given that it remembers the chosen selection and favors
the ones selected often/recently (I don't know which; it's been so
transparent that I don't care) it's not an issue.</p>

<p>Okay, <em>now</em> I found an annoyance: I can't get it to print
the kanji for my name without typing one character at a time: 路 武</p>

<p>でも、すごいです！</p>
