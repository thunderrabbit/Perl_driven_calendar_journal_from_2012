<p>I got a call from Jenny Lee at the English school in Seoul where
DruDaddyG works now.  She told me basically it takes a month to
process paperwork and shtuff after both parties accept (they and I),
and I have just over a month left in Japan.</p>

<p>Shit.  I need to write to Sumidasan to ask him to ask his peeps to
make a decision Y/N within a few days, but I still want to be sure he
understands I totally appreciate him trying to hook me up with a job
here in Japan.</p>

<p>So I started the process of contacting UH to get transcripts and
diploma sent to Korea.</p>
