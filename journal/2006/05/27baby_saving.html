<p>On the west side of Hamamatsu, about 4km west of the station, I
was lucky enough to save a baby from likely concussion.  The strong
wind (against which I have been struggling all day (it sucks)) tried
to blow over a woman's bicycle with her baby in the front handlebar
seat while she was getting her other child out of the back seat.</p>

<p>Whoops; tipping; she grabbing the bike and squealing a bit, and I
instinctively just sprang over and caught the bike like a super
hero.</p>

<p>I got yer back, baby jack.</p>

<p>I don't know how I will make it to ¾®ÅÄ¸¶ tonight.</p>
