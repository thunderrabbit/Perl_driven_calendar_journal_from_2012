<p>Tired, but still fartin' around on my computer, making good
progress on my list.  Now I am determining which pictures are on my
computer that have already been moved to my website.  Gonna wipe from
my computer what is uploaded, and then start making more albums
locally to upload.</p>

<p>hit a slight snag with that process, but my brain is too tired to
untie it now.  bedtime.</p>
