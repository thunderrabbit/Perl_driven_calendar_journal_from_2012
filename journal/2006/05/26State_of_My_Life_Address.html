<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I am in Nagoya at Kazzah's house (Kazzah from PB 52; we were
GET Street roommates in GET 8), and have stayed here for over a week
enjoying her good cooking and fast internet at her work.</p></li>

<li><p>I shall be leaving today, though it looks like rain may
fall.</p></li>

<li><p>We recognized that the party is over; Kazzah needs her space;
I need to get rockin' back to Tokyo to say bye or get settled before
my encroaching deadline.</p></li>

<li><p>I must escape Japan within 33 days.  My tourist visa runs out
at that point.  I've got limited funding:  4823 yen.  I stopped
saving receipts, so this will be a fresh starting point if I choose
to keep them for the final leg of the journey.</p></li>

<li><p>For the past week, I have been working on getting images off
my local computer and on to robnugen.com, with a big well-needed
sidetrack of getting images out of /images/journal/YYYY/MM directories and
into /images/CAT/A/GORY appropriate categories.  Plus evaluating
different album viewing utilities.</p>

<p>For the record, emAlbum was high on the list.  Coppermine is
higher on the list, but it's a bit too powerful (*) for what I want.  I'm
going to evaluate Curator, which is apparently quite clean and simple
and written in Python.  I am still considering writing my own, and I
basically decided to write it in Python, so if Curator doesn't work
for me, I can adapt it or use it as a base for my own.</p>

<p>* though it's "too powerful," I really like the idea of people
being able to send ecards of images from my site.</p></li>

<li><p>I have started emailing with Hitomi a bit.  I'd like to start
a new friendship with her instead of all the chaos of the past.  But
just gotta start slowly.</p></li>

<li><p>My HD has 3.43 gigs free.  Slowly increasing the available
space by getting stuff uploaded to my site.</p></li>

<li><p>Right now, I don't know where I will be in one month.  I can
imagine three likely possibilities:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>39% I will be in Korea, close to getting a job next to Dru Daddy G</p></li>

<li><p>39% I will be in Tokyo, close to getting a job via Sumidasan</p></li>

<li><p>14% I will be headed home to Texas (Austin)</p></li>

<li><p>4% I will have escaped Japan for a longer TJ Bike adventure</p></li>

</ol>

<p>That last one I added on, but I think it's a pretty remote
possibility.</p>

<p>Then I took off a percentage point from each to give my angels a
chance to show me a whole new world.</p></li>

<li><p>Next planned stop, Odawara.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Aight, back to work.  (as my brother would say)</p>

<p>In this case,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>* cook</p></li>

<li><p>* wash</p>
<p>* dishes</p>
<p>* me</p></li>

<li><p>* pack</p></li>

<li><p>* load</p></li>

<li><p>* write (*)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) a note to Kazzah.  She does know I'm leaving, but just a thank
you would be nice.</p>
