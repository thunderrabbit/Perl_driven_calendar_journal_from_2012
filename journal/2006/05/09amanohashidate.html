<p>天橋立サクス。</p>

<p>Amanohashidate sucks.</p>

<p><em>Maybe</em> it shouldn't be experienced alone.  or with high
expectations.  (I said T2 sucked because it had been hyped up so much
before I saw it.)   or close to closing time.</p>

<p>Maybe if the ski lift had still been running instead of just the
funicular, it would have been enough fun going up the hill that I
would have liked the overall experience.</p>

<p>Or <em>maybe</em> if I had gone up that extra flight of steps (as
Karina (from Argentina) suggested), the view would have changed so
dramatically as to be amazingly amazing.</p>

<p>But, I didn't go up the steps; I was so anti-impressed with what I
saw at the main area that I couldn't wait to go back down to TJ Bike
and start scrounging for free food samples in the overpriced souvenir
shops.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I did find a shop with a great number of samples, several of which
were still loaded despite all the crowds having passed.  Chowed until
I could feel a dent in my hunger, then asked what time they closed,
and at that time would they have any un-needed food?  6pm.  Nope.</p>

<p>bah.  Oh well.</p>
