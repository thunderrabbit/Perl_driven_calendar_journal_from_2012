<p class="date">2:40pm JST Monday 15 May 2006 (day 13200)</p>

<p>I have just finished transcribing all the stuff written in
Kazzah's diary, though I think there may still be some stuff in the
clear packet.  I'm going to take a break and maybe walk down to get a
snack as a celebration for my 13200th day!</p>
