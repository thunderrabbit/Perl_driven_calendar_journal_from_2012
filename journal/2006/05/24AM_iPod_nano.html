<p>Nice.  This is my first experience with an iPod nano and my own
music.  I had listened to Will Smith's "Switch" in the Shibuya Apple
Store when the nano was first released.</p>

<p>Now I've borrowed Kazzah's borrowed nano and have my own tunes,
mostly NIN and Eminem and How to Win Friends and Influence People on
tape.  er, nano.</p>
