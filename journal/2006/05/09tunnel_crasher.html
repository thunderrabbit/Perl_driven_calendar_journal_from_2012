<p>Holy shit, I almost ate it bigtime in a tunnel.  Super narrow
pedestrian/bike path, and I was scared and nervous in the dark, going
a bit uphill, with cars and trucks zooming past, and I hit the side of
the tunnel and bounce/reacted back toward the road, and just had
to <em>stop</em> for a bit to let cars go by and get myself started
again.</p>
