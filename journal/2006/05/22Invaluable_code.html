<p>I found this beautiful code written by <a
href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/au/1840">Mike Schienle</a></p>

<p>It's a <a
href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/05/07/iphoto_perl.html?page=2">perl
script to extract images from emails and put them in mySQL</a></p>

<p>The code is beautiful and to me looks basically flawless.  I will
probably pick up a lot of its pieces and hopefully be able to give
props to my main man Mike.</p>
