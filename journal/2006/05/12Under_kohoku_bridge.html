<p>Under a bridge in Kohoku now.  47km slowly traveled today from
Ishihara's house, around the north side of びわこ, through some
tunnels (including the Best Tunnel Award in my informal survey) after
chillin' at まきの beach where a guy took some pics of me and was
willing to snail them to me, but didn't think he could email them to
me (yes it was a digital camera). (Interestingly, Ishiharaさん も
hardcopy をくれた.  I had to ask him for email versions.)  Oh, and the
dog, ラク, could kick the tennis ball on command!  Awesome.</p>

<p>Really ooky today.  I want to quit and my guts are all farty and
just ready to be at Kaz's house.  About 85 more km, I think.</p>

<p>Ready to be sleepin' and maxin' on internet and my website!
Write_log and super secret password thing AND Fred showed me an even
cooler password thing I want to install, plus I found a Free Photo
Viewer that looks phat as hell. In beta now, but full version "soon"
and will apparently index pics in my file structure, instead of
import.  Perfecto!</p>
