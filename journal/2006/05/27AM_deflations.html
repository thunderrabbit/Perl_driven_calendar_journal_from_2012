<p>Slept in the tunnel; headed out at 5:40am.</p>

<p><center>Five good things about nails:</center></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many homes are constructed with nails as fasteners</p></li>

<li><p>They can be used to point at maps and other things</p></li>

<li><p>They are relatively inexpensive yet quite durable</p></li>

<li><p>They can be used to make beds</p></li>

<li><p>They leave easily identified holes in innertubes</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding number 5 above, in today's case <em>two</em> easily
identified holes in one punch.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class="date">7:45am</p>

<p>Fixed both punctures in record time.  And now I know why the guy
at the bike shop used scissors to make the hole <em>bigger</em>.  It
easier to see once the rubber cement is covering it (before applying
the patch).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class="date">8:45am</p>

<p><em>Another</em> flat.</p>

<p>I kept my cool, though I wasn't really impressed with my luck.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class="date">9:32am</p>

<p>Fixed the flat, this one being a gash in the tube. When I
inflated, I saw what had happened.  I will ride super carefully to
try and keep it from happening again:  There's a little hole in my
tire, where the tube poked out like a hernia.  Hit a bump and the rim
sliced right through it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class="date">9:45am</p>

<p>bump-slice</p>

<p>Limped to the next gas station and they directed me to a bike shop.</p>

<p>Offloaded heavy stuff from the back: my backpack on my back and my
green bag on TJ Bike's handlebars.  Headed to the bike shop, trying
to lift the back to keep a lot of weight from damaging the rim.  The
tire is absolutely shot.  Tube can be salvaged, but it now has 8
patches and a small gash next to the most recent patch.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class="date">10:15am</p>

<p>The bike shop turns out to be a motorcycle shop.  The guy was
like, "we'll have to order the tire."</p>

<p>"how much will it cost?  wait; who cares... what time will it get
here."</p>

<p>"Not time.  day."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Umm"</p>

<p>"Day after?"</p>

<p>"mmmm"</p>

<p>"The day after the day after?"</p>

<p>"probably"</p>

<p>"next week?  Next year???"</p>

<p>He laughed, which was a welcome relief from Japanese not
understanding sarcasm.</p>

<p>The day after tomorrow I plan to be in Odawara.  I can't wait.</p>

<p>He explained that his guy had gone upstairs to check, but if they
didn't have it, they didn't have it.</p>

<p>Oh shit...</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>They had it.</p>

<p>And a tube.</p>

<p>ふしぎ, said I. (unbelievable)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>They put it on, and said it would be 5250 yen.  I have 3000 +
change in my wallet.  "Is credit card okay?"</p>

<p>"not really."</p>

<p>I counted the notes in my wallet: "1, 2, 3, finish," I said.</p>

<p>そ、か。。 and they got the credit card machine going.</p>

<p>I thanked them profusely, and thanked the guy who had directed me
there as I rode triumphantly in front of his shop.</p>
