<p>I was looking for a park for lunch and saw a sign for a zoo and
botanical garden.  Looked at where the sign pointed and saw a roller
coaster.</p>

<p>Hmmmmmm.  Wonder if I can get some pics.</p>

<p>Long story short (for once), they wouldn't let me in (without
buying a ticket) and tried to explain that the coaster wasn't running
due to the high wind (I don't care; I just want pictures) so they
accepted my camera and <em>took pictures for me</em> while I ate lunch
outside the park.</p>

<p>How much did it cost the park to have that employee (manager type,
given her nicer uniform than the ticket taker) go take pictures?  Why
not charge me for the ticket, offer to buy it back if I'm back at the
gate within 5 minutes?</p>

<p>Because I wouldn't have been able to get pics of the train inside
the platform...</p>

<p>Nice.</p>
