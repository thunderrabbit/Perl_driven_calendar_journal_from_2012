<p class="date">3:00pm JST Tuesday 09 May 2006 (day 13194)</p>

<p>Super chillin' day today; I've ridden <em>not</em> really that
far, but have seen some pretty cool stuff.</p>

<p>Woke up a bit after 5am and meditated from 5:31 to 6:31am, with
two peeks at my camera clock to see how the hour was progressing.
Fell asleep a bit during that time, but each clock check woke me up,
so it was a good balance.</p>

<p>The chorus of frogs that had been a symphony the previous night had
apparently dwindled to only the most hardcore of party animals.</p>

<p>Rode the rest of the way to the Sea of Japan (gulf between Japan
and China)!!  Stopped by Yura Beach (actually Yura Garden and Sea, but
I had also seen a sign for Yura Beach) and chilled there for a few
hours, watching the little waves and the tide slowly come in, and the
little trains on the single track line.  For rush hour they came sorta
frequently, but then when I wanted to take a picture of one, the time
between each one had gotten really long.</p>

<p>Got a pic of a 2-car train, but no single car trains.</p>

<p>Spent quite some time writing my S00p3r s33cr3t security thing
(which is one thing I wanted to write during the 10 day deal), and a
couple of people greeted me as they went by - something that
basically <em>never</em> happens down in Tokyo / Yokohama.</p>

<p>(never)</p>

<p>Rode on a bit more, and used a construction zone with 1 direction
at-a-time traffic to allow myself untrafficked zooom time down the
hill.  Wasn't the bestest hill I've done in Japan, but probably the
safest, given the lack of trucks and such.</p>

<p>The highway took the high way with a sign that said no bicycles, so
I got veered off and found a small road crossing the railroad, with
crossing guard arms, so a perfect place to get a photo of the train!
The crossing guard arms would give plenty plenty of time to get my
camera ready, so I chilled out there a bit with the intention of
waiting for the next BING BING BING BING BING BING BING indication of
a train coming for a photo op.</p>

<p>A woman happened by soon thereafter and asked how I was doing and
I told her fine and added <em>what</em> I was doing, and she was
like, aight, then went inside, came back out with the train schedule
and noted I had just missed two train crossings (one each direction)
and the next would be in an hour.</p>

<p>She pointed out the nearby beach might be more interesting, so I
calibrated my camera clock and brain and headed to the beach.</p>

<p>The waves were super small, but it was definitely a beach with
water and sand, and large lines of large tetrahedron wave-blockers.  I
began to code more code and soon enough a train went by, <em>well</em>
ahead of schedule from what I understood.</p>

<p>I shrugged it off, and continued to code until the time I had
planned, then headed back to the spot and was a bit 'spooked' when
some guys were working on the tracks; I didn't know if they would
disallow me from loitering around the tracks, etc.</p>

<p>But they were friendly and everything was all good, and I got the
perfect picture including Francois.</p>

<p>The woman who had shown me the schedule came back out with three
(3) large and perfect strawberries for me, and reminded me there would
be one more train coming the other way shortly.  I thanked her,
enjoyed the strawberries and photographed the second train from a
different angle.  (It was a two-car train, though, so not as
cute.)</p>

<p>More ridin' then through a tunnel (with a dump truck behind me
(oops!!)) and then arrived in a small town where I saw a conveyor belt
dumping skinny metal bars silently into a hopper... what???  I looked
again and the metal bars were <em>fish</em> (of course!) and I was
mesmerized with how disgusting it was to think they were going to be
on the shelves and in people's bellies sooner than later..  Some of
the fish didn't make it into the hopper and lay on the concrete for a
while.  Some of <em>those</em> got scooped up and put into the food
bins (unless there was some indicator that I didn't see.. "NOT
FOOD")</p>

<p>Then the coolest thing: all these big ass birds knew cleanup time
was feeding time and they started swooping down for tasty snacks.
Some bickering, but mostly just silent swooping and snacking.</p>

<p>Found a cool sailboat shaped bridge, with a sign that said Library
near it, so I went in search of internet.  Found it, but we can only
click, not search nor use the location bar nor anything.  Super locked
out.  But free electricity to write this journal entry.</p>
