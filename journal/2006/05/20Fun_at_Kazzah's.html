<p>I've really been enjoying time spent at Kazzah's; we have primarily
been working on our various projects: me on my website and she on her
Master's, and then we work together to buy food and cook and clean and
chat about random and various things and it's just been great.</p>

<p>Sounds so normal slash obvious, I guess, but why it feels so great
is a bit of a mystery.. in that.. yeah, a simple fun life should be
great, but have I not experienced this in such a long time that I had
forgotten how great it is?</p>

<p>For the record, I am happy to state we have been perfectly
platonic, without even a hint of interest from either party.  Even my
crazy brain has been totally chill and disinterested in starting such
shenanigans with anyone.</p>

<p>I seem to be growing through to different phases of my life.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>
