<p>After getting the positive note back from Korea, I sent a
semi-byebye note to Sumidasan, who I had asked if he could sponsor my
visa.  I had basically assumed the null response was a "no" response.</p>

<p>But</p>

<pre>
I apologize you for not responding your request.
I have been negotiating with Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare  about
your request.
( I am a ex-'yakunin'=government oficial.)
They are searching appropriate job for you somewher internatinal section.
In any country 'red-tape' is red tape,you know.
If their respose is good for you, I will inform you of the news.

In any case, we are waiting your return to Tokyo and shall have good time
with you.

<p>Holy shmoley!  A government job in Japan?  How...... unexpected
and different <em>that</em> would be!</p>

<p>Yikes stripes; this is ... wow..  I feel a bit of fear around
taking such a job because I don't want to stay <em>THAT</em> long
(whatever that means), but it would be pretty phat to be able to
practice Japanese, etc.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm</p>

<p>but I had started looking forward to a new adventure in Korea.</p>

<p>two totally different possibilities, each of which may or may not
be available.. what a present moment the unknown future provides!</p>
