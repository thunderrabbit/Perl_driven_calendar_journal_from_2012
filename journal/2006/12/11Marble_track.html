<p>Kinda bummed that my camera is fucked (my old one died a month ago and the one Hitomi gave me has
gotten progressively worse so that it won't focus at all now.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I haven't yet installed the big slalom piece, but it, as a unit, is built, and it has
one foot (so far) that will be used as a leg to support it.</p>

<p>Went back to work after i-group and worked on the marble track's slalom.  Its one leg was well
dried; I added one more little  spacer, shaved a few mms from a different part so it would fit well
ad glued the sucker down.  It is glued at three points so far, and I plan to add a toothpick or
two(?) tomorrow to lock it into place.  Should be cool.</p>

<p>Oh, the slalom is on, but its edges are not built yet so the ball just rolls off it sideways.
There are three slopes.  The top two just roll right off and the bottom one doesn't link to the
ramp below it.  These things will happen this week or so.</p>
