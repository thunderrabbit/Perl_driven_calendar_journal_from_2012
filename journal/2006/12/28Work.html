<p>Silly brain.</p>

<p>Masako smokes, but she's really cute; my brain is captivated by her cute nose, cute short hair,
cute smile, and today, cute sweater that wasn't even a full sweater (basically just sleeves and
half-back).</p>

<p>Talked to the artist currently known as Zen for an hour.  He enjoyed checking out my marble
track.  Sachiyo has stated that she *only* wants to take my lessons.  Basically the same for Ami,
Naoki, Koji, and Miyoki.</p>

<p>Our boss is a poor manager.  I think it basically stems from him not trusting anyone.  After two
employees were out at the same time, he basically accused them of going out together.  But didn't
do anything like, <em>ask</em> them.  One of the two has quit over it.  I thought about quitting,
but officially I don't know.  And I rarely have to see him, much less deal with him, and I like 90%
of my students, so it's all good.</p>
