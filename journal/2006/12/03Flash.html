<p>Been working on this stupid flash thing all day; I'm mad cause I don't know what I'm doing, as in
I haven't taken any flash classes or such.. no real experience in how to go about making things.
Just trying shit to see what I can do, and what I can do I know won't match up to Tariq's
expectations.  Damn.</p>

<p>Have one more hour to work before I'm going to men's group party.</p>
