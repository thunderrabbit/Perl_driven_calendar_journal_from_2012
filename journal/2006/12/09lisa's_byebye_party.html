<p>Tonight was Lisa G's byebye party at Insomnia in Shibuya.  Good times talking mostly with Maruan
and Kyoko to my right and Matt-o across the table, plus Laura and Lisa making funny faces for the
cameras.</p>

<p>Maruan told me how he got to read Polish with a Japanese accent for auto ads in Poland, and his
proposal to Kyoko.  &quot;she cried.&quot;</up>

<p>&quot;You made a girl cry??&quot;</p>

<p>big fun all around.  I had the idea of organizing a &quot;We're Still In Tokyo Party&quot; for
just after the new years, after everyone is sober, but before everyone has to go back to work.</p>
