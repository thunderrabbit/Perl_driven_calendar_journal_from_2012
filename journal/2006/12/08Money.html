<p>Today is payday, because the 10th comes on Sunday.  I've totally lived this month within
financial means; my food spending plan, which I feared might be too small, was plenty to cover other
plans in which I spent more than planned.</p>

<p>And getting sick didn't destroy my income though I was out for four days.</p>

<p>I've decided not to abbreviate this month's plan because I got paid early, but I'm going to get
a head start on next month by paying Hitomi today.</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<p>My credit card account in the US was snarfed up by a big bank.  The new web interface for my
account is actually quite nice.  They have an ingenious feature: a personalized image on their
server which is served up when my computer's cookie is detected.  A fake website can't realistically
copy that image to fakingly get my password by setting up a phishing script.  Even if they try to
send the URL request to my bank, they can't get my cookie (?) to impersonate my computer.</p>

<p>Only thing is I wonder how everything will work if the cookie on my machine is erased.  Perhaps
I'll try and see.</p>
