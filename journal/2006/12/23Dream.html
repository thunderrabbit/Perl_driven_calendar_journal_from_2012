<p class="dream">Fred and I running outside in a park; we had just taken a No Smoking pledge, which
we thought was pretty farcical, and then we were running down some stairs, and he had a bit of
trouble with mending a monitor.  Actually that was no trouble, geting away from the car offered less
time Fifty perent less. (*)</p>

<p class="dream">Fred recovered from his fall and I was releived that he was okay, and that I would
not have to jump off the upcoming bridge to go find him.  The upcoming bridge was easily 500 meters
high.</p>

<p>(*) I was basically asleep while writing that &quot;sentence.&quot;</p>
