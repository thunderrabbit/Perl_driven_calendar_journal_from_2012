<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>

<li><p>I feel joy about having spent the last month keeping track of my spending, nearly down to the
penny (yen) in order to make a more careful budget for this coming month (paydays are on the 10th of
each month), and to have a better sense of my finances overall.</p></li>

<li><p>I feel joy because I believe I can get out of debt again.  I can plot out my debt recovery
fairly precisely now.</p></li>

<li><p>I think I should be more direct with my date about Aiko.  I have not told her that I am
becoming friends with Aiko (via chat and Skype). I judge I should tell her.</p></li>

<li><p>Talking to a guy today, I might be able to join a startup company here in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>Right now I am teaching at EV in Shibuya, the startup would pay more than that.
Nice.</p></li>

<li><p>I've not really been in touch with Ma in the past couple of weeks, but I chatted with Dad
for a bit maybe a week ago.  Haven't really chatted with Fred recently, but usually am in pretty
close touch with him, so the standards are stricter.  I chatted with him two nights ago or
so.</p></li>

<li><p>Had the best time at Kellie's byebye party and then the next day at Carla's byebye party.
Nudity at Kellie's; lots of PB peeps at Carla's.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been enjoying work on Marble Track 2.  It's pretty much becoming way more complicated
than the one Maggie has.  (therefore work on it is slow).</p>

<p>(( I'd like to mention here that there have been 2 other marble tracks, but they were both
destroyed.  One of them was &quot;pretty cool&quot; (for its time?) but was the victim of my short
temper when Fred did something or said something like basically not believing I would, in fact,
wreck the marble track.  I smashed it with my fist.  The other one was an experiment in speed; I had
a super tall 40 degree angle aiming down toward a loop, but it never worked well and was
discarded/destroyed.))</p>

<p>The track Maggie has been holding for me was built over a 14 year period, with large breaks and
one huge break for some years.  I re-began construction for about 6 months once I moved out of
me-an-Wende's house.  As a result, I seriously wondered how long it had been since I worked on it,
and when I had worked on what.  So I began to write the date on each piece of wood on the track.</p>

<p>Marble Track II has the date on each piece of wood, starting from day 1.  BUT, the dates are
written in magic black-light ink: invisible in visible light, and fluorescent in black light.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really been meditating.  After my 10 day course, I basically was really pumped to
do 1 or 2 hours per day, but now I can hardly sit for 15 minutes before it becomes unbearable.
During PB, I was able to meditate 30 minutes pretty easily with Eri each morning no
worries.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently my stomach felt a bit blah like I hadn't been eating properly.  I had been focused
a lot on eggs, cheese, sausage, bread, but no veggies.  I had two small green peppers this morning
and yesterday.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really been studying Japanese properly, but often when my girl comes over, she chats
with Michael in Japanese and I often understand and occassionally join.</p></li>

<li><p>No real bed in my room; just the stuff I had on TJ Bike trip around Honshu.  Thin camp-style
air mattress and sleeping bag, plus a blanket that Jesse left  when he left.</p></li>

<li><p>Still living with Michael in Sakurashinmachi</p></li>

<li><p>Still working at EV in Shibuya</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is MacBook with 74.2 Gig HD.  3.8 Gigs free.  Recently the power management has
been fucked up.  The battery goes down to like 21% and then the whole computer just powers off.  No
warning.  No sleep.  No deep sleep.  Just OFF.  That pretty much pisses me off about the
battery.</p>

<p>Also the screen at times does not illuminate; I have to reboot to get it to come back.  That could
be part of the same issue.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access: none at work.  Sometimes wireless at McDonald's thanks to Hitomi's
account.  Every day at home on our fast connection.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't been to I-group this month because I fucked up at work and didn't properly ask for
the days off.  Did get to see them in Mejiro recently for one man's wedding party.  Good times and
dancing.  Will be back at I-group on Monday.</p></li>

<li><p>Been working with Kim on my 1-2 year plan, and designing 10 year future lifestyle.  Good
stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>Have not really volunteered since PB.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really worked on programming my website, but been working on Flash program for Tariq.</p></li>

<li><p>No pets.</p></li>
</ol>
