<p>Incredible fun at Kellie's byebye party.  Met Steve the gay stripper model who posed twice with
Kellie in a sexy moon-the-camera shot.  Only he was mooning.  He's in a movie, going to the premier
in Hollywood in January, doing modeling gigs all over, and I want a part of it all.</p>

<p>And he's reallly really funny, plus, doesn't drink, smoke, drug, nor cuss.  Wow.</p>

<p>After shabu shabu, several of us went to プリクラ: Kellie, Yukiko (who I met at El Torito when I
went and Kellie was randomly there), Caroline (with beautiful blue eyes (and husband)), Dan,
Francois, Anna and Jesse.  Also super duper great fun!</p>

<p>Then people dropped out and I joined Kellie, Yukiko and Dan at &quot;Breakfast Lunch Dinner
Yeah!&quot; which reminds me a lot lot lot lot lot lot lot of House of Pies (except a lot smaller
and no pies) to the point that I may want to go there again.  Maybe it's just the hanging out
atmosphere.  Maybe it's the closest I'll get to Yamamba.  Super cool chatting with them and I felt
kinda bad that it was the first time I'd been there, though Dan and Kellie apparently hung out there
a lot.</p>

<p>Kellie and Yukiko had to split; Dan and I hung out for a bit longer.  Perhaps this time we will
meet up on our own instead of just randomly meeting when other PB people set up events.</p>
