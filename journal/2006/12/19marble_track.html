<p>Nice.  Ono spent an hour with me, mostly playing with Marble Track II.  He suggested a valley,
and I was like, &quot;those are too hard to make,&quot; and then promptly warped the remaining
tongue depressor into a shape that looks like it will work perfectly.  In the last five minutes of
our lesson, I ran and got one side of the tongue depressor wet, and then we warped it and used the
space heater to dry it, and it's going to be <em>perfect</em>.</p>
