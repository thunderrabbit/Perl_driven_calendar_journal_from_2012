<p>Been working on the game for some hours, a lot of which included chatting with Tariq in the
background.  We've basically gotten the one game finished, including sound effects and background
music.  Need to have some losing music though.</p>

<p>I'm tired.  bedtime.</p>

<p>Meeting him tomorrow online at 8:30am.</p>

<p>And by tomorrow, I mean today, in 6 hours.</p>
