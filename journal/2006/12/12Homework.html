<p>Argh.  I haven't done any homework for Japanese... though, well, that's not actually true.  I
listened to the CD on repeat, have nearly gained some new vocabulary (wrote about 70 words; can't
remember the meaning x/or the pronunciation of any), and simply forgot to recharge my batteries
last night.  D'oh!</p>

<p>Hoping to go to Tokyo Hands to get a voltage transformer for Petra, but got sidetracked watching
Mythbusters that Michael had on this morning.  Argh.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>I did buy contact juice which I'm sure to need tonight, given that I didn't think I'd even have
enough last night (barely did; I guess 2 CCs seems like a lot less when inside a 500 CC bottle than
in the contact case)</p>
