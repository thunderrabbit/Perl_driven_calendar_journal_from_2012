The Peace Boat is a model of how to deliver the message of peace and human rights across the world,
said Peace Lab Director Dionysus Mintoff yesterday.

Fr Mintoff was speaking during a public discussion organised by the Peace Boat on peace, irregular
immigrants and human rights.

&quot;The mission of the Peace Boat is universal - a message that we at the Peace Lab have been
practicing hands-on with the poor and socially disadvantaged in Malta for many years. That is why we
are delighted to host the Peace Boat,&quot; he said.

The Peace Boat is a Japan-based international non-governmental and non- profit organisation that
works to promote peace, human rights, equal and sustainable development and respect for the
environment.

Its main activities are the organisation of educational peace voyages on board the ship. Three
global voyages and one short Asian voyage are organised each year.

Rei Ueno from the Peace Boat explained that it was the first time the boat had visited Malta.

The Peace Boat seeks to create awareness and action based on effecting positive social and political
change in the world, she explained.

It carries out its main activities through a chartered passenger ship that travels the world on
peace voyages. The ship creates a neutral, mobile space and enables people to engage across borders
in dialogue and mutual cooperation at sea, and in the ports it visits.

The Peace Boat activists, Peace Lab and several students from Junior College discussed the issue of
irregular immigration in Malta and Europe.

Ms Ueno explained that after the discussions are over, lectures will be held on board the ship and
incorporated with other issues that they discussed in other countries.

The boat stopped in Malta for one day and will move on to Libya.

&quot;The Peace Boat is a global voyage and our mission is to discuss the issues of each country and hear
the voices of the local people, and deliver the final message back to Japan,&quot; she explained.
