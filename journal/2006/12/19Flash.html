<p>Trying to figure out what fl.getDocumentDOM() does without testing it has caused me a bit of
wasted time, but I'm hoping that I will be able to grok it and use it to get some cool effects.  I
want to grab a couple of the text fields on the screen and make tweens with them. But they are
user-entered text, so I have to do it all pragmatically.  I was trying to use breakApart, which
I've learned is required before doing shape tweens with symbols (I think it should be called
flatten, but) I don't see how to use breakApart on individual items.  The documentation talks about
getDocumentDOM() returns the currently selected document.  WTF is a document besides the whole
movie.  Are they calling an individual symbol a document?  Why not call it a &quot;symbol&quot; or
something with a bit smaller conotation.  And if they do in fact mean the whole document, er screen,
then htf am I supposed to select an individual symbol?</p>
