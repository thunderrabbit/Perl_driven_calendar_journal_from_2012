Hello Robert,

How are things going?  Just to let you know that we are looking for volunteers to take part in a
clinical trial at the start of February 2007.  The trial drug will be administered once orally.  The
volunteer fee for this trial is Yen 380,000. As you will see from the trial dates there is a period
of four nights between the discharge and the final follow-up.  You have the choice of either flying
back home or staying in a hotel.  If you decide to stay in the hotel you will receive yen
10,000/night (40,000).  Please remember that you are still considered to be participating in the
trial during this period and should avoid, alcohol, excessive exercise etc. This will be explained
when you come for screening and also in the informed consent document that you will receive.
