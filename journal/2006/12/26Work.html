<p>Fun times today; showed my shoulder X-rays to my favorite Yuki (and showed her the camera on my
computer, obtaining a cute pic of her and Francois) and to Makiko, who said she would help me pay
for my shoulder last week (so I brought the X-rays this week).  Makiko seemed pretty intrigued by my
idea of counting days old, said it could be interesting, especially for the aging population of
Japan.  Still not sure how to market the idea, though.</p>

<p>Just chatted with Rie, and ended up giving her several several vocabulary words, starting with
bad, rude, mean, impolite, as she was thinking of words to fit &quot;his friends think gossiping is
______.&quot;</p>

<p>On 20 minute break now, and my next student has cancelled (80 minute lesson!)  I hope to get the
flash game corrected; I gotta figure out how to essentially stop the timeline and then restart it,
all within one frame.  Can't do that (according to my limited research), so I gotta split this
frame functionality to separate frames.</p>
