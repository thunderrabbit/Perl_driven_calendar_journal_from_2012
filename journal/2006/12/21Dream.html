<p class="dream">&quot;If we worked together, Francois and Abe would become friends, perhaps start
going out for rides.  But, as it is, Francois is looking for customers who want to buy products
every day, he wants to set up residual income..  あっ！、&quot;　I caught myself, &quot;what am I
telling *you* for?  You're in sales!!&quot;  I affected a 50s gangster accent, &quot;there's this
shing called shales, you shee...&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He laughed and the joke was well taken, but basically that was the end of my story
cause he knew everything I might know about sales.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The woman sitting to my left thought it was pretty funny/cute/dorky and she
giggled.</p>

<p class="dream">Abe was a stuffed gnu, and I was talking to the guy sitting on my right after he
had shown Abe to me.  I went and got Francois and started my story.</p>
