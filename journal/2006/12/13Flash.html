<p>Tariq came over to our apartment for our online meeting because he had left his computer here
for surgery by Dr Michael.  Surgery was unsuccessful, but didn't make the machine worse than it had been.</p>

<p>The meeting was successful; I was glad to be able to show a bit more of the Flash cartoon that I
had worked on last night.  I felt a bit bad that I hadn't gotten more done, but Tariq seemed fine,
and it seems I did more than others.. Hmm</p>
