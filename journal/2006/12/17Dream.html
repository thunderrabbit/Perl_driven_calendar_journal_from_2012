<p class="dream">The GET Team was slowly grouping up; I walked alone into the airport, wondering if
I was going the right direction as it took a super long time to get to the terminal; I saw a ship
that looked like Topaz, but it didn't have the same smoke stack, but everything else looked the
same.  As I was watching it, a couple people came up who were on the GET Team, and I knew I should
know their names from before, but I couldn't think of them, so I was a bit embarrassed, but just
plugged through like there was nothing to be apologetic about.</p>

<p class="dream">One of the guys knew a shortcut to the terminal, which included going down an
elevator that subsequently went sideways and effectively undid all of the walking I had done for the
previous twenty minutes, which was mentioned by another guy, &quot;we've just backtracked the entire
way I just walked, &quot; and we got to where we needed to be, which I was back in my apartment and
received notice of a package about to arrive the next day, but I couldn't imagine what it would be
because I had been here the whole time and handling everything immediately as it came.</p>

<p class="dream">We had a bit of a discussion about it, and Michael convinced me that it could be a
lot of different things and I shouldn't be too worried about it.</p>

<p class="dream">Little five year old came up to our table at the restaurant, *<em>smoking</em>* a
cigarette like he was cool or something, and I did a double take and then yelled at him,
&quot;YOU'RE FUCKING FIVE YEARS OLD AND YOU'RE SMOKING?  PUT THAT CIGARETTE OUT RIGHT NOW!!&quot;
and he quickly crushed it out and started to cry, and I continued in Japanese, 「ぜったいダメ。」 I
was totally disgusted.</p>

<p class="dream">Later, I saw Laura and Lisa in the same line and told them, and Lisa joked,
&quot;well, a smoker's gotta start sometime.&quot; which was pretty darn funny, I gotta admit, but I
still was pretty disgusted at the kid's behavior.</p>

<p class="dream">Saw the rest of the Team walking up, just on time, and they included several tall
women, including Aiko, and I was like, &quot;eek&quot; cause I didn't know if I would want to kiss
one of them instead of her..  but I decided, &quot;no, she's the one.&quot;</p>

<p>This dream includes the first occurrence of being angry in Japanese in a dream.  And maybe the
first occurence of me being angry in Japanese at all.</p>
