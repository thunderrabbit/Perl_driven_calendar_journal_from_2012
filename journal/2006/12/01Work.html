<p>Just had my favorite Yuki at work.  Her English class watched Dead Poets' Society (in four
parts) and she wrote a paper on it.  I read it, trying to coax as many corrections out of her as
possible, instead of just giving the &quot;right&quot; answers.</p>

<p>I love when she smiles.  I'm thinking <em>I'll do anything to see you smile.</em></p>

<p>The woman who wrote the scathing letter about my lesson was out in the waiting area when I
walked out to go on break.  She made eye contact with me and I pleasantly said HI before 100%
noticing who she was.</p>

<p class="date">10:23pm JST</p>

<p>Fun in the final lessons today; had Ami for an hour; she was too tired to focus on the book, so
we had a free(style) conversation about her fire drill today (walking down from the 42nd floor), her
nails (which have grown out almost beyond recognition), my budget, Francois getting 5000 yen
donation after I gave it to her if she would paint her nails brown on one hand, and on the other
hand, red.</p>

<p>Before that lesson was a killer lesson which turned good at the end when she told me she used to
do glass blowing as her job for 7 years until it proved to be too stressful on her body.  (1400
degrees C...)  That was after we struggled to communicate about her company making pachinko
machines; some parts were okay, like the price and the noise levels in pachinko parlors, but when
she said her company planned to have quiet, smoke-free pachinko parlors, I couldn't get her to tell
me either (1) why don't they just open one parlor (2) why the estimated time is either 45 or 10
years away (perhaps she meant 4-5, and then changed to 10) (3) how many quiet smoke-free parlors
they planned to open.</p>

<p>She told me new pachinko machines cost about 500,000 yen ($5000).  Used ones are sold for 200,000
or 300,000 yen.  But that price is to parlors; she didn't know the price to sell to an individual.
Her job is licensing of characters that appear on machines.  They recently made a machine featuring
Rocky (as in Sylvester Stallone), but I couldn't understand why she said it was just one machine (I
couldn't get across the difference between one style of machine and 1 actual unit), and they create
1 new machine per month.  &quot;How many machines do you <em>sell</em> per month?&quot; (no
answer)</p>

<p>Only one machine a month?  Each machine is custom?  I don't know shit about pachinko parlors
(except they smell like shit (smoke) and are louder than shit (1 million decibels) and the outside
sometimes smell like shit (piss), depending on the area of town), but upon glancing inside, I see
rows of machines that all look identical, so I was pretty confused about the conversation above.</p>

<p>The last lesson was with the woman who I've thought was from Taiwan, but turns out she's from
Shanghai (yes I know the difference between Taiwan and China), but when she says she's from
Shanghai, she means her city is a 5 hour drive from Shanghai.  I guess it's just that I don't know
shit about cities in China, so Shanghai is the closest one I've heard of.</p>

<p>She asked me to read an article about Bush and Maliki's recent meeting in Amman.</p>
