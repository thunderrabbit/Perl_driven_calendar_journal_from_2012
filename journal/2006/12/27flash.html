<p>Some good success with flash.  Figured out how to get Japanese characters to work in the
crossword finder game.  Ami played and went from 37 misses to 0 misses in 5 tries.  We played
around and put her name in the grid, and subsequently I figured out how to allow name lengths to be
independent of numbers of tiles making up the names.</p>

<p>Got both the introduction and the crossword game with the correct background.</p>

<p>Did other stuff, but I'm too tired to remember now.</p>

<p>Tariq will be here in about 7 or 7.5 hours.</p>
