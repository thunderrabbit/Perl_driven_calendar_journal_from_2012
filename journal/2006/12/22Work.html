<p>Last student today, Mai, told me her birthday is close to Christmas, so I told her about
celebrating every 500 days instead of every year.  Not sure if she bought into the idea.</p>

<p>Ami cancelled today, which meant the chocolate I had bought for her was distributed to various
people, starting with Mai when she told me her birthdate.  I ate a bunch, gave some to Reiko
(receptionist) and taped 6 (in the shape of a happy face) to the back of a letter that's waiting for
Virginia to get back from vacation.</p>

<p>Ah, cool.  I will be 13431 days old on 1 January 2007.</p>
