<p>Just chatted for 40 minutes with a cat who works for a help desk.  We started talking about
programming and operating systems and I was (gently) harshing on M$ saying I just think M$ is icky
feeling, and won't use their products on my machine; I prefer emacs for writing and programming (he
was like, &quot;what software do you use for coding?&quot;; he uses Visual Studio); Apache is the
primary web server in the world, so that must say something, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Later he was like, &quot;I work for Microsoft.&quot;</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>I especially like how I didn't back pedal at all, but rewound the conversation in my head and
was like, &quot;but you have Macintoshes in your office?&quot;  and he explained that a lot of
people at M$ have Macs, ostensibly to test M$ software usability on them.</p>
