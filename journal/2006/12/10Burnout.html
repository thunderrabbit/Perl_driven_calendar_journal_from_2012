<p>Read <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/24757/index.html">Jennifer Senior's excellent
article on burnout</a>, which seems to fit my experience pretty well.</p>

<p>Then sidetracked reading about
the <a
href="http://digg.originalsignal.com/article2/28422/the-infamous-ghetto-indoor-swimming-pool.html">indoor
penguinless inflatable pool</a>, a hilarious story with pictures.</p>

<p>Okay, back to Flash.</p>

<p>Right after I send an email to Maruan.</p>
