<p class="dream">model airplane wings being attached with rubber bands; the guy was showing me how
to do it, thought he was not able to do it himself, but he knew the theory.  Rub the rubber band on
the finger a bit to get some oil on it, twist it around the finger like this, and then  stretch and
rotate and hook it on the other peg.</p>

<p class="dream">I tried the technique, but was also having some trouble; I forgot to lubricate the
rubber band and it broke; I dropped the wings, which got a bit scuffed.  My guy tsked a little bit,
but knew it couldn't be helped, plus they would get a lot more damage when actually being used.</p>

<p class="dream">He asked me what had happened.  When I told him the rubber band broke, he said I
should ask for a replacement one from the store, where we happened to be arriving.  I hadn't
thought of that.</p>
