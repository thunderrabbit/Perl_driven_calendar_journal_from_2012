<p>Today my favorite Yuki showed me the paper we worked on together; I had been careful not to
write the paper for her, but only to make changes that she could understand and recreate herself.
Her instructor made several corrections which I transcribed for her in a legible manner (I'll email
them to her).</p>

<p>She wasn't able to schedule a lesson with me for next week, but she'll be back to work on the
next paper she has to write, discussing issues brought up in Dead Poets' Society, the movie they
watched in class recently.</p>

<p>My favorite Ami didn't come today; I'm surprised, but I sorta know what happened.  Last time (or
so) we talked about cancellations and she learned that if she cancels on the day of the lesson, I
still get paid.  If she cancels a few days before, she gets the money back.  So she cancelled on
the day of the lesson.</p>

<p>Delightfully enough for me, another student filled in 40 minutes of the new 60 minute paid
break, so I'll be paid for that time as well.  Basically being paid double.</p>

<p>Miki, who came back to EV today for the first time since March, had an excellent technique for
studying.  She had a &quot;book&quot; on Mother Theresa (basically amounted to what could be a
speech on MT's life) and had me read it so she could repeat it.  I discovered how much she could
capture and repeat at a time and extended a bit past that, and then a bit past that as well.  She
was able to repeat sentences like, &quot;Agnes said goodbye to her friends and home, and then said
goodbye to her family at the station.&quot; and &quot;Classes started early each morning, but the
nuns' days started earlier than that.&quot;</p>

<p>I quite appreciate her concentrated efforts for an hour, and hope they pay off well for her.
She was quite an inspiration to my studying.  Which, of course, explains why I'm writing this in
English instead of Japanese..  oh wait.  shit; I got it all backwards.</p>
