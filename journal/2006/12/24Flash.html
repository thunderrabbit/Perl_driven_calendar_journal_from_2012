<p>Worked on flash game for about 8 hours today, then met Tariq in Yurakucho, a station I've
visited before, but had forgotten (couple years ago for the plasticized human body exhibit).</p>

<p>He seemed pleased with that which I had done, but not necessarily hella impressed, which I didn't
necessarily <em>expect</em>, but I did finish more than he had expected when we talked last night.</p>

<p>The electronics store is a complete and crowded nightmare of holiday shopping.  I did scoop up a
free map/calendar of Japan, for purely practical reasons, mostly focusing on my occasional interest
in having a map of Japan.</p>

<p>Tariq said that every 100th sale at the electronics place is rewarded with free merchandise.  As
in, that for which the winner had planned to pay is given gratis.</p>

<p>(After I thought of &quot;gratis,&quot; I thought of Sam Malone Style Free!  I wonder if they are
still on the air.)</p>

<p>There's more flash work to be done tonight.  Or, before our meeting on Thursday.</p>
