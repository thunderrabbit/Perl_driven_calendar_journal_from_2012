<p>Akiko was 50 minutes late for our 80 minute lesson today.</p>

<p>I bought chocolate for her.  She squealed when seeing the marble track in action.  That's quite a
nice response compared to getting a shitty letter sent to my boss about it.</p>

<p>(*) which I joked with Victor it would be funny to say to some students, &quot;you know, today is
Pearl Harbor Day...&quot; and see how they respond.</p>

<p>He said he's had debates about kamikaze bombers from Japan vs suicide pilots at WTC.  That gets a
lot of feathers ruffled.</p>
