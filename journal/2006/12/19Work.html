<p>On the way out for food during my break, Makiko who had just taken my lesson rode down the
elevator with me.  She was like, &quot;I chose your lesson again to help you pay for your
shoulder.&quot;  awwwwwww!!</p>

<p>I offered to show her the X-rays next time.  Need to remember to bring them in.</p>

<p>I recognized the voice of my student Yukiko, who showed up late for her lesson.  Almost 24 hours
late, or on time, had the lesson been today instead of yesterday.  I was on break, so headed out to
give her a side hug of empathy.  I haven't verified, but I hope she signed up for my lesson later
this week or so.</p>
