How can I develop and trust my warrior to protect and champion everything I value, starting with myself?

If I wanna step into my king, don't try to become a king.  Instead develop the last piece necessary
to be ready for kingship, which is my warrior.

When all the pieces are together, the kingship happens.

HOMEWORK:

     Write to invite PB peeps to we're still in Tokyo party.

     Handle the situation with Stephen who is coming to visit for two weeks.

     Watch for and accept, through fear, opportunities to lead.
     Be aware of places that my warrior doesn't show up.

     Three questions I should ask all the time:
     
     (1) Who am I? ( in relationship to god today?  What is my role in each part of my life?  What is my
     power? (it starts where the part of me connects to God))
     
     The way I detatch from other people and things: attach to that part of myself that is connected to god.
     
     Work to grow my taproot into the deepest soil of my center, connected to god.
     
     When I do this, I don't need to &quot;worry about what other people think of me.&quot;
     
     (2) Where am I going?
     
     (the three plans of 2-3 years out)
     
     (3) Who/what is going with me?   [we'll talk about this next time]

     Who would be my warrior mentor in the world?  I might see them as negative because they have a lot
     of the energy I am disowning.
     
     Who would be my kingship mentor?  (A leader necessarily followers around him.)
