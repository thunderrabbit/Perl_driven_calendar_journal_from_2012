<p>Work was pretty easy today.  Five students total, including Tatsuya, the cat who built a video
distribution website and recently sold it for several dollars.  Will mention him to Tariq as a
possible resource for our flash project.</p>

<p>Wow.  I left my schedule from Friday on the wall all weekend.  I'm surprised no one gave it to
the receptionist.</p>

<p>I'm off work early today so I can attend my I-group meeting, for the first time in a while.</p>

<p>And then tonight will be talking to Kim.</p>
