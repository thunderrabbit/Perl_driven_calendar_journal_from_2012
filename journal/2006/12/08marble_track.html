<p>The marble track didn't get squeals today, but was appreciated by one of my students; I forget
who it was.  I didn't add a whole lot to it today, but I built a &quot;pre-fab&quot; part that
hopes to implement a suggestion by Ami a couple weeks ago for the big marbles to roll back and
forth like a slalom skier.  She wanted the slaloms to be really tight, but I explained basically it
couldn't work that way because there was nothing to encourage the ball to switch directions.  So
the slaloms are bigger than would be totally cool, though I think it will be pretty cool when it's
finished.  It definitely will change the overall shape of the track.</p>

<p>Also, I'm pleased to have squeezed two more tracks into where I hadn't planned to have tracks
before.  I may have mentioned the one that looks like wooden wires made of toothpicks in the center.
As of yesterday I used the third strangely-labeled long stirrer from Starbucks (?) to make an extra
track for big marbles leading into the trough before the switch near the bottom.</p>

<p>If possible, that track will lead up between the as-yet-uninstalled slalom track and the
recently finished wire toothpick track.  It will be quite tight.  Perhaps too tight for a big
marble and will have to reserved for small ones.  Or not used at all.</p>

<p>The top of the wire track curves over the default big marble landing area, and I'm not sure where
to send it from there.  It could continue to curve along the 180 degree big marble U-turn, but that
will extend (again) the outer edges of the track.  Have to decide if I wanna have even more fragile
toothpicks defining the outer boundaries.</p>
