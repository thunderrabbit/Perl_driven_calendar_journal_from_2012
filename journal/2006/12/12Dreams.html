<p>After Kim was talking to me about taking opportunities to lead, I had several dreams in that
department, including</p>

<p class="dream">I was offered a chance to become Mormon, and lead people to join the faith.  I was
horrified that I'd *have* to do it because it looked like a perfect chance to become a leader.</p>

<p class="dream">I had no sense that I was dreaming: in fact, quite the opposite.  It was really
nerve wracking.</p>
