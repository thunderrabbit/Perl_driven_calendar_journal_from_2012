<p>Been working on the flash thing most of the day, with a bit of a break to watch Jon Stewart vids
on youtube.</p>

<p>Had a bit of trouble getting a radio button to work, just to toggle properly.   but I finally
got it.  Gotta go to bed.  I think I'm supposed to chat with Fred tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow
night??  Dang; I forgot.</p>
