<p>Best things today:</p>

<p>A student who reallllly liked the marble track, and was happy to grab multiple marbles and send
them down in succession.  She was super smiley and I was nearly afraid to beam smiles back at the
same rate; but, overcome by the glow, I happily showed her the switch and even plans for the next
portion.  I *almost* asked her what she thought should come next, but I decided to wait until I was
sure she would visit again to see the results.</p>

<p>A student who loved the idea of counting days old.  She's 24, so I foolishly pegged her for 8000
days old, when it's obviously 9000 days.  She's actually 9049 days old today, and in about 15
seconds, I was able to calculate her 10,000th day in my head.</p>

<p>I checked it on computer, and she was well impressed, until I told her the secret:  her
birth date is 20 days before mine; I remember when my 10,000th day was, so I just subtracted 20 to
come up with hers.</p>

<p>Today featured 5 hours straight teaching with every student on time for class.</p>

<p>Tomorrow there is an 80 minute break just before my 80 minute lesson with Akiko.  I look forward
to using that time to work on the marble track.</p>
