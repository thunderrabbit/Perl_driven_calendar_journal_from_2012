<p class="dream">hospital bed with a guy in it pretending to be killed as a laser plasma ray is hot
at him, but the ray doesn't work, so he lives, and then a bad guy tells his henchman to start
hitting the gu with teeeth, which will simulate eating him, and he has to be hit with teeth unti he
is eaten and dies, so finally the good guy is like, &quot;this is terrible&quot; and pulls the plug,
cryingly on his friend and says, &quot;alright, I don't have to watch this show anymore.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I was writing to CDs two CDs worth of data, but there was no CD writer, and the
platter was out in the rain, so I ran out to get them out of the rain.</p>

<p class="dream">This was after I had been in Carla's classroom, flrting with her like patting chalk
marks over her back and butt.  She was like, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; and then, &quot;this
school is not as nice as my house, but I like the people.&quot; I was quite surprised, given that my
house looks about the same as the school.</p>
