Well, I wouldn't say "no worries", but I did make it...  Caught the last possible train at Nippori
with about 10 seconds to spare before they closed the door, and they held the plane for a few extra
minutes to let me in.  All in all, I went from the train, through the check-in counter, security,
customs, and the last inspection at the gate in under twenty minutes.  So, in a manner of speaking,
it made things considerably faster doing it that way.  =9

It certainly beats the three hours they advised.
