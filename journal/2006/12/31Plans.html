<p>Ah crap, I forgot tonight is the night I planned to go &quot;see Shibuya on New Year's&quot;
just because it's my (favorite) city in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Later, I'm sure I'll be glad I saw it (i.e. I imagine I won't want to have missed it), but I
don't want to go <em>tonight</em>.  Maybe I'll be more ready to go after some more coding today.</p>
