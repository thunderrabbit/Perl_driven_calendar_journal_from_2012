<p>Good meeting with Tariq.  Didn't get free lunch, but ¤Þ, still good to show off what I had done
and give him some direction on his next steps in learning Flash.  I've got a good sense of two
games I'll be working on: one that I have started, and another I had designed, which he said should
be pretty cool after some difficulty-adding modifications..</p>

<p>Headed home now to bang out some code, eat, and perhaps go back out to Shibuya tonight.  Meeting
Tariq online at 10am tomorrow.</p>
