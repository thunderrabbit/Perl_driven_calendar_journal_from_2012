<p class="date">1:31pm JST Tuesday 12 December 2006 (day 13411)</p>

<p>At work, if I recall correctly, I have a single 40 minute break in the &quot;morning&quot; and
then no breaks until 10pm</p>

<p class="date">10:18pm JST Tuesday 12 December 2006 (day 13411)</p>

<p>No no-shows.  No cancellations.</p>

<p>Mr Yosh was cool with reading while I worked on the marble track though.  Nice.</p>

<p>I got the bottom of the slalom integrated with the next lower track, and the top turn of the
slalom integrated with the middle slope.  Tomorrow, perhaps, will see the final slalom turn
built.</p>

<p>Oh!  And the axis for the large marble switch has been extended to two toothpicks, and the slalom
has a a toothpick with its end bent to make a snugly spot within which the axis can rotate while
being stabilized on top.</p>
