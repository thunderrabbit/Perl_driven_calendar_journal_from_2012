<p>Talked with Tariq for a few hours this morning.  Got some design on the next steps, and some
tweaks for the current thing.  Now having a problem with frames in flash.  for some reason, I can't
figure out why my code is stopping before I want it to.  This is during the final scene of success,
which plays, but when I extend it to multiple frames, it doesn't play, despite the lack of a
stop(), despite using gotoAndPlay(&quot;frame&quot;);</p>

<p>argh.</p>
