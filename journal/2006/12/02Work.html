<p>Lesson with さんチャン was fun; we were talking about her job for most of the lesson and then she
made a quick dive for a new topic, &quot;what about you; do you like Japanese food?&quot; and I
pretended not to notice and went with the new topic, but then I just laughed after a bit, &quot;I
noticed that topic change; it was very cute.&quot;</p>

<p>'sall good in the end; she may come play ultimate with us!</p>

<p>Pretty good day so far, and two of my favorite students will fill the rest of my day: Yuria (who
is often late), and Yuta (who knows a lot about international issues and such)</p>
