<p>Just skyped with Marcel and Kayse!  They and kids are doing well.  Marcel is working for a
company out of Dallas, and Kayse is handling the posse at home, set to be busier come June!</p>

<p>Told them I won't likely be able to come back until like October, but it'll prolly be even
longer than that; ... dang.</p>
