<p>As I left for work I wished good luck to Stephen in his first full day in Japan.  I forgot to
wish bon voyage to Michael, who I won't see for 2 months.  Dammit.  I was feeling late for work and
could hardly detach from the slew of questions from Stephen about how to get around Tokyo дт how I
prepare before going in to each lesson дт something else.</p>

<p>I just tried to call Michael, but his phone is disconnected (?) slash otherwise unavailable.</p>
