<p>Work starts in 26 minutes; I made the 53 train, though I was pretty sure I would miss it until I
saw I had over 60 seconds to get from the entrance of the station, through the gaes, and down two
levels to the platform.</p>

<p>A bit of difficulty getting up this morning, but was successful in the end.  But even then, I
just watched The Daily Show and a couple other clips (including Pinky and the Brain), plus the funny video that Matt sent me.  (I
don't have the link ... oh wait, I do!!  FF with its unclose tab list = Snap!!)

<p>I didn't make time to send Petra's transformer; I'm at a bit of a snarf after she was like,
&quot;oh, and can you send me an ¤¤¤´ board?&quot; and I'm like, <em>should I save on shipping and
send them together?</em></p>

<p>Tonight, Stephen, a warrior from north central US (Chicago?) is coming to crash on our couch for
some weeks.</p>
