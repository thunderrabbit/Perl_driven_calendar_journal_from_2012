<p class="dream">Telling stories using my computer while logged in remotely via terminal, and the
console said it was &quot;heating...&quot; meaning it was getting overheated, and I didn't know if
it was a message from my machine or from the remote machine.  Then I saw smoke coming from the
monitor so I realized it was my local machine and told my audience we'd have to tell stories without
using the computer as I typed &quot;exit&quot;</p>
