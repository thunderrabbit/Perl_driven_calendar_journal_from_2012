<p>On my way home, the train got stuck for some unknown reason one station from my station.  Prolly
someone discarded themselves in front of a train, which mucks up the whole line.  People started to
escape the train, so I was just like, &quot;fuckit I'll walk&quot; and headed out as well.</p>

<p>Just happened to be at a bus stop as the bus came up, so I used Kellie's bus pass (that I won at
her byebye party) to get the rest of the way home.</p>

<p>In a lovely turn of events, I found two train cards on the floor of the bus, with credit on
them.</p>

<p>Yoink!</p>
