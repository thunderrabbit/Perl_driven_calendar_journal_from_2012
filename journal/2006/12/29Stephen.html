<p>Stephen heads out today to see a friend up on the north coast of Japan somewhere.  We shared a
couple of stories in our last hour.  He's got a lot of wisdom from which I can benefit.</p>

<p>Told him about Fricke's 3 million dollar statement, and my reason for bicycling 1400km.  He told
me about staffing mkp weekends and how much he's benefitted from that.</p>

<p>I'd like to as well.</p>
