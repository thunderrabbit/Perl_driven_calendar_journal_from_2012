<p class="date">10:19pm JST Tuesday  5 December 2006 (day 13404)</p>

<p>Just finished work; chillin' in Shibuya station debating catching this train or the one that
leaves in 7 minutes.</p>

<p>Good day at work, somehow, despite having no break for like 6 hours.  Argh.  But the last three
students were lovely in their own ways, from high level English, to self sufficient, to Laurel and
Hardy-ish in their silly banter.</p>

<p>(the train just left)  (I'm not on it)</p>

<p>Tariq called me near the end, but I still had 30 more minutes of lesson to go so I didn't
answer.  His message was mostly inaudible due to lack of cellphone signal, and he didn't answer
when I called him back.</p>

<p>Got a lot of good work done on Marble Track II today. (Worked while my second to last student
just shouted his way through the text.  He's great.)  Today I basically put together the wire loop
lookin' thing of toothpicks with a net on the loop end.</p>

<p>I built the net during his lesson.</p>

<p>L &amp; H were duly impressed by it, given they had seen it on day 2 and now on day 36 or so.</p>

<p>Next train's about to leave.</p>
