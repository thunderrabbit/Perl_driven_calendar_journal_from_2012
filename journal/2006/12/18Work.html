<p>Worked balls yesterday on the project, basically all day all day working working.  Met Tariq
online to get feedback and direction.</p>

<p>This morning worked on it more, and plan to work on it more tonight.</p>

<p>At EV work today, had a lesson with my favorite Yuki and with Francois' favorite Ami, plus a
woman named Yuuko who has been to Palestine, and learned some Arabic.  She knows written Arabic
more than spoken Arabic, which intrigues me.</p>

<p>I enjoyed meeting her and recalling a bit of the Arabic I learned while over there.  She also
does slash teaches belly dancing.</p>

<p>Last student didn't show up.  She came three times.  The second time after 6 days, the third
time after 8 days, today was scheduled after 10 days, and she didn't show up.  Hmmmm.  Looks like a
loss of interest.</p>
