<p>Tariq came over this morning and seemed pretty happy with the progress on the game.  We
implemented a few more points and Fred scoped it out, providing some feedback, one point of which I
agree needs to be corrected.  I hadn't noticed it before.</p>

<p>There's still hella work to be done, but we're plugging through it.  I'll be putting together
another game that we were debating this morning how it should look.  We ended up simplifying it
programatically, to the point that the game play is nearly the same as the current game, but using
images instead of objects.</p>

<p>and by images and objects, I mean something else.</p>

<p>Headed to work now, with power supply, mouse, keyboard, and rabbit in my backpack.</p>

<p>Need to send out a Rob Update soon.  Hmmm.</p>
