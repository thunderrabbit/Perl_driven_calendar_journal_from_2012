<p>The key to our apartment uses magnets and holes instead of just bumps.  More secure, and more
expensive to copy.</p>

<p>Yesterday, for the mere price of 3999 yen, I got a copy made of the key.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it wouldn't work.  The guy had selected a blank that was slightly larger than the
one we have.  They both have a ridge, and the new ridge was too tall to fit in the keyhole.</p>

<p>Brought both keys back and crudely explained the problem.  I don't know the word for ridge.</p>

<p>He made another copy on a new blank.  This one without a ridge whatsoever.  I hope that ridge
isn't part of the tumblertainment.</p>

<p>Just asked Victor what to call the ridge.  He doesn't know.</p>

<p>Just asked Reiko what to call the ridge.  She doesn't know either.  HAhahahaa</p>
