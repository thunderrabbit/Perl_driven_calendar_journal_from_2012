<p class="dream">At a party and a bad guy came.  We didn't know what he looked like, but we knew he
would be coming, so when I noticed him (coming to stalk the hostess of the party), when she came
back toward the front to meet him (not knowing he was a bad guy), I walked toward her and gave her
the finger (which I would never do to her otherwise) and she breathed, &quot;I've got it,&quot; as
we walked past without making eye contact.  She walked past the bad guy also without making eye
contact, and I went to the back of the party where a girl was upset that our friend might be in
danger.</p>

<p class="dream">She was a student, so I didn't know if I could touch her, but she said, &quot;just
hug me,&quot; so I did and I told her not to worry because our friend knew about the guy even before
I told her about the guy, so she must have a plan in mind.  I was just making it all up as best case
scenarios type stuff, but I didn't actually know if it was true; just hoped it would be true.</p>

<p class="dream">For our own safety, we stepped into an elevator to go up out of the building, but
it turned out to be a downward-going elevator only, even though we pushed the topmost button, the
elevator headed down and stopped at each floor to let on passengers, and people tried to get on, but
when I pushed the door-open button, it turned out to be the door close button, and closed the door
in their faces.  One guy got on anyway, as the elevator was down past his floor and the doors half
closed, he slipped in like a flexible shadow, and he showed me why my door open button wasn't
working.</p>

<p class="dream">When we finally got down to the bottom floor, I didn't recognize anyone as the bad
guy, so it seemed we were safe.  People down here were pretty close friends, and all computer nerds
of some sort.  They were preparing a feast of some sort and recreating puzzles and complicated
scenes from nature that represented ways the food could have been grown, though it was obviously not
a natural fruit or whatever.  Like a three tiered cake made of grass that was a miniature three
tiered slope of grass fields and goats cutting the grass by eating it and the internals of the slope
visible for inspection or consumption.</p>

<p class="dream">It was all very cool, and I even got into the spirit by making something, a single
layer puzzle made of graham crackers that were cut into jigsaw puzzle shapes with a water laser,
the only way to precisely cut graham crackers.</p>

<p class="dream">The party was about to begin, and people were snacking on various treats, so I was
looking forward to eating, and then I realized I was late to meet Tariq, so I ran upstairs and got
there about 5 minutes late and he was like, &quot; you've got to maintain boundaries with these
people,&quot; as in he was upset with me, but not going to say it particularly harshly.  I still
felt bad because I am never late, but just after he told us he was going to crack down, I was late.
Grr.</p>
