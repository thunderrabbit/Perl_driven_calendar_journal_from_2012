<p>Just helping Stephen get oriented on the train system.  He's trying to get to Roppongi tomorrow
and find a certain building.  Getting to Roppongi is easy enough, with just one train switch, but
finding the building will be a bit more of a trick; I encouraged him to ask a koban.</p>

<p>Interesting to recall being so lost on the trains.  Not knowing the difference between north and
south in Harajuku when I was headed to Shibuya.  Now which one is Shibuya?  Or is it Shinjuku?
Shinagawa?</p>
