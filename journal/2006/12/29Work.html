<p>Wonderful blessing at work today.  A woman said basically, &quot;thanks to you, I can finally
enjoy English.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow.  What had she enjoyed specifically?  Talking about my marble track, and my way of
explaining &quot;exciting&quot; vs &quot;excited&quot;</p>

<p>I'm really excited to meet her again.</p>
