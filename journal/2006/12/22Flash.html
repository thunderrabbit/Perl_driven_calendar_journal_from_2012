<p>Fun with inheritance in flash.  Gotta get some ideas drawn out here; I'm pretty sure I can knock
this out.</p>

<p>Nice.  Got some good stuff going, but I need to add a variable where currently there is none.
These tiles get placed, but then forget which tile they are.  That just won't work at all!</p>

<p>I took the train to Jimbocho so I'd be guaranteed a seat which I used to program, winging it
successfully all the way until that snag.</p>

<p>haha damn.  I just missed my station.  Usually more people get off than did, so I thought it
must have been the station before mine.  Aight.  Getting off and back on at Futakotamagawa.</p>
