<p>I've just uploaded a whole slew of vids to YouTube, including some stupid ones that I've put up
there just for posterity, and one hopefully cool one of my marble track...</p>

<p>And,</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Starting now, until next year, I will tell people I'm 37 years old.  Whoohooo!</p>
