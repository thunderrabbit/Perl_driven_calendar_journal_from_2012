<p>Puske's mom came 20 minutes late for a 40 minute lesson, which means the lesson is cancelled, by
our policy.  But I like her well enough (and happened to see her on my way out of the building for a
snack), had 80 minutes worth of break scheduled after her lesson, (and had just had a 20 minute
break,) so I had a full lesson with her, leaving 60 minutes of break.</p>

<p>Akiko is now 38 minutes late for her 80 minute lesson.  Looks like a no-show.  She's usually
quite careful about calling if she intends to come (but is late).</p>
