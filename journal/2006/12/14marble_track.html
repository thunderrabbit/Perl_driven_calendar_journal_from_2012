<p>Really happy about my marble track; have just put into place an even more difficultly
squished-in line in the center of the track  This one is for big marbles, and it uses one rail from
the already squished-in small marble track with a net on the end, but uses it in the opposite
direction of rollage.</p>

<p>It <em>might</em> not work well enough to (pass the high standards of quality, *cough*, and) not
require a slight modification to the small track's toothpick rail, but once it's fully dry I'll be
testing it quite a bit.</p>

<p>Gotta add a few catchers on the turns, but, I'm hella pleased that it already works this well
(on first glueage, with limited bracing).</p>

<p>Oh!  And, I am now pretty sure I've got two tracks that will toggle the big marble switch.
However, I still don't know how it will toggle marbles at the top (so it gets set on one run and
then unset on the next, as opposed to set and unset on one run, or require sending big marbles down
different tracks (one to set and the other to unset))</p>

camera, I was able to get as a closeup of the cool new squished-in large marble track.</p>
