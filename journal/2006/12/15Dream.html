<p class="dream">Walking in my new neighborhood to meet some friends at 20:00 at a certain cafe, I
looked down at my phone to check the time: 14:22.  I was like, &quot;what??&quot; wondering how I
could be that early.  Then I realized it was 14:23, 14:24, 14:25... the phone was counting the
length of a call!</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Hello??&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Rob?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Have you been waiting for 14 minutes?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Oh my god, I'm so sorry!  I had no idea; I just looked down to check the
time, and..&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;That's okay.  Are you still in touch with Shama?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Not past that email she sent me.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Oh, well, this is Miffy!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;HI!&quot; (who?  I have no idea who this is.)</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I heard Shama emailed you, so I wanted to call you, and see how you are
doing..&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Thanks!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;But it looks like we have to start over; press #&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Okay&quot; and I pressed the # key and the call was disconnected.  Hmm.  I
guess she'll call back, given that she was willing to wait (pay for) 14 minutes of silence.  Gotta
remember that when she calls back.  14 minutes.  I owe her that.  Who is this girl?  Think think
think.  What's the best way to tell her I have no idea who she is?</p>

<p>This dream is full of places my warrior did not show up.</p>
