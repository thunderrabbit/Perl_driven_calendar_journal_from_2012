<p>Fun lesson with Akiko today; she practiced listening while I bitched about US policies on
immigration and toothpaste on airplanes.  I pointed out that these new laws were enacted *after*
the existing system <em>worked</em> to catch the bad guys who were allegedly going to blow up a
plane with liquid explosives.</p>

<p>The system <em>worked</em>.  Why force me to throw away my toothpaste?  Fuckers.</p>

<p>A N Y W A Y</p>

<p>Mari and Chika after Akiko were a riot as usual.  They hadn't studied and were bewildered about
stuff we've done several times, but by the end of the lesson, they seemed to have gotten the hang
of it:  &quot;Where is your book?&quot;  &quot;It's on the table.&quot;  and &quot;Where is the
table?&quot;  &quot;It's on the floor.&quot;  Heaven forbid adding a new preposition to allow the
table to be in the room.</p>

<p>Enjoyed my first lesson with Rieko; she presented diary entry which I corrected, with some
difficulty; it seems that the yahoo translator isn't all that good.  She had a lazy day at work
yesterday because both of her bosses had forgotten about her, so she used the time to plan a trip
during her upcoming vacation, and to write the journal entry.</p>

<p>Tomoko, physical therapist, after that talking about recovery, and I told her how I 100% expect
100% recovery for any injury I sustain.  My nose-disabling double concussion with blood squirting
out the ear: no problem.  My broken shoulder: definitely no problem.</p>

<p>Explained how I try every day to enjoy the gifts I receive.  We simply need to wake up and
notice the gifts of life.  She asked when I had started this thinking: after reading _Way of the
Peaceful Warrior_ and _Celestine Prophecy_.</p>

<p>Just now had Yuria, who had cancelled three of the four lessons we had before this week.  And
today she arrived 10 minutes late, gave pastries to everyone in the school (as in a box of pastries
to each teacher and the receptionsit), had a 20 minute lesson with me and left 30 minutes early.</p>

<p>I bless her life to be more relaxed; she's certainly giving me time to do the same.</p>
