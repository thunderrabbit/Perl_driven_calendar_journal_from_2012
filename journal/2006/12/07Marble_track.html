<p>Marble track got slightly disassembled for an hour today while I added a piece made to look like
a continuation of an already existing piece.  Upon repair, the already existing piece was turned
over (oops) and then labeled on top &quot;(over)&quot;, and then its new partner with today's date
&quot;7 DEC,&quot; (*)</p>
