<p>Last night was Carla's byebye party. (( and she wasn't in tears!! )) It was just 5 hours ago that
I was chillin' with her, but I've slept 4 hours since then so I say last night.</p>

<p>She and Maria had a party in Shibuya at The Ruby Room and Sonoma, places I've been to before but
didn't remember until I saw them.</p>

<p>Lots of PB peeps there, including Adriana (whose name I remembered this time), Dan (long time no
see, brother (last night)), Natalie (with whom I haven't really chatted since her voyage), Jeremy
(who I met upon the arrival of 54th voyage), and others I didn't really talk to: Stacy, Yuki,
Kentaro, Kyoko-n-Maruan (now married!), Chris (GET Coord for 56), Maho (whose name I only knew
because Carla had just said it), Robento (didn't ask about future plans), and Mariko (who I only saw
as we were all outside after the bar totally closed on us) and her b/f Hiro (who she introduced as
Hirokun, so I was like, &quot;Hiroko?&quot; and then immediately <em>ah shit, of course not!</em>
&quot;what???&quot; and I confirmed that she had said Hirokun, which threw off my silly brain.  HIRO
is the name.) ... and probably others I'm forgetting.  Like Tomoyo (who gave Carla a bright orange
bracelet with 東京 kanji embroidered on it).  あっ! and Levi, the man of the beautiful blue eyes who
rode his bicycle from 高田馬場 to 渋や。</p>

<p>Ah jeez, and Carla's &quot;twin&quot; Maria!!  It was also <em>her</em> byebye party as well!</p>

<p>Also some NOVA peeps  were there: Masayo (whose name I didn't remember, and  the guy whose name I
never remember, to  the point that it's become  an embarassing joke, because the last  time I didn't
remember (pre PB days, so over 20 months ago), he refused to tell me, so this time I didn't remember
I didn't even ask, nor talk to him past, &quot;ah shit; no I dodn't remember.&quot;)</p>

<p>Mostly I talked with Jeremy's friend Mark, from Melbourne, who was talking to Natalie when I
stole up to hug her.  She saw me before I could surprise her, and she gave her Natalie-ポイ &quot;I
see you&quot; smile.  At first I gave hugs to Natalie and Adriana whose name I proudly remembered,
and my hugs were complimented, so I offered one to Mark (&quot;I'm an equal opportunity
hugger,&quot;) who accepted.</p>

<p>I explained the technique: &quot;no pounding pat-pat-pat on the back, but a real solid physical
connection with a heart to heart connection to go with it.&quot; Mark and I talked about the diffs
between Melbourne, Austin, Sydney and Houston.  I'm hella proud to be able to have such a
discussion.  It was his 4th day in Tokyo (just to see Jeremy), and he has a whole itinerary planned
for using the JR Pass around Japan from Kyoto to Sapporo.</p>

<p>At the very least, I wanted to sit for hours talking to Carla; I want to hear and share all the
stories and all the goodness.  We got to say a decent &quot;see you soon&quot; in the street after
we were kicked out of Sonoma.  She thanked me profusely for having told her about PB (thank you,
profusely, Genki Man Dan!) and I thanked her profusely for having shown me how to enjoy life to the
fullest (even if I don't implement all her techniques yet); we confirmed we would always be friends,
and that I look forward to her stories.</p>

<p>(I was pleasantly surprised when she mentioned Skype as a connection technique!!  Carla was
computer illiterate when I met her.  PB was the first time she used a computer, and we don't have
Skype (no internet) on those machines.)</p>

<p>Walked arm in arm with her down the hill and across the street at Book First, surrounded by
Tomoyo and others as we tried to catch up with the group.  Over a five minute period punctuated with
interruptions, as she is hugely popular in any group, we found Levi on his bike across the street as
Carla told me how she wanted to see Aiko in Okinawa, but hadn't been able to afford tickets.</p>

<p>Story finished, I disengaged from Carla as I felt obliged to head home and be responsible around
the Flash project (and my date).  More huge and huger hugs and cheek kisses and kisses to Maria who
promised to take care of Carla (as they will be traveling together at first) and watched them go
around the corner near the angular police box in the fan of streets behind Shibuya crossing.</p>

<p>Huge props to Carla; thank you; see you; love you.</p>
