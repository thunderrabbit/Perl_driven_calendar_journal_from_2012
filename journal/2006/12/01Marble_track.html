<p>I'm pretty pumped about my marble track.  I've *basically* gotten the switch designed and
tested.  Just got to build its support system and we'll be all good.</p>

<p>*and*, I recently decided to renew progress on a previously abandoned idea, right in the middle
there will be a little twisty track for small marbles.  Twisty cause there's not a lotta room to
build.  I had been discussing the idea with a student who seemed pretty interested in the project;
during that time I told him about the abandoned idea (in terms of how I basically don't have a plan
for anything, and some plans are abandoned) and I decided to disabandon it.  &quot;Ya know, I
should do it because it will be difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>He agreed.</p>
