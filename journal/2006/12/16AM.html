<p>Wow.  I had to wait for the shower this morning.  Had no eggs available for breakie, so I just
cooked the remaining 1/2 onion, clove of garlic, two small green peppers, cheese,</p>

<p>and several sausages for breakfast.</p>

<p>haha and you thought it would be vegetarian.</p>

<p>On the Keio Inokashira line from Shibs to Kichijoji now, headed to work.  1 hour worth of
scheduled breaks today.  Yuria isn't on my schedule today.  Wha???  She's been a cornerstone for
weeks!</p>

<p>This morning on the Denentoshi Line I discovered my batteries were dead slash sleeping slash on
strike after getting my circa 1990 sound system set up.  None of them pesky iPods for me.</p>

<p>Actually, I'd love one, but just can't afford it now.</p>

<p>The woman who just sat to my left looks a lot like Miki in Boston.  двд├! It's Miki's birthday
soon!</p>

<p>Shit and I wanna send cards to PB peeps for New Years.  Hopefully I'll get my shizola together
and do it tonight.</p>
