<p class="dream">Riding around and around and around on a roller coaster, I was overhearing the
woman in front of me, who was talking to her kids and too herself.  She wanted to raise them
believing that they would be better off by not eating fat, and I was like, &quot;how are you going
to teach them that?  You don't have to turn around to answer me; just keep chatting with your
kids.&quot; the kids were like 3 and 5 years old, so they basically just wanted attention and would
not understand the topic of conversation anyway.</p>

<p class="dream">We were still going around the roller coaster, and this time I didn't notice part
of the ride that had passed, it was like I had blanked out during part of the ride, whereas before
I had been accutely aware of each nuance.</p>

<p class="dream">I was thinking about her problem: if she just says &quot;fat is bad&quot; o her
kids, they will probably grow up with prejudices against people who are overweight, and it wouldn't
be the optimal solution.</p>
