<p>Nice.  I got a blanket for Steve to use, got the transformer thing Petra requested, and got my
teiki updated for use until 18 January 2007, all in one zoomy trip to Shibooooya</p>

<p>Looked for the book Kim suggested, but the guy at Book First wouldn't try to look up a book for
me!  Don't they have an inventory?  Don't they want to sell books?  I was anti-impressed, and
bitched louder than necessarily called for, but, I mean, there's a computer right there.  WTF is
wrong with their system that they can't look up a book??</p>

<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

<p>The transformer is way smaller than I guessed from the picture.  This model (60W) is a step up
from the one Petra requested: 50W.</p>
