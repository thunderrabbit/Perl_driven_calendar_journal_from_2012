<p class="dream">Piggy backing Shoko (NP Shoko Shoko) outside, like a
monkey with a monkey on my back; she kept not holding on with her legs
and I was like "Shoko hold on," as I climbed around in this little
courtyard with stair cases, trees, and other things to climb on.</p>

<p class="dream">Shoko kept falling asleep, and near the end, I
finally got back to the beginning and she was totally falling asleep
and basically falling off my back.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like 「ここで寝るの？」"will you sleep here?"
and gave her a kiss, which she didn't reject nor dig in.</p>

<p class="dream">A computer program for tracking chats was used to log a murder, and
it was the same chat program tha got me intersted in chat back in the day.</p>

<p class="dream">I told the guy who originated it "thank you" before going off to kill
the guy at the end of the game.</p>

<p class="dream">Once he was dead, we were redecorating the room, and
some contractor began to bring in a set of glass shelves and wall
mounts, but box number 61 was missing.  I helped look for it, and
found it due to dream number shifting, so then they were like having
to start over with counting the boxes to see which one was not
there.</p>

<p class="dream">Boss told me that the last one was being brought in
from next door, but "it was flapping like crazy."  So he was like,
"everyone go help them" as I ran over and there were like 3 guys
helping to carrying carry this long flexible glass, with Jesse in
front.</p>

<p class="dream">I picked up the whole thing and just carried it
vertical, much to the girls' going "oh look at him show off.." etc.</p>

<p class="dream">Jesse started seeing just how flexible it would go, and I got
irritated cause he ended up splitting the two layers of the table
apart; they were like rubber and air got stuck in between.  "Fred!
oh, Jesse!  I almost callled you Fred cause you're annoying me so
much."</p>

<p class="dream">"Now every time I see these bubbles, I will be like 'Jesse did that,"

<p class="dream">"'and that oand that and that...'"</p>

<p class="dream">We carried it back to the room and I woke up.</p>

<p>This is the raw typing from when I typed with my eyes closed at:</p>
