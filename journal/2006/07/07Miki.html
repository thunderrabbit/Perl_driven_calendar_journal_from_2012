<p>Headed to Cinecitta to see <em>Cars</em> with Miki, who I've not seen since
before PB 52.</p>

<p class=date>4:54pm JST Friday 7 July 2006</p>

<p>We chowed a buffet lunch (with the smallest selection of food in
the planet) for 1000 yen, then wandered around Tokyu Hands (basically
Ikea plus toys) and scoped the various goods and bads.  Saw an
interesting(?) puzzle that I didn't get for Fred because it wasn't
easy to use.  (It was basically a spherical Rubik's Cube with a marble
in one of the 26 outer "blocks", that could jump through
correctly-aligned holes in the walls to other blocks when they were
aligned correctly. But during rotation, the faces didn't "click" into
place, and (especially because it's spherical) it was easy to stop in
the wrong place, so turning an orthogonal plane tended to break the
puzzle.)</p>

<p>Stopped by Yodobashi Camera where she got batteries and charger (at
my suggestion, instead of 20 disposable batteries) for her electronic
dictionary, and a photo album for her sister.</p>

<p>Also checked out the new Macs so I could see forward to what I am
looking.</p>

<p>A spot of ice cream hit the spot on the way back to Cinecitta where
we tossed 40 (net) tokens (free with movie ticket purchase) down the
tubes at the game center, then headed to the in/outdoor mall for some
snack food at the supa-cheap snack food shop, then got intercepted by
a guy working for a hiphop fashion shop where I ended up getting some
shorts (hiphop, ripstop, sans top) for 5500 yen including tax.</p>

<p>Not sure it was a good price, but I'm glad to help those cats out
on occassion.</p>

<p>The shorts are cool / funny:</p>

<p>cool: the inner band is embroidered with a serial number of two
letters then about 8 digits.  The letters: RN</p>

<p>funny: On the pocket is embroidered in a L337 sorta way
USS-AKIDIMIKS, such that the ID is merged as one character |) and the
IMI is actually |V|.</p>

<p>Cars is <em>Fantastic</em>!!  I was in fits of laughter so many
times;  so so so so funny!</p>

<p>And I cried when Stickers went for the drive with the Porche.  Perfect.</p>
