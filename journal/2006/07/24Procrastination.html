<p>There are lots of good ways to pracrastinate online.  I just
found <a href="http://43things.com">43things.com</a>, which quickly snarfed 2 hours of time.  I'll
count the site as another &quot;good idea&quot; that I hope is making someone a shload of money.
Or at least a decent start.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also found <a href="http://youos.com">youos.com</a>, which I guess gets its name from
youtube.com.  youos seems pretty.... wow.  Like an impossible idea come to life, except it seems
really slow and pretty buggy.  They just got slashdotted, which could account for the slowness.  I
hope the bugginess is worked out soon enough.</p>

<p>I basically couldn't get anything to work, except just a tiny bit.  Like in the shell I could
type &quot;help&quot; and &quot;ls&quot; but neither ls nor cd worked (help did), and I tried to
load my site in their bitty browswer, but that didn't seem to work, unless I actually went to bitty
browser's URL instead of youos.</p>

<p>The chat seemed to work, though I didn't add to the clutter of messages.</p>

<p>I gots to go to bed so I can go to the hospital tomorrow for what should be my last check up.</p>

<p>Oh shit; I just realized I don't have any money to pay them for X-rays.  Dammit.</p>

<p>Oh wait.  I do.  I've got 15,000 yen saved for rent.</p>

<p>Sigh.  I will get out of debt.</p>
