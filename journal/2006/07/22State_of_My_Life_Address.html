<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>"I've been living in Japan off and on for 3 years," I told a student recently at E-V (3ngl!sh
V!11ag3).  I'm semi-protecting the identity of the school because they've hooked me up with work
though I don't yet have a visa.  Worked 12+ hours for them so far in 3 different days over a couple
week period.  Am missing an opportunity to work today because I scheduled a Computer Party with
Hitomi today.</p></li>

<li><p>Am on the train in ºù¿·Ä® on my way to Àîºê to meet Hitomi for our computer party, during
which I will return PekoMac after basically 6 weeks of use while I got a new computer.</p></li>

<li><p>I got a new computer!  A MacBook.  OS X 10.4.7 (Tiger), 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo, 1 GB SDRAM,
75 GB HD.  I love: the stronger hinge (I broke my PowerBook's hinge twice (I don't coddle my
computers)), the magnetic power connection.  I'm sure I will love other things as I use them:
built-in camera, easy-remove HD, ummm. other stuff.</p>

<p>I have no issues with the reflective screen.  I see reflections but they don't bother me.</p></li>

<li><p>I got a wireless keyboard to help me compute with better posture.  Keyboard on my lap, laptop
screen closer to eye level.  Perfect.  I read mostly glowing reviews of Apple's bluetooth wireless
keyboard.  I agree it's beautiful, and it only took about 2.5 minutes to set it up and use
it.</p></li>

<li><p>Living at Jesse's house, but Jesse is moving out.  I will be taking over his space.
Hopefully I will have income to pay for it soooooon.</p></li>

<li><p>Been playing Hackey Sack Jack with Jesse's footbag (though it doesn't have a name; I wonder
if we are giving it an identity crisis..) some evenings.  We lost touch with that game for a while,
but seem to have picked it up again.</p></li>

<li><p>Each Friday night Jesse hosts a bible study.  I attend out of basic politeness and free
food, though I've not been persuaded to join the ranks.  Last night Anna was the other guest;
everyone else cancelled.</p></li>

<li><p>TJ Bike is still in ¾®ÅÄ¸¶ with Nachiko, who I saw yesterday at PB54 departure.  My shoulder
i almost 100% perfect, and *is* 100% perfect by the way I'm using it essentially without careful
attention paid to it.</p></li>

<li><p>My passport has recently been expanded to have like 20 some extra blank pages added.  Ready
to do some travelin'....  Soon as I get some money.</p></li>
</ol>
