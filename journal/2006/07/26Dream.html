<p class="dream">Trying to carefully climb over the bunk beds with YRUU and PB people sleeping: PB
Stacy, YRUU Robin, others;  Jesse had just asked me to get the tapes from the transcription project
and try again to transcribe everything.  I was not impressed with the dumbness of his idea; I had
just transcribed them to the best of my ability; transcribing them again wasn't going to increase
accuracy.  He was like, &quot;I know, but I don't know what else to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I apologized to those people I woke up, and stuck my head into the window where the
tape office was located, and asked if I could come in.  The woman was basically like &quot;no&quot;
but was quick to obtain the tapes I needed, and said she would bring them over as soon as they were
copied again.  She was actually downloading them from her server, and I couldn't imagine why they
had the audio in a digital format, but were then recording it onto casette tapes.  Why not just
email it to us?</p>
