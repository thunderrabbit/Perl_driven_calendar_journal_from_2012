<p>I think I'm ready to move robnugen.com to dreamhost.com.  I like
their setup better; they have 10 times the disk storage, make it
easier to create mySQL databases, domains and subdomains, and I have
direct access to the error logs instead of being forced to view them
through web interface.</p>

<p>And it's really easy to install perl modules in my
local space. perl -MCPAN -e shell or something.</p>

<p>I've been testing on <a
href="http://rob.thunderrabbit.com/">rob.thunderrabbit.com</a>, and
everything has worked except I haven't been able to check is my
wordpress installation, because it has robnugen.com hardcoded into
some of the links.</p>

<p>I've removed it from my navigation until I can test it properly.</p>
