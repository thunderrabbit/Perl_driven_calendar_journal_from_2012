<p class=dream>Riding with my friend in a cement mixer, we took a
short cut through the woods and he turned down into a ditch that
would force us to dump over sideways, but the other side of the ditch
caught us; I realized he was trying to grease up the side of the
mixer with mud from the other side of the ditch.</p>

<p class=dream>We ditched the mixer and climbed out of the ditch and
I found an article about Japanese manga and how back in WW2 it was
used as a mental purification rite instead of just mental candy.</p>
