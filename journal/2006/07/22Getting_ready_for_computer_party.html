<p>Today is the computer party with Hitomi!  I am glad to return PekoMac to her, and perhaps help
her get started on a brand new domain.  I've done a bit of research and have basically chosen
<a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com">Gallery 2</a>
for her website.</p>

<p>Her computer is basically cleansed of crap, though she may want to keep the pictures I had
imported after our Bali adventure.</p>
