<p>Working in Shibuya today.</p>

<p>10 - 10:40 Yumiko reminded me of Makiko, my favorite at Gaba.  Not as genki, but similar long
hair, big smile and eyes.  We worked on there is slash there are for describing neighborhoods, and
a little bit on prepositions for the same topic.</p>

<p>10:40 - 11:00 Hironori trial lesson was... no show</p>

<p>11:00 - 11:40 Ryuichiro was another no show.</p>

<p>11:40 - 12:00 break</p>

<p>12:00 - 12:40 Makoto no show!</p>

<p>12:40 - 13:20 Tsunehisa broke the trend a came.  He has his own book, basically four panel
story/comics the narration for which he gives in English.  We did three: an old woman who drags her
husband to dance classes and they both end up loving it; a woman who bought a couch online against
her husband's wishes (and the couch never arrived, and website shut down); casual Friday gone awry
when the client suddenly called a meeting!</p>

<p>After Tsunehisa gave his version, we read the book's suggested version.  I thought the second
story was pretty complicated, and pretty offensive.  &quot;She bought the couch anyway&quot; (!!)
why not &quot;they made the decision to buy it anyway&quot; ??  Plus, they were really harsh on The
Internet, as if it's a deadly pit of vipers.</p>

<p>I asked T-dog if he thought internet shopping was dangerous; he said &quot;a little bit.&quot;
I decided to ignore the other one, given that I am still on trial to get a job here or not.</p>

<p class="date">4:20pm JST</p>

<p>Just finished chatting with Yasuhiko for 80 minutes.  During the lesson (soon after lunch) I
started getting sleepy and popped the hugest, most unstoppable woodie in the planet</p>

<p class="date">6:14pm JST Saturday 29 July 2006</p>

<p>Fucked up near the end, as I misunderstood the timing of lessons; I was supposed to be doing a 20
minute level check, but I was settled in for a 40 minute lesson.  Ooops!!</p>

<p>Reiko seemed to handle it and recover everything, though I don't know how much ЗњСА was in that.</p>
