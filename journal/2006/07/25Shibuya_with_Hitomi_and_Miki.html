<p>The plan to trick Hitomi basically didn't work at all because Miki and I were sitting next to
each other when Hitomi walked up.</p>

<p>Ate a lovely dinner at a resaurant that I could probably find again.  Had some dishes for the
first time tonight.  Can't name them, but can describe a couple.</p>

<p>Deep fried spring rolls, but with super shattery fibery shell instead of thin dough.</p>

<p>Large shrimp in an orangey milky sauce.</p>

<p>Something else good.</p>

<p>Dinner conversation was 1/2 English and 1/2 Japanese.  Miki got to understand it all.</p>

<p>Supa thanks to Hitomi for paying the bill; I certainly enjoyed a lovely time.</p>

<p>After dropping Miki off near Shibuya station, Hitomi and I went to the McDonald's on the other
side of Yamanote from Hachiko where we tested out Yahoo!BB connectivity.  It took a bit to follow
all the directions, but got connected.</p>

<p>I was able to connect her WordPress and Gallery2 apps for her website.  Shweet.</p>
