<p>I apparently didn't get enough sleep last night; my brain is
misfiring like pretty-tired mode, and I can't stand to concentrate on
the images project anymore.  Came upon a stumbling block about which
I've asked the developer, but can't bear to work beyond it right
now.</p>

<p>Also, apparently, <a

sleep less than they think they do</a>.</p>

<p>I'm glad to generally sleep each night until I wake up.  No alarms
for me.</p>
