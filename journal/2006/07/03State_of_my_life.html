<h1>State of my life address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I appear to be on the cusp between freedom and working, after
15 glorious world-traveling months of the former.</p></li>

<li><p>I really really don't want to go back to teaching at an
English conversation school.   Argh.</p></li>

<li><p>However, I did an interview at <a
href="http://www.english-village.net/">English Village</a>, the school
Billy, aka Mr Momo, told me about last Friday or so.</p></li>

<li><p>According to the numbers I saw, 60% of the students' pay goes
to the teachers.  They pay every 40 minutes what teachers get every
hour.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been working a lot on my website (likely moving to
dreamhost.com and working on the images display script), using
Hitomi's computer while mine is.... unusable due to lack of a hard
drive and CPU freezes within a couple minutes of booting.</p></li>

<li><p>I've sorta gotten used to Hitomi's keyboard, which is smaller
and Japanesier than mine.  It has keys in the wrong places, but my
fingers can generally find them now.  " ' * _ @ + ~ are all in the
wrong places.</p></li>

<li><p>This version of emacs is buggier than the previous version I
had.  This is version 21.3.50.</p></li>

<li><p>Using Jesse's flat panel display so I don't have to be crunched
up over the laptop to use it.</p></li>

<li><p>At this point, images can check for tables it needs, and I've
got code that can display a directory tree of the image directory.  I
plan to use this code to ease the importation of images.</p></li>

<li><p>No girlfriend, no pets, low money, and for a bit longer, no
job.</p></li>

<li><p>Still wearing the shoulder harness thing from when I broke my
shoulder.  Going to hospital tomorrow for what I hope will be the
final check, and get it off and begin careful exercises.</p></li>

<li><p>Really torn between going home and sticking out one more year
here just to get out of debt.</p></li>

<li><p>Back in touch with Kim Sawyer recently to get my life back on
track.  Thankful for that resource.</p></li>

<li><p>In close touch with Dude and Fred.  Slightly in touch with
Ma.  A bit in touch with Dad.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently fell in love with Rachel from <a
href="http://88slide.com">88slide</a>.  She's a cutie!</p>

<p>Will likely be making a guest appearance on an episode.  Hopefully
more than one!</p>
</li>

<li><p>Downloaded Barkanoid 2, and have enjoyed that a few times.
Only 9 levels available without paying money or cracking it.</p></li>
