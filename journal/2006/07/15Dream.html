<p class="dream">I was asked to clean up the apartment slash office
space held by the PB people about to embark on the 54th voyage.
Carla was supposed to be on the ship in about 12 hours, but hadn't
yet started packing.</p>

<p class="dream">She was in her room with someone, and I was
like, "hey Carla; you gotta get going, yo.." and was beginning to
clean the other parts of the apartment.</p>

<p class="dream">Erick Morrow was the someone in Carla's room, and I
was glad she was with somebody I liked.</p>

<p class="dream">I found a 4x4x4 Rubick's cube and was working on that
with some success while waiting for Carla to get out.  When Erick
walked by, I commented to Katy B-H next to me, "he's cute."</p>

<p>I didn't recognize Erick until I was typing; I knew I knew this guy
while dreaming, but couldn't name him..   Erick was in YRUU and was killed
in a traffic accident late one night while crossing the road.  Alcohol
was involved.</p>
