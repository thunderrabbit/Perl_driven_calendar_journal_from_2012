<p>After spending lots of hours for $5 per person chillin' on internet, Hitomi and I finally got
sick of it and headed out for dinner in … ¿Ó.  A bit of ice cream in front of the station; I was
impressed the girl was able to give me a chocolate banana parfait without chocolate.  Usually it's
"impossible" to change an order.  For example, I determined at McDonald's that buying two 100 yen
shakes gives more shake than one medium shake for 200 yen.  But they are unable to save cups and
give me two small shakes' worth in a medium sized cup.  Maybe it won't fit, but I think it will.</p>

<p>Anyway, she gave me the chocolate banana parfait without chocolate without batting an eye at the
strangeness.  Awesome.</p>
