<p>Trying to fucking sleep right now and someone, drunk, is calling me to complain that I pay to go
out with other women, but don't pay when I got out with her.</p>

<p>Last night she chatted this at me.  While I checked email after she woke me up.</p>

<pre>
Are you sleeping?

<p></p>
<p>And then, 15 minutes later, waking me up again,</p>

<pre>
wow!!! おもしろい！
</pre>

<p>So I blocked her.</p>

<p>Funny - I just realized I donated well over 8 hours of website setup time to her.  That's
normally worth a lot of money.</p>
