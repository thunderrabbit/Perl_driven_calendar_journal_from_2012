<p>I swapped the new card back to the new HDD and it works just fine.
Created a new partition on it called "rob user space" and made a
backup of the junk I have here in my user space on Hitomi's HDD.</p>

<p>Then tried to install ubuntu on the rest of the drive, but was
unable to make it happen.  Probably cause I haven't read any
instructions for how to do the partitioning of the drive, and I wasn't
willing to just let ubuntu do it alone.  If it were to wipe Hitomi's
data on her drive here, that would be a super nightmare.</p>
