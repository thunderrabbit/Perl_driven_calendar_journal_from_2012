<p>Heading out to InterFM, 76.1fm soon, where I hope to hang out with
<a href="http://www.interfm.co.jp/n03_pro/soul.cgi">DJ Marvin
Dangerfield</a> on the air.  I met him at Gaba and he said "c'mon
over!" when I queried about his radio show.</p>

<p>That was over a year ago, but ... I'm going to try it today.</p>

<p>Killa!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The setup here is well bigger than we had in KTRU at Rice.  Three
broadcast rooms, and CDs are in stacks in completely separate rooms.</p>

<p class=date>3:09pm</p>

<p>Chillin' in the broadcast booth with Marvin and the gang; just had
a woman announce the news - wow she has a beautiful voice.</p>

<p>(( this is my first time to ever hear Marvin's show, but I can
write as if I know what's going on: ))</p>

<p>The theme of the week has people emailing about the last time they
cried, given that today's date in Japanese sorta sounds like [to cry]
in Japanese.  Most people have been citing movies.</p>

<p>Marvin was telling me how they try to keep everything super-live;
he doesn't pre-listen to the emails before his assistant Chisako
(perhaps her name) reads them.</p>

<p>Marvin's Japanese is probably better than my English; it's fun to
hear him flipping between languages as needed depending on the topic
and his audience.</p>

<p>Definitely cool to reconnect with broadcasting, even if I
basically can't understand but the gist of what they're talking
about.  Just had Fakie, special guests in the studio.  I had never
heard of them, but that's what a radio appearance should do:
educate the audience.</p>

<p>Cool beans でした。 He had his hands full with people to entertain
by the end of the show; half were guests, half were photographers,
one was his fortune teller (?), and one was me.</p>

<p>I didn't want to try and look comfortable in all their Japanese
yammering and politeness, so I ducked out.</p>

<p>I'll call him tomorrow to see about working in IT at GABA.</p>
