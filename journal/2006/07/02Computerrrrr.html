<p>Hella online day today.</p>

<p>Watched several 88Slide episodes.  Like 20+</p>

<p>Tried to work on images, but webquarry's errorlog viewer thing
wasn't working.  I payed $197 (credit card) toward 2 years of
webhosting on dreamhost, the provider Dude uses.  Not sure that I will
switch to them, but right now, they are looking better than WQ.</p>

<p>Got a fantastical leap forward in my images thing with Stevan
Little's Tree::Simple set of modules.  Ab fab.</p>

<p>Played Barkanoid, discovering that I can switch it from German to
English (very helpful toward my understanding of the finer points of
the game)</p>

<p>Played a 3D water dripping game called Enigmo.  It's pretty cute,
though not actually 3D (*).  That would be even cooler.</p>

<p>(*)  It's as 3D as a hologram.  Move it back and forth to see
different sides, but can't turn it all the way around.</p>

<p>Discovered <a href="http://alloy.mit.edu/">alloy</a>.  Hard
pressed to understand it.</p>
