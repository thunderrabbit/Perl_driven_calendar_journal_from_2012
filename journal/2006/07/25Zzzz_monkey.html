<p>I'm way too tired to write much, but there was a tall guy with a small monkey in Shibuya.  He
was talking on his cell phone with a small crowd of people around him and a monkey climbing all over
them, inspecting everything for edibility and portability.</p>

<p>Dammit if my camera wasn't working.</p>
