<p>The US Embassy in Tokyo has, as a result of US foreign policy of
making the world hate us, built an extra security gate thing through
which we are not allowed to bring computers or cell phones.</p>

<p>They did not check nor scan my cell phone, but asked me to put it
into my computer bag, which they kept like a bag check in a store
full of small valuable items.</p>

<p>Went in to get pages added to my passport, then realized I needed
something I left in my computer bag: Jesse's home address.  Back out
there to scoop it up.</p>

<p>Back inside, I realized I needed my (borrowed) cell phone number.
Back out there to scoop it up.</p>

<p>The guards were basically busy with other people, so they didn't
notice when I kept the cell phone with me and went into the embassy.</p>
