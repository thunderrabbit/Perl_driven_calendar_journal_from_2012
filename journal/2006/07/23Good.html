<p>Have made better headway this time.  Last night, I got WP and G2 installed on pekoneko.com, and
when I was reading the docs on how to link them I discovered they must be installed on the same
DB.  Damn.  I had carefully made sure they were on separate DBs, and in fact had deleted both
installations and started over when I accidentally put them on the same DB.</p>

<p>Now they are in the same DB again, and I have found the source of the link between the two; I
had been distracted by silly wikis full of crap information for a bit, but I got past them to the
real deal.</p>

<p>Chowed at TGI Friday's across the street and about to go back.  I think I've got her site past
the hump and the final configuration will just be a simple install of a WP Plugin that will link
the Gallery 2 data.  Two of the requirements (this was part of the confuzzled part) were already
part of the G2 installation, but just need to be activated.  Better documentation regarding that
would be good.</p>
