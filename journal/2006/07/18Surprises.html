<p>Today, briefly:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Went to US Embassy to have pages added to my passport.  Was
able to get my cellphone into the building, which apparently is a
security breach.</p></li>

<li><p>Found out my Mac will be here Friday or Saturday instead of
today.</p></li>

<li><p>Got an email from Hitomi inviting me to dinner with her and
Miki (from 49th voyage, I believe)</p></li>

<li><p>Discovered a significant bump in Hitomi's computer case, in
the front.  Crap.  I've been trying really hard to keep it perfect; I
don't know what happened.</p></li>

<li><p>Scheduled a time to visit CPC (?) to sign up to be a guinea
pig for drug testing.  They test on gaijin in Japan to confirm
reported test results from US testing before testing on Japanese.</p></li>

<li><p>Got a call from E-V, offering me work tonight.  Like zoom; I
would have to leave right now.  (but I've already left, so I'm good
for time.)</p></li>

<li><p>Looking into ways to help Jesse's project idea.</p></li>
</ol>
