<p>Been talking to Jesse about how we can make money, and the
conversation will continue as I accompany him to do a couple of
errands.</p>

<p>I started the conversation basically like, "hey Jesse; I still
ain't got no job; we've either got to make your business idea work,
or I gots to get out of Japan."</p>

<p>hahah we missed the transfer station on Inokashira line because,
though it's a station "big" enough for all the Inokashira trains to
stop, it's a tiny station compared to what we're used to.</p>
