<p>Back about 6+ months ago, I went to Wara Wara for a Nova party.  I
think I only expected to know Carla there, but a few other teachers
(Benny, Ali, Brett), staff (___ko, ___ko, ___ko), and students were
there as well (Yutaka, Akina).</p>

<p>I was mesmerized by Akina, in the same way when I first met Amanda.
Like, ", , , , , , , , , , wow. . . . . . . . HI! . . . . . ."</p>

<p>At that time, we didn't talk basically at all; there was no time (I
had arrived late) and we were busy with various other conversations,
and <em>our</em> intention-of-conversation had gone on for months
(years).</p>

<p>But, I got her digits, told her I would call her after I got back
from PB 52.</p>

<p>Tonight: the big night.  I finally got my old phone unlocked (I
remembered the code, but for some reason the hardware was being silly
and staying locked, except for rare moments) and I quickly copied all
the phone numbers I wanted out of it.</p>

<p>Standing in Mizonokuchi area, listening to the Peruvian band that
Sally et. al. enjoyed twice in front of Shinjuku station back a year
ago, debating calling Akina.  I basically decided I would have to
assume everyone at Nova would know; she could very well be at Wara
Wara right now with all the Nova teachers and staff around.  Was I
willing to let everyone know I called her?</p>

<p>Ummm... yah.</p>

<p>I debated just being outright like, "I'm looking for work; can I
teach you?" or "do you know of anyone who needs a teacher?" or perhaps
a different thing: "I told you I would call, so here I am," ... and
then I remembered why I had been so focused on her suddenly today:
this morning I had a dream that I called her.</p>

<p>"I dreamt that I called you this morning, so I decided to call you
for real."</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>The number is disconnected.</p>
