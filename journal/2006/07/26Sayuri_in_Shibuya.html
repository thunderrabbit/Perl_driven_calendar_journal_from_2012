<p>Will be meeting Sayuri in Shibuya soon.  7pm at ¥Ï¥Á¸ø¡£ This will be our first lesson; I hope
it goes wonderfully for both of us.</p>

<p>May meet near a Yahoo!BB wireless port to give her the added benefit of email with corrections.</p>

<p>Nice.  We're having great fun; I can hardly believe it's been an hour already.  We're at Mickey
D's and have just chowed and have started talking about days old because she was concerned about
upcoming birthday.</p>

<p>I'm like &quot;no worries, mate!!&quot;</p>

<p>And super thanks to Hitomi for hooking me up with internet access here!!</p>

she says)</p>

<p>We had a great lesson; I showed her some pictures from PB and Bali.. I suddenly realized I can
make quick indexes for the PB pictures, so I did that.</p>

<p>We will meet again in 2 weeks at the latest; hopefully next week some time, though my Wednesday
is already double booked with Miki and Miki.</p>
