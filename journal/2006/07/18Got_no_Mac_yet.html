<p>Erg.</p>

<p>I thought my Mac was supposed to arrive today, but I apparently
misinterpreted the email that I received previously; perhaps it was
shipped from the US today, and will arrive in Japan in a couple days
and <em>then</em> they will forward it on to me.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will arrive Friday or Saturday.</p>
