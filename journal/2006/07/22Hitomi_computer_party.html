<p>And today is the big day; I first uttered computer party probably two weeks ago when Hitomi said
she missed her computer, and I realized it was time to give hers back and get my own.  My laptop was
no longer worth reapiring; "after the extended warranty runs out, the next time it breaks I will buy
a new machine," I had said.</p>

<p>Today was the big day.  I showed her a bunch of new applications on her machine, and have gotten
WordPress and Gallery2 installed on her website, <a href="http://pekoneko.com">pekoneko.com</a>.  I
have *almost* gotten them connected so she can embed pics into her blog entries.  She mostly just
wants to do pictures. but yeah.</p>
