<p>With Hitomi at her friend's work where he is trying to revive my
old computer's HDD after it died when Hitomi and I tried to copy its
data to her computer.</p>

<p>Welp, he wasn't able to fix it, but he said it <em>seemed</em>
to work with an IDE-&gt;USB adapter with power, but his computer
couldn't read the volume; just see the drive existed.</p>

<p>Perhaps buying a $30 adapter with AC (not enough power just with
USB to make it work) will bring the drive and data back to life!</p>
