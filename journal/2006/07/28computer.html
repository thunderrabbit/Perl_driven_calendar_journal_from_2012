<p>Saw that Google offers an open source code repository using Subversion as the engine.  I've never used
Subversion before (nor CVS), so I am sortakinda getting a sense of how to do it.  I'm probably going to
host my images project there.  No real reason to do that, though (at least not at this stage), but
I just wanna try out Google's offerings.</p>
