<p>Hitomi has offered to help me purchase a new Mac, though I am not
actually sure why.  I certainly don't mind the support, but doing more
than just recovering my old HD is more than I judge she needs to
do.</p>

<p>((Just for a bit of clarity: my computer began to lock up within
minutes after booting after my shoulder-breaking TJ Bike adventure.
Hitomi, knowing how much I love my Mac-time, offered to let me copy my
HD to her HD and let me use her computer.  She had the hardware to do
the transfer, so we got all set up to do it.  In her excitement to get
it done quickly, she accidentally killed my HD.</p>

<p>She felt super duper bad, and I was totally like, "don't worry; the
data is fine, just the motor is dead," etc.  She took it to her HD
mechanic who didn't have the replacement parts for such an old drive,
so (just last night) I ordered an identical model number from ebay for
$40 (thanks, <a href="http://froogle.google.com/">froogle</a>!)  (but
for $35 shipping (it turns out (the shipping price made a big jump
from $9.95 (after I confirmed my desire to purchase))) since it's
being sent overseas).))</p>

<p>I would like to get a PowerMac Pro, but certainly don't need it.
But, but...  glowing keys!! auto-screen brightness!</p>
