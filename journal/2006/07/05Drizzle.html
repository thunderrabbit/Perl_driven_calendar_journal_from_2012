<p>Rainy season here in Japan (at least Tokyo), so umbrellas are
rampant.  I'm wearing the banana leaf flipflops I got in Bali, though
they are a bit slippery so I took them off while walking down the
street.  Put them on to walk down the steps into the station,
wondering at the levels of irony at putting on slippery flipflops when
going down more dangerous terrain /slash/ why/if people would care
more/at all if I am running around barefootfully in the train
station vs outside.</p>
