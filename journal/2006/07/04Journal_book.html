<p>Good news is I've been reading a scad of articles, including
reviews of <a href="http://eefoof.com">eefoof.com</a> which pays users
for ad revenues generated for cool videos, and <a
href="http://lulu.tv">lulu.tv</a> which does the same (but only for
pro users), and has a print-on-demand thing for books, .... which I
could use to print my journal...  or parts of it.  or something.</p>
