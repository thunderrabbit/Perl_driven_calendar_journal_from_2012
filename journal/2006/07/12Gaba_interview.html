<p>Allowed plenty of time to arrive at Gaba for a 6pm interview; I
have been here a few minutes, and I certainly didn't hurry.</p>

<p>Interesting to be back in this office near Ebisu.</p>

<p class=date>5:58pm</p>

<p>Just met a cat named Peter who is reinterviewing for a job
teaching; he is going to school 20 hours per week for Japanese.  6
months = 380,000 yen, same price as my shoulder.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>He said, "I had been saying that too, and then when I got back
from Europe I was like, 'okay, I'm going to do it.'"</p>

<p class=date>8:12pm</p>

<p>Interview went well.  I met Gary Smith, Benjamin something and Ron
something else (probably).  Gary is the director of IT; he basically
said I don't have the skills they are looking for overall, but perhaps
I could work as a teacher and be trained at the same time.  Talked to
Benjamin who is in charge of web-development, and he seemed
indifferent, but nothing seems to phase him, so I actually think he
was rather keen... but there's still the pesky issue of getting a visa
and not being able to work until then.</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>In the end, I talked to Ron, the current recruiter for teachers.
He will contact me this week to say Yay or Neigh, though he tended to
indicate it would be nay.</p>
