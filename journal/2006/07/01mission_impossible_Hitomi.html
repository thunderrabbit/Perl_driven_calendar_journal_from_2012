<p>Saw Mission Impossible 3 with Hitomi last night at Cinecitta in
Kawasaki.  I was in a decent mood before the movie as we chowed
takoyaki next to the World's Shortest Escalator and then ice cream at
31 Flavors at the bottom of the Dice building.</p>

<p>But after the movie, on the way back to the station, I just got
irritated when it was time to part and Hitomi seemed to want to delay
the parting.  I felt pretty bad all the way home, and wrote her an
apology email. Even now the next day (given that she hasn't written
back) I feel pretty shite over it.</p>
