<p>Nice: the crowning &quot;achievement&quot; included finding a version of Emacs whose
sgml-mode.el file I can edit!  I've now gotten html-rob-paragraph working again (it writes either
&lt;p&gt; or &lt;p class=&quot;dream&quot;&gt;, depending on the name of the html file.  Also C-ct
and C-cT are working (create timestamp and full datestamp, respectively).  Have't gotten C-cJ
(Japanese date) working yet.</p>

<p>And got Hitom's website pretty well set up, to the point that she's been happily uploading
pictures, ... even using an FTP program to do it batchfully.</p>

<p>I am so tired right now, that I have to like consciously push adrenaline from my adrenal gland
into my brain.</p>
