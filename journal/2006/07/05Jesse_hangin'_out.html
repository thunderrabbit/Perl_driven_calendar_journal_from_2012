<p>Semi-wandering around in the rain looking for a non-existant exit
on the far side of the school to walk to Musashi Shinjo instead of
Musashi Nakahara, thereby saving 20 yen on Nambu Line, <em>and</em>
discovering a Korean food store where Jesse scooped up several
different food items and a can of coconut juice drink for super
cheap.</p>

<p>Takoyaki shop for 6 takoyaki balls for 250 yen.  Neither of us
noticed they gave us 7 balls before we both claimed the last one
wasn't ours.  "I ate three" "Well, <em>I</em> ate three..." and we
both mulled over the memories to make sure we were right...  yes;
three.</p>

<p>[um, did you give us 7?]</p>

<p>[yes]</p>

<p>Wow; cool.</p>

<p>Jesse decided the coconut juice was fantastic, and well worth the
price, so I decided I wanted my own can, but he would have to go into
the store because it reeked of stale cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>"The woman's teeth are black, too," reported Jesse.</p>

<p>I sent him in with 200 yen so he could get another can for
himself, and he came out with like four cans plus two extra cans of</p>

<p>"they have guava juice!!!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I love guava juice!" we announced in unison.</p>

<p>"Really?  You want some?"</p>

<p>"def!"</p>

<p>So he went back in for two more cans of guava juice.</p>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Canned jackfruit on display outside the store tempted me; I loved
the fresh jackfruit in Bali enough to nearly call it my favorite
fruit.  But canned....?</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>Nah.</p>

<p>Just a bit ago I gave the shoulder strap to Hiroko, owner of the
small casual clothes shop near the station; she had expressed
significant interest in it for her son when I went in looking for
shorts a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>I asked if they could order some shorts for me, but the supplier
was out.. Columbia Sportswear has some phat rip-stop fabric shorts
that I totally would want, but they are too long for me.  I like them
above the knees.  <em>Might</em> go get them anyway.</p>
