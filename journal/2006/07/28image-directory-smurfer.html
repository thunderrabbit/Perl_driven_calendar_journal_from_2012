<p>Damn.  I had created a project &quot;image-directory-smurfer&quot; on code.google.com, and
finally figured out how to import source code to it.  BUT, I didn't want to import my entire cgi-bin
directory, so I made a subdirectory with symlinks to the necessary files in cgi-bin.</p>

<p>The first import was flawed in that I had created a local version of tags/ branches/ and trunk/,
and they all got copied into the trunk/ in the repository, so my code was available in trunk/trunk/
which is just stupid.</p>

<p>I fixed that, and then went to check my handywork.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the previously imported directories were still there, cluttering up the directory
structure.  But even worse, the import didn't follow the symbolic links.  Just made a file with the text
&quot;Link to /full/path/filename.ext&quot; for whatever files I had symlinked.</p>

<p>I deleted the project.  But I really liked the name.</p>

<p>Knowing Google's (in)ability to handle individual users' issues, I bet it would be a huge pain to
recover the name and start over with the source.</p>
