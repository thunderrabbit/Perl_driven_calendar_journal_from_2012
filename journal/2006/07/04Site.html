<p>I haven't heard a peep from webquarry after I complainfully
wondered why their service levels have declined recently.</p>

<p>Still a couple of obstacles to overcome in a move to new server (<a
href="http://dreamhost.com">dreamhost.com</a>), like how to get mySQL
dbs transferred (I have instructions, just haven't done it), and all
the perl modules I've installed recently.  May use Shlomi (sp) Fish's
module-list-thing which apparently simplifies installation of modules
for running Shlomi's site.</p>

<p>Good progress on images.  Now working on imagesadmin, which
features basically the best programming I've done, <em>not
including</em> making a grand plan and flowcharting the design.  But
except for that, the code is great!</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com">thunderrabbit.com</a>
restored on dreamhost, and I <em>think</em> I can test robnugen.com
functionality on the new server at rob.thunderrabbit.com, though I
haven't tried to set that up yet.</p>

<p>Not sure what the heck else to do with thunderrabbit.com; perhaps
write write write and let lulu.tv bind some books.</p>

<p>If I get kick-ass images code written, I may set up a wiki for
documentation / discussion, though it will probably be just me
yammering in a big empty room.</p>

<p>Nice.  Got the main div to display the tree starting from the
branch clicked on the sidebar panel.</p>
