<p>Headed home to Jesse's where I crossed paths with him and Anna (and
the rest of the bible study crew) on their way home (Jesse escorting
to the station) and thought I should perhaps walk with them just a
second after it was "too late," so I didn't turn around and join
them.</p>

<p>Got home and the door is locked.  And I don't have the key.</p>
