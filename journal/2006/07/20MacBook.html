<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>My (credit card company's) new MacBook arrived today.  Francois and I took a lot of pictures while opening
the box.  During the day I've been configuring the machine and downloading the software I want:
<a href="http://worldfirefoxday.com">Firefox</a> (invited myself to get into the version 2 source
code), Flock, Skype, Adium, Google Earth, and last, Emacs.</p>

<p>Found a site that has weekly builds of emacs for OS X.  porkrind.org, I think.  I downloaded the
most recent one and installed.  Coolio, BUT, like on Hitomi's machine, all the source code is owned
by root, so I don't have access to configure it (I haven't yet set up a root user on the machine).</p>

<p>The porkrind guy gets the build from CVS; I imagine if I do that from within my account, it will
be installed and owned by me.</p>

<p>But I have little or no clue how to download from CVS.  Though I do know what it is.</p>
