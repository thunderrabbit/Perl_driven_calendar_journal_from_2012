<p>Nice.  Got Hitomi's site to a place where she is now uploading pictures and creating albums.  She
seems rather happy with the whole thing.  I'm glad to see her excited about it!  Next step is to get
the album linked to her wordpress installation, but I am at a root-disabled dead end; I need the
server admins to chown the wordpress directories in her user space from root to Hitomi's
username.</p>
