<p>Last night I left my computer running with USB cooling fan running as well.  I forgot, however
to plug in the computer.  (plugged thw power supply into the wall, but didn't plug the other end
into the computer...)  This morning, I noted the machine completely off and realized my mistake.
Plugged it in, had to hit the power button to turn it on. and was surprised that it didn't start
from 0; it had saved everything, including the final image of the screen saver!</p>

<p>Everything was
saved, though the battery was deadder than a doornail, as we used to say.  So dead, in fact, that
it hasn't flipped from 0 to 1% charge.  I hope I haven't fucked up the battery by running it
completely out.  That would suck; batteries are not covered under Applecare warranty.</p>

<p>Ah.  Just now 1%.</p>
