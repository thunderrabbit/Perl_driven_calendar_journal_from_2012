<p>Woah.  I'm thankful to have woken up instead of releasing that pile
of crap in bed.  A half liter of vanilla ice cream last night may have
contributed to this lactose-intolerant's morning productivity.</p>

<p>I remember when I first woke up thinking it was a weird time (in
terms of my dream) to wake up.  Then I felt the painful cramps and
realized why.</p>
