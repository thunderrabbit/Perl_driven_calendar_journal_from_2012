<p>Really enjoyed this game before and am really thinking about getting back into it.</p>

<p>For some reason the demo doesn't have the game editor built in, or I can't figure out out to get
to it.</p>

<p>I lost the games I had created before, but they were on an archive I gave to Fred for safe
keeping.  If he can come up with those, I will quite likely buy the game and continue working on
those.</p>

<p>Actually,... I submitted some of the games to Garage Games, so those data files are in my gmail
account and possibly online at Garage Games.</p>

<p>But the coolest game, the unfinished game,...  hadn't been uploaded (given that it was
unfinished).  I hope Fred can recover that backup copy!</p>
