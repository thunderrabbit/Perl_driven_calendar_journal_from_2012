<p>Just had a fantastic 1.75 hour chat with Kris (49th, Vancouver, but
now BFE Canada), which started with me whining about my joblessness,
then girlessness, then how the fuck did Carl go from dessert-eating
contests to PB staff, and we started talking about PB and old pictures
and briefly the fucked up situation in Middle East (Israel attacking
Lebanon).</p>

<p>Told her the story about Alice; Kris said I should definitely call
to see about the "long time stay okay" plan over there.</p>

<p>Kris is a kinesiologist, so she did a remote session with me on my
shoulder, scoping the <a
href="/images/travel/tjbike/kyoto2006/almost_finished/Page3_no_blood.shtml">X-rays
of my shoulder</a> online and asking me to move it in various ways to
see where it's tight/painful, etc (which is actually in only a very
small area; if my arm is relaxed straight down and I rotate it
backwards, that is kinda tight.  Everywhere else has the same range of
motion as my right shoulder).</p>

<p>Super thankful she will show the pics to her mates at work on
Monday.  Hopefully fun show-n-tell for her!</p>

<p>Her cell phone rang a couple of times: the guy she was seeing, but
was supposed to dump tonight, but ended up not going out at all.  I'm
glad for my sake she didn't answer, but too bad for him, I guess.
Though what an irony when I was talking about women not answering my
calls or encouraging further connection.</p>

<p>And all of that goes perfectly with <em>both</em> of us saying the
<em>other</em> one's life looks so cool (she with a real job, me in
another continent), and I'm thinking there is something skewed about
our perspectives.</p>

<p>Good luck to me figuring out my life; good luck to she dumping
that guy.</p>
