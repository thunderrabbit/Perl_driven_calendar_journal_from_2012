<p>Meeting Hitomi today in Harajuku for a breakfast picnic (Roboyaki)
and hanging out plus English lesson because someone is desperate for money.</p>

<p>Brilliant day today overall, but Hitomi got a bit too overheated
while taking all the photographs of the freaks in Harajuku.</p>

<p>I chatted for a significant time with Fefu and Vega; Vega teaches
in Kyushu; Fefu is here on vacation for a bit.  Vega gave me a brief
history lesson leading up to crazy costumes in Harajuku, and said she
would email me a more extensive version.</p>

<p>Hitomi and I walked around Mejijingu, down a street/path I had
never taken before.  Had a funny idea of a Francois video being
purified at the entrance of the shrine.  Basically him using the
super long-handle scoop thing and not anywhere near able to pour it
on his other hand.  We'd have to show a human how to do it first.</p>

<p>Wonder if we could make it actually funny with a plot.</p>

<p>Hitomi practiced answering telephone for her work; she has to take
calls in English at times.  She wasn't serious throughout the
practice, so I was a bit, like, do you want to learn this?? but didn't
say anything because I didn't want to fight with her.</p>

<p>During the day I kept asking her if she wanted a website, because
I think she could really get into uploading a ton of pictures, and
it's something that I can easily teach.  'cept that I don't know of
any template / design tools in Japanese.</p>

<p>Also kept making references to our upcoming computer party, where
I will give back her Mac after having received my new Mac.
Hopefully on the 18th!</p>
