<p>They just called me.</p>

<p class="date">11:08am JST Tuesday 4 July 2006</p>

<p>My doctor (still don't remember his name) said I have 80%
bone-reconnection (at 5 weeks after surgery) and everything is
looking good.</p>

<p>I can begin stretching and exercising the shoulder, and basically
have 240 degrees of forward vertical freedom from almost straight up
to a bit beyond straight down, and 180 degrees of forward horizontal
freedom, which will come in handy for washing my other shoulder.</p>

<p>No longer have to wear the back strap, so I'm going to give it to
Hiroko the clothes shop owner near ºù¿·Ä®±Ø, who wants it for her
son.</p>
