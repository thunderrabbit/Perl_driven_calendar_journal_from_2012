<p class="dream">Back in Jerusalem, walking near where a road was
being repaved against the Palestinian's wishes, over an area they
considered sacred.  I could feel the weight of stares on me as I
walked through the affluent Israeli neighborhood and into the
Palestinian neighborhood, with both sides wondering which side I was
on.</p>

<p class="dream">As I walked along, I realized I shoulda brought my
camera; this even would be remembered for years and it would be nice
to have pictures from when it happened.</p>

<p class="dream">As I walked along the newly paved road, I looked up
at the wall which was a chalk board from history class, with a
writing assignmeent quickly scrawled, asking us to describe the
historical background leading to this event and its likely affect
toward the future.</p>

<p class="dream">I wished I had been listening when the assignment
had been written, as I wasn't quite able to make out all the words,
but I had a general idea of what it was.  I figured I was in a pretty
good place, though; I was the only student in the class who had been
present when the road was being repaved.</p>
