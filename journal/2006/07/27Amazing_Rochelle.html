<p>I got this email from Rochelle, one of the amazing people I met in Palestine:</p>

Hello to all on the list Serena and I created for our travels to Occupied
Palestine...

As most of you know, after returning from the middle east, Serena and I
embarked on a two and a half month journey around the states to talk about
our experiences and to show photos and and tell stories from our four
months and the ongoing struggle of the Palestinian people for freedom,
justice and peace.  We spoke to fifty audiences in churches, community
college classrooms, social justice centers, and more.  It was a great
experience and a powerful way to transition back to America after
witnessing such insane US supported injustice and violence.  Thanks to
each of you who helped us make that tour possible. It fills me with such
sadness to see the current situation in the Middle East worsen and to see
so many more innocent civilians murdered as Israel expands its violence
into Lebanon.  It equally pains me to see the US Congress respond with
such support for Israels military actions and policies that are bringing
no one closer to peace. The crisis in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon never
would have come to pass without the uncritical economic, military, and
diplomatic support that the United States provides Israel.  I am inspired
by those (many of you in fact) that continue to work tirelessly for a much
needed change.

I am writing this e-mail to let you all know that I decided to continue my
travels and am currently in Mexico with plans to volunteer in the
indigenous communities in Chiapas. I hope to continue south into Central
and possibly, depending on funds, into South America.  What is occurring
in Latin America today truly gives me hope as the resistance to
neoliberalism is growing, from the Zapatistas in Mexico, the MST in
Brazil, and other popular movements throughout Latin America.  The
elections of left leaders in Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile,
although there are many criticisms of their leadership, is still an
inspiring change.  The people are reclaiming control over their resources,
their economy, their jobs, etc...  The incessant growing inequality caused
by neoliberalism can not continue and I look forward to traveling and
learning from these amazing movements. Palestine will remain deeply
embedded in my heart and I look forward to expanding my understanding of
how interconnected the struggles in Latin America are to those in the
Middle East, to those in the United States and to those around the world.

Which brings me to the purpose of this e-mail, I am planning to continue
to write occasional e-mails to this list with updates from my travels
focusing on the global movement for social justice and observations of
various struggles.  If you are not interested in receiving these e-mails
(on average no more than once a week) feel free to unsubscribe from this
list by simply sending an e-mail to
globalsolidarity-unsubscribe at lists.riseup.net
(no hard feelings I promise I know how overwhelming e-mail can become :)
I hope Serena will continue to contribute to this list as well.  She is
spending some time in the States and I hope she too will travel south in
the near future.

In solidarity...
