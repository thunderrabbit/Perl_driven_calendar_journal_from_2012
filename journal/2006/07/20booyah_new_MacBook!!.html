<p>New MacBook *and* new wireless keyboard.  Using the keyboard now.  <em>Almost</em> don't care
that I can't edit the sgml.el file.</p>

<p>It appears I will be needing a wireless mouse; or at least a corded mouse.</p>

<p>My fingers are not 100% back on track with this keyboard; the ctrl key is down in the bottom
left; I keep hitting CAPS LOCK instead of CONTRL.</p>

<p>Can't stay up all night; I gots to be up early to meet Miki; but just let it be recorded that I
am quite happy with my new machine.   And I haven't even loaded all the stuff I want for it yet.</p>
