<p>Jesse and I split a 1000ml carton of juice; he poured his half into
a bottle and I was drinking from the carton, though using a straw.</p>

<p>Finishing the last of the beverage, I sucked on the straw, but
tilted the carton back as if to knock back the last chug, which then
poured onto my shirt.</p>

<p>hahahaha!  idiot.</p>
