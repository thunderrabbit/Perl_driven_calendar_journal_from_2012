<p>Got here in plenty of time though it was my first time to visit Shinjuku EV.  Turns out South
Exit is the exit I know; I just keep forgetting its name.</p>

<p>Masako greeted me, and was patient with me telling who I was though she knew already.</p>

<p>First lesson with Asako was pleasant; her 2nd trial lesson, and I am sure she had fun; just
general chitchat of greetings and family and translating her Japanese to English, plus correcting
her pronunciation of 13 and 30.</p>

<p>from Charles' lesson next door:</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like a bowl of soup and to drink a glass of potato juice.&quot;</p>

<p>lesson with Makoto and Yusuke was interesting; their level is higher than their text, and they
were hardly willing to produce language on their own.  I don't really understand their motivation;
are they just waiting for direction???</p>

<p>Chie brought in her own paper; she read about Dry Tortugas, the least-visited national park in
the US, located 112km west of Key West, Florida.</p>

<p>Told her about my idea to bring Mankind Project to Japan.</p>

<p>Lesson with Satoko was pretty chatty; we talked about travel; she's been several places.  Funny
was when she said she wanted to see NASCAR and I was like, &quot;really????&quot; but she's talking
about a place in Peru, not car racing.</p>

<p>Mamiko cancelled, so I'm chillin' for 40 minutes before the last lesson with Fujisawasan.</p>
