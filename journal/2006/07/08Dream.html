<p class="dream">At General Assembly with Jesse in a small little town
with one big hill where the main hall was located, in a building with
lots of windows; quite beautiful.</p>

<p class="dream">Jesse and I had been looking through old pictures of
past YRUU events, and I couldn't remember all the names of the youth,
and for some reason I chose not to look up any of the names I
couldn't remember.</p>

<p class="dream">We had an alligator in the refrigerator, but the gator
was sleeping in a vat of tapioca pudding.  If the alligator woke up,
it would be really pissed and probably bite one of us, if it knew
we were siphoning pudding into a jar.</p>

<p class="dream">So we had to be really careful; Jesse hooked the hose
(a stethescope) up to the refrigerator, and I controlled the output,
letting the pudding squirt out the ear pieces of the stethescope into
a jar.</p>

<p class="dream">The pudding came out more quickly than I expected, so
the jar I had chosen filled up pretty rapidly.  I squeezed the tubes
shut and went to look for another container.</p>

<p class="dream">One of the youth who I couldn't name arrived, and
Jesse thought it would be funny to use the hose to spray water on
her.  I told him not to, but he still did it, and I got pissed at him
for not respecting the youth nor acknowledging my request.  In our
struggle, he ended up with water sprayed on him, and he wasn't too
happy about it.  "See?? it's not very nice!"</p>

<p class="dream">The youth seemed good natured about it, and that was
lucky; I went out to the main strip to chill and saw my mom walking
by, but I didn't talk to her because it wasn't surprising to see her
here at GA.</p>

<p class="dream">Plus, she was probably busy.</p>
