<p>Headed to Jesse's high school English classes before they rock out
for the summer.  These are the students who knew me before I arrived,
so they asked me to come back.</p>

<p class=date>11:18am</p>

<p>First class was a success!  We had fun hollering names of students
as we handed out papers.  A couple of times as we rolled through the
stacks of paper, names appeared on top of both stacks, so we were
yelling the same names, sometimes pretending not to notice.</p>

<p>One girl kept smiling and giving me eyes; I thought of Indiana
Jones.</p>

<p class=date>12:19pm</p>

<p>Second class was suuuuuuuuper quiet!!  Pretty difficult to know if
they were comprehending, confused, sleeping or something else.</p>

<p>To keep some level of entertainment, Jesse did a little stand-up
comedy sketch about Japanese on cell phones, using a long string of
short grunts of listening / acknowledgement.  I then did a rap, faking
on my (Jesse's) cellphone like "uh uh yeah uh"...  I cut it short
because I thought it was dumb, but the students clapped
appreciatively.</p>

<p>Lunch now.</p>

<p>Last class turned into two half classes; I got pulled into the
other assistant teacher's class to read some stuff with good ol'
'merican pronunciation.  The students flipped when I walked in
barefoot.  Hahahah!</p>

<p>Jesse came in soon thereafter and we read in funny accents. (school
girl, old woman, southern drawl, etc)</p>

<p>We were each reading from a thin workbook, which I immediately
started to spin on my finger - an old trick I learned starting in high
school.  Most of the boys started to emulate, trying to learn this
valuable skill to the possible detriment of their attention to the
class.</p>
