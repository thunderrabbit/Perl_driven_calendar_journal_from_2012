<p>Hitomi planned to meet Miki in Shibuya.  I know Miki from 49th voyage, so Hitomi invited me, as
a surprise to Miki.</p>

<p>But, Miki and I met up at 54th departure, so we planned to play a trick on Hitomi tonight:
pretend like we don't know each other.</p>

<p>I wonder how it will turn out.</p>
