<p class="dream">In a YRUUer-filled guest house type place, and it was my first night there.  I
needed to get settled and the next morning get some food.  I found some bananas in the kitchen, and
took 1 that looked just slightly freckled, and then a saw an even larger banana collection by the
sink with even more freckles, so I took one of those and replaced the first one.</p>

<p class="dream">I wanted some cereal and found a seemingly abandoned pot of milk and cereal, still
cold, and a bit crunchy.  Katie Lucach was on the other side of the screen in the kitchen and I
asked her if it was her cereal.  She said, &quot;no; it's yours,&quot; and I wondered if she had the
authority to give it to me, or just the wisdom of living here for a while to know it would be wasted
if I didn't eat it.</p>
