<p>Got a login to writely.com today.  They were bought by google;
good job, writely!</p>

<p>Found a bug in CGI.pm version 3.04 (hidden fields don't have id
tag) but it's been fixed in 3.20, which is not on my system, so I
downloaded it and figured out how to get my perl script to find it</p>

<pre>
use lib "/home/thunderrabbit/perlmods/share/perl/5.8"; 
use CGI 3.20;  # new version is only in my local space.  It corrects a bug with hidden fields not displaying id
</pre>

<p>Encouraged dreamhost to upgrade to the new version.</p>

<p>Um.. got a frappr login as well, and am/was a bit intrigued by the
chat box thing.</p>
