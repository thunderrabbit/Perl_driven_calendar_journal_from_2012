<p>Lazy day today; Jesse cooked a fantastic brunch and then was working on his computer some until
oops he was a couple minutes late for his 1:45 meeting friends downstairs.  I was like "la la la"
glad to have all the free time in the world.</p>

<p>Working on my website, found an issue with symlinks; for some reason I ended up with some
circular symlinks in my journal directories (2006/08 and 2006/09 pointed back to themselves) and
while correcting that, I noticed that orphaned symlinks are showing up like good symlinks, even
though their color code (according to dircolors) appears to be set to RED with black background or
something.</p>

<p>The main and my local LS_COLORS variable has orphans set to a noticible color, but... when I ls,
they are not noticeable.</p>

<p>Possibly</p>
