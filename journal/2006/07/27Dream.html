<p class="dream">A guy came over to buy a gas range appliance that I hadn't used.  There were
actually two of them available, one for 100 dollars and the other for 200.  He asked why I didn't
want them, and I was like cause I never use them.  They actually wern't even mine, but Jesse had
basically abandoned claim to them, so I took responsibility for dumping them.</p>

<p class="dream">The guy looked familiar when he came over, so I let him in no problem.  He
immediately went into my room and claimed that a box which had ben dropped off today was his.  I
couldn't prove that it wasn't, and I had no information either way, so I let him take it.  Then he
saw the sale price on the cooking stoves.</p>

<p class="dream">Had not made plans to meet my new student again next time, so I needed to contact
her, but when I got home, the washer and dryer had been replaced with two washer/dryer units.  I
noted that they were both basically the same and asked my mom if they were basically evaluation
models, and we would give one back soon.  I liked the one on the left better because it seemed to
have a bigger washer basket, but it turns out it was actually smaller, though I am sure it couldn't
have been because its radius was wider than the other one, and radius affects volume squared, though
depth affects only 1 dimension of volume.</p>
