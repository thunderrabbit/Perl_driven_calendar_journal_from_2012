<p>Wow.  Another PB departure from the wrong side of the rail.  Came to Osanbashi with KG Miki, and
happened to be met by PB49 Miki as well!  Stood in the drizzle for 2.5 hours hoping for glances of
GET Ts helping passengers onboard, and then lots of waving and</p>

<p>PB49 Miki showed up while I was watching GET T activity behind the windows of the boarding
platform.  "Wow, Miki!"   This time, I remembered her name.</p>

<p>Finally they finished loading and Carla waved to us through the windows; so fun that I ASLed my
phone number to her and she called me!!!  They had a quick semi-cancelled meeting and started to
come out on the top deck.  Used 49Miki's cellphone to call Carla who reported the champagne was
cancelled due to rain; didn't want drunk people to slip on the deck.  Streamers also cancelled, but
plenty of turnout for the departure.  Wow.  54th voyage on their way.</p>

<p>Sabrina waved HI; I heard a rumor that she had been promoted, and her uniform seemed to agree.
Awesome!  Carla said she'll be on the entire voyage; I hope to make time to write a card to her.</p>

<p>Got cold / crowded out and stepped back from the fence and Tamo from 52nd newspaper team found
me! Wow; she is staff now, too, answering phones and such.  Chatted with her a bit, exchanged
contact info; headed inside.</p>

<p>Met Ayako inside; I didn't remember her name, but she reminded me she had emailed me after
hearing about my shoulder.  Ahhhh...   yes.  Ayako!  perhaps.</p>

<p>I do remember her face from the voyage, and I taught her and friends how to sign their names in
ASL, but that hadn't been enough for me to recall them.</p>

<p>Lunch with Miki and Miki at a chinese buffet.  Lovely lovely lovely.</p>
