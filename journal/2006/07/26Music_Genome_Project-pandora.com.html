<p>Wow.  I just entered &quot;nine inch nails&quot;
into <a href="http://pandora.com">pandora.com</a> and it came up with &quot;The Wretched
(Remix)&quot; which I played relentlessly in headphones while working at FSD back in the day.
That's when I used to use terms like &quot;until my ears were bleeding&quot; after listening so long
and so loud.</p>
