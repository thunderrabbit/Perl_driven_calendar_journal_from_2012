<p class="dream">I was working on a project, but was asking Fred if he could put together a
conference for it.  I didn't want to do that part of the work, so I called him in to do it.  I came
up with an idea for boosting attendance, &quot;who do you know in the academic community who would
benefit from this?&quot; and perhaps if we inivited peoples' friends, they would want to come as
well.</p>

<p class="dream">Fred seemed well-impressed with that bit of logic.  I thought it was pretty cool
myself.</p>
