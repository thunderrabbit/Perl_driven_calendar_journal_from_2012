<p class="dream">Wih a new group of friends I came across in a stadium playing frisbee, but with
little wack frisbees instead of ultimate discs (little cheap promotional discs), not golf discs, and
they welcomed me into the group, and I immediately thought of a new game to play.</p>

<p class="dream">One person throws a water bottle, and another person catches it.  The person who
threw the bottle then gives a task for the catcher to do.  If the catcher can't do it, the next
nearby person tries it until someone can complete it and gets the point.</p>

<p class="dream">Someone threw to me, and my task was to charade being on the beach.  I didn't have
much room, but danced around frolickingly a bit, and the did a shoulder roll, though I didn't get
all the way back up, so I thought the group was going to booboo my attempt, but they gave me the
point.</p>

<p class="dream">I threw the bottle, and the person toyed with wanting to know what the task was
before choosing to accept (clearly against the rules), but she finally accepted and I was like,
&quot;use the bottle as a chair&quot; and it took her a while to get it; she seemed to think it
really hurt to sit on the bottle, even sideways. I was able to do it with little or no
discomfort.</p>
