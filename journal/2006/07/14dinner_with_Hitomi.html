<p>To ビックカメラ in 渋谷, but they didn't have the drive adapter.
Headed to 新宿のヨドバシカメラ, and found just what we needed.</p>

<p>Wandered a little bit until we found an Italian restaurant where
we enjoyed avacado/cheese/chicken goop in avacado shell, and thin
(super thin, like corn chips) thin cheese pizza.  I didn't really
care for the salad (too vinegary) nor the smoking (too smokey) so we
ducked out quickly, but not before I used the 1/6th crispy pizza
slice as a new nose (props to Supa-funny Shawn on 49th for that idea)
and nearly licked the avacado skin clean.</p>

<p>Back to the part of Shinjuku that I know in search of ice cream,
but by that point the shops were closed or fast-closing as 10pm
rolled by.  As in, we walked out of the mall area as the guards were
locking the doors.</p>

<p>Found a soft cream (soft serve ice cream) shop down the steps near
GAP and ... it was okay, but not particularly vanillafied.
McDonald's 100 yen shake would have been better.</p>

<p>仁美 suggested we wander around, so I led her to where
I <em>thought</em> I had stayed my first night in Japan: the Sun
Route Hotel in Shinjuku.  Instead of the hotel, a construction
project filled the lot.</p>

<p>"The hotel is gone???"  Not likely that it wasn't getting enough
business, being in such a fantastically crowded and wealthy city...</p>

<p>I told Hitomi why I had dragged her that direction, and she
promptly pointed to the sign describing the construction.</p>

<p>Ah. ホテルソンロウト (Hotel Sun Route), being rebuilt on this site.</p>

<p>Very glad to know my sense of direction had led me well.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Told her the story of losing my keys on my first day alone in the
city, and buying 10 tickets (hoping for a discount) when I could only
use 1, and how frightfully confusing Shinjuku is to a newbie,
especially an illiterate one.</p>

<p>But now..  man I got this Tokyo shit figured <em>out</em> (*)... I
even bought Hitomi her <em>first</em> Suica (which translates to water
melon, but is the brand name for a cash card that works on JR
lines).</p>

<p>(*) not figured out</p>

<p>Took the train to Shibuya where I hopped off, and she stayed on
(til Shinagawa, then Kawasaki, then home).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Walking through Shibuya when the creatures of the night have fully
taken over, I felt both なつかし and a sense that this will be one of
my last times to see it.</p>

<p>Am I heading home soon?</p>
