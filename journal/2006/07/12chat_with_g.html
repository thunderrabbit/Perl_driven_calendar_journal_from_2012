<p>woah.  Talked to Fred until 5am; it was great.  I actually did most
of the talking, given that I had come up with a list of topics.  I
added his car in there just to make sure I didn't <em>totally</em>
dominate.</p>

<p>So great to reconnect with g.</p>

<p><a href="/images/peeps/g/thanks,g!.jpg"><img
src="/images/peeps/g/thumbs/thanks,g!.jpg" align="left" /></a> I showed him my
imagesadmin, and he "helped" me by clicking all the links on the
screen, delighting in the 404 messages that say they were sending me
an email.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>The good thing is that gives me a design constraint for my new 404
which will look up files in db.  In addition to an option to ignore a
404 (which I had already considered), only warning about new 404s once.</p>
