<p>"Fuck fuck fuck!"</p>

<p>That was my immediate response when I got the email from Hideo, at the CPC thing asking if I was
going to come today or not.</p>

<p>Ah, crap.  1000% forgot, and was happily listening to tunes, chatting with Calder, wondering why
orphaned links on my bash shell are not showing up in bright colors.</p>

<p>It appears I will make it to Azalea by 2:45, which Hideo said would be okay as I freaked, shut
down the computer and almost ran out before confirming that time would be okay.</p>

<p>Made it.  Received 4000 yen for applying.  Sweet!</p>

<p>I bought him a thing of chocolate covered almonds, but he was so gracious about forgiving my
transgression of lateness that I couldn't bear to give it to him.</p>

<p>And, mmmmmmmm, chocolate.</p>
