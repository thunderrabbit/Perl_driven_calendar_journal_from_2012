<p>Shweet.</p>

<p>It feels like it took a week since I started the process, but now I
have officially moved my domain from webquarry.com to dreamhost.com,
plus have gotten thunderrabbit.com again.</p>

<p>I have some sub-domains used: resume.robnugen.com,
password.robnugen.com, and one other that's a secret for now (it has
to do with spam).</p>

<p>Also on the new server we have a much better mySQL interface, and
I've created several databases, used mysqldump to move my dbs from old
rn.com to new rn.com and... tightened up the code used to draw the
navigation at the top of the screen, and changed all cgi-locals to be
cgi-bin (the way I prefer, but didn't know how to do it on webquarry),
and now have a much cooler way to install modules locally, using "perl
-MCPAN -e shell"</p>

<p><em>And</em> I have 10 (ten) times more storage on this new
server!  Went from 2 to 20 gigs.</p>

<p>And just before I wrote this entry, I got imagesadmin to the point
where I had it when I got mad at webquarry cause I couldn't see the
error.log file.</p>

<p>bang.</p>
