<p>Hard drive recovery did not work.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p class=date>1:05am</p>

<p>I'm not sure what else to try; Jesse is trying gentle taps and
shakes of the drive while it's on.  Not working.</p>

<p>He says "that's really weird," which I guess means he thinks it
should be working.</p>

<p class=date>2:35am</p>

<p>nothing</p>
