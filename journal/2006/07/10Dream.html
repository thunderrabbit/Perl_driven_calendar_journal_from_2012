<p class="dream">Playing aminiature game of golf, as in the entire
game was contained in a box 3 by 4 feet.  More like a board game.
One element of the game was to hit other players' balls off the
course with one's oown ball.  My ball was actually a little figure
with a vase, which had gotten stuck under a piece of paper, so when I
tried to hit it, the paper held it in place.  I was given permission
to place it on top of the paper before hitting it, and I used my
miniature cue stick to hit t and it plowed through two other players'
pieces, and off the game grid itself.</p>

<p class="dream">Kelly was there, and said she was pregnant again,
and let me feel the kicking.  It was like Looney Toons Tasmanian
Devil with such frequent and dramatic kicks.  yeouch!</p>
