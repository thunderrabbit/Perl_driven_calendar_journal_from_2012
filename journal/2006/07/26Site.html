<p>I officially love my website.  I just got an email from Jimmy da Magnet, who said he is in SF,
and I was able to pretty quickly find
my <a href="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=skate&date=2002/12/20">San Francisco Wild
Skating Adventure</a>, a story I recently relayed to someone.  Probably Hitomi or one of the
Mikis.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was like &quot;bang!&quot; there it is - a journal entry I took time to write a long
time ago, still there, just ready to be read.</p>

<p>Still working on my image indexer, but here are the pages for which I just whipped together
static indices.</p>
