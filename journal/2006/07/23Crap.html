<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Trying to connect with the Information Superhighway, this new fangled highway to the future, but

a space station on the moon.</p>

<p>I just want to get online.</p>

<p>Our bad.  It helps to scratch off all of the scratch-off part to reveal the entire
instructions.  But why would they put scratch-off on parts that are the same for everyone??</p>
