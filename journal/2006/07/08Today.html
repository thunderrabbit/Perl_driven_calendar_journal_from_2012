<p>Worked on my website basically all day today.  Got 3 databases
created to hold three db's worth of tables: Rob Updates, Gaba Tracker,
and Wordpress.  Still need to move the images database over.</p>

<p>I retooled the admin login on rob_updates.pl.  Now the mySQL login
info is stored in a non-web accessible location, and as a result of
better coding, I don't have to "login twice" to login.  (previously I
was storing cookies in an apparently dumb way which had to be done
once to save the cookie, then try to login again to read the cookie)</p>

<p>Also looked up DJ Marvin Dangerfield, who works at InterFM to see at
which radio station he DJs so I can go visit him because he's a DJ
and has told me I can come visit anytime while he's on the air.
Hopefully tomorrow.</p>
