<p>Now in Shibuya to meet Sayuri for our first official lesson.</p>

<p class="date">9:43pm JST Monday 31 July 2006</p>

<p>Lesson was great; basically 2 hours, so we've decided to meet for 2 hours each week.  Sayuri is a
really good student; she brought material to study (about Mel G getting arrested for drunk driving)
and did homework.</p>
