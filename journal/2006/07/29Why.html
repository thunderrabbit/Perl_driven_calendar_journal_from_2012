<p>Fuck.  Why did she have to see that?  She who never logs in, who never responds to my
emails.... but who I'm just silly over.  Read my stupid entry and was not impressed.</p>

<p>I just want to give up on Japan and go home.</p>

<pre>
I don't know if you care, but I realized I should not write about
her online, and I took it down... before I saw your email.

You are right; I shouldn't write about her like that.

I am embarassed that you saw more of the worst of me, but there
is nothing I can do about that now.

I will just keep the memories of our fun days in my heart.
</pre>

<p>between the words of that last line: I had been hopeful, but now I doubt I will ever see her
again.</p>

<p>I think I'll just cry myself to sleep.</p>
