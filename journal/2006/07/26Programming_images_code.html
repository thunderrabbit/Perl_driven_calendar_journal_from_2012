<p>After a break of sorts, I have begun to make forward progress on my images code again.  I was
stuck behind trying to make it all optimal and shit instead of just knocking it out.  It now can
create most of the tables needed and detect when tables need to have data before it can be used.</p>

<p>I still need to write out table definitions for image_tags, image_events, image_people, and
image_locations, but these should be supa-easy; they are just links to say which images have which
tags, etc.</p>

<p>After that will be figuring out how to populate the tables..  more user interface design should
be done first.</p>
