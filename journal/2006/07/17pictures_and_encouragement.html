<pre>Hello global citizens!

I have just sent an email to the President and Vice President of the United States,
asking them to stop the Israeli aggression in the middle east.  I will write a post
card after sending this email to you.  Please feel encouraged to do the same.

Just a brief few notes and pictures from the latest adventures.

I have fully paid the hospital for my shoulder related medical bills.  Super thank
you to everyone who supported me.

I recently had to leave Japan to reset my 90 day tourist visa.  Hitomi offered to
loan me money for a trip to Bali, and I quickly agreed!  Photo albums are here:

I especially enjoyed the zoo and Tirtagangga.  But the Elephant Safari topped the
list.

I'm still jobless, though I have tried a few different places to get work.  Haven't
tried really really hard (yet?) though.

Instead, with Sundays free from responsibility, I decided to go see the strange
fashion in Harajuku, a neighborhood about 30 minutes from where I live.  Every
Sunday, crowds of tourists come to see the show.

Photos are here:

I hope everyone is okay, with special prayers for all my friends in the middle east
war zone.

Now go write some emails to your leaders.  Better yet, post cards!


    Peace and Blessings
