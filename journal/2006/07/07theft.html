<p>I have been needing a calendar, but there seem to be none left in
any of the stores; the annual cycle starts in May, so I should have
been in the market while TJ Bike and I were galavanting around
Japan.</p>

<p>I looked at some little notepads that I could use to make a DIM (Do
It Myself) calendar, and selected one for 95 yen including tax.  I
like that it's all paper (save for spring binding) and looks like it
may even be recycled paper.</p>

<p>I selected the pad, picked up some chocolate and ice cream and
headed to the counter.  I suddenly wondered if I could left hand the
notepad in plain sight (also holding Hitomi's computer) while my right
hand paid for the ice cream and chocolate.</p>

<p>Answer: yes.</p>

<p>Except for my troubled conscious, that was easier than easy.</p>

<p>On the way back, I thought about the US Government and lots of big
business practices, plus the cultural norm of lifting things from the
workplace.  Decided this was small peanuts.</p>
