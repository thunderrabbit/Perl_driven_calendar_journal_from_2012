<p>Been chillin' on my computer all day, a lot of that time spent scanning through the listings of
four CDs of archives from my machine 3 years ago.  Sent them to Fred for safe keeping, and (via
gmail) noted that my old Marble Blast levels were on those CDs.  Fred still has them, and will
restore the data for me shortly.   While he's at it, I figured, it would be pretty smart to just
get everything I want from those CDs instead of me asking him again later.  AND, I was super happy
to fid my old old old The Master Genealogist data on the fourth CD.  Awesome!!</p>

<p>I put that at a higher priority than the Marble Blast levels; it would be really phat to have
that data available.</p>

<p>((Wow.  A bunch of non-Japanese speaking girls just got on this train.))</p>

<p>Via some Japanese study .torrent I downloaded, I found a really
awesome <a href="http://coscom.co.jp/">Japanese study
resource</a>, <a href="http://coscom.co.jp/">http://coscom.co.jp/</a>, which I scoped for a while
and perhaps learned a new word or two.  I hope I make a practice of visiting that site regularly.</p>
