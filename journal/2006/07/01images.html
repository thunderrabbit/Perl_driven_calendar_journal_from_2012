<p>I figured out the problem with images: Firefox couldn't handle the
javascript code being produced by CGI::Ajax.  I switched to Flock and
was able to resume coding.</p>

<p>But even so, progress is slow; I'd like to design a nice interface
to import all the images that will work for initial load and
incremental loads.</p>
