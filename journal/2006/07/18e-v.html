<p>Lessons start at 6:20, 7pm, 8pm, 8:40, 9:20</p>

<p class=date>6:20pm</p>

<p>Tomoko was pretty genki; we talked about Texas and US geography,
then "Japanese trains are fantastic" and "reliable" then used
"should" when she wanted to ask what English she should study, though
she didn't know the word "should."  I encouraged her to use flash
cards and that she should not write Japanese on them.</p>

<p class=date>7pm</p>

<p>Ryu is actually Korean, and asked what kind of visa I have, and if
I had ever been to the US Embassy.  He asked several questions about
PB adventure and said he hoped he could have my lesson again.</p>

<p>"Please tell my boss!"</p>

<p class=date>8pm</p>

<p>Noriko's sheet says she is super genki and has travelled a lot.
Most of the conversations have been about travel.</p>

<p>My lesson with her starts in 6 minutes.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We did talk a lot about travel, and politics.  A tiny bit about computers.</p>

<p class=date>8:40pm</p>

<p>Nao was super genki and funny and fun.  We talked about weather
and travel and comparisons between various areas.</p>

<p class=date>9:20pm</p>

<p>Yuuta is 20 and will go to Hakone with his mates to play golf
soon.  Quite talkative and I was hard pressed to interrupt him in
time to make corrections.</p>
