<p class=dream>Carefully watching a home video taken back in WaraWara
at the last Nova teacher/student party, hoping to find hints as to
where I can get contact information for Akina.  She had given me her
number at that time, before PB 52, and said "call me after you get
back."</p>

<p>Woke up suddenly, thinking I had been sleeping too late, and found
that it's only 4am!!  I feel totally awake.</p>
