<p class="dream">Helping Jesse move, I got mad and threw a pen after he asked me to &quot;move it
farther over there&quot; I felt bad, and ended up telling the story to Father Paul from UH.  Michael
walked up to Father Paul at the same time, also to confess something, but he let me go first.</p>

<p class="dream">Paul and I walked to his favorite mostly private area, where we could look outside
through a set of huge windows.  The reflection blocked our view at first, but then by closing the
curtains behind us (stepping in front of the curtains), they blocked out the light behind us, so we
could see the incredible sunrise over the lake.  Paul had some superballs that he bounced playfully
while I was talking.  They were marble size in (dream) reality, but billiard ball size in the
reflection in the window.</p>

<p class="dream">Called my new student to see if we could meet at 3pm, with my undertsanding we
would also meet up at 7pm for our actual lesson.  But the 3 pm was a freebie during which time I was
like, &quot;do you want me to make you a website??&quot; and she was like Yes, and then she was
like, &quot;no&quot; and changed her mind, and she was like, &quot;I won't be able to meet you at
7pm&quot; and I was shocked that she didn't tell me until the end of our 3pm meeting, and I realized
I was shocked only because I had assumed we would meet, and assumed I'd be essentially getting paid
for it (at 7) although less money.  But now suddenly no money and I realized it wasn't really fair
of me to say it was free, and then be upet when she cancelled on something else, making the first
part truly free.</p>

<p class="dream">She said something about how she thought it would take really long to do the site,
but I assured her I could put them together quite quickly; I just needed to confirm what domain she
wanted.  She said, &quot;I want to combine all my friends' domains&quot;
www.rabbit.alt.miyuki.power.c.z.net and I was like, &quot;no way we can get z.net but she didn't
undertsand it's just the top two that count, but finally I was like, &quot;let me try it&quot; and
we hapened to see a guy who said he had internet access in his office, which turned out to be a
little tiny closet next to a womens' clothing shop.  I went in first, and Hitomi came a bit later;
she had had to go P.  And then when she came in, she started typing on my keyboard as I was trying
to get set up, and I told her to stop, but she kept typing as if she hadn't heard me, or was just
focused on typing one specific password, though she was unable to read the screen to see what she
was typing, or even in what window she was typing.  I kept telling her to stop, and it got
progressivlely more ridiculous that she wouldn't so I grabbed her arm and gouged my fingernail into
the inner writst, which she withstood stoicly.  Then she whipped out a water balloon and threatened
my computer with it.  That's why she had gone into the bathroom!</p>

<p class="dream">She faked at first, but then I was able to catch it, and I chose not to burst it in
the store, so I swallowed it, and then as I choked on it, and she freaked out that I would do such a
thing, I spited her and pinched my neck until it popped the balloon and saved myself from choking
and dying.</p>
