<p class="dream">With a girl for whom I had the hots; we were in some
type of X-ray laboratory, and the subjects of an experiment where we
were supposed to actually become more intelligent by getting a good
dose of x-rays in our brains.  We both got under one lead apron and
got zapped for an instant by the machine, then went to sit down with
some papers that had impressions of words on them as the words were
written on papers above those.</p>

<p class="dream">I was unable to find the word in the text book we
were given.  I tilted my head onto her shoulder with "I love you" and
she was like "really?" in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p class="dream">"yeah, my definition of love is different than
most.  I mean I support your spiritual gro.."</p>

<p class="dream">I couldn't even finish the word "growth" before she
interrupted me "really?" in a tone of recognition, knowing exactly
what I planned to say.</p>

<p class="dream">Wow.  Not many others use that definition.</p>
