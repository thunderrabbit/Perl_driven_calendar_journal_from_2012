<p class="dream">Wende and her friend Cameron (as in Diaz) had had a falling out and were trying to
get reconnected via cell phone, but Wende was sure Cameron should be inside, but Cameron was
outside on a dock near a university.  She was wearing a black and white petticoat thing and I went
down to help Wende locate her friend.  Wende was quite upset and couldn't understand where Cameron
was, but I could hear her voice through the air instead of the cellphone and was like, "Wende,
she's right over there," and Cameron saw me point, then smiled her dazzling smile and jumped off
the dock to come wade over to Wende's side of the water.  I went down to help her climb up the
ladder.</p>

<p class="dream">On a train, watching it plow over people who were chillin' on the tracks; we
couldn't even feel us hitting them, and definitely didn't stop.</p>
