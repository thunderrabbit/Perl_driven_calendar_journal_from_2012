<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>Got a call from E-V; they would like me to work again tonight, starting at 7, and probably till 10.</p>

<p>Snap.  Got here a bit later than expected, but still on time.</p>

<p>Yuko is funny; she's staffing the desk; offered me a cookie and then gave me the desiccant,
saying "this one is best."</p>

<p>Hahahahahaa! I'm doing a level check today!</p>

<p>Rinako was pretty darn high level, though she missed S on plurals and he/she verbs.  I could
easily chat with her for a while.</p>

<p class="date">7:20</p>

<p>Teruo asked about my political affiliation and when/why I came to Japan.</p>

<p class="date">8:00</p>

<p>Masayuki... I don't really remember.</p>

<p class="date">8:40</p>

<p>Nobuhiro... I don't really remember.</p>

<p class="date">9:20</p>

<p>Shuuji is a percussionist; he asked some detailed questions about how to use "by" and "until"</p>

<p>More funniness from Yuka as we talked about her having come to meet me at the station; I was
like, "next time, I will remember how to get here."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's actually good; it gives me a chance to get out of this prison."</p>

<p>"Alright, then I'll call you from the station."</p>

<p>"And I'll say; 'it's your second time; can't you get here???'"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Sarcasm is rare in Japanese; I wonder where she learned it.</p>
