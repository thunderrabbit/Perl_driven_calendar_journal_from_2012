<p class="dream">Three little girls lived near a guard rail.  They
lived on the cliff side, and traveled along the other side on some
stairs.  I was watching them play, and noted with curiosity they
didn't go under the guard rail to get to the other side, even though
they could obviously fit.  Even I could fit, but I didn't try so I
wouldn't give them the idea.  Apparently their parents didn't want
them going under, or they hadn't thought of it yet.</p>

<p class="dream">One of the girls was the leader, the second was
nearly as strong, but the third was a bit slower / younger.</p>

<p class="dream">I was just observing as they we ascending the stairs,
with the the youngest one jumping as high as she could like a little
frog from step to step. She became a little frog jumping from step to
step, and occassionally falling down one step if she caught the
underside of the step and couldn't quite make it up.</p>

<p class="dream">I saw a cat stalking the frog and and wondered about the balance
between flat out stopping the cat, vs letting the frog fend for
itself, and before I knew it the cat had caught the frog in its
mouth.  I grabbed the cat by its jaws to force them open and make it
hack out the frog, but it wouldn't open its mouth and in fact I had
missed and the cat swallowed the frog.</p>

<p class="dream">I woke up from the shock of recognizing what a bad
froggy body guard I had been.</p>
