<p>Heading out to Kanda for my first demo lesson at English Village,
probably hereinafter to be referred to as EV.</p>

<p class=date>5:31pm</p>

<p>Interesting....  I changed this title from lesson to lessons.  And
they are not demo lessons, like new students learning about EV, but
just first lessons for <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>I will be teaching 4 different lessons - three 1-on-1 and one
couple.  First lesson starts at 6:20pm: 40 minutes with Rie, next is
60 minutes with Masayo, then 40 minutes with Nobuhiro, then 20 minute
break and then last lesson is 40 minutes with Yuko and Akira.</p>

<p>There are no breaks between the first three lessons!  Just like
zoom zoom work and be done.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I like this better - the scheduling is more
dynamic than Gaba, and the writeups (at least for these students, who
are all pretty high level according to the notes) are all like FC
Globalization; FC translation stuff; FC Life, English Language; FC
North Korea.</p>

<p>Like each of those is the entire writeup for one lesson; there's
only one line!  No time wasted blabbering some BS on the computers.
Bang.</p>

<p>Damn.. now that I think about it, I definitely like it more than
Gaba.  Unless something really wack and surprising crops up...  this
is rad.</p>

<p>Rie is a part time translator; she asked me about some language
in a movie script she is translating.</p>

<p>Masayo and I talked about travel and stuff.</p>

<p>Nobuhiro and I talked about travel and semi-conductors.</p>

<p>The last couple were actually siblings, with Yuko more talkative
than Akira, and I really enjoyed chatting (more like me 100%
blabbering) about PB (after giving some vocabulary about nuclear
families featuring divorces: half-sister, step-brother, in-laws,
brother/sister-in-law, mother/father-in-law)</p>

<p>I realllly enjoyed the lesson, and am thankful they did too.</p>

<p>Yuko said she had never spoken with someone who's been on PB.
Hmmm.. Me? unique?  something different?  world traveling?
Hmmmmm.</p>

<p class=date>9:55pm</p>

<p>Hahahaha...  I am half-amused, half-unimpressed with this: my boss
just reported that "they all said 'not bad'," referring to how the
students enjoyed my lessons.  This booth is right next to the exit (and
his desk); I heard what he said to each student as they were leaving.
In three cases he was distracted and didn't talk to them, and in one
case the woman (Masayo) said Âç¾æÉ×, which means fine or good.</p>

<p>Besides <em>that</em>, I have enjoyed this day quite thoroughly.  I
assume he was just covering his own ass in case the other four
students hated me (which he doesn't know cause he didn't talk to
them).</p>
