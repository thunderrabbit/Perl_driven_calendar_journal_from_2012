<p>I just burned a bootable CD of <a
href="http://ubuntu.com/">ubuntu</a>, after reading an article that a
couple of high profile Mac OS X cats switched over, and the ubuntu
site says I don't have to change my computer to check it out.</p>

<p>Not sure how to tell my Mac to boot from CD, though.  Ah.  C or
Option</p>

<p>That was fun.  I wasn't able to effortlessly get it to do more than
what OS X can do already, so I likely won't switch.  But I'll keep the
CD slash idea.</p>

<p>However, I <em>will</em> grant that it reconfigured the keyboard
settings to the way I want!  Except I couldn't find the ~ character.
Pretty important in linux.  Perhaps I will try again when I get my own
computer again.</p>
