<p class="dream">Maggie telling me about her son, whom I've never met though he is old enough to be
seeing ghosts in his room at night.   I encouraged her to not simply discount the ghosts as
invented apparations, but possibly real.</p>

<p class="dream">She said she could hear most of them being invented in the bathroom, with various
knockings happening all the way to her son's room.  She was sure it wasn't real.</p>
