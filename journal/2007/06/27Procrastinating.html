<p>What I &quot;need&quot; to be doing is working on chatforest.com for our super amazing website.
But fuckin' hell I've got no idea where to start.</p>

<p>And I need to get some crocs (before tomorrow (???)) cause I told Kim I would get some; I've
been wanting to have these cool-ass sandals since I saw Jason wearing some at ultimate.  They're
all rubber so &quot;you can piss on them and they won't stink.&quot;  I know that's what I always
look for in footwear.</p>

<p>And I'm supposed to have gotten a copy of _Gods of Eden_.  I went to a bookstore and requested
that they order it, but they never called me.  I went back to look for it, but they didn't have it.
Boo hoo.</p>
