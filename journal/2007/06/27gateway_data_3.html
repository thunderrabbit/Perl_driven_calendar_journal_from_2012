<p class="date">1:35am JST Thursday 28 June 2007 (day 13609)</p>

<p>Mostly cold dope snoozin' which is basically what I expected, starting so late at night.</p>

<p>Awoken for some of his speaking, but not much.  One part I didn't recognize, and I thought I had
slept into the second track on the CD.</p>

<p>It sure seemed to take a lot longer than how long it took.</p>
