<p>Missed the train that I normally take at Sakurashinmachi, so I missed the express train I
normally take from Shibuya.  Got the local train that leaves 2 minutes later, and best I can tell
from the marquee, it will not be passed by an express (this is the first of at least 3 consecutive
local trains), but I still don't know if I will make it to work on time.  I think I will.  Still got
30 minutes to get there, and only 14 stations to go.  Hmmm.  Nevamind; that's cutting it close.</p>

<p>Today I have most of my favorite students from Kichijoji.  Satoko, Mari and Chika, Yuria,
Naori.  No Kumiko, but 5 of 6 (counting M &amp; C as two) is pretty great.</p>

<p>Of course no Tomoko, but she only takes Jamie's lessons.</p>

<p>I brought the marbles for Mari and Chika to work on THE vs A.</p>

<p>Made it.  With enough time to buy a tasty beverage.</p>
