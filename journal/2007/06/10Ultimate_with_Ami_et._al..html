<p>Fun day tossing discs yesterday.  Just as we were going into the park, Geoff was coming out; he
had been there for an hour and no one showed up for practice.  He surmised they were not coming.
Ami and I continued to the field and I called Little J and then Peta to try and see who may be
coming.  Before we made it to the field, Ami's friend Naoko called from the station.  It was her
first time out, so we headed back to get her.  Peta was actually already at the station and was
lovely enough to loan us her disc (though I will likely never see her again), as she headed out to
where the core group of people were playing.  I never heard a specific reason they were playing at a
different location except Peta said, &quot;they're too lazy to come down here.&quot; Though the
field was wet after the rain, the weather was beautiful for ultimate.</p>

<p>I played catch with Ami and Naoko a bit, teaching them how to throw.  Ami had the basics down and
was doing pretty well.</p>

<p>In all, we had a total of 6 players. Shaggy was the first one out.  He and I played catch with a
baseball and a disc, throwing each to each other at the same time.  I'm not sure if the skill is
really useful, but I think it helps with coordination because each one is so different for catching
and throwing.  Shag(gy), Sean, Yuka and I are solid players; we played a game I had played one time
at UH: call the name of the player to whom you will throw the disc before you catch the disc being
thrown to you.  We were using 2 discs, and were spaced pretty far apart so a lot of the throws were
off their intended targets.  I liked how Yuka said, ¤Ï¤¤ each time one of us called her name.</p>

<p>During this game, Ami and Naoko were off on a semi-spooky adventure.  A woman had been found near
the river.  She was moaning like in pain.  Ambulance was called.  Fire engine, ambulance, police (in
that order (though the fire engine was *just* in front of the ambulance, and actually let it go
ahead)) arrived.  The officer on bicycle.  (I didn't have any memory available on my camera after
having taken the video of Francois and the birds in Futakotamagawa station.  But I don't really know
how interesting it would be to see emergency vehicles from afar.  Ah, except to other Iku players to
show them what they missed!  Short version of the story: the woman said she was fine, but her
husband had died.  Ami thought the woman had a few screws loose.  After the emergency vehicles left,
the woman walked out of the field on her own.  What I can't understand is why the guy who had
originally found her didn't go ask her, &quot;hey man; are you okay?&quot; Why go track someone else
down and call emergency services?</p>

<p>Anyway, Naoko and Ami came back and we had three games of catch going on.  Ami and I; Yuko and
Naoko; Sean and Shaggy.  Naoko did get noticably better during her practice.  Ami says she did as
well.</p>
