<p>One of my students told me she has her groceries delivered each week, so I had her refer me to
the service.  The guy came over today and &quot;told me&quot; about it.  Mostly he told Michael who
translated the good bits for me.</p>

<p>I can order for the first time on 21 June (a nice day for several reasons), and will get my first
order on 28 June.</p>
