Hey Molly

Can you keep a secret from Will?  Not like, an uh-oh-secret, but a hooray-secret.
</pre>

No prob.

Is is about Ultimate?

Yes.  But, if by "about Ultimate" you mean about flying plastic discs,
then no, it's not about ultimate.

And, if by "Will" you thought I meant your husband, then no, not about Will.

But if by "Ultimate" you mean my marble track, and by Will, I secretly
meant Maggie, then yes, that is the secret topic of this email.

However, if by "marble track," you think the marble track I loaned to
Maggie already, then no, not my marble track.

But if by "marble track," you mean the one I've nearly finished in
Japan, then yes, my marble track.

Specifically, I want to give it to her as thanks for watching my stuff
for 4+ years.

And by give, I mean "hand deliver," with my hands, on July 19th, 2007.

Will you be available to pick me up from my dad's house that day?

----

Summary: I'm coming to the US for a month, and it's an Ultimate top
secret.  I Will surprise my brother because he did the same for me in
Japan a few years ago.

Plan:  Suzanne will get me from the airport to my dad's house on 18
July.  You get me to you-n-Maggie's area for dinner on 19 July.  Then
Maggie drives me to Suzanne's on the morning of 20 July.  Suzanne
drives me to Austin to see Fred.  From that point on, many cats will
be out of many bags, but until then, please keep it under your hat.
(of our core college group, including ultimate, you are the only one
who knows.)

  Love Love
   - Rob!
