Hey Marvin

Michael said he saw you and you said HI to me, so I'm sayin' HI back to you!
How's stuff with the radio station?  I had big fun that morning; I hope an
unexpected guest wasn't too much trouble!

For me, now is a good time to connect with you because I'm in a job search
mode.  I'd like to have a few different part time jobs; is there any intern
work for a white boy at the station?

I'm actually taking a month vacation from mid July to mid August, but I plan
to be back in Tokyo for at least a year or 2 past that.  Just want to widen
my experience in Tokyo and hopefully do some good along the way.

    Peace!
    - Rob

Hey Rob-

Thanks for the message and I am happy to hear that you stilling hanging
tough. Hey, man send me your resume, or a corver letter on what you
interested in doing at the station. Since, the time that you were there we
have moved location and have changed management.

I believe they are looking for fresh blood with new ideas, so now may be a
good chance for you to see what they have to offer. I can pass your
information over to some of the management guys and see what they think.

What other kind of work are you thinking about? I can't promise anything,
but if I can help in anyway, it would be my pleasure to do so.

Take care and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Tell Mike thanks for
passing on the message to you.

Opportunity at InterFM

With my extensive web design experience and English fluency, I can work on any aspect of the InterFM
page from layout to English accuracy.

I DJed for 2 years at KTRU 91.7 FM, Rice University's student run station in Houston, Texas.  We put
on live shows, did interviews, monitored live sports coverage feeds, and kept handwritten logs of all
the music we played.  The mission of the station was to promote artists and music from all regions
on the world; we played the music other stations ignored.

I'm looking to expand my artistic outlets.  I paint on canvas, I create 3D art, I tell stories, I
travel and take pictures for my website.

I look forward to meeting and working with the new team at InterFM!  Right now my schedule is open
most mornings of the week, so we can begin planning cool shows on air and events around Tokyo!

    Genkily Yours
    Rob!

<p>Welp, I'm glad to say Hitomi has stopped paying for me to have internet access at McDonald's. ((
Dang how nice that would have been to have during my TJ Bike trip.  If I do BEE next year, I will
likely hook that shizzle up, (though we won't be stopping at any McDonald's..)))  I'm glad/sad that
she has done that final bit to take care of herself.  Nice.</p>

<p>Nice.  I was able to send the message by going to the top of the building and finding a wireless
signal floating around.</p>
