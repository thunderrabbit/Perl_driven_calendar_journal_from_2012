<p>Woke up twice this morning, and then went to Sizzler with Ami, where we had an entertaining meal
and salad bar with Francois sitting on the table to keep us company.  The funniest thing has fled
from my tired brain, but, trust me; it was funny.</p>

<p>Dropped my breakfast for tomorrow off at home and then headed out to ultimate, arriving at the
station around 2:20pm, with me wondering if anyone had been planning to meet me.  No, I hadn't
gotten any emails (*) so no problem.</p>

<p>(*) Except from Naoko at 11:30am on Saturday... I had told her to email me by Friday so I'd be sure
to see it, but I actually don't know if I would have seen it, given that Ami and I met right after
my work at watched Pirates 3 and we generally stayed offline until Sunday night.</p>

<p>About 20+ people were out to play.  Notably missing without due cause were Tall Rob, Yoshio and
Kerry, Tamau, and Bruno.</p>

<p>There's one new kid named Niji (Æú), who's damn fast (I could have kept up with him more except
my feet recently developed huge blisters on my heels) and an all around good player.  He started in
September when he started college up in Virginia.  It appears his English is better than his
Japanese (in some ways); I'm curious about his history.</p>

last time there before they tear it down.  I was glad to share the fun with friends.</p>

<p>Foolishly, I hadn't removed the video of the sushi restaurant from my camera, so I couldn't take
(m)any pictures, but I deleted one pic so I could take one pic of T-dot Rob on his last day to play
with us before heading back to Canadia.  He smuggled in some wine to celebrate the occassion.</p>

<p>Also for celebration, it was Maki's birthday the next day, so I hope Rob will trade the pics he
took of everyone else for the pic I took including him.  I bought a cake donut for Maki and one for
British Mike (who had asked for a cake when I asked if anyone wanted anything from the Chinese
restaurant where I went to get some aniin dofu (delicious Chinese pudding)).  Everyone was full, so
the donuts were chopped up and distributed to willing eaters.</p>

<p>Great time.  Really glad to go, and really glad Ami was there, too.</p>
