<p>Ami asked about the content of the 40 minute conversation I had had last night with she who
continues to go unnamed.  I told her everything, not much of which came as a surprise; just the bit
about claims regarding Ami's personality: &quot;I don't know Ami very well, but she is a Roppongi
girl, always dancing with different boys...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She said that?&quot;</p>

<p>Haha.  Yeah.</p>
