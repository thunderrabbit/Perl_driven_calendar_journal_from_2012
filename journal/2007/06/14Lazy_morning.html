<p>Nice lazy morning this AM; I got a message from Tariq like, &quot;no word from Hitoshi yet.
I'll call you&quot; which I took to mean the meeting was cancelled unless he called.</p>

<p>Tariq took it to mean the opposite.  Shit.</p>

<p>After doing the Gateway exercise, I worked on my resume; I slept; I texted Ami; I slept; I
painted.</p>

<p>Before going in to work, I plan to go to the book store to get _Gods of Eden_ by William Bramley,
which I ordered some time ago and thought they said the would call me when it arrived.</p>
