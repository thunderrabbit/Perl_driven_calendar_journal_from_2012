<p>Today was awesome.  Video is in progress.</p>

<p class="note">11:29am JST Monday  4 June 2007 (day 13585)</p>

<p>So basically, we went to Ogawamachi to make traditional Japanese paper and ride a long
roller-slide of the type used for boxes in a warehouse.  Except this one was 200 meters long on the
top of a small mountain.</p>

<p>On the 70 minute train ride from Ikebukero (on the Yamanote Line) to Ogawamachi, we snoozed a
lot.  At one point I realized I had made a foolish mistake of *not* bringing the photos we had
taken recently at the プリクラ, basically a cutsey photo booth for girls, but a great way to
commemerate great days with friends in Japan.  I'm glad we were able to find one in Ogawamachi (I
guessed correctly, twice), so we used those photos in some of the post cards.</p>

<p>Super happy to Ami for having figured out the bus schedule and locations and prices and stuff for
the day.  I brought her the research material (from the day I was introduced to Ogawamachi on the PB
GET Challenge last month or so) and she did all the researchin'.</p>

<p>At this paper-makin' place, we were able to wander around and pick flowers and shizzle with
which to decorate the paper; we hadn't been able to do that at the other place, perhaps because
we were a group of about 30 and needed to save time: the flowers had been picked for us.  Nice to
wander around with Ami picking flowers in the lovely sunshine.</p>

<p>Actually, I was a little bit less inspired to make art this time, but I certainly enjoyed
hanging out with Ami.  I hope-plan to post the pics soon.</p>

<p>Bus back to Ogawamachi station, and then on foot to the roller slide place.  We got driving
directions, it seems; but we made it there in about an hour (as opposed to the advertised 40 minutes
on foot), including walking up a significant hill, though it was just a good start compared to
Hakone.</p>

<p>I'm putting together a video, which will relay tens of thousands of words worth of writing, but
still won't quite capture the humongous fun we had.  I would like to have been there with some of
my crazy friends (and no one else at the park)..  Jason Fricke and I could spend a day there no
problem.</p>

<p>There's basically a 200 meter long wire-frame tube with warehouse style rollers along the
bottom, so we can roll down on cardboard sleds.  There are four turns, which eat some of the speed,
but my god is that thing fun.  The latter 50+ meters has no outer wire tube, so we can stand up and
slide down on our feet.  ( Oh, wait, that sign means we should *not* stand up and ride...  Ooops!
)  The wire tube makes the whole remainder of the thing easily climbable; we could do daring mid air
tube transfers, or set up a pony-express style mail (Francois) pickup system, etc etc etc</p>

<p>Ami and I went down once, and I knew I'd be there for a while.  I asked if they could keep my bag
at the top, and they were like &quot;no way&quot; (and after a bit of discussion, I think they were
simply worried that I didn't understand I would have to come back to get it.  Wha??) but then they
were cool and I left my bag at the top of the slide the second time we went down.  Ami was ready for
a break after that, so I had her stay at the bottom which is when she got the footage of me sliding
down on my feet (though it was super closeup so my feet aren't visible the whole time).</p>

<p>Then I dropped her off at the break area and went about 3 more times using the ticket-pack I had
purchased.  1200 yen worth for 1000 yen.</p>

<p>It was during those slides that I got footage of Francois sliding between my feet and realized a
good way to get a vid of him rolling down &quot;by himself&quot;</p>

<p>Filled my camera to within three seconds of full, and then went down three more times trying to
get the dramatization of Francois falling over the edge of the slide.  It took three takes to take
it, but I was happy to support the stunt rabbit</p>
<p>(to be continued)</p>
