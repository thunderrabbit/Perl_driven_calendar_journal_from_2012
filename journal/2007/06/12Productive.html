<p>Last night I met Ami for a bit to tell her I can't meet her as often.. basically because I
wasn't getting any of my own shizzle done.  I wrote down a list of 13 things to do, which included
silly things like &quot;eat&quot; which I had just finished and &quot;sleep&quot; which I wasn't
likely to forget.</p>

<p>The list also included stuff like, &quot;meditate&quot; and &quot;send resume to Yoko&quot; and
&quot;google 'Tokyo jobs'&quot; and &quot;paint&quot; and &quot;TMI CD&quot; and &quot;work on
video&quot;, all of which I did.</p>

<p>Now I'm starting item 12: &quot;»Å»ö&quot; (work)</p>

<p>And then will be item 13: &quot;°¡Èþ&quot; (Ami)</p>
