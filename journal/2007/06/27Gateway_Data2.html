<p class="date">12:50pm JST Wednesday 27 June 2007 (day 13608)</p>

<p>This time I just told my body to sleep sleep sleep and see what would happen when I heard the
instructions.  This time, like all times, I feel a gentle shaking that I have always thought was
the building being shaken by truck traffic outside, but now I'm thinking maybe it's not that.</p>

<p>A way to test the theory is to rotate my physical bed 90 degrees; the shaking always happens
side to side.  If I feel head to foot shakes, that will tell me it's the building, or otherwise
associated with physical orientation.  If I feel side to side, then that will tell me it's me, or
that I'm not able to feel head to foot shaking.</p>

<p>Basically in and out of dreams this time.  At the end I dreamt I was watching water pour down
the sink drain in our bathroom.</p>
