HI!

Thank you for being a key agent in my super-secret plan to visit the US!

There are a few interesting news items:

1) My initial plan to surprise Fred has been confounded because he
will be out of town when I arrive in Austin.  D'oh!  But I can still
surprise my dad, Dude, and my mom.

2) During my trip, my girlfriend Ami will come for a week!  (2 - 7 August)

The above two items each give a good reason for another trip between
Austin and Houston (so I can see (surprise?) Fred, and so Ami can meet
Fred and my mom.)

I have written up the plans in a secret calendar on Google Calendars.

  Love Love Love
