<p>That was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I took copious notes in my book titled _ROB'S RUNES_ and subtitled today _and other spiritual
stuff_:</p>

<p class="date">29 JUNE 2007 (¶â)</p>

<h1>Psychopomp Training</h1>

<h2>with Kevin Turner</h2>

<p>This is not an official TMI course.</p>

<p>We all operate on all levels of reality, all of which are right here right now.</p>

<p>Kevin's first Lifeline course gave no confirmation; he thought he made it all up.  However, on
the second time, he got confirmation.</p>

<p>This imaginary monkey suit self disconnects from larger reality and just focuses on the 5 senses.
It's not *bad*, just happening.  Even though we know this monkey will be worm food, we pretend we
won't.  We deny death's imminence.  Actual experience of death will help us understand the reality
and not fear death.</p>

<p>All fear is ultimately fear of death.</p>

<p>(I'm not sure I agree.)</p>

<p>We are all connected.  &quot;Individual thought is all thought&quot;</p>

<p>Before helping people tomorrow and the next day, we need to empathize with them, so today we are
going to experience death.  We'll do shamanism and hemisync today.</p>

<p>Sharing our experiences with others is valuable; we are an exploration team (20 people in
workshop).  Kevin has experienced learning more from peers in workshops than from the teacher.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>First exercise: Shamanic Self Soul Essence Retrieval.</p>

<p>Normally a shaman would do this for a member of his/her tribe member (within three days) after a
sickness / trauma / shock.  It could be a subtle or a gross experience.  Anything that was more than
we could handle at the time causes a bit of our self to split away, or to concentrate on hiding
that experience from us, and is therefore unavailable to us.</p>

<p>We'll only be concerned with current lifetime soul retrieval today.</p>

<p>Connect with inner guidance at Focus 15 or say simply &quot;I am looking for lost parts of myself
that are willing to come back to help.&quot;</p>

<p>We'll be using Wave 5 Exploration of Focus 15.</p>

<p>These splintered parts of self can be in Focus 10, Focus 12, Focus 15 or elsewhere.  Success can
be in any variety of experiences, but don't have any expectations.</p>

<p class="dream">Experienced meeting Kevin at The Monroe Institute, and being told to turn off my
cellphone here in our current room.  Had a bit of a sleep during the process and some grrr at
having to listen to the Japanese translation, but then a note of sadness and &quot;I don't want to
leave the natural English,&quot; though I'm not sure that's a direct translation.  Maybe 'English'
was 'Japanese' or simply 'language.'</p>

<p class="dream">Thankful for the experience and the English direction given through the stereo
system during the exercise.</p>

<p>debriefing:</p>

<p>one guy felt pain in his shoulder and pain like his feet had been removed.</p>

<p>one girl got her self back from her friend Yoko.</p>

<p>one girl saw x-ray of her hip and went inside it.  has had hip issues in C1.  made friends with
her body.</p>

<p>one guy saw red cheerful dressed girl in tunnel, a lake by a mountain, something that spun and
fell</p>

<p>Kevin says: we are welcome to self guide: &quot;what does this mean?&quot; We are welcome to use
imagination to get started.  &quot;what would it be like to have a lost part of my self
returned?&quot;</p>

<p>I AM LEARNING TO USE IMAGINATION AS A MEANS OF PERCEPTION.</p>

<p>This is a new part of our affirmations.</p>

<p>If nothing seems to be happening, ask what it would be like if it did happen.</p>

<p>Dreams, intuition, and imagination all come through the same doorway.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class="date">noon JST</p>

<p>Sitting meditation: &quot;I release all parts of others' souls taken or given to me.&quot;</p>

<p>This meditation featured releasing parts of souls from ¿ÎÈþ¡¢Îè¡¢Îè»Ò, Kuni, Ka_trean, Wende,
Christine, Amanda.... about 500+ women.</p>

<p>All the sadness of all the C1 breakups: releasable.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>3rd exercise: Going Home CD3 &quot;Touring the Interstate&quot;</p>

<p>Now that we have dropped off some ballast, we are going to go to Focus 27, The Park.</p>

<p>If any fear, hold love in your heart.</p>

<p>- a - f - t - e - r -</p>

<p class="dream">no attraction nor fear at any points (specifically not 21 - 26).  In The Park
F-27, I chilled with peeps and very emotionally like desperate to know, &quot;I am ready to know
why I am here on earth this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Answer was to love people and share and listen and not hold back love from
others.  ¤¿¤È¤¨¤Ð, not from the woman next to me for whom I clammed up when she greeted me in
Japanese this morning.  A makeup can be to tell her I was feeling shy.  Just keep trying to
communicate with people and be happy and genki.</p>

<p>I didn't notice pain on the back of my head from the darkness goggles' strap until we exactly
came back and reached Focus 21, which is supposed to be the edge of physical reality.</p>

<p>Creating art from the heart is part of love.</p>

<p>From Dr Elizabeth Kubler Ross, doctor of death studies, from the C1 perspective, physical death
is to be avoided at any price.  Five stages of dealing with death:</p>

<p>Denial
<br />Anger (at what I didn't get to do)
<br />Bargaining
<br />Depression
<br />Acceptance</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Fourth exercise, 3rd CD</p>

<p>Notice changes as we go through Focus levels; we are calibrating our system, yet understand they
are just a system, as unreal as any other system.  We are always in all levels all the time.  Just
learning to be conscious of the different levels is the task.</p>

<p>C1 - normal waking reality</p>

<p>F10 - mind awake, body asleep</p>

<p>F12 - expanded awareness</p>

<p>F15 - no time</p>

<p>F21 - edge of life/death</p>

<p>F22 - coma</p>

<p>F23 - recently died, maybe unaware of death, some confusion as to where they are, what happened,
where to go.  These are where most ghosts reside, but we need not fear them; they are just
confused.  Most of them are in their own little world, but some are still attached through fear or
anger to C1.</p>

<p>F24 - F26 different religious belief system territories.  (I assume there are countless numbers
of these) mass hallucinations based on C1 conscious religious rites.  People's religions tell them
what will happen after death, and they believe / create this reality.  People gravitate to
like-minded hallucinators.</p>

<p>F27 - The Park, where we can just chill and relax and review what we experienced in life.  Kevin
also described this as a mass hallucination, so I'm not sure how it can be any &quot;better&quot;
than F24-F26.</p>

<p>In this course, we are just going to go to F27, but we are welcome to go further if desired.</p>

<p>- - - - after the park - - - -</p>

<p>I made it to The Park</p>

<p class="dream">Hey, Chez; I'm in the park!  Can you come visit me?</p>

<p class="dream">no response</p>

<p class="dream">Chez, Chez; I'm in the park!  Can you come visit me?</p>

<p class="dream">no response</p>

<p class="dream">Chez, where are you?</p>

<p class="dream">[I wish to go wherever Chez is now.   zooooom to Dallas.]</p>

<p class="dream">[Chez, sad:]  I think I made a mistake.  I did a bad thing.</p>

<p class="dream">Chez, baby, what happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I did something wrong.  It didn't work.</p>

<p class="dream">Chez, you're still here in Dallas?  at the building?  it's been 3 years, baby,
you're dead.  You did it.  You jumped.  Do you remember your funeral?  People were sad.  But they
are moving on.  here, baby, just give me a hug.  You're okay.  Let's go to a park I know where we
can talk.</p>

<p class="dream">No?  it's okay.  you don't have to stay here now.</p>

<p class="dream">[guides?  What do I do here?  What would I do if I knew what to do?]</p>

<p class="dream">Hey Chez, let's go see your body.  Your grave.  See?  you're dead.  You're free.
You don't have to stay here.</p>

<p class="dream">[I acknowledge this may be all my imagination, my grief.  I release you,
Chez.]</p>

<p class="dream">Okay, Chez, I have to go.  Here is a white feather.  With it I will contact you soon.</p>

<p>Kevin: Shamen were original travelers between death and life.  Often a teenager would fall very
ill or into a coma or delirium.  NDE and may meet ancestors or totem animals for journeys to other
realms.  Then, with this experience and practice (and recovery to C1), they could become
intermediaries.  With a 4 to 7 Hz drumbeat, they could induce consciousness to a border between
sleep and wake, and then will themselves to go one way or another, to either upper realms or lower
realms.  (( now when the Christians came and interacted with these natives, there was a lot of
confusion, given that the Christians often assumed any lower realms were associated with evil:
Satan and hell.  They weren't evil realms, just more focused on earth energy ))</p>

<p>In the next exercise, will only have drumbeats and our own willpower.  No hemisync, no verbal
suggestions, so set your intention now.</p>

<p>Some like this better than hemisync, and some aren't phased.</p>

<p>( I'm often not phased by hemisync, so no worries )</p>

<p>There exists an F-27 earth energy to which some people are encouraged to go.</p>

<p> A F T E R :</p>

<p class="dream">I experienced death (by drowning?) and tossed into a lake backwards, falling
sinking slowly.  not too fast, just slowly sinking to the bottom and resting on top of the muck,
then fish ate my body and mud covered my bones and they just stayed there and I lost interest and
went deeper, below the lake, following the sound of the drumming until I found a cave where the
drummers with stoney faces were huge, bare chested with huge drums, drumming for me.</p>

<p class="dream">I wanted to hit a drum and tried, but my hand went right through it.  So I walked
through the drum, and then I walked into and through one of the drummers who didn't flinch even if
he felt me.  I danced to the rhythm and eventually I went over and sat with some elders against the
wall and just listened.  Lost interest again and went up up up up and tried to go to the upper
F-27, but just stayed on earth's surface and semi listened to the drums and came to C1</p>

<p>My butt was sore, so I shifted my legs and sat in an upside down fetal-ish position to stretch
my legs and muscles in a new way than they had been resting for hours.</p>

<p class="date">4:23pm JST</p>

<p>I was about equally inspired by the drumming and my most complete hemisync experience, which
may be saying something considering it was my first drumming exercise.  About 1/2 and 1/2 the
participants said one or the other may or may not have been better.</p>

<p>Kevin described my experience as a classic shamanic journey.</p>

<p>one woman came across a row of her-selves in coffins and chose one to communicate and merged</p>

<p>The Greeks say we drink from the River of Forgetfulness.</p>

<p>At birth we are like, &quot;woah, what is all this?&quot;</p>

<p>At 2 years old, we begin to believe it must be real.</p>

<p>At 5 years old, we are like, &quot;I think there's something I'm forgetting; what was
that??&quot;</p>

<p>5 year old daydream a lot.</p>

<p><em>&lt;em&gt;I daydream a lot.  Am I five?&lt;/em&gt;</em></p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Number six exercise: building a signpost map.  After this we will make a ballad of our journey.
Private navigation song just for me to use later if I like.  Just another experience with which to
become familiar with this journey.</p>

<p>Going Home CD 4: Moment of Revelation</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>lost of sleeping for me.  I remember going all the way to F21, but only vaguely remember being
asked to grow larger and hold the earth / solar system in my arms.</p>

<p>My Ballad:</p>

<p>Mind awake body asleep
<br />this time shall I conscious keep?
<br />Focii, numbers, images
<br />food for worms and spin aches
<br />song is short but time ¤¬¤Ê¤¤
<br />now I reach and touch the sky</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Last exercise: shamanic death rehearsal.</p>

<p>&quot;To practice death is to practice freedom.  he who has learned how to die has unlearned how
to be a slave.&quot;</p>

<p>We will journey from the point of our death.  The moment will come for all of us, some sooner
than later; some of us are over halfway done.  We won't likely have CDs to help us reach The Park.
We will practice now our death, which may come as suddenly as a phone call.</p>

<p>while I shake this rattle, recite your ballad under your breath while standing at the edge of
your death bed.  When I strike the drum, you die.</p>

<p>But first, write a contract:</p>

<pre>
I, Rob Ï©Éð ROB! agree to come back 
to full C1 consciousness because I 
love lasagna, ice cream, and °¡Èþ¡£
</pre>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Well, that was less than hoped, but what I expected.  I 'died,' fell back onto my pillows,
called &quot;little help?  little help?&quot; but no one came.  &quot;what would happen if I
actually died?&quot;  nothing.  I tried to imagine floating up, but nothing.  Ah well.</p>
