<p>Nice to talk with Ami during lunch today.  Gave her a letter inspired by a desire to
acknowledge/correct my reaction to our しちゃった last night, and tell her that she is free to do
as she pleases, but I'd be delighted if she'd be delighted to be with me.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you gonna be my girl?&quot; has been overplayed on the radio at work, but it certainly applies.</p>

<p>Also downloaded the pictures from her camera, including the video of Francois sliding down the
roller slide thing..</p>
