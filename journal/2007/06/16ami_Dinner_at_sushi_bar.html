<p>We went to a sushi bar before the movie.  There was a large fish tank behind the sushi chefs in
which several fish were swimming.  One fish was sometimes swimming, sometimes upside down.  I
commented on that to Ami, and the chef noticed, so he was like, [ya want me to chop it up for
you?]</p>

<p>Only if I can get it on video.</p>
