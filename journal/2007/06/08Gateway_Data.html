<p>I can clearly feel a difference between Focus 10 and Focus 12.  That's quite interesting to
me.</p>

<p>Fell asleep durning some of the exercises; I am 100% certain significantly different periods of
time were spendt during visualizations of different words.   &quot;relax&quot; was given an
especially long time.</p>

<p>At the end I had a dream</p>

<p class="dream">a guy was asking about a mechanical pencil; he was offereng one to me, but I
wanted to repair mine instead of replace it.</p>
