<p>Coaching session with Kim was good; he went back through the history of his notes with me and
we compiled a list of action items that had fallen through the cracks in conversation.  Most
notable so far: how am I spiritual with money?  i.e. how do I let my higher spirit guide my
spending of money?</p>

<p>If we think of money as a necessary evil, then why should it come to us?  Who wants evil in their
lives?</p>

<p>Think of money in a postive light, so it may flow into your life.</p>
