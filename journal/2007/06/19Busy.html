<p>Last night I got 4 DVDs from <a href="http://ufohypotheses.com/">Rick and Maritza Keefe</a> all
about aliens and stuff.  One of the DVDs is the interview of Alex Collier, which has pretty much
affected my thinking since I saw it.</p>

<p>I'm exporting an old movie clip, the details of which I've forgotten.  It's some old ladies
playing instruments and singing in Meijijingu.</p>

<p>I'm about to check out Focus 15 on the TMI CDs.</p>

<p>And I've got to figure out how to register for SWUUSI, without letting anyone know I'm going to SWUUSI.</p>
