<p>21 June is my favorite day of the year.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>it features the most daylight hours of the year (*)</p></li>

<li><p>it's my brother's birthday</p></li>

<li><p>it's a day after our mom's birthday</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(* yes, yes, only in northern hemisphere, I know)</p>

<p>Also, Wende and I were going to get married on 21 June, so it reminds me well of her.</p>
