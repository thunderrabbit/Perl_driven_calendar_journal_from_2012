<p>Just finished lovely morning with Ami at our park near Hiroo (sounds like &quot;he row&quot;),
where a crow stole the bag of ume boshi (sour plums) I had bought for Ami.  She had eaten one, but
the rest are destined to be distributed by natural randomization.</p>

<p>Mostly just sat and watched the world around us, and played the seven game a few times in
English.</p>

<pre>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, clap!</pre>

<p>up to 49 and then 42.</p>

<p>Generally very happy with the situation at present, and no particular reason for that to change.</p>
