alt="Pekochan at Pink Cow" align="left" /></a>Met Ami in Shibuya last night, and we headed to The
Pink Cow, where we were greeted with a European cheek kiss by Traci.  Nice to be in that group now,
instead of being greeted as first timers multiple times.</p>

<p>We happened to arrive on a buffet night, so Michael helped us find a table, and I went to order.
But then he came back to the bar while I was ordering, and suggested we get the 1000 yen cheaper
option instead of what he had suggested before because Traci had just realized the buffet was about
to close in 20 minutes.  I was like, &quot;it's good customer service like this that keeps me coming
back!&quot;</p>

<p>The food was hugely plentiful, and we couldn't finish it all between us.</p>

<p>But *that*'s not why I'm writing.</p>

alt="Stacy's peace poster" align="left" /></a>I noticed a poster with a cool mosaic of pics on it,
with the bottom right corner saying, &quot;or maybe we should just buy more guns??&quot; so it was
obviously written by an English speaker promoting peace via sarcasm.  Nice; I hadn't seen that
before.</p>

<p>I was scoping each picture in between talking with Ami and eating, and I suddenly noticed a
familiar picture that I had never seen before.  It was of people jumping in the air next to a
banister...</p>

<p>&quot;That's (TSS The) Topaz!!&quot;</p>

<p>It was the ship used by PB.  &quot;How did that picture get on this poster?&quot;</p>

<p>I told Ami, and then I noticed a PB business card in the corner.  Ami scoped it: Stacy.</p>

<p>Nice.  Stacy takes thousands of pictures each voyage, and says that's why he comes up with a few
good ones when people say how fantastic the pictures are, &quot;well, when you take a lot of
pictures, a few of them are bound to turn out.&quot;  (Yeah, Tracy.  You're a photographic genius
and we all know it!)</p>

<p>I looked around the room and saw a huge 9 collage, and realized that must also be PB.  I thanked
Traci for supporting PB, and she was like, &quot;always!&quot; and, &quot;it's lucky you got here
in time to see it; it's going down after Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I wrote Stacy a note and hung it on the back of the poster hopefully for him to see when they
come get it.</p>
