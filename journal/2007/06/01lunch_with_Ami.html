<p>Chowed a variety of homemade and purchased items, then headed to ドンキ, where she wanted to buy
a はんこ.  They didn't have the exact kanji she wanted, but same pronunciation, so she went with
it.</p>

<p>Wandered around a bit; that is the biggest ドンキ I've seen!  It's like a condensed Wal*Mart of
everything one would want except groceries, though they do have candy type stuff.</p>

<p>Ami saw the latest and greatest Beyonce CD/DVD combo pack, and expressed interest.  I knew she
likes Beyonce, so I offered to split the price with her.  (Wow; what a great offer, yeah?)  She
accepted and we plan to scope it on Saturday.</p>

<p>Looked over at a different part of the DVD section and was a bit surprised to see some T-n-A,
and we commented a bit on who may or may not have seen what or whatnot.  &quot;I'll show you next
time, if you want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
