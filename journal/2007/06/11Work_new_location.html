<p>Our office has been moved to a new location.  On Friday Reiko asked if I could help move the copy
machine today.  Basically she said our boss was absent mindedly wondering if Victor and I could move
the copier today.  I called while on the way to the station to see what time she thought I should
get there.  1:30.  She called back, &quot;I just got into the office; everything is gone except the
refrigerator.&quot;</p>

<p>All of the above is written to say one thing:</p>

<p>I hope Maggie's marble track is okay.</p>

<p>And I got the first and best room.</p>
