guy hugging hachiko" align="left" /></a> A couple nights ago I saw a guy hugging Hachiko.  I didn't
get the picture of him *kissing* Hachiko, but he did that, too.</p>

<p>This is one reason I love Shibuya.  Some crazy shizzle goes on there every day and night, but
overall, everything is safe.  Anyone can walk anywhere anytime, no worries.</p>
