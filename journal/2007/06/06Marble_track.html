<p>Thinkin' about my marble track: yesterday Virgina brought up the very good point that our boss
might throw it away during the process of moving our school this weekend, so I need to devise a way
to get it safely home.</p>

<p>He might throw it away because he's a non-listening short-sighted bumbling old man.  I don't
trust him because he lied to me on the first day we met, and he never listens nor remembers
anything spoken to him.  At least not spoken by me.</p>

<p>Anyway, Virginia's thoughts are well-heard, so I'll probably bring the marble track home
tonight or so.</p>
