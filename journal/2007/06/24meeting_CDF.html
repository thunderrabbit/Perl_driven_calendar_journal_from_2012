<p>Shunji's pics from PB 55 were great; I'll host some of them on my website.</p>

<p>Good times at the Second Meeting of C(razy|heerful) Dancing Fellows.  Special thanks to Naho for
organizing this hotel and researching things we can do tomorrow.  Special blessings to Aki who
couldn't come because she is studying for a big test tomorrow, and to Kazue who couldn't come
because she hurt her leg and is expecting a grandchild soon.</p>

<p>We're way down in the tip of a peninsula that I've seen many times on the map, and have wondered
what it would be like.  Now I know.</p>

<p>Ami asked me to take a bunch of pictures, but there really wasn't all that much to see.  Perhaps
that's what I should have been photographing.  I got a pic of Francois overlooking the sea (actually
he was looking at the camera and the sea was looking at his side) and some of the group; tomorrow I
will take some of the other scenery in Nagoya.</p>

<p>Shunji asked if I have a girlfriend, and I told them about Ami.  He asked if I've kissed her,
and I said, &quot;only one time,&quot; and stuck with that story, including telling them I'll email
them if we have kiss number two tomorrow.</p>

<p>We nominated Aki to be the hostess of CDF's Third Meeting next summer in Hokkaido.  Naho will
call Aki to let her know.</p>
