<p>For some reason it took until today to get a braincell big enough to figure out I can import my
map data to google maps via a .kml file.  Wow; what a phenominal idea!  I'm a gENIUs.!</p>

<p>Anyway, I grabbed a sample file from google and tossed my 8600+ coordinates into it.  No
result.  Crap.  Cut them down to 2 coordinates and got a line 1/2 way around the earth on the
Pacific Ocean (perhaps.  I didn't look carefully.)</p>

<p>Hmm.  The trip was long, but I'm pretty sure not *that* long, nor that wet.  It appears the
coordinate system I used on google maps is different from that I'm trying to use on google
earth.</p>

<p>Didn't have enough time to research further; I had to bust out to meet Ami for lunch.</p>

<p>BUT, I'm pretty sure I can find a solution soon and put my TJ Bike trip onto google maps'
&quot;My Maps&quot; or whatever it's called.</p>
