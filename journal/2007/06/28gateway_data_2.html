<p>oops.</p>

<p class="date">5:46am JST Friday 29 June 2007 (day 13610)</p>

<p>(okay, I just hung my laundry)</p>

<p>Here's what I remember:</p>

<p>My left leg was feeling strange, like what I was told were &quot;growing pains&quot; when I was
little.  I normally had that experience after having played hard in a day.  Now when it happens,
it's usually with both legs (therefore strange to have it with just one), and I usually just get up
and walk around a bit or otherwise exercise my muscles to get rid of it.</p>

<p>I disallowed myself from getting up last night, but I did shift my leg around a couple of times,
and it felt better with a slightly different position (less outward rotation).</p>

<p>I still made it to Focus 10 by the time the guy mentioned Focus 10, and then I did Focus 12
pretty consciously, but began to lose consciousness by the time we were inviting guides to help
lift, lift, lift, zzzzzzzz</p>

<p>I had been planning to use the exercise as an alarm clock of sorts.  I wanted to hang up my
laundry last night, soon after the exercise, so it could be nearly dry by now.</p>

<p>I totally fell asleep, and only noticed what had happened because I wasn't wearing my mouthguard
when I woke up.</p>

<p><em>??? why am I not wearing my mouthguard ???</em></p>

<p><em>Ooohh... I fell asleep unplannedfully last night.</em></p>

<p>D'oh!</p>
