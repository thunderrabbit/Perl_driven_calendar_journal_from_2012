<p>The food here at the hotel is all food of the day.  Whatever they could catch is what they
serve.  Though the hotel is not *that* small, but apparently it used to be: he would fish and she
would cook; now they buy locally caught fish and they both cook.  perhaps.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have no idea what we ate, but dinner was huge, and that was *after* chowing snacks and
stuff after Naho drove us here.</p>
