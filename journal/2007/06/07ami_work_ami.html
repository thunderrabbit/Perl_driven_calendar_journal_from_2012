<p>Met Ami for lunch; we worked on the video and made some significant progress, but there's still
a lot more to go.</p>

<p>Work was bearable for the most part.  One of my students who usually drives me bananas drove me
bananas at first, but then I switched my attitude and things were better.  He (Naoki) said he would
be a good person if he could speak English, and all my MKP sirens sounded, and I went into a
compassionate warrior mode and cut this negative feedback loop right in two.  At the end of the
lesson, he said he felt good about himself because of me.  I was like, &quot;naw g; it's all
you.&quot;</p>

<p>Met Ami after work at her friend's bar (near EV) and met Matt, Simon, Nobu, Brian, Misa, Yoko
and remet Naoko, who will come to ultimate this Saturday.</p>

<p>Ami, Naoko and I went to Ramen after that.  Fat bellies leaving for the station.</p>

<p>Called my ex and got a 40 minute repetitive griping (especially considering she had already told
me all the same shit before (turned out she was drunk)), but she said she felt better at the end.
It reminded me a lot of _i_o_i's gripe sessions, and I wondered if I was in for one with Ami in a
year or so.  I sure hope not.</p>

<p>Called Ami again after I got home and confirmed lunch with her tomorrow.</p>
