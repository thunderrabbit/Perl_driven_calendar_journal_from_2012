<p>Ami has basically just missed her last train to go home (she would have had to have been at the
station 1 minute ago).</p>

<p>She slept during my coaching call with Kim.  I finished my first bit of homework: update
my <a href="/resume/">resume</a> and send the link to Kim before waking up Ami with a barrage of
kisses.</p>

<p>The kisses turned to conversation; we agreed it would be *nice*, but actually better to hold off.</p>
