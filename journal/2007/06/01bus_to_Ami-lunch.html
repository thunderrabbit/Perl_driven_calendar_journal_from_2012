<p>This is the first time I've taken the bus from Shibuya to Roppongi.  Always taken the train
before this.  I generally like the trains better because I imagine them to be more likely on
schedule, since they usually have their own uninterrupted paths on which to run.  Plus there's a bit
of a psychological factor: a bus can literally go anywhere; perhaps the driver will make a wrong
turn and end up in France or something.  A wrong turn on a train would take a more concerted effort
by more than one person.</p>
