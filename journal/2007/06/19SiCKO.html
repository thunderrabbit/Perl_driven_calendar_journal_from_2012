<p>Downloaded Michael Moore's _SiCKO_ today and watched half of it.  I almost turned it off right
after it started; I couldn't bear to watch the first guy suture his own knee.  And then with the
table saw..  eeek!  And later, the guy walking across Abbey Road.. I just knew something would
happen.  I'm glad it wasn't too terrible.</p>

<p>Anyway, tonight I'll watch the rest.  Gotta jet to work.</p>

<p>Holy shizah.  It's a must-see.  Must must must see.  I'm seriously considering moving to France
or England now.</p>
