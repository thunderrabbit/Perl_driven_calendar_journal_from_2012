<p>One reason I really like Ami is we can really play together.  Last night we were doing air
transfer games and when I was going to do a water transfer, I got choked up trying to overfill my
mouth and nearly spewed all over, but she rescued me in three transfers.</p>

<p>Just happy wonderful crying laughingly awesome.</p>
