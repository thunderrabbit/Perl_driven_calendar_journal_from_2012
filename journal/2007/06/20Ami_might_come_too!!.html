<p>Yesterday Ami called me and asked what I thought about her coming to the US as well!  I was
like, &quot;Whooooooooohhhoooooooo!!!   Really??&quot;</p>

<p>We sketched out a possible schedule that allows her to see both my mom and dad in their
respective cities for a couple days each.  It will involve one extra drive between the cities, but
it's only about 3 hours each way.</p>

<p>Given that almost no one knows about this, it's hard to make plans, but I'm sure we'll be able
to work out the proper details once everyone knows what's up.</p>
