<p>Moved some pics and a video online.  The pics were from Ami's camera; the video was of Francois
flaoting down a gutter thing in Meijijingu.  It's taken youtube a hella long time to process it; I
don't know why.  Like over an hour.</p>

<p>Right now I'm headed to Futakotamagawa to get a video shot that I wanted to get yesterday but my
camera card memory filled up just at the wrong time.  I didn't charge the battery last night; I
hope it works well.</p>
