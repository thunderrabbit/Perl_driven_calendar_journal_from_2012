Subject: Chat with Bob Nugen

10:05 PM  me: howdy!
  Happy Dad's Day!
10:06 PM Did Fred give my message?
  I completely flubbed up and didn't call you....
	14 minutes
10:21 PM Bob: Thanks..... Nope, Fred is having his own problems at this point in time. Please send
  Love and Light to the successful completion and presentation of his paper.
 me: I will
  When is it to be presented?
10:22 PM Bob: I'm at DeVry U giving a final to my Pre-Calculus students, so my conversation will be sporadic.
 me: okay
  I'm typing to my girl in Japanese, so I may be sporadic as well.
10:23 PM Bob : July 23 or so. He is about 6(some?) months behind and has to catch up on the
  mathematics and the programming and is wanting someone to lead him to the solution.
 me: eeeeekk!
10:25 PM Bob: Please talkto him about visualizing good outcomes and such if you can. He is having a
  strong emotional scare here and is very afraid of the consequences, and doesn't seem to be able to
  make his way out of this "hole" he appears to be in (the way he is looking at it, it seems
  insurmountable)
 me: I see
10:26 PM I understand
10:27 PM Bob: He will appreciate support and encouragement from you, even if it is just telling him
  that he can do it and that it is all OK.
 me: Cool
  I can call him in a bit
10:29 PM Bob: He is already (said he would be) at school talking to one prof and waiting for Tom
  (his major prof) to get in. He is asking Tom for hel this am. Hopefully, Tom helps, rather than
  cutting his losses and letting Fred just wither and go away.
 me: wow
10:30 PM Bob : I need to go. Love you.
  me: bye!
  Bob: bye!

<p>Sending love and blessings to Fred....</p>
