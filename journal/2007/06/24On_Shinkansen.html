<p>I'm on the shinkansen, headed to nagoya to see Cheerful Dancing Fellows (CDF (Crazy Dancing
Fellows)), my crazy class from PB 49th voyage.  This will be the second time we've met since the
voyage!</p>

<p>Super thankful to Ami for helping me get the right tickets for this trip, and for helping me
fiture out how to get from the shinkansen station in Nagoya to the airport.  (or just knowing that
the airport is where I need to go, which I didn't know before last night.)</p>

<p>I barged into the seat area of this girl to get a pic of Francois on the shinkansen.  It was a
closeup pic, so I don't know if one will be able to tell that it *is* the shinkansen, but I
know.</p>

<p>What's really awesomely crazy: we are between Shinagawa ad Shin Yokohama, and going next to my
old hook along Tokyu Toyoko line.  I saw the bridge over Tamagawa that I've crossed  many times (on
TJ Bike when i would ride to Gaba) and we're about to cross Tsurumi River.</p>

<p>Whoohoo!</p>

<p>And now we're going into the tunnel where Dan and I made 10 yen bets on which way the trains
would come next.</p>

<p>I just uploaded this video from on the way *back* to Shinagawa from Nagoya.</p>
