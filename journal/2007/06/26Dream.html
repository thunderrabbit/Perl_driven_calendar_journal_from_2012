<p class="dream">I had been adopted into a family with two demon children, and  was witness to the
father organizing a way to get rid of them, sending them basically into slave labor.  Documents
were to be forged; trials were to be faked; his kids would never be able to return.</p>

<p class="dream">I knew that was the wrong thing to do, but I did nothing, even though for a moment,
I had a chance to steal some documentation with which I could disclose the plan.  My chance was too
slim, with a higher chance I would be caught, and a low chance I'd actually be able to do anything.
I was afraid they would do something equally dastardly to me.  And, a nice dinner was available,
which would apparently be the start of a life where I wouldn't have to worry about anything, so long
as I could just forget I had ever seen his two real children be sent away.</p>

<p class="dream">The father had invited to the dinner the two men with whom he had arranged the
trade.  One of them agreed, and the other refused.  The father was like, &quot;well, that's
alright, because your suit makes my stomach turn; I wouldn't be able to eat anyway.&quot; And the
guy said something else, and a moment later they embraced and were all but making out.  Completely
bizarre.</p>

<p class="dream">At dinner, the mom was gloating, &quot;we're going to start having children as soon as
possible,&quot; as some sort of emotional tar to cover her shredded heart.  I knew she was serious
and thought she was completely crazy.</p>

<p class="dream">The dad was like, &quot;Rob, we're going to have a test to see if we're fit
parents.  I want you to make sure there are no cockroaches in this house.&quot;  Sitting at the
dinner table, I scanned around the room and saw three mouse holes in the walls.  &quot;I don't see
any, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;That's good.&quot; Uproarious laughter from everyone at the table.</p>

<p>I was happy when I woke up.</p>
