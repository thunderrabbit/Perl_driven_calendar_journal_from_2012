<p>Nice.  We watched the ¥Ó¥è¥ó¥» DVD and I invited/convinced her to bunk out as the DVD finished
after her last train.  Cuddly all night and maintained our boundaries.  Noticed a bit of an issue
with communication, but it was mostly due to me not being able to communicate when I wanted her to
read my mind.   Hmmm.</p>

<p>Really enjoyed watching her sleeping face.</p>
