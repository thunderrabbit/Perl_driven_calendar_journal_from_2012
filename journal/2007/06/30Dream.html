<p class="dream">Back at PB, but it was an annual event, and I couldn't believe it had been a year
already.  I had arrived a few minutes late, and the movie had already started, but only a few people
were still awake.  Natalie, Matt the Artist, and Audrey, perhaps.  Everyone else was snooozin' like
puppies littered across the floor.  I tip-toed my way in, and found a place to watch the movie.
Suddenly, it was the next morning, and we were in line for something.  Kat_rean came by and was
like, &quot;do you like my shoes?  They are very cute, like me.&quot; and she flirtingly gave me her
ABC gum by hand, then walked out the door.  I was in line to go backstage and the security guard
(who I knew) didn't pat me down, but just looked at the pen I was holding.  It wasn't allowed to be
brought in, but he basically told me I could go in, but he was trusting me.  I went in and found a
guy sprawled out on the stairs in a big trench coat.  I helped him up and was like, &quot;man, how
long have you been there?&quot; and he was like, &quot;a long time,&quot; but I couldn't tell if he
was joking or how long he thought was long.</p>
