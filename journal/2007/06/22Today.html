<p class="date">1:41am JST Saturday 23 June 2007 (day 13604)</p>

<p>Lunch with Ami was followed by work, which included a 120 minute break, during which I met
Shimpei to discuss future housing possibilities (we decided on Inokashira, Denentoshi, or Toyoko
lines), and also included a cancellation of my last class, of which when alerted, I contacted Ami to
meet her for ramen and gyoza and then chillin' in my room.</p>

<p>Just watched a video chock full of information about the world's financial powers, and the
slavery of US citizens (yes, including you) and the engineering of wars and recessions, etc, etc.
Scary scary shit.</p>

<p>If I can figure out how, I'll post it on google video</p>
