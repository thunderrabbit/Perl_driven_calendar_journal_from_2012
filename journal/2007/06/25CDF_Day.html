<p>During breakfast, we saw a guy throwing fish guts to the delight of swooping birds near Maruha Hotel.</p>

<p>Today's highlights: making pottery and seeing Nagoya Castle, while taking pictures of Francois
all over the place.</p>

<p>We ate misokatsu (famous in Nagoya) (comparable to BBQ pork), shrimp chips (I was shocked that
someone had converted a big empty warehouse into a money magnet by making a tourist attraction out
of a cracker store.), and &quot;white whirl,&quot; a big blop of ice cream on a heated pastry bread
with syrup.</p>

<p>I took a shload of pictures, and my battery didn't survive the onslaught.  I took a shload with
Naho's camera; she said she'll post them soon.</p>
