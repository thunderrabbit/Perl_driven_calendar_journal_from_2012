<p>Good lesson with Mari and Chika just now.  I used the marbles to help them practice using THE and
A, and extended to BOTH.  They both need to work on this more.</p>

<p>Earlier, I had a new student named Akane; it's her second and last lesson before zipping off to
NYC for a year or more to study dance.</p>

<p>Went to Starbucks with her for a sandwich and drink, then chatted with Naori.</p>

<p>Satoko was late, but she's here now.</p>

<p class="date">6:05pm JST</p>

<p>Did a quick THE and A review with Satoko; I think she gets it, but there were a couple
mistakes.</p>

<p>Then Yuria, in what I think will likely be our last lesson.  She gave me an extra 10,000 yen for
some editing I did for her a couple days ago.  Definitely a nice bonus.  Even so, I could hardly
stay awake during the lesson because she was just reading and not engaging my brain even a little
bit.  Maybe a teeny tiny trace of a bit, but no more than that.</p>
