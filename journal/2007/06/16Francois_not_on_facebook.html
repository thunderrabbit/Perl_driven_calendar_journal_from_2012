<p>I tried to register Francois for Facebook, but they first said, &quot;Francois Rabbit&quot; is
not a valid name, and then they said &quot;you are not eligible to join Facebook.&quot; with no
further explanation!</p>

<p>Perhaps it's because I
said <a href="/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=all&date=2005/06/15#A_name_for_the_rabbit">Francois is 2
years old</a>.</p>

<p>I would love to find Ai, who suggested the name.</p>

<p>Holy Shit!  Francois is 2 years old as of yesterday!</p>

<p>I've been telling people he is 4 years old, because that's about when Colleen sent him over.</p>
