<p>After work, I met Ami (and (semi-randomly) some cats from ultimate, who were waiting for other
people to go bowling, <em>and</em> <a href="http://carlrandall.com">Carl Randall</a> who works at
EV-K with me) and headed out to Minatomirai, where there was to be
a <a href="/images/travel/japan2007/around_town/yokohama/2007hanabi/index.shtml">fireworks
show</a>.</p>

<p>Chowed ramen in Shibuya after that.</p>

<p>I put all the pics in sequence to make a video of sorts:</p>
