<p>We went to the patio with 4 restaurants, a flower shop, and Mister Donuts around it (I think it
might be called Dogwood Plaza) and got shocking news!  The whole place will be shut down after
Sunday July 1st!  NNnnnoooooooooooooooooooooo!!</p>

<p>The ultimate gang often goes there after our games..  It's perfect; we can be loud outside and
have 4 restaurants from which to choose.  It's going to be demolished and a building will go in its
place.</p>

<p>I'm glad I found out about it *before* it happened, but I would like to go with the ultimate
gang for a bunch of silly fun pictures of the area.  I'll ask Ami if she'd be willing to go there
next week as well, instead of Showashonen Park.</p>

<p>Good times with guys there.  We took some pics (actually I asked some women upstairs to take
one).</p>

<p>Someone asked me how old I was; Ami chuckled and I rattled off &quot;13581 days old.&quot; in
Japanese.</p>

<p>Sean was like, &quot;you know how many days old you are...&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;well, my computer does, and I just sorta keep track of it like I keep track of
the date.  I forget my days old like I forget the date.&quot;</p>

<p>Case in point.  I thought it was 13581, but it's 13591.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>

<p>update: I asked Ami last night; she agreed to play ultimate instead of going to the park.  Nice.
I emailed the Iku group to tell them the news of the impending closure, and lots of peeps were like,
&quot;wha???&quot; and said they'll definitely go.  Nice!</p>
