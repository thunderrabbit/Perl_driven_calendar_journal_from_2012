<p class="date">3:35pm JST Wednesday 27 June 2007 (day 13608)</p>

<p>Worked on one of my paintings for basically an hour, though I recorded it only as 45 minutes
because I did some inking after I recorded the number of hours spent.</p>

<p>However, I see that today is the 27th, and I wrote the 26th as the date on the painting, so I
could just add .25 hours with today's date, and be pretty accurate.</p>

<p>Today I added orange to one half of one of the pair of paintings.  The orange wraps around some
brown lines to which I had added inked lines to 'attach' them to another line, the color of which I
have forgotten.  Possibly brown or blue (or another color).</p>
