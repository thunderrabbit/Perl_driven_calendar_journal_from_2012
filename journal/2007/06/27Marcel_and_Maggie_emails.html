<p>I skyped Marcel yesterday to tell him my plans; I'd love to see him and family, but need to not
have another out-of-town debacle like with Fred.</p>

<p>I love how casually he did this... such a risk with setting the dates!</p>

Maggie!!

Let's get together!  How about a family BBQ?  Probably need to wait a few weeks to let Rebekah grow
up a little.  What do you think?

I'd love that.  I think we'll be having a shower the 1st week of July or the first week or August.

I wonder if we want to plan a dinner after the shower or if we want to choose a different weekend.

Remind me when you are due?

I know this could be answered more effectively than how I'm going to answer.  :)

Technically, my due date is 21 September according to my doctor.  And while there have been
indications that my doctor can move my due date earlier, she hasn't which I think is fine.  However,
I don't think anyone seriously thinks I'm going to make it to 21 September.  I had estimated my own
date as 15 September - if I get that far, I'll be really surprised.  When asked, I say middle of
September, but I think it'll probably be early September.

Doh!  I see I typed 1st week of July - I mean last week of July or first week of August.  :)

How about July 29?  We have an out of town wedding on 8/4.

I think we're planning to be on that side of town for a wedding shower, so if it's more convenient
for you and Bill, we could meet at your place.

Sounds great.  Since I figured travel is more exciting for you, I was open to your judgment.  :)
