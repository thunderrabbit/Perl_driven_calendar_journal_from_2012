<p>In 五京, there are three genders: male, female and kimale (木メル (tree-male)).  A baby can only
be produced if a male and female have intercourse inside a kimale, where the zygote is left to grow.
Therefore the females do not have to carry babies to term; the tree (木 (ki)) gives energy (気 (ki))
to the fetus during gestation.</p>

<p>Also, cars have five wheels and can roll in any direction.  They're actually spheres instead of
wheels as we think of them.</p>
