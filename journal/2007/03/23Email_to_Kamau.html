<p>Kamau was the hip hop artist who performed on PB 49th voyage back in the day.  It seems like
years ago, but it was only a couple years ago.  I liked chatting with him when we both had free time
and were both in the same place at the same time; I probably would have enjoyed getting to know him
more.</p>

Hey Kamau

I was the one who had you burn 20 or so of your CDs near the end of your time on PB 49th voyage.
Thanks for that!

I just came across my copies of those CDs _The Black Insperience_, and _In it... but not of it_,
and I'd like to import them on my computer, but I can't find the track titles for the second one.

Do you have them online somewheres???

I saw your myspace front page..  Cool books you've been reading.  One day I think I'll relax my
brain enough to experience OOB; I did one of the week-long courses at Monroe Institute back in 1995
or so.  Good times, but I stayed firmly planted in my body.

Thank you for spreading the message of peace.  Looks like you're in Macau now?

I'm chillin' in Tokyo, working on a video game that we hope will benefit humanity by encouraging
people to stop playing video games..  hahaha

I visited Palestine (mostly Jerusalem) for 6 weeks after our voyage.  That was wild.  Came back to
Japan, sailed on 52nd voyage (southern hemisphere, including Easter Island (wow))

Strapped for cash, but with plenty of free time, I rode my bicycle about 800km (each way) to do a 10
day silent meditation west of Kyoto.  The meditation was harder than the ride.

On the way back to Tokyo, I hit a car and broke my shoulder, bicycle, and computer.  Oops.  Been
working for the past year to pay for all that.  I didn't have insurance, and I was in the car's
lane, so it was basically fault.  Overall, hella fun, and I have a cool scar and metal plate in my
shoulder, with X-rays and photos.

   Blessings
    - Rob!

ps: From 49th voyage, I'm vaguely in touch with Petra who is working in London, and pretty in touch
with Kris, who is starting a travel agency in Canada.  Grassroutes travel, an Eco travel thing.
Good stuff.
