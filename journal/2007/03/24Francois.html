<p>One of Michael's students was telling him about Francois today.  After the lesson he was like,
&quot;I didn't know you had a stuffed rabbit...&quot; etc, and I told him (and the student) the
latest news that Francois is in Egypt for 4 days.  My imagination says he's there now, though Mika
did not specify which 4 days she'd be there.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing the pictures!</p>
