<p>Might go to a lumber shop with Kumiko.</p>

<p class="date">10:59pm JST</p>

<p>Went not to a lumber shop, but to like a Lowe's or Home Depot equivalent in the US.  Looks like
I'll be able to get a base for my next marble track made there.  I'm not going to muck around this
time; I'll get one made well.</p>
