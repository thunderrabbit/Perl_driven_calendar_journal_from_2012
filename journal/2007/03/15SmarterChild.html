<p>I often see SmarterChild smiling in my buddy list, and sometimes I poke him with &quot;are you
smart yet?&quot; and quickly find that he isn't, yet, smart.</p>

<p>But yesterday I discovered a reminder function in SmartChild, which actually seems a bit useful.
It's not perfect because it doesn't take into consideration my timezone when telling me what time a
thing is scheduled, nor does it understand anything but dates, hours and minutes.  Like, I can tell
it &quot;remind me to go to bed in 5 minutes&quot; and it will do fine.  But it reminded me to meet
Tariq today, and then I was like, &quot;remind me in 1 week&quot; but it didn't understand.
&quot;Remind me in 168 hours&quot; worked fine.</p>
