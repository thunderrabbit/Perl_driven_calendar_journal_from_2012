<p>Tiredness.</p>

<p>Watched all the remaining White Rapper shows except the last one before heading to ultimate today.  Sarah and
Rob were there, and then a guy named S[e|h]aw?n showed up.  We played some hammer practice, then
Greatest practice and then forehand practice, then huck practice and then got tired and Gleb showed
up as we headed out to Pink Cow, where everyone else showed up to chew and chat.</p>

<p>I found out Bruno is Sock Monkey; for some reason I thought it was Kumi.  I found out why Jason
wasn't there today; he dislocated his shoulder last weekend.  Interesting to see him out of
commission.</p>

<p>Came home and watched the last episode of the white rapper show.  I thought John Brown should win
due to being so creative, but.. ah well.</p>
