<p>I'm meeting Miki in Futakotamagawa today.  I headed down to the train platform and heard the
Japanese announcement of the arriving train.  &quot;Huh?  why is this train.... oh!!&quot; and I
looked up to confirm, and saw ½ÂÃ«, I had gone to the platform headed toward Shibuya!</p>

<p>Went back upstairs and *just* caught the train going the right direction.  Had I missed it, I
would have been late. (*)</p>

<p>(*) Actually not late, because Futakotamagawa is so close to my station, (!) but still.. the point is
that I understood Japanese both spoken and written in a useful realtime situation!</p>

<p>(!) the train stopped before reaching the station; a bit of congestion, it seems.  But still no worries.</p>
