<p>I just created <a href="http://surgery.robnugen.com/">surgery.robnugen.com</a>, which points to
the pictures from my accident on TJ Bike and surgery pictures and X-rays.</p>

<p>While creating that sub-domain, I noticed Hitomi's domain, where she has posted some pictures of
her travels with friends around Japan and around the world.  I scoped a few of the pictures (like,
3), and saw one with her cute and beautiful smiling face... and I just started to cry.</p>

<p>Slobbery bawling crying into my pillow.  I miss Hitomi.</p>

<p>I extended the domain registration for another year, along with thunderrabbit.com</p>
