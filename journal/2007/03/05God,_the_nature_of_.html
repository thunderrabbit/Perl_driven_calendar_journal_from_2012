<p>I just realized something(s):</p>

<p>If God is infinite, then God must be the universe (or bigger than the universe)</p>

<p>Being in the &quot;presence of God&quot; is said to be the ultimate fulfilling feeling, from
which we never want to leave</p>

<p>So God = good feeling, and God = infinite, so the only way to have bad feelings is to believe (
= create the (perceived?) reality of ) being away from God.</p>

<p>So ultimately, our desire as souls will be to merge with God, which would mean that we believe
we are infinite, or, in other words, inseparable = the same as, everything/one/where/time, etc.</p>

<p>So, once we realize that all of these concepts of separation are false, and then realize that
thinking about separation as a concept pulls us away from oneness, then we begin to realize the
nature of reality, which is we are all one.</p>

<p>Anything I do to you, I do to myself, though the perception may be otherwise, because I perceive
you as not being me.</p>

<p>Religions based on doing good things are specialized cases of this, all trying to be more like
God, = remember that we are already one, = unlearn that we are separate.</p>

<p>And God-ness is just patiently and gently waiting.</p>
