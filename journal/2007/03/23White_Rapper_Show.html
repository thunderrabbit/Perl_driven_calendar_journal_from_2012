<p>Almost finished the second episode of the White Rapper Show that Tariq recommended.  I quite
enjoy it!  I'm surprised at the amount of non-supportive discussion and bickering, but maybe that's
cause I'm older than most of them.  I'd probably been all crazy just like them at the time.  But
anyway, it's good times, and I look forward to seeing the rest of the episode and the rest of the
episodes.</p>
