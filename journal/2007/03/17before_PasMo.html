<p>I went all the way home before deciding for sure to go back to Shibuya to get a Suica card, which
I can use to ride on any JR lines in Japan, because tomorrow starts the sale/use of PasMo cards,
which cover Suica (JR), Passnet (almost everything else), and Bus cards (buses), all in one.  For
the past 4 years that I've been in Japan, until tomorrow, we have had/will have to use three
separate cards for those.</p>

<p>明日から、PasMoというカードを使えるので今日までSuicaカード買えると思います。だから、今Suicaカード
を買います。未来にもと高いになるずたる。</p>

<p>かな。</p>

<p>Michael pointed out that on the advertising flyer, it appears the old-style Suica cards will
still be available, so the &quot;last Suica card&quot; that I buy today will not be any more
valuable than its encoded value.  (clearly on the flyer the two card designs that will be available
tomorrow include one that looks exactly like the Suica card I have now.) I'm hoping the flyer is
wrong, or approximating, so there will be a bit of a difference on the face of the card (or maybe on
the back).  Like tomorrow the cards will say &quot;PasMo&quot; somewhere on them.</p>

<p>But anyway, I realized why I <em>actually</em> want to buy one.  When I thought about turning in
my old Suica card so I can put its value onto the new PasMo card (that I will definitely buy), I imagined
a desire to keep the old card, .. but why keep an old scuffed up card when I can buy a new card...
Unless I can't buy a new card anymore!!</p>

<p>I bought a new card.  2000 yen for 500 yen card and 1500 yen JR line travel.</p>
