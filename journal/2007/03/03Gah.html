<p>Gah.</p>

<p>I forgot to upload my journal entries last night; basically just wathed episodes of Mythbusters
with Michael, even though I had a list of things to do, though one of them are Due Today or any
some such.</p>

<p>Up too late for my own sleeping good, so  haven't yet eaten this morning as I reset my alarm for
a more reasonable hour after the first one jjolted me awake.</p>

<p>Now, an interesting point is my consciousness came nearly to level 1 awakefulness.. to the point
that I was thinking, <em>ya know, if I wake up <b>now</b>, I won't have a jolting shock after I fall
asleezzzzzz</em> and promplty ignored my own advice and subsequently was jolted awake <em>and</em>
was later than usual getting up.</p>

<p>ANYWAY</p>

<p>As I was rushing for the station a girl walking sideway and looking backwards was headed right
for my flight path, and kept remaining in my way though I made adjustments (or maybe I just kept
thinking she wouuld wake up and face forward. and I ..  I didn't have a ton of wiggle room as there
were a ton of other people all around.  I bumped into her shoulder as I was like, &quot;what the
fuck are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>Not a very nice way to treat a felllow human being, even if they are walking backwards in my
way.</p>

<p>Or was I walking forwards in <em>her</em> way?  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I'm getting closer to  remembering Kim's advice for handling anger *before* I bark at someone.</p>
