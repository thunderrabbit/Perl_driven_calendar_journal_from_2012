<p>Great to see Miki.  She described her husband as &quot;big&quot; and his age as
&quot;secret&quot;</p>

<p>I hope she's happy.  それだけ。</p>

<p>Miki told me how she decided to go to Nova because Carla was her teacher at the initial lesson.
I whipped out my camera and put it on video mode, &quot;can you say that again?&quot; and went
through about 4 minutes of recording her squirming about being on camera and blah blah blah, but I
got her to at least nod yes when I reviewed the story in English.</p>

<p>She grabbed the camera after a bit and recorded me saying HI to Carla and wishing her a happy
Carla White Day and then introducing Francois a bit.</p>

<p>She ended up convincing me to delete the part of the video where she appeared, because she would
re-record a message in a more poised manner.  I did what I thought was the right thing, but it
deleted the part of the video where *I* appeared.  I was pissed for a bit, but then was
like, <em>fuckit</em> and deleted everything so we could just do it all again.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that wanted to have captured the moment in the raw, in real time, with
spontaneity and the whole perfect youtube style.</p>

<p>We ended up with a fine couple of vids, I'm sure:</p>

<p>Met her sister for lunch at the nearby Chinese restaurant, which wasn't disgusting with smoke
when we went in, but was before our order was far in progress.  I told them sorry and ducked out.
I didn't want to smell disgusting all day at work.</p>

<p>I said bye to Miki who came outside with her sister's baby for a bit and waved to her sister.</p>
