<p>Back at home now watching Michael play God Of War, a pretty visually and aurally exciting game; I
wouldn't play unless it were a full body suit immersion game where I can climb and jump and do all
sorts of fun things.  That would be pretty cool, actually.  The suit could have feedback mechanism
to make it feel like I was climbing, or to make me actually use strength to make a difference.
Would be really cool exercise.</p>

<p>But just pushing buttons?  Like on a keyboard?  No way.  Not for me, thanks!</p>
