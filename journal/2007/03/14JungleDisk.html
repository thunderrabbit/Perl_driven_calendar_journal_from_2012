<p>JungleDisk makes my Amazon S3 account look just like a hard drive on my computer.  A realllly big
hard drive with a slow access rate.  I'm currently copying my entire iTunes library there.  I have
this idea that I can just move my computer to S3 and not worry about backups whatsoever.</p>

<p>Yes, I don't always have internet access, but I'm not moving *everything* there.  Just big
things to evaluate the viability.</p>
