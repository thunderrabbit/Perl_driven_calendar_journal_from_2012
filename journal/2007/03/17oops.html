<p>Just heard a boom as someone collapsed just outside the train, perhaps while getting off.  Not
sure what happened.  We were stopped, so the train motion didn't have any effect.  I'm not going to
take a picture because it was probably not his choice to collapse / cause a problem.  Not sure what
happened.  I'm in the front car of the train, and the driver ran back to see.  The person's legs are
wiggling, and the driver is talking to the person in a way, but it still looks like the driver is
trying to bring the person to consciousness more than make sure he's okay.</p>

<p>Now the condustor from the back has run down, and is talking to driver.</p>

<p><em>probably</em> the person is shnockered drunk and collapsed.  That's my guess.  No one is
hovering around the body watching anymore.</p>

<p class="date">11:19pm JST</p>

<p>Our train doors closed and we are leaving, with one body on the platform and one conductor guy
talking to him.</p>

<p>As the train left my station at 23:23, the expected departure times were not listed on the
blinky sign.  Soon after it left, they turned back on, with the next train leaving on time at
23:25.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the train schedule I have in my wallet shows different departure times.  I'm
going to check if I have an old version of the schedule, or (more frightening if it's true) I'm
misreading it.</p>

<p>Ah.  Or option 3: I forgot today is Saturday.  I was comparing the blinky board with the weekday schedule.</p>
