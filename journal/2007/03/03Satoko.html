<p>Satoko was over a minute late for her lesson, so I went ahead and (told Michiko, then) ran to
the conveni to get some food for I hadn't eaten properly today.</p>

<p>She hadn't arrived by the time I got back, so I was happily chowing in my room when she came
in.  She was totally cool and didn't mind me chowing during the lesson.</p>

<p>Also cool, or maybe even moreso: she's trained in Oracle, and proficient in SQL, so next lesson
I may ask her about MySQL tables and queries I'd like to make for the days old website I'm planning
to launch.</p>

<p>I'd optimally like to outsource the user-login and password-recovery software to an existing
Perl library or the like.</p>
