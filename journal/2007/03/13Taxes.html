<p>I'm heading out to pay my taxes.  I didn't know we had to file taxes here... I think very few of
my peers do file taxes.  Michael showed me on a map where the place is located..</p>

<p>Good luck to me!</p>

<p>Did it.</p>

<p>Fred made a statement after visiting Tokyo for some days: &quot;In Tokyo, parallel streets are
not parallel.&quot;</p>

<p>I think I shall call this Fred's Law of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Thanks to Fred's Law of Tokyo, it took way longer to get to the tax office than it will next
time I go.  Thanks to touch screen technology and other magic, the guy was able to print a form to
file my taxes in a jiffy.  I just had to write my address, my name, and the name of my company.  He
even entered my bank account information where my refund will be sent.</p>

<p>Aw yeah.</p>

<p>I wonder about hooking up some refunds from my year each at NOVA and Gaba.</p>
