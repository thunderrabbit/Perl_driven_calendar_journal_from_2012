<p>this morning, while writing my 360 degree look at life for Kim, I decided to make some simple
changes around finances: I called my credit card company to see if I can get a lower balance (short
answer: yes, but call back on Monday); I called my bank to see how to send money to them from
overseas (I know how on *this* end, but I want to verify what bank details should be used on *that*
end)</p>

<p>Last night I signed up for Amazon S3 and got Jungledisk, which I may use to back up a significant
amount of data (so far, just the source code of movies for the flash game presentation).  Kinda
sucky: I can't just send entire directories up at a time.  Or, I haven't yet figured out how.</p>

<p>Today, I'm going to go play ultimate, and then meet with Tariq and Hitoshi online at 8pm.</p>
