<p>There's an entry for Sakurashinmachi station on Wikipedia, but it's just a stub.  Right about
now, the station is undergoing construction, including new escalators and fire doors.  Part of me
would like to update the entry with pics from this construction.</p>

<p>The rest of me is busy with other things.</p>

<p>I saw some bars on the ceiling which look like tracks designed to hold a hanging curtain, but
they were attached all shoddily.  I asked a guy in Japanese what they were, and he answered in
English, &quot;pardon?&quot; and then explained they are simply to hold the temporary plastic
ceiling in place.</p>

<p>Ah.</p>
