<p class="dream">Accepted to sail on PB again, but I forgot to bring any clothes, and forgot to get
ready for the departure until like just as it was time to go.  I  saw online a way to tell them I
planned to come, but I decided it was too late, and apparently I ought not go.</p>

<p class="dream">Ended up in some other kind of adventure, riding on a school bus with a grocery
bag full of my stuff (not groceries) and realized I needed to get something from the floor below
(while we were driving?) and asked a guy if he would watch my stuff.  He was like no problem, so
I left it with him, but just at that time, we were arriving at the school, so it was too late to 
go down to get the rest of my stuff; I was unsure what to do, and went off the bus in the normal
fashion while everyone else was at a Beastie Boys concert, fighting for their right to party.</p>
