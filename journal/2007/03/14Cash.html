<p>The good news: I transferred 216,000 yen to my new GoLloyds account, 2,000 of which they will
enjoy, and the rest of which will be converted to USD (not sure who enjoys the money skimmed there)
and then sent to my US account, who <strike>will likely enjoy between $10 and $25, I'm
guessing</strike> took $10.</p>

<p>According to their website:</p>

<pre>
        Amount in Yen:          216,000         
        Commission (Yen):         2,000          
        Transfer in Yen:        214,000          
        GoLloyds TTS Rate:      117.19
        Remittance Amount:      USD 1,826.09
</pre>

<p>So I should end up with at least $1,800 in my account at home.</p>

<p>And every penny can go to my credit card.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>
