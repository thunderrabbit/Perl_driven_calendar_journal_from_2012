<p>Holy fucking shizah; just had this gum smacking cat in my lesson stumbling through the text, not
understanding nor asking questions, and totally boring the fuck out of me until he was like, 
&quot;¿Ë¿∏, just a moment, how do I this book is using?&quot; or some shit like that, and I was like,
&quot;don't read the book here.  Read the book at home and bring questions here if you have
them.&quot;</p>

<p>I realized after a bit an even better way for him, blabber mouth that he is; perhaps it will
work better if he writes a diary or something and then asks for corrections.  I suggested that to
him and he seemed keen on the idea.</p>

<p>I'm so thankful that Ami is my next student.  Except that she's now 5 minutes late.  I wonder if
she will come today.  She usually is either well on time or doesn't come at all.</p>
