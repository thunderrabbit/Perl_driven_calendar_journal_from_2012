<p>I just checked; the cash has already hit my bank, and I've already sent it toward my credit
card.  And I just called my credit card company and asked if they can drop my interest rate.  They
did, from 16.49 to 12.99.</p>

<p>Silly me for getting a low rate while I have a low balance.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Ah well; I'm getting my finances sorted.</p>
