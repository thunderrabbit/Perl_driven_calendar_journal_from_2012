<p class="dream">Jimmy da Magnet gave me 5000 yen to go get a drink; he told me to keep the change
for my 13,500th day celebration.  I quite happil went down to the neighborhood shop, which was
tucked in an alleyway below the freeway by a big tree.  I opened the refrigerator to get a drink
and found a plate of fried eggs and a banana on the bottom that had been there a few days since I
had forgotten them after cooking but not paying for them last week.  I took the plate as well and
went up to the counter, explained to the guy I had left the eggs by mistake.</p>

<p class="dream">He got all excited and called his friend over and I told him what happened, and
they were like, &quot;don't worry about paying for the eggs; we've had a betting pool on whether or
not the eggs would be claimed and paid for.  The betting pool more-than-covers the price of the
eggs.&quot; and I laughed my ass off at the simplicity of the technique for not having to pay for
forgotten-remembered food.</p>
