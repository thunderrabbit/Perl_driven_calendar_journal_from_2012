<p>Got to chat with Naori on the way home, as our train line was stuck for a bit so I caught up
with her after she left EV 20 minutes early.  Nice surprise, that.</p>

<p>She taught me 慣性（かんせい）which means momentum, after I told her I had learned (and
forgotten) 重力（じゅうりょく）which means gravity.</p>

<p>I bumped into her, あっ慣性しちゃった。and she laughed.</p>
