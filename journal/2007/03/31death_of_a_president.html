<p>Oh my gosh.  I'm only 5 minutes into the movie and completely shaking with excitement, like I do
when I'm *really* into a movie.</p>

<p>Mmmm..  It was good, though not as awesome as I had thought...  After reading
the <a href="http://www.cinerina.com/reviews/death-of-a-president/">Cinerina review of Death of a
President</a>, I thought there would be much more focus on a police state and craziness after
something crazy happened to the Prez.</p>

<p>But, yes, I could not tell it was not real.  I think I know which composite shot she thought was
flawed, but I sure thought it looked like Cheney giving a eulogy for the president.</p>
