<p>Because my train was late, I called Shimpei to tell him I'd possibly be late; I thought he said
basically it was okay and he'd wait, but when I got to Shibuya and called him, he was already on the
train headed home.  I'm glad I called him before I walked 5 minutes to the restaurant to find out he
wasn't there nor even coming.</p>
