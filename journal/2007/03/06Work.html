<p class="date">11:04pm JST Tuesday  6 March 2007 (day 13495)</p>

<p>Tough day today, though not as tough as it could have been.  I started at 2:40 due to a level
check no-show after being scheduled to start at 2:20.  No cancellations, no late students after
that, but a 20 minute break at 7:40 to 8pm.</p>
