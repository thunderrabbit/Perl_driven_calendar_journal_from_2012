<p>Met Gigi and his wife whose name I didn't catch; they travel about 5 months a year from their
home near Tel Aviv.  Headed to Hakone today for two days and eventually to a city that I couldn't
identify from what she was saying.  (nor could a nearby English-fluent Japanese woman)</p>

<p>They said the Toyota factory tour in Nagoya (in Toyota, I wonder?) is not to be missed.</p>
