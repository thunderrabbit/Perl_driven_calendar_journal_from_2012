<p>Good morning, backup.  I see now there is still 4116 MB of music to be archived to Amazon S3.</p>

<p>Apparently due to all the data OS X stores about files, this number is greater than the actual
amount of data to be stored.  In the Pending Operations list, I see this for each song:</p>

<pre>
Write /path/title.mp3 (0 KB)
Write /path/._title.mp3 (0 KB)
Write /path/._title.mp3 (0 KB)
Write /path/title.mp3 (3 MB)
Delete /path/._title.mp3 (0 KB)
Copy /path/NN title.mp3 (3 MB)
Delete /path/title.mp3 (0 KB)
</pre>

<p>Where NN is the song number within the album.  Only the 4th Write command seems to take any
(much) time.  Even the Copy (though it lists the same amount of data) doesn't take (much) more time
than the 0 KB operations.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's now 9:40am and we're at 4045 MB remain, which means roughly 5.5 MB /
minute or 740 minutes (12 hours) remain</p>

<p>So it should be done before I get back from work tonight.</p>

<p class="date">9:46am JST</p>

<p>4008 MB remain.  6.2 MB / minute</p>

<p>I've just turned off BOINC, to see if it makes any difference.  I imagine not, since it's CPU
intensive while the backup is bandwidth intensive.</p>

<p class="date">9:55am JST</p>

<p>3954 MB.  6 MB / minute.  No real difference.</p>

<p class="date">10:55am JST</p>

<p>3553 MB.  6.7 MB / minute.</p>

<p class="date">10:57am JST Monday 19 March 2007 (day 13508)</p>

<p>3539 MB.  Now turning BOINC back on.</p>

<p class="date">12:49pm JST</p>

<p>2880 MB: 5.9 MB / minute.</p>

<p>So maybe BOINC does have some effect on the thing.</p>

<p class="date">1:43pm JST Monday 19 March 2007 (day 13508)</p>

<p>2461 MB remain.  I'm going to pull the ethernet cable, take my computer to work, come back and
plug it back in.  This should effectively simulate a network outage.  We'll see how JungleDisk
handles it.</p>

<p class="date">2:02pm JST Monday 19 March 2007 (day 13508)</p>

<p>Hmmm.  While writing the next entry, JungleDisk seems to be trying and then discarding write
operations.  That ain't what I had hoped would happen.</p>
