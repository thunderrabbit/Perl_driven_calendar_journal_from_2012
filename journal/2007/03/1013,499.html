<p>Today, this morning, for my 13 thousand 499th day, I shaved my head in anticipation of meeting my
girl tonight (I saw her last night (so I figured a bit of some shockage was appropriate)) but mostly
in anticipation of enjoying Fujikyu Highland tomorrorrroooooowwowowooooowwww!!!!!</p>

<p>I think I remembered everything but bringing a bit of extra cash.  I've got 14,000 yen in my
wallet; that will be enough if I'm not asked to pay back tickets tomorrow; I forgot if she
requested me to or not.</p>

<p>I'm well-early for work today; I can get some food this week as opposed to last week.</p>

<p>Ah, also, there was a bit of progress on the fire doors on my end of Sakurashinmachi station as
of today (last night); I got a pic.</p>

<p class="date">9:16am JST</p>

<p>I'm going to try to upload them now via my camera, which has folders and categories.  I wonder
if they will show up on here.</p>

<p>Hmm.  not really sure.. but one weird thing is that the camera didn't show up in Finder, though
iPhoto detected it and imported the pics (faster than my card reader has in the past)</p>
