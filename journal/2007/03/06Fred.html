<p>Super longer than expected chat with Fred this morning trying to figure out how to make flash
rotate an object around an arbitrary point.  I may end up solving it by putting my movie clip
inside a movie with the registration point where I want it to rotate.  I think I just thought of a
way to do that without adding any apparent complexity to the objects.  I was hesitant to do it
before because I've been taping together with bits of code this whole thing that is only staying
intact by luck and grace.</p>

<p>I don't have the chat available right at this moment, but I may put it online later.</p>
