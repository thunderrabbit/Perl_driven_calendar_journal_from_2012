<p>Walking in the train from one end to where I guess I need to get off, I found that this train is
actually two trains linked together.  Basically a walkway through where the engineer and conductor stand
while driving or monitoring the train.</p>

<p>It took me a while to determine what they do with the accordian tube thing when the trains are
separate.  I found levers connecting the accordian to one train, but the other train doesn't have
such levers; it must drive with the accordian attached.  But how is it stowed?  I found some hooks
that will hold it in place, but they aren't all-that-strong, and I think it would look funny to
have the thing hanging off the end of the train.  Perhaps it *is* there, but I've just never
noticed disconnected occurences.</p>

<p>But, I also saw an extra flap that can allow one more level of collapse, though I didn't see how
it would be secured.</p>

<p>Two strong bars were hanging; one on each side could do some strong closing, but I didn't see to
what they would be attached.</p>

<p>AND, I couldn't see what was under the walkway; there could be another clue there.</p>
