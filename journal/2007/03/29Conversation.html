<p>After meeting with Kim last night, I chatted with Michael about what's up with me moving.  He
surprised me by saying he was thinking of moving out if I was going to move out.  I thought he was
going to be here for the long haul.  I told him about the main two things that bug me, and he was
like, &quot;well if you never say anything, then how am I to know what you're thinking?&quot; or
some such.  Strictly speaking, that is true, but he also used the words, &quot;I was wondering when
you were going to tell me,&quot; so.. I'm not sure what that all means in sum.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>We made an agreement as far as cleaning the common parts of the house: I'm in charge of the
bathroom and trash; he's in charge of vaccuuming and recyclables.  We didn't make a decision about
the kitchen, but as a show of good faith, I did the few outstanding dishes.</p>

<p>Also, regarding internet connectivity, the previous contract is due to expire, and Michael was
considering *not* reconnecting if I was going to move out.  I asked him the cost: basically $800
for two years.  I told him I'd pay $400 right now for those two years of service.  No refunds and
no cancellation fees if I move out.</p>
