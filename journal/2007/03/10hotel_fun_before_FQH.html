<p>Chillin' before sleepin' at a hotel about 5 minutes' walk from Fujikyu Highland.  We don't
actually know what time it opens tomorrow, so I'm going to go for 8am arrival.  Not sure if she
will be up to it, but I'm going to whine like it's my 13,500th day party and I'll go early if I want
to.</p>

<p>Funny vid (funny to us at least) in the onsen:</p>
