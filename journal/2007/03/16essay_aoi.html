<p>Aoi wrote me an essay type thing on the difficulty of making friendships in Japanese culture.
She basically said it's not just between Japanese and foreigners, but even between Japanese,
friendship can be difficult or difficult to understand... but we just trust and help each other as
much as possible.</p>
