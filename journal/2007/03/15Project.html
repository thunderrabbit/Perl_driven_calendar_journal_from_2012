<p>Project is still pending, but in a good way.  Tariq has another meeting tomorrow.  We three are
meeting today in a few, to hopefully get our ducks sorted and source code straight as we barrel
into the future.</p>

<p>I backed up my data and brought my <strike>100 MB</strike> (*) 5 GB firefly disk that I got a
long time ago; I think it was a freebie with my first (previous) Mac.</p>

<p>(*) I'm not sure why I always think it's 100 megs.  (So far), I never think 5GB is small (for a
small external drive), but then I quickly think of the drive as small again and think it's 100
MB.</p>
