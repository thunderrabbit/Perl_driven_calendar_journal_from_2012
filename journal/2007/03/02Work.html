<p>Cancellation here at work today.  ゆりか gave me a pen from the 2005 World Expo in Aichi, which I
didn't visit due to being on 49th PB voyage.  It's got 5 colors, plus pencil, and a little green
bobbing monster character named きっころ on the top.  The pricetag still on the pen says 840 yen.  They're
apparently going for 3500 yen on Yahoo! Auctions now.</p>

<p>So sweet!</p>

<p>Motoko came today and was quite pleased with my idea of counting days instead of years.  She's
372 days older than me, and I calculated her 14,000th day will be on .... 17 July 2007.  I think.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  I just checked and emacs gave me 18 July 2007 as the correct day.  Not sure where was the
discrepancy.</p>
