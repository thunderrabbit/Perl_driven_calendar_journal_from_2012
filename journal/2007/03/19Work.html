<p>&quot;I'm going to Los Angeles the day after tomorrow, so I have some questions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've never lived in Los Angeles, but okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the weather like in Los Angeles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, if I were you, I'd look it up on the internet, because I don't really have any
idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I did that, and it said 20 degrees C.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well, then, it's 20 degrees C.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What should I wear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When is it 20 degrees C in Tokyo?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;April.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you wear in April in Tokyo?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blouse, skirt, stockings, shoes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heels or flats?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Flats.&quot;</p>

<p>What kind of teaching is this?  WTF is going on here?  Am I an ass for not appreciating the
chance to answer her questions?</p>

<p>Reiko told me one of her favorite students saw me as not in the best spirits today during our
lesson.  I agreed and surmised that it was because of the previous student who had sucked my brains
out by trying to read through a book that (in my judgement) is way above her level.</p>

<p>It didn't quite come out like that, I bitched about my job and how I'm sick of pandering to
students who won't do any homework, who come in and be all like, &quot;how do I study
English?&quot; but don't do homework, or who act all like I should have some sort of magic pill
that can magically make them speak English or some shite like that.  It doesn't fucking exist,
people.  Go home and study.  Go watch movies in English.  Go meet some English speakers.  Use the
resources around you; change your lifestyle.</p>

<p>I ranted on to say that I'm not willing to study, so that's why I've quit taking Japanese
lessons; it's fucking embarrassing to me if I come in all, &quot;yeah, I didn't study
again.&quot;</p>

<p>What a nightmare.</p>
