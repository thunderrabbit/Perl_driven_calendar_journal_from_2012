<p>Good day at work, including some breaks, during which I got my golloyds application sent.  I
assume they received it with no worries.</p>

<p>Students today featured Yukiko, whose nose I love, and Akiko, who knows English well. </p>

<p>( I'm too tired to pull the best pun out of that. )</p>

<p>During other breaks I worked on flash.  Got a movie clip to spin upside down on command, but now
it's causing something else to muck up, and I'm not sure why.  Too tired to fix it now.</p>

<p>Bedtime and awake early to work on it more.</p>
