<p>Asakaze is 9 years old; I've had lessons with him about 6 times now.  I try to combine learning
and games in a haphazard way, keeping him guessing as to what may come next.</p>

<p>Today we played BASH; he did relatively well understanding the game, and I think I remembered /
created a logical set of rules for the game.</p>

<p>Then we went to the textbook and were reading about Stanley's International Restaurant, and it
came to light that Asakaze has no idea where Italy is.  Nor China.</p>

<p>I gave him homework of obtaining a world map.  We'll see how it goes.</p>
