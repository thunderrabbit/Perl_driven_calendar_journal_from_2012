<p>Phat Pat told me he was playing with his new odometer.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>Then he told me it was for his mouse!</p>

<pre>
I was playing with me new odometer
nice
have you written a poem about it?
its for my mouse
not yet
wow; a mouse odometer is cool
I have moved it thirty three feet already
hehehehe!
holy shit I want one now!
kudo
is it hardware or software?
softwear
sorry kodo
its a toy on gnome
I also have these penguins that fall from the top of the screen
they climb over your windows
and if you open or move a window above them they die
and they have little angels that float up to the top
hahaha
that sounds fun
I'm looking for an odometer for OS X
giggets
right?
or is it gigetts
neither of those terms comes up with anything but genealogy stuff
got one
1.92 meters
It took the most time to find a ruler to measure my screen.
</pre>

<p>5.46 meters now.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>It's actually measuring the distance the mouse *cursor* moves on the screen, not how far I move
the actual hardware mouse.  I've got a little ruler here; it's measuring at least as accurately as
I can.</p>

<p>5.80 meters now.</p>
