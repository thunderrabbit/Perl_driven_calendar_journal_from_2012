<p>I *just* sent Francois off with Mika, the ninja who made his shirt.  She is going to Egypt for 4
days!  He wanted to go with her.  See him and her back in 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Wow.  So I'm pretty excited about how this may turn out.  I'll have to tell a few peeps, most
notably Colleenie Beanie.</p>

<p>I was just wondering how Ami will react when I tell her.  If she ever comes back to EV!</p>
