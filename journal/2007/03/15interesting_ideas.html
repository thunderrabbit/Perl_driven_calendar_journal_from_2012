<p>Meeting with Tariq was interesting partially in that we didn't <em>do</em> all that much except
chat and clear out some of the old source code that's been piling up as versions change.  ( I gotta
get subversion figured out )</p>

<p>Interesting story differences:</p>

<p>My dad said don't forget your family, and there's plenty to do back in the US.</p>

<p>Tariq's dad said, &quot;never look back.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>Tariq was also telling me about how he/one must sell out (my words) a bit in order to have the
resources to kick back later.  Like having the fashionable appearance that &quot;rich people&quot;
appreciate..  expensive ties and cufflinks and shit.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>
