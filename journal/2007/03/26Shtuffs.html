<p>Just made my train, as in I'm sure the conductor held the door cause he heard my stampeding feet
coming down the stairs.</p>

<p>My roommate: bless him for helping me out monetarily when I was broke with a broken shoulder, is
a slob.  He's addicted to video games and the internet way moreso than I am.  I mean, I check my
email more than the average cat (I think), but at least I don't leave disgusting dishes for
days and days.  And by days I mean days off from work, too.</p>

<p>I probably shouldn't even post this cause I know some people who know him read this; I should
talk to him first.</p>

<p>BUT I might not even be able to post this cause our internet is going to be disconnected soon;
the previous-previous roommate whose name was on the previous contract decided he didn't want to
renew the contract (understandable, given that he no longer benefits from said internet as he no
longer lives there) and my roommate was all, &quot;uh, yeah the internet might be disconnected today
or tomorrow.  Well, the guy who was paying it closed the account today; I don't know how quickly
they will act on it.&quot;</p>

<p>He was heading out to work so I didn't get into a big ol' discussion, but I was like, &quot;so,
uh, is there any way I can help you get internet access here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It shouldn't be all that hard; just need to sign a new contract or something.  How hard
could it be?  The wiring is already in place!&quot;</p>

<p>For the record, without my posting this, and without me saying anything to him, he cleaned
all the dishes.</p>
