<p>Cool.</p>

<p>The girl got us hooked up with a great price to and from Fujikyu Highland, for an overnight
adventure featuring my 13,500th day at the awesomest amusement park in the Tokyo area (probably in
Japan), featuring one of the two awesomest roller coasters in the
world, <a href="http://www.eejanaika.jp/">ええじゃないか</a>, the brother of which my brother rode
when <a href="http://robnugen.com/blog/2006/07/26/fred-on-4d-coaster/">Fred rode X</a>.</p>
