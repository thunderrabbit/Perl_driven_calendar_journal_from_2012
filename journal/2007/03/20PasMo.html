<p>Some people are concerned when marketers know too much about one's buying habits, etc.  But
generally speaking, marketers value information about their customers.  Right?</p>

<p>So the idea behind PasMo is that I can use one card to ride JR trains, other companies' trains,
buses, and buy things at several retailers.</p>

<p>I'd like to consolidate all my existing cards (Suica for JR, passnet for others', bus pass for
buses, and (the same) Suica for retailers).  But I can't.  This should be excited to have me doing
all these things on one card.  The passnets can't be merged at all.  I've asked a couple different
guys; both said no.  The bus cards I haven't tried, but given that they are *basically* the same as
the train cards (same company, even), I doubt they can be merged.  I just went to the JR office to
merge my Suica with the PasMo, and was pleased to hear I can do it.  But,</p>

<p>They want to charge me a 210 yen cancellation fee!</p>

<p>What??</p>

<p>Yarg.  She pointed out that I can use the credit on the card at various retailers and suggested
I do that (and not be charged a fee (?)).</p>

<p>So, I just did just that.  Bought 699 yen worth of stuff with my Suica.  And they'll never know
who bought it!</p>

<p>(( Now, granted, there is a purchase and travel history associated with that Suica, so maybe
they're happy enough with *that* information.  But why don't they want to merge it all????? ))</p>
