<p>It's raining.</p>

<p class="date">8:49am JST Sunday 11 March 2007 (day 13500)</p>

<p>Still raining, but I was able to convince her to get outta bed and go go go.</p>

<p>Eejanaika is pretty awesome, but I don't know that it's the best coaster in the world..
Definitely some wild turns and silliness, and  plenty of death defying views of the ground rushing
up toward us,</p>

<p>but it's a bit short.</p>

<p>I successfully got my camera on the ride by tucking it into my underwear, so I know it's
posibile to smuggle items onto the ride.  Didn't try to video the ride while on my first time, just
hollered a lot like, &quot;yeaaaahh booiiyyyyyyyy&quot; and hands up the entire time (of course)</p>

<p>Interesting in the photo at the end, the girl had her face squeezed shut to block out
the horror, while I'm basically like snarling forward through the ride.  Quite a difference.</p>

<p>Not sure if i will post it here due to her request to be anonymous.</p>

<p>Ppppbt.</p>

<p>Doushiou??</p>

<p>We are in line for Fujiyama now.</p>

<p class="date">1:36pm JST Sunday 11 March 2007 (day 13500)</p>

<p>We got sent away from Fujiyama with tickets to get ahead of the line later.  Too much wind for
it to run.</p>

<p>Eating now.</p>

<p>We rode Zola 7, Execution House (headphones in dark room, ooh scary), Moonraker (spinny vertical), and Mad Mouse.</p>

<p class="date">3:13pm JST Sunday 11 March 2007 (day 13500)</p>

<p>We rode Panic Clock and then the ferris wheel twice.  After that we headed to Licca Town, but got
sidetracked by another audio scary thing which was definitely better-themed than Execution House.
We all got inside padded vertical coffins which had speakers discretely placed at our ears.</p>

<p>It wasn't really scary, but I kept making animal noises in the darkness, much to my own
entertainment.  Lots of cat meows, twittery bird, and then I busted out the elephant one time.  I
forgot about the howler monkey.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  I've finally found an attraction that scared me.  Licca Town:
filled with pink plastic things and little girls running around having their photos taken.  Eeek!!</p>

<p class="date">4:56pm JST Sunday 11 March 2007 (day 13500)</p>

<p>We've ridden bicycles, walked through a haunted house, rode spinning tea cups..</p>

<p>Now ice cream for me and hot tea for she</p>

<p class="date">8:04pm JST Sunday 11 March 2007 (day 13500)</p>

<p>Done.  Final ride was Fujiyama, during which I recorded video, though I don't know how it turned
out given that the sun had already gone to bed.</p>

<p>Before that, we were in line for the Fire Mountain thing that janette and I had done numerous
times until we won.  Today we didn't play because while we were in line, there was an announcement
that Fujiyama had resumed coasting after an extended break due to wind.</p>

<p>Before that we went to the big haunted house, but didn't go in after (re)learning the tickets
are 500 yen, and aren't included in the day passes we had.</p>

<p>Walked back to the hotel to get our luggage and then got some souvenirs, and now our bus is here.</p>

<p class="date">8:34pm JST Sunday 11 March 2007 (day 13500)</p>

<p>wow!  The night video on Fumiyama is much better than I expected.  I'll definitely post it.</p>
