<p>Today, because I forgot the lunch Ami made, I went to Shakey's, hoping to get a free sympathy
drink from the waitress after I accidentally left an empty tupperware container there that was
thrown out by the next day (yesterday).  The waitress wasn't there (yet), but when I sat down at the
table near a non-Japanese guy, he was like, &quot;hey you can join me if you want,&quot; or
something.. and though I had brought my notes from work so I could lay out some brain cells on this
project, I was like, &quot;yeah; I'd like to meet someone new.&quot;</p>

<p>We both appreciated that our names specialize in being only three letters, then I was like,
&quot;so what's your story?&quot; and he told me he's just winding down the last couple days of a 2
week adventure here in Tokyo.  I enjoyed hearing his experience with trying to get around town.
(Hard to find a balance between the extremes: girls waving him away while pointing to their wedding
rings; people walking blocks out of their way to help.)</p>

<p>Abe's features reminded me of a darker version of Vin Diesel.  Abe's from Toronto, works for
Rockstar Games, and likes Japanese culture, especially anime.  After we talked about living
durations extending surprisingly fast, he stated that he'll be leaving Toronto for (hopefully) LA
within 18 months.</p>

<p>We talked about other stuff, but I can't remember any other that shouldn't be kept offline
without permission.</p>
