<p>Wow.  tonight was quite the FREE HUGS superlative!</p>

<p>Met the doublestunt couple; they are circus performers and will be performing tomorrow and this
weekend in Ueno Park!  Wow!  At first I thought the woman said &quot;Syracuse&quot; when she said
circus.  Not sure where they are from.</p>

<p>Met Roxanne and Rafael, both French, and both into the &quot;FREE HUG Scene&quot; (is it a
scene?) and encouraged me to join their group on Facebook!  Woah; I never thought of that...</p>

<p>Met three little high school girls who stood around for 30 minutes asking me questions &quot;do
you have a girlfriend? what do you do? how long in Japan?  do you like Japanese? etc etc plus why
are you doing this?  what does hug mean? blah blah blah,&quot; all in Japanese (which I guess is why
I would get the same questions in English when I worked as a teacher)..  ((at one point, はるか
called her boyfriend and reported that he was mad at her for having given me a hug; I told her
friends みゆき and りんご (never got her real name) to support her in telling him to relax...)) At
one point, there was a chaotic crowd of rambunctious hugs and about 10 people standing around to
watch slash join.  They all drifted away and then when Tetsuya showed up in a <em>Superman suit</em>
with tens of FREE HUGS signs, the three girls (still there) squealed and joined us for another 20
minutes or so.</p>

<p>Just as I was leaving, two やまんば girls walked by and looked, but didn't participate.  I had my
FREE HUGS sign in my bag, and was putting it on my shoulder, but was still close enough to the group
that I could bring up the topic without difficulty.  I was like, &quot;why didn't you free
hug?&quot; and one of the girls was like, &quot;uncomfortable feeling&quot; I go,
&quot;really?&quot; and she's like, &quot;oh, not with you, but yeah.&quot; I was like, &quot;yeah
yeah of course.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked what line they were taking and it turned out we were headed for Tokyu Toyoko line so I
asked to what station they were going.  They were like, &quot;Jiyugaoka.&quot;  &quot;Ah, the
Oimachi line,&quot; to prove that I wasn't a complete stranger to Japan (just strange, but not a
stranger) and continued, &quot;I'm meeting my girlfriend in Nakameguro,&quot; to further tell them
I wasn't trying to connect in an inappropriate way.  I said bye at the top of the escalator as they
went to get tickets.  I hopped onto the first outbound train.  Before it left, they mosied by to
the second outbound train, where it was likely they would get seats.  We waved and that was
that.</p>

<p>I really wanted to get a picture with them, my first (1st) time in Japan to have any sort of
conversation with yamamba girls.</p>
