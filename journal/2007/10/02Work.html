<p>Good stuff at work.  Doing some php, which is new for me, though not necessarily what I want to
do.</p>

<p>But anyway, it's got a lot of free code floatin' around the web, which I've been scooping up as needed.</p>

<p>Right now making a URL extractor so we can write them to a DB with a reference key that will
refresh to the URLs when a user clicks on our link+reference key.</p>

<p>I just downloaded my brain to paper so I can go home and relax, then pick it right back up in
the morning.</p>
