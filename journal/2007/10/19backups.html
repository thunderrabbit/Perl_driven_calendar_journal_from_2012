<p>While playing with Amazon EC2 and therefore Amazon S3, I decided I was overdue to archive my
accumulation of stuff in my user space here locally.  I look forward to Leopard with its &quot;time
machine,&quot; but even then it's only on local disk.  Perhaps I will set up an ongoing backup with
JungleDisk.</p>
