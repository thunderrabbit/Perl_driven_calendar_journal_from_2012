<p>Feelin' good after sharing 25 free hugs in 45 minutes.  One guy sidled up to me like he wasn't
paying attention and then gave a surprise hug.  One old man walked near / around me a couple times,
and then later came up and shook my hand then walked away.  Near the end I was hug-attacked by 3
individual guys and 2 pairs of girls from a group.  One of the guys did a jump-catchme! style hug.</p>

<p>Earlier a girl who I would swear was a pure Shibuya Girl (lollipop, long bleached hair, big round
sunglasses) was actually from Arizona, and perfectly English fluent.  She said her boyfriend didn't
understand that in the US, giving hugs is like saying HI.</p>

<p>A guy from Russia gave me a few great hugs, and explained to me and the two Japanese girls with
him that &quot;we used to do this in Russia, about 2 years ago,&quot; and explained in Japanese the
reason for giving free hugs.  He said he would be back in an hour, but I told him I'd be gone, but
perhaps Tetsuya would be here by then.</p>

<p>Definitely going to give free hugs most nights after work for the time being.  (&quot;time
being&quot; might be just tomorrow, but probably longer...)</p>
