This is being written with my phone. 2.5 presses per char average.

Today and yesterday good progress on work project, even though on both days I felt totally stuck at
times.  Today I finished the PHP-HTML-form framework so my next step is to convert some mySQL class
to work with my new table. Fortunately, I was just looking at it today and it appears it will be
easier than I had guessed.

A big part of the challenge before was figuring out how the previous author was moving data around,
and I believe the code was sloppily cut-n-pasted from itself because by Occam's razor that's how
there's superfluous code, especially in some rarely traveled error catchers.

Not sure that I will clean up those modules soon, but I'm trying to make my code as lovely as
possible.

<p>Okay, now I'm on my computer.  Regarding &quot;moving data around,&quot; I mean the pages are
presented to the user after going through three .php files each.  The first is called _____Action
(where _____ is a description of the page) which does calls to mySQL through a different class.
Then _____View, which seems to set up some HTML bits, and then _____Template, which is included at
the bottom of _____View and just presents all the stuff to the user.</p>

<p>The documentation did not explain the order of these page calls (and it still doesn't; perhaps I
should write some explanation), and I don't have access to an object called &quot;context&quot;
which I am sure is not in standard PHP because there's a misspelling in its member functions:
getAtrributes and setAtrributes.  But I can't seem to find where it's defined.  Anyway, this context
object is used to let _____Action tell _____View the state of the process, but I think he was just
setting everything that might be needed, without regard for what might be useful.</p>

<p>The code I found that makes me sure it was all just cut-n-pasted:</p>

<pre>
                $context->setAtrributes('miscInfo', $inputData);
                $context->setAtrributes('inputData', $inputData);
                $context->setAtrributes('error_msg', $error_msg);
</pre>

<p>Why would he set $inputData into the $context object under both 'miscInfo' and 'inputData' when
there is also a variable called $miscInfo, which means the code obviously should be</p>

<pre>
                $context->setAtrributes('miscInfo', $miscInfo);
                $context->setAtrributes('inputData', $inputData);
                $context->setAtrributes('error_msg', $error_msg);
</pre>
