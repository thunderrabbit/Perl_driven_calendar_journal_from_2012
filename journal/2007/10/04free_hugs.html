<p>I joined Tetsuya again for a FREE HUGS session in Hachiko Square.  In one hour I was the lucky
recipient of 47 hugs.  Most of which were by unique individuals, but some of which were multi-person
hugs (featuring as many as 7 guys) and one guy hugged me 7 separate times.</p>

<p>Good times; good times.</p>
