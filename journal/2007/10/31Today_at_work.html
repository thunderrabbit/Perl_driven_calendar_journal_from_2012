<p>Pretty good day at work today, if I count all the stuff I did for my website and chatforest.
For work, I explained what was causing an error that they were about to retract all the files that
got moved online today to fix (it wouldn't have fixed it), and I added my nice date checking code
to another page with dates.</p>
