<p>I've been reading slashdot.org and came across a hilarious EULA that says &quot;you cannot look
at the source code of our page,&quot; blah blah like a bunch of babies.  They also say I can't use
their name nor link to their site.</p>

<p>To be clear, &quot;they&quot; are <a href="http://www.cybertriallawyer.com/user-agreement">Dozier
Internet Law, P.C.</a>, and their EULA is linked under their name.</p>

<p>I laughingly note that in the source code of all the pages *I* could find, they have
inappropriate keywords listed:</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta name="KEYWORDS" content="keywords go in here"&gt;
 &lt;META name="y_key" content="1dfad02220b8c67b" /&gt; &lt;!-- For Yahoo authentication --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;
&lt;meta name="generator" content="Adobe GoLive"&gt;</pre>

<p>Hahaha</p>

<p>I guess that's what they get for using a site generator to make their pages instead of hiring
a professional.</p>
