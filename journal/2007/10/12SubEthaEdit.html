SubEthaEdit seems like a pretty decent piece of code editing software for Mac.

Bad points:
it's not free (but apparently the non-current version is (not the next non-current version, just this current non-current version))
one more bad point that I forgot

Good points:
It uses a good deal of the emacs keystrokes, (but doesn't have the concept of a kill-ring)
equivalent of font-lock-mode, easily customizable for many different coding languages including LaTeX
seamless connection with CyberDuck (free FTP software)
tabbed file can be pulled onto or off from the current frame
show changes mode

There are other good points that I don't use:
Remote file collaboration / sharing
Many other menu items I haven't explored

shrug.   just lettin' you know.

How's shtuff in New York( City)?\?
