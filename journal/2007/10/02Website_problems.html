Subject: site down again
HI


I'm unable to access http://robnugen.com, but I'm able to access http://m.robnugen.com/j

This makes me think there's a problem with the DNS for http://robnugen.com


I've tried accessing from different computers, and from different countries via proxy servers.

In all cases I'm getting Connection Refused for http://robnugen.com. In all cases http://m.robnugen.com/j works.


I haven't done extensive testing, but on first glance, I'm getting errors for http://chatforest.com
and http://pekoneko.com

<p>Jeff T responded that they had just rebooted the machine.</p>

same problems as issue #2097725

Short version: please check IP address 208.113.179.194 for proper http responses

Long version:

I can't get http connection responses from

http://robnugen.com
http://pekoneko.com
http://thunderrabbit.com

I get Site Temporarily Unavailable from
http://chatforest.com

BUT

I get a proper http response from

http://m.robnugen.com

I can ping all of the above domains. I notice that all the ones that don't give http connections are on IP address 208.113.179.194

chatforest.com has a different error and is on a different IP
208.113.178.75

and m.robnugen.com works properly and is on a different different IP.
208.113.179.16

<p>Now Jeff T replied a bit more fully:</p>

Your server has had continuous issues for the past 2 hours that I and a
fellow tech have been working on. A complete resolution has yet to be
found but we are in touch with an Admin for further help. Let me know if
you have problems after the next 30 minutes!

Thanks!
Jeff T.
