<p>At work today, I actually got a project that's beginning to be an actual IT project.  Got to
design some way to make click-thru counter page that people can link from their sites.  It needs to
count page impressions and (unique) link clicks.  I chatted with Dude about how to do it, because
he used to do exactly that.</p>
