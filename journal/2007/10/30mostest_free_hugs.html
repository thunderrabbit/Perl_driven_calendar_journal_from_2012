<p>Wow...  Tonight I logged the highest rate of free hugs so far.  81 hugs in 75 minutes.  The
final 15 minutes was a real boost; I had been right at 57 hugs right near the 60 minute mark, and
one more stream of people came across Shibuya Crossing.  I thought <em>I'll wait until this stream
finishes and call it good even if I haven't recovered a hug per minute</em>, cause at 45 minutes, I
was at like 50 hugs, and I thought for sure that rate would maintain me through the hour.</p>

<p>Good luck was brought by British Mike and Eli from ultimate, who came up separately.  Also,
Chiemi from EV came up and chatted for a bit.  I'm glad she's doing well in her new job and
studying BATIC.</p>

<p>British Mike held the sign for a bit, and got nothing at first, but then two attack-hugs from two
girls and aftershock hugs from their boyfriends while the girls bounced over to me.  He was like,
&quot;now I gotta get me one of these signs!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See???&quot;</p>

<p>I got my first disparaging comment about giving free hugs, a Japanese man came up and in English
was like, &quot;why are you copying Japanese?&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;excuse me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see Japanese people here doing this.  Why are you copying them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do?  Then where are they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's with this 'free hugs'?  What happened to communication and dialogue?  Do you want
to debate with me?  Come over here and we'll debate.&quot;</p>

<p>He was walking away before I really had time to say &quot;no,&quot; and get back to offering
free hugs.</p>

<p>Apparently, Megadeath performed at the なんとかセンター near Harajuku.  I saw a Megadeath
T-shirt, and later a guy came up and asked what I was doing.  He told me he had just been to the
show and said it was great.  Said that the band talked about the fires in California.</p>

<p>Most of the hugs tonight where in the Good range, though I got one that I would call a WTF hug,
but the girl just seemed so sad/shy/meek that all she could do was put her forehead on my chest and
barely lift her arms enough to touch my kidneys.</p>

<p>Two German women seemed happy to get hugs.  They're traveling around Japan.  I met a group of
four who were on their way to party for Halloween.  They were like, &quot;what are you
doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Giving free hugs!  What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're going to party for Halloween!&quot;</p>

<p>And one was like, &quot;I'll come back later; how long will you be here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About 30 more minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, I'll get that hug now,&quot; and she got her second hug while she had the chance.</p>
