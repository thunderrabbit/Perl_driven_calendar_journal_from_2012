<p>Yesterday at work I was gmail chatting with Sally and asked if we could continue via Skype 16
hours later.  She countered with 14, and our Skype date was set.</p>

<p>I logged on and was like, &quot;I don't have Sally's Skype username!&quot;  hmmmm.</p>

<p>Turns out, Sally didn't yet have Skype!</p>

<p>I love how she was like, &quot;sure!&quot; and knew she'd solve the little detail of having
never used Skype before.  &quot;these are minor details...!&quot;</p>

<p>Sally is great; our chat was great;  and next time, video!</p>
