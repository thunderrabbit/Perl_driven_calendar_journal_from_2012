<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>SubEthaEdit <em>just</em> bumped up to a new version and a new price!</p>

<p>I wonder if I can plea my case.</p>

<pre>
HI Monkeys!

I have enjoyed using SubEthaEdit for the past 20 days, and planned to purchase it after my next
payday at the end of the month.  Is it possible to get the version 2.6 price (and then free updates)?

I support the SEE community; I've submitted a feature request (cursor stays within viewport on page-up) 
and will happily submit bug reports as I find them.  I've pimped SEE on my site and to my close peeps.

  Thanks!
    - Rob
