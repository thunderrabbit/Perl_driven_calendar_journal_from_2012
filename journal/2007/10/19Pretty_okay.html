<p>Pretty decently productive at work today.  I got everything finished that I can likely do
without input from my handlers (interesting word choice) and I've got a good start on doing the
*next* part of that which they will likely want me to do.</p>

<p>Met with °æ¾å¤µ¤ó, and he suggested that instead of adding a click_count next to the view_count,
that we just add a (SELECT ...) to the list of things to select.  I was like, &quot;cool,&quot; and
he proceeded to write out the code freestyle, which was impressive enough for me.  I didn't mention
that my SQL coding isn't on the same par as being able to write stuff like that.</p>

<p>We ran it, and, nothing.  Looks like he's not good enough to write stuff like that either.</p>

<p>We pored over it for a bit, but he finally gave up (I had given up already) and asked me to
email him the code so he can play with it later.  If he can write it, that's great; I'll put it
into the project.  I may try to work on it a bit this weekend, but probably I won't.</p>
