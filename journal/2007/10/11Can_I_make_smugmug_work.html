<p>I've been considering the possible ways to make smugmug work...</p>

<p>I wanted this type of structure:</p>

<pre>
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> Shibuya -> funny outfits -> oct 10
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> Shibuya -> funny outfits -> nov 3
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> Futakotamagawa -> frisbee october 15
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> Futakotamagawa -> frisbee october 22
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> Kawasaki -> item date1
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> Mt Fuji -> date1
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> Mt Fuji -> date2
Home -> Tokyo -> 2007-> FujiQHighland -> date1               
</pre>

<p>But arguably, &quot;Around Town&quot; and &quot;Day Trips&quot; imply &quot;Home,&quot; and Shibuya/etc imply Tokyo, and I can merge the dates with the album name..</p>

<pre>
Around Town -> Shibuya -> funny outfits 2007	      
Around Town -> Shibuya -> funny outfits 2008	      
Around Town -> Futakotamagawa -> frisbee 2007 october 15 
Around Town -> Futakotamagawa -> frisbee 2007 october 22 
Around Town -> Kawasaki -> item date1		      
Day Trips -> Mt Fuji -> date1		      
Day Trips -> Mt Fuji -> date2		      
Day Trips -> FujiQHighland -> date1
Travel -> United States -> 2007 
</pre>
