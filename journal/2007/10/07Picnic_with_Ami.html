<p>Today instead of ultimate, Ami and I had a picnic where we usually play ultimate, but everyone
went to a different field because our field is pretty messed up from the flood.</p>

<p>I wrote a topic on the Tokyo Ultimate message
board: <a href="http://outdoorjapanforums.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/9511072951/m/7211097182">refurbishing
F-T on Monday</a></p>

<pre>
Ami and I had a nice quiet picnic and threw disc for a while at F-T today. The field is clean, but I
agree it's pretty lumpy, and I doubt we can really *do* anything to help it.

However, basically all of the surrounding baseball fields' outfields were being used by random
people (families). I don't know if we would be welcome to cleatfully use those fields, but they are
certainly flat and manicured.

Also, on the other side of the river, on the other side of the train tracks (and actually *closer*
to F-T station), there were two ultimate fields set up with some really high-level guys playing.

That's my official analysis of F-T playability. Perhaps some Japanese ¤Ú¤é¤Ú¤é¿Í can figure out if
we can use the baseball outfields for now.

So, about tomorrow: Alex, are you still game for a game?

Anyone else? I bet we wouldn't have enough turnout for an actual game, but perhaps some picnic
action with disc on the side would be nice.
