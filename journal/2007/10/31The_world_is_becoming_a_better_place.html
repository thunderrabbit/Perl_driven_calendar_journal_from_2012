HI Ed

Thank you for your Flickr extension!

Unfortunately, it won't work on my webserver.  I tracked down the
reason and added a check to your code.
<a href="http://wiki.edsimpson.co.uk/index.php/Flickr_Extension#Installation">http://wiki.edsimpson.co.uk/index.php/Flickr_Extension#Installation</a>

I added

       if(! ini_get('allow_url_fopen')) {
               $output = "&lt;strong class='error'&gt;Flickr.php error: this PHP install does not allow_url_fopen&lt;/strong&gt;";
               return $output;
       }

I'm going to check into my webhost provider (dreamhost) to see if I
can change the setting.

   Thanks!
   - Rob

<p>Basically, I found some awesome free software extension that lets me add to the already awesome
free software that powers wikipedia.  The extension, unfortunately, won't work on my server because
of a security thing they've got set up.  So I went to the extension author's site and made the
change (in his wiki) as mentioned above, then sent him the email.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Even better: Dreamhost documentation showed <em>exactly</em> how to use a more secure tool to do
this.  Even gave the code sample.  Now it works on my server, and I've patched the code mentioned
above with the code below.</p>

<pre>
        #  use cURL if we can't use file_get_contents
        if(ini_get('allow_url_fopen')) {
                $rsp = file_get_contents($url);
        }
        else
        {
                $ch = curl_init();
                $timeout = 5; // set to zero for no timeout
                curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
                curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
                curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, $timeout);
                $rsp = curl_exec($ch);
                curl_close($ch);
        }
</pre>
