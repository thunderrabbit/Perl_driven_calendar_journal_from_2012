<p>Good stuff at work; I got the list of files figured out..  I think I got them all.</p>

<p>Installed dotProject on my domain at /todo.  Yesterday I installed a wiki at /wiki.</p>

<p>Now going to Japanese lesson.  This is a trial lesson; we'll see how it goes.  Someone didn't
prepare, but has 30 minutes to do just that.</p>
