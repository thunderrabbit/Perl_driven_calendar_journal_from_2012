<p>I wanted to make this title a pun-cross between Ami's supposed to cook and Am I supposed to
cook?  But there's an extra s in the way.</p>

<p>This morning, I realized that though there's lots of food available in my fridge, it's all in
need of cooking before consuming.  Hmmm.  I don't really know how (long) to cook a slab of fish.
I'm not really sure I want to clean all the resulting dishes from cooking ground beef.  I'm not
sure that I want to eat ground beef.</p>

<p>So I went to the store to get some soy milk and had granola cereal.</p>

<p>At the store, the soy milk is 84 yen (they only have little bite sized drinks, not like a
carton), so I gave the guy two coins: 100 yen and 5 yen.</p>

<p>He gave back the 5 yen and then gave me 16 yen change, which included three coins: 10, 5, and
1.  I put my 5 yen back into his hand and pointed to both, saying, &quot;give me one,&quot; (in
English) and then &quot;moron&quot; (also in English) as he traded the two coins for one.</p>

<p>I guess I should be nicer than that, but dang, wasn't my intention pretty obvious?</p>
