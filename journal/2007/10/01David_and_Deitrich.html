<p>Met David and Dietrich tonight at Hachiko.  I suggested Pink Cow, but they are closed on
Mondays, so we went to Shakey's Pizza though we had been headed for Black and Brown Spaghetti
place.  We each got the buffet at Shakey's.  It's not cheap as chips, but we all were certainly
stuffed at the end.  Good times had by all (except perhaps the girl who was crying when she left;
not sure about the story there)</p>
