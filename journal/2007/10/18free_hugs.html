<p>Gave an hour's worth of free hugs in Hachiko Square tonight.  Pretty low turnout for willing
recipients.  At 8pm I had been there 53 minutes and mentally logged 13 hugs.  All but two were from
individuals who came alone or whose partners chose not to hug.  Usually the partners are
automatically peer-pressured into hugging as well.</p>

<p>Hug number 11 was with a girl named Eda from Denmark.  I teased her a bit when she specified it
was &quot;in Europe;&quot; I guess she's had many blank stares when telling people.</p>

<p>Eda held the sign for about 5 minutes.  She got an obligatory hug from her friend (but not her
two Japanese host sisters), and then nothing for a while.  She said it was okay because she knew
people were at least noticing her and &quot;thinking about it.&quot; After a bit she got a pair of
hugs from two girls.</p>

<p>A couple of &quot;hugs&quot; were not really hugs in the sense that I know them.</p>

<p>types of hugs (assuming both participants have two arms):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Excellent: both right arms on top, chest to chest connection, hands stationary on backs,
awareness of each other's breathing, relaxation upon realization this is a real hug.</p></li>

<li><p>Great: somewhere between Excellent and Good</p></li>

<li><p>Good: four arms, strong squeeze, back patting, short duration</p></li>

<li><p>So-so: four arms, no chest connection (&quot;A-frame&quot;), back patting</p></li>

<li><p>meh: side to side, each person one arm, optional patting</p></li>

<li><p>wtf: head hunched down with raised shoulder like to ram a door, no arm around anything, bump
slightly into my chest instead of a door</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One hug that I wouldn't really call a hug was like the wtf listed above.  The other I can't
really remember, but somewhere down in &quot;meh.&quot;</p>

<p>After the 13 hugs in 53 minutes, I got a quick 6 hugs in 7 minutes.  With that final 6/7
hug/minute ratio, I <em>almost</em> jumped the overall hour from a 1/4 hug/minute ratio to 1/3!</p>

<p>But still below the average of 1/2 (no mathematical pun intended).</p>

<p>Perhaps tomorrow night (Friday) will be a bit livelier.</p>
