<p>Kevin sent an email asking if someone would meet him to go to our new I-group location tonight.
I was like, &quot;yah, no worries&quot; and then David replied, &quot;And Rob you were at the last
meeting.  I remember we all agreed to go to Narita to meet Steve.&quot; And I read it as &quot;Rob,
where were you at the last meeting?&quot;</p>

<p>And my heart dropped.  Oh fuck; I missed seeing my closest friends in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I wrote a long email (that I wish I had kept) basically saying I felt sad and shame because I
missed the meeting, and the reason was I have given my memory over to Ami, just assuming she will
remember for me the things I need to do.  I put my magician to work on my shame and brought it to
sadness.  I just feel sad.</p>

<p><em>Then</em> I read a bit more carefully and realized my mistaken reading of David's reply,
quickly deleted and recomposed *my* reply, and realized I should capture this little moment.</p>

<p>I judge I'm still out of integrity with the group because I gave incorrect information to Kevin
and would have done the aforementioned fuckup had Kevin not written to the group and precipitated
this little conversation.</p>
