<p>This morning, my meditation was punctuated with thoughts of Rei from 52nd PB voyage.  I want to
have a final lunch to say goodbye or at least make sure that is in fact what she wanted.  I haven't
forgiven myself for (what I see as) my mistake that blew it.</p>

<p>Basically, before the 52nd voyage, I hadn't cut ties with Hitomi definitively enough to know that
she wouldn't be at Yokohama port when we returned, with some hopes that she could connect with
me.</p>

<p>I explained this to Rei, with the added PS that &quot;as I'm telling you this, my worst fear is
that you'll stop seeing me.&quot;</p>

<p>Worst fear realized.</p>

<p>Was it all just a misunderstanding?  Am I better now?  Obviously not, cause now, (by writing this
entry,) I'm creating a similar situation with Ami!</p>

<p>But I believe the truth needs to be free.</p>
