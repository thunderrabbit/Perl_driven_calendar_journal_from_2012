<p>Holy cats this is late for me to leave work.  But finally got to hash out the tables we'll be
using for the new DB stuff, and I totally slashed out several unneeded columns and added necessary
ones to get much closer to 3rd Normal than this guy was thinking of.  Now granted he knows a lot
more about the current setup than I, but his table plan was terrible in this case.</p>

<p>I just printed out 33 pages of code through which I will probably go tonight to see if I can get
a better sense of what else will need to be done to finish this, and how long it will take.</p>

<p>The good news: the bulk of the code I wrote for this thing is still usable.  I had to bang on
language slash table-design barrier for about an hour to get my design plan through.  But I did
it.  (^_^)V</p>

<p>Ami had to work later than me.  She was still at work basically until I got off the train in
Motosumiyoshi around 12am or so.</p>
