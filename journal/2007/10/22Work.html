<p>My understanding of an email from °æ¾å¤µ¤ó is that he'll be adding a field to a table and that I
don't really have to worry about it.  So today work has been a big reading day for me.  I read
about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Abagnale">Frank Abagnale</a>, the bank-fraud
expert, have read a bunch of <a href="http://qwantz.com">Dinosaur Comics</a>, and that's pretty much
about it, unless I'm forgetting something else I've read.</p>

<p>My stomach feels like it's on the edge of throwing up slash just need to sleep slash not sure
what.  Sorta ooky feeling today.</p>

<p>It might actually be a result of the Contact caplets I took yesterday and this morning.  Are
they making me worse or better or somewhere in between?</p>

<p>I just took two more in the hopes that they're making me better.</p>

<p>Ah.  Nice.  Right after posting this, I decided it might be good to do a bit of work, and, only
slightly sidetracked by various internet thingies, I noted that the sub-sub query was using the
wrong row to grab data.  I made the change and now...</p>

<p>The query works.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>I've basically decided to buy <a href="http://www.subethaedit.net/">SubEthaEdit</a> by
CodingMonkeys.  It's not freeware, but I've really enjoyed its colorization of PHP-HTML code and
ease of use with <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">CyberDuck</a>.  Payday is on the 25th; I should be
able to buy the license soon thereafter.</p>

<p>But right now, I gots to head out to Shinjuku.</p>
