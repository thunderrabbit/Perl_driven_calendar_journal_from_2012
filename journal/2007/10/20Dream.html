<p class="dream">Watching a guy beat boxing in a recording studio, he was flowing for a bit and
then just stopped for a couple seconds before breaking character and saying, &quot;right there I
want to add some lyrics &apos;freedom to the power and the power to the people,&apos; in five
fifths time.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He rapped the line a few times so it could be sequenced in to the recording.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Freedom to the power and the power to the people,  Freedom to the power and
the power to the people.  Freedom to the power and the power to the people.&quot;</p>
