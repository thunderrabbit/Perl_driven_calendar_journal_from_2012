<p class="dream">My alarm went off, and the music was different than usual, which was a reminder to
myself that this was not just a daily wake-up alarm.  I couldn't remember what it signified until
I thought for a bit and realized this was the alarm reminding me to call Bill Gates about my
difficulties in installing Vista on my Mac.  He had been like, &quot;call me at 9am on
Monday,&quot; so I had set my alarm; it would be interesting to get &quot;training&quot; from
&quot;the man&quot; himself.</p>

<p class="dream">Still a couple hours from the designated call-time, I talked to my mom a bit; I had
woken up in the back room of her house.  She told me the latest news about something, and then we
were directed to go to the university assembly where some kind of big announcement was to be made.
There were rumors as to what would be announced.  I was determined not to miss my Bill Gates phone
meeting, so I wasn't going to go.  But I did walk over that direction to *look* like I was going,
and told my friends why I wasn't attending.  &quot;Yeah, Vista sales must be really crap if they are
so unbusy at M$ that I can just call him right up...&quot; then turned back with my large red
inner tube and piece of paper with the phone number on it to call Bill.</p>

<p class="dream">As I left, I could hear the student announcers announcing the announcement.  One
person mispronounced a word, and the next person read what was obviously unedited source material,
including the TO: and Subject: of an email from when the announcement was being drafted.  This
confirmed in my mind that the assembly was worthless.  On the way back to my room, I walked through
some sloppy mud, which collapsed under me so I ended up in a little sink-hole of mud, thereby losing
the inner tube and the slip of paper <em>and</em> my room keys.  I waited a bit until the mud flowed
away, found the inner tube, and paper.  Headed back to where my room should be, and realized I didn't
have my keys, nor actually know which room was mine.  I tried to peer in the french windows to see
my stuff, but wasn't successful.</p>

<p>Woke up for real after that.</p>
