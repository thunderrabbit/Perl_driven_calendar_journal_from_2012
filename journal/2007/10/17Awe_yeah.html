<p>As the insert worked perfectly, no errors came up; I smiled, checked... &quot;aww yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<b>crushing the competition...</b>&quot; came to mind for some reason.</p>

<p>Sweet.  All indicators (okay, just one indicator) so far says I've got this thing licked.</p>

<p>And by licked I mean designed properly.  Just gotta code it all up.</p>

<p>And by properly, I mean it worked once.</p>

<p>Zoomin' along; now it correctly saves URLs and ensures there is either 0 or 1 URL per topic.  I
should set it up so that if the URL in the DB is not found in the options presented, we let the
user know.  But right now it's lunch time.</p>

<p>Lunch was great.  Total of 610 yen savings by going to Family Mart.  100 yen off coupon,
and 510 yen left on the counter.</p>

<p>Boom.  Finished the notice to user in case of missing URL.</p>

<p>Now need to SVN another directory and make changes that will let the user see the new URLs.</p>

<p>Oh shit; there's one thing I still have no idea how to do: the refresh to new URL.  I know how
to do it HTMLfully, but not sure what URLs I can use for the link on our end.</p>

<p>Dang.  Dead in the water.  I don't see how to include the class I wrote to access the DB for
this stuff.  Different directory branch.  So I copied the class to the equivalent directory under
this branch (has supporting files and everything).  I can include the file, but not instantiate an
instance of the class.</p>
