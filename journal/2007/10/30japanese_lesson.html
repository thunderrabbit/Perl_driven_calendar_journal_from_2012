<p>Before the lesson even started, I felt pretty much set to *not* join the class; I hadn't studied
in preparation of the class, even though I had had nearly a week.  The class (only three people)
seemed a bit ahead of me, though I could conceivably catch up.  Stuck with my original plan of not
joining the class due to lack of funds right now, and lack of desire to work hard and catch up with
the class.  I hope I start tearing into the book on my own... sometime soon.  yeah.. hmm; when
might that be?  I've got the book right here...  hmmmm.</p>

<p>There were three guys in the class: Raymond (black, about my age), Jason (freckly, a bit
younger), __never caught his name__ (French, in beteen ages).  Jason seemed to be the best; he had
the best pronunciation as far as I could tell.  The French guy had really wack pronunciation, and
the other guy was saying &quot;ちゅい&quot; for &quot;つい&quot; and I was like, <em>what??</em>,
but the teacher never said anything.  She got onto me for forgetting ん in 寒いんですが、 and for
adding an extra ん in 難しいです。</p>

<p>Ah well; it was an okay class.</p>
