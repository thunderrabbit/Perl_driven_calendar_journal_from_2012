<p>I haven't listened to it yet (available on 1 November), but it's free for 192Kbps or $5 for higher
rates to download.  I'm really happy with the way they're distributing this.  (I hope it catches on
soon.)  I<del>'m going to buy</del> <ins>bought</ins> a copy just cause I want to support this mode of distribution.</p>

NiggyTardust!

As many of you know, I've been working closely with Saul Williams on his new record. We've spent
many hours together in hotel rooms, busses, backstages and studios around the world working on
something we knew was great. This is the most involved I've been with any project outside NIN since
Antichrist Superstar, and I've been impatiently waiting for the chance for you to hear
it. Well... guess what?

The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust! has arrived! After my own recent dealings with
record labels we decided to release it directly to you. Head over to <a href="http://www.niggytardust.com">http://www.niggytardust.com</a> for
all the details. Register now and you can download the record November 1st. Working on this project
was a real pleasure. Saul was interested in breaking boundaries / crossing genres / defying
expectations and we learned a great deal from one another in the process. When asked about the sound
of the record, I've had to resort to "... I really don't know HOW to describe it." That's a good
thing more than ever these days.

A word on the way we've chosen to release this. There are obvious similarities in how Radiohead just
released their new record and the way we've chosen to. After thinking about this way too much, I
feel we've improved upon their idea in a few profound ways that benefit you, the consumer. You
obviously will be the judge of this in the end. One thing that IS very different in our situation is
that Saul's not the household name (yet!) that Radiohead is, and that means we need your support on
this more than ever. If you like what you hear, spread the word.

I hope you enjoy the music,

TR
