<p>Great time at ultimate today; Ami was chatting and missed my most amazing catch, but she seems to
be having a more chatty time with peeps there, and is <em>definitely</em> getting better in her
throws!  I was well-impressed as she was whippin' 'em back to me as we practiced tossing.</p>

<p>My most amazing catch was while running full out then turning backwards and barely catching it
with my left hand while losing my balance and falling backwards (in a nice roll (though not back up
to my feet)) and shouting, &quot;I win!!&quot;</p>

<p>Keita's hands seemed to be disc magnets today.  One single-handed catch involved the disc somehow
revolving around his fingers as he locked on for the point.</p>

<p>For several points, I covered Wendi and enjoyed chatting with her.  She seemed quite smilier than
I remember when she used to play last year, so I'm glad about that.  She asked about my job and
shoeless behavior.  I asked what shifted in her life that she's back out on the field with us.
Basically said she seems to have a grasp on her job (and it was making her a bit crazy) so she's
taking some free time to play.</p>
