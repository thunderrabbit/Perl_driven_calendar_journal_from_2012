<p>Tonight I offered free hugs from 8pm to 9:15pm.  Tetsuya showed up at 8:30pm, for which I was
glad because I hadn't seen him since he gave me one of his FREE HUGS signs.  He asked that I send
him an email before I go out each time.. not sure why - maybe to join me, or just get a sense of
what kind of usage his sign gets.</p>

<p>Tonight featured zero hugs for the first 15 minutes, and then three in quick succession, the
thirf of which lasted for a full 30 seconds.  I barely even saw her face, but she just said
&quot;thank you,&quot; and walked away.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, six hugs in quick succession, including a small girl who nearly leaped onto
my arm, and a group of four girls who drew straws to see who had to hug me, and then asked
why/where/how-long questions.</p>

<p>Then a man named Daniel from New York gave me his card; he's apparently closely related
to <a href="http://www.gria.com/">GRIA Cultural Publications</a>.  He was dared to hug me by his
companion who wouldn't hug me, but was questioned, &quot;why not?&quot; etc in Japanese by a man
named Asan (sp (no card)) who came up subsequently and hugged both me and Daniel.</p>

<p>Then a few minutes later two little little kids (thigh high!) gave me little little kid hugs (no
giving, just placement to receive hugs) at the encouragement of their older peer (sister?) who was
about 8 years old.</p>

<p>After that was a blur of people *not* offering hugs, punctuated with individual hugs from people
out of nowhere, except for one who specified she's visiting from Hong Kong.  Good times.  Good
times.</p>
