<p>Ami was already at home when I got there.  She was cooking as I arrived.  When I came quietly in,
I called her and told her I had just finished giving free hugs and would be heading home.  She was
like, &quot;really???&quot; because I had already told her that I'd be coming directly home after
work, and then I burst into the kitchen!  &quot;うっそ！！&quot; and surprised her.</p>

<p>Big chowtime and then too tired to really shag, but shagged anyway; should probably just have
gone to bed.  Like I'm going to do right.  Now.</p>
