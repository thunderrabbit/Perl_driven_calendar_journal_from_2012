<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  I have just been poking around
with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">Amazon's EC2</a>, which seems
interesting, though I'm not really sure how I can use it.  Basically 10 cents per hour to use their
CPUs.  I was hoping it would be 10 cents per effective CPU hour (a bajillion times cheaper), and
then I would look into ways of putting my website hosted from their virtual machine.  Not sure that
I can do that, though.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Well, I just looked up my &quot;usage&quot; on the service</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They don't offer an HTML format for usage reports; only XML or CSV</p></li>

<li><p>They charge for each instantiation start as a full hour, and don't actually count the total
usage and charge for each portion of an hour.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, I can keep costs down by not starting and stopping services willy-nillfully.</p>

<p>I can keep costs down even more by not starting services at all.</p>

<p>The thing is, I can't really see how I would *use* the service.  I successfully created my own
AMI (Amazon Machine Image), and even included little executable files to zip it up and copy it to
my S3 space.</p>

<p>But, .. well, I guess I could put a webserver on an AMI.  I guess I could even put my site on
it.  But the URL would be all wonky: something like ec2-72-44-35-143.z-2.compute-1.amazonaws.com,
which was my most recent one.  <a href="http://notlong.com/">notlong.com</a> could take care of
that, but...  then what?</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Are we allowed to make AMIs and then sell them?</p>
