<p>Another long day at work: 12.5 hours.  Spent most of the day cleaning up the code (removing
duplicated carriage returns) and grokking how it works, but some stuff I just couldn't get, and
sent an email to the smart guy who comes around not so often.</p>

<p>Got an email from Tetsuya that he'd be offering free hugs from 10:30pm, so I went out there to
join him, but he hadn't showed up by 10:45 when Ami called, so I chose to meet her in Nakameguro
and head home.</p>

<p>Ami had been out with friends and was in a super silly kissy licky mood.  I was just laughing
and giggling every time she came close and licked me!  She chose to go home instead of engaging in
further licking at my place, but she'll come visit tomorrow (*).</p>

<p>(*) and by tomorrow I mean later today, in 8 hours.  I've been up up up up reading through
suggestions made to Dreamhost.  Also determining that in three (3) years with Adsense, I have made
$35.  But it will take 6 more years (at this rate) to get the minimum of $100 to get paid.  Fuck
that.  So I killed the adsense ads on the left and replaced with Dreamhost, my very lovely webhost
provider.  I seriously love them for their great prices, great service, funny monthly
newsletters, and Huge storage and bandwidth!  <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?204388">500
Gigs of storage!  and counting!</a></p>

<p>Oh, also, I noted that I had misread Tetsuya's email.  He said 11:30pm to 12:30am.  Oops.</p>
