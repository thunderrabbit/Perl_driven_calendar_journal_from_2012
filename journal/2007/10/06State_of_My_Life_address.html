<h1>State of My Life address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I think I haven't been writing these as often because I wrote a template to make writing
them easier, but filling in all the parts just seemed to make writing them more tedious.  This
entry will be written as it comes from my brain with no template-prompts</p></li>

<li><p>I've just spent a huge amount of time fuckin' around on my site, trying to get the links to
the earthquake I felt done just right, including making an edit to Wikipedia's entry, fixing an
outdated link to one that's been stable for several years, according to archive.org</p></li>

<li><p>Then I got caught up in trying to get my page to validate as XHTML Strict; I had done it
before on some previous journal entry, but now I can't find the problem they say is causing an
error.  Blargh.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm working for a small IT company in Shibuya.  I'm enjoying being employed in a Japanese
work environment, so I can use and improve my Japanese brain cells, but realistically speaking,
I've not been *talking* as much as I had hoped.  I guess that goes with the territory of being
focused on coding webpages all day.</p></li>

<li><p>For the past two days, &quot;all day&quot; has equalled 12 hours, which I'm *not* proud to
be doing, but I do enjoy imagining that I'm getting a grasp on how to solve the current issue:
basically make a clickthrough counter from random bloggers' sites to our clients.  I'm designing the
DB tables, and the process by which the new links will be given to the random bloggers.</p>

<pre>
2:14 PM The code I'm writing lets the user paste that code into a textarea, click a button and it
    will smurf out all the URLs, then let you decide which ones to change (probably all of them, but I
    figured it would be good to give an option)
2:15 PM Dude: cool
 me: if a URL is duplicated, my code will notice and not generate two link codes for it.
 Dude: nice
 me: thanks
2:16 PM So now the next step is to hit the DB and say "hey man, what's the next code supposed to
    be?" and write our new URLs with those codes into the same field where the user pasted.
2:17 PM Just before I was about to start writing that code, I met with a guy (who comes only for a
    few hours a week; this is not his normal job, but he's the non-resident IT whiz(?) here, and
    definitely knows the current setup of our system)
    and he suggested some terrible table designs
2:18 PM Dude: hahahahaha
 me: and some terrible ideas for how to implement this
 me: Turns out about 1/3 of it was Japanese/English miscommunication
  but
 Dude: nice!!
 me: I was like, "jack, you gots to get some Third Normal up in this shit"
     and I quickly cleaned up the tables (he had look-up tables, but he still copied columns and data all over the place)
 Dude: lol
 me: and was like, "see?" and he agreed and changed the suggested specs
 me: so now I've got 3 tables with 4, 5, and 3 columns, respectively
</pre></li>

<li><p>At work there are apparently a few different companies (including a fruit/vegetable
distributor) all under the same umbrella, and all squished into one mid-sized room with various
squashes in boxes on one end of the room, with adjacent <em>video recording studio</em>.  I can
watch the guys watching the monitors and talking to the hosts and guests each day.  One of the
consistent hosts is a cute girl who seems not to work (unless she's hosting), but just sortof occupy
herself with email and surfing to while away the day.</p></li>

<li><p>In my little company, there are five consistent workers: me, Yumiko, Yuji, Shinobu, and Nakatani.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently I saw a guy with a FREE HUGS sign in Hachiko Square.  He had extra signs, so I
joined him, and then came back two days later.  I went last night, but had the times mixed up, and
now I'm thinking I should get my own signs and just spend an hour there on my way home from work
each day.  I certainly feel happy after giving away all those hugs.</p></li>

<li><p>Ami is my girlfriend.  I've liked her ever since I saw her a year ago as my student at EV.
We've been dating for some months.  I say since May (when I sent her textual kisses via email); she
says since June (when we actually kissed).</p></li>

<li><p>My cellphone is thin, blue, Softbank, 707SC (I think), and covered with pictures of me and Ami.</p></li>

<li><p>I've taken several
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/63854242@N00/tags/cameraphone/">pictures with my phone and
emailed them to flickr</a>.  I'm super hesitant to start using flickr bigtime, because I don't want
to pay more for web services.  I've got <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?204388">tons of
space on Dreamhost</a>, and I'd like to keep all my pictures there.  But flickr's infrastructure
sure makes tagging and editing easy.</p></li>

<li><p>Francois has been coming to work with me most days, and helped me hug people a couple nights
ago.  Actually I don't know if he helped, but I enjoying imagining he gained publicity.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63854242@N00/1494493130/" title="Photo Sharing"><img
src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2348/1494493130_d34da807e4_m.jpg" width="240" height="180"
alt="little itty bitty plant" class="left" /></a> At the Emotional Mastery day-course I attended
with Ami (after my weekend Magician Training), we got a single itty bitty sprout thing from a
plant. (I just took a photo and sent it to flickr, so it will appear in the link above,) (and in the
picture to the left).</p></li>

<li><p>I also snagged a photo of a poster I snagged from a train of
a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/63854242@N00/1468367138/">cute girl on a Popteen magazine
poster</a>.  It was the first time I actually *took* a posted poster that I found attractive (there
was a different time I took a non-posted poster, that seemed to have been forgotten/lost).  Anyway,
this one was on the train, and I was hesitant to take it, but I figured that no one would say
anything (grossly speaking, no one speaks up when things are wrong in Japan; they just ignore the
wrong), and no one said anything; I can't even tell that anyone even <em>noticed</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Ami noticed the poster in my room and was like, &quot;how'd you get that?&quot; and just
laughed.  That's one reason I like Ami.  Not jealous when I scope a poster / video / hottie.</p></li>

<li><p>I started m.robnugen.com/j some days ago, in an attempt to make a mobile web version of my
journal.  Haven't yet finished it enough for public consumption, but feel free to cut-n-paste the
link.  As I write this, the navigation links don't work at all.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently started my own religion.  It's my own, as in you can't join.  The main reason is
because it's called R.O.B.O.T., or Rob's Own Brand Of Teachings.  But you can form your own
religion, if the idea suits you.  Right now, my religious writings are all available online at
/etcetera/R.O.B.O.T., but again, not ready for public consumption, so I'm not linking the link.  If
in a few years, this non-linked URL doesn't work, try removing /etcetera.</p></li>

<li><p>One of the precepts of my religion is learning something new every year.  Dan asked me what
I really meant by that, and the answer is basically &quot;I don't know, but it basically means
don't *not* start to learn something because you think you're too old.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the things I decided to learn this year is SVN.  As a result, I've got the
R.O.B.O.T. writings all stored in SVN at http://svn.robnugen.com/robnugen.com/etcetera/R.O.B.O.T./,
currently at Revision <del>19</del><ins>20</ins> (see below).</p></li>

<li><p>The weather is beautiful this weekend, so I plan to go to ultimate tomorrow.  Last week was
crappy rainy and the week before that was the Emotional Training thing, so I chose not to go to
ultimate on those Sundays.</p></li>

<li><p>As a strict follower of R.O.B.O.T., I've been meditating every morning.  The current rule is at
least ten minutes, but there is a prophecy that the requirement will be increased, ultimately to an
hour each morning and an hour each night.</p>

<p>Hahahaha &quot;prophecy!&quot;  I'm going to add that right now.</p></li>

<li><p>Ami is coming over (3:47pm now); I'm going to go take a shower and be done with my computer for
a bit.</p></li>
