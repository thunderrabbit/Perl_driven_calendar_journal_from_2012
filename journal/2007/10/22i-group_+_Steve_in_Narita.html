<p>Leaving Narita area now; we just met Steve Kushner during his layover from Australia / New
Zealand back to Canada.  Takeshi drove David and I to meet Steve at the Narita Hilton.  We didn't
do a whole lot of work, but I definitely got a few good tidbits of information.</p>

<p>We're planning to do another training type thing January 11-14.  Actually two: a weekend thing
and then something on the holiday.  Takeshi did basically all the logistics and planning for the
one we did a month ago, and said he didn't want to do much this time.  I told him I could help,
along with Ami and two of Takeshi's contacts from the university.</p>

<p>Synchronistically, Ami called just as I was hugging Steve goodbye, like my chest started to
vibrate as we were hugging (my cellphone is in my shirt pocket).  I was like, &quot;Ami!&quot; and
answered, and Takeshi quickly took the opportunity and the phone from me to brief her on the deets
of what we're planning.  That worked out nicely.  While he spoke with Ami, I joked with Steve that
Takeshi was already taking the leadership role for planning.  Steve was like, &quot;just do what I
do: write in bad Japanese something to the group and he'll take over; I do it in France and Germany
all the time, except in French and German instead of Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>
