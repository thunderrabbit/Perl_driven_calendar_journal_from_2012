<p>Basically have done a whole lot of nothin' work related today, although I *did* make a pop-up
window have its focus default to the submit button (effectively the close button) so the window
isn't too obtrusive.  That is unless there is an error and the focus will be whatever the window
suggests, which will probably be the top radio button of the list (if there's a list (if not, it
will default to the submit (close) button, effectively negating any benefits of the code)).</p>

<p>Today, after doing basically *nothing* work related all day, I met with °æ¾å¤µ¤ó once he came at
6:50pm.  We met for longer than I would have liked, but I now have a project that I can start
tomorrow.  It should only take a day or two.</p>
