Hello, friendly human!

I hope you're having a lovely day.  Feel free to take a bit of a break before reading my email.  I
can wait (13 more days)

I am about 5 seconds from signing up... but I've got to have supa-supa-sub directories or else I
will *die*.

I have had my pictures on my site for years (before blog was a word)...  taking them off there is a
huge consideration for me, and if I move them to smugmug, I will be a paying account for many more
years to come.  I ain't movin' again.  ;-)

On my website, I keep my pictures in directories such as this:

<a href="http://robnugen.com/images/home/tokyo/2007/around_town/futakotamagawa/nine_days_after_typhoon/">http://robnugen.com/images/home/tokyo/2007/around_town/futakotamagawa/nine_days_after_typhoon/</a>

I'd like those directories to become Sub-sub-sub categories on smugmug.

Otherwise, I'll have about a hundred Categories, each with too many sub-categories and then too many albums..

Oh my brain is crying to think of it.

If you guys know of a nice solution to this in your framework, I would love to see it.

    Thanks!
     - Rob!

Hello Rob,

Thanks for emailing SmugMug.

I'm sorry, but we don't have a way to set up sub sub categories.  Our
organization is only homepage>category>subcategory>gallery>photos.
Sorry.  I really wish that I had a different answer for you.

All the best,
Dustin

Thanks mate

I appreciate being quickly answered by a human at least as much as anything else.  :-)

Has anyone else asked for sub-sub-sub-sub directories?  Are designs in place to make it possible?

Before I leave smugmug, I'll tell you the things I like:

1)  great layout.  I like the simple layout/themes better than flickr

2)  unlimited storage.  Nice way to use Amazon S3

3)  easy thumbnailing.  This is a huge boon for me.

4)  non-registered guests have full access

5)  nice use of Web 2.0 techniques.  Help and menus pop up (and go away) at the appropriate times

6)  easy to import from a variety of sources, with Macintosh solutions well represented

Unfortunately, there are some things I find lacking:

1) can't seem to move photos *within* smugmug.  If there in gallery A, can't I move them to gallery B?

2) no sub-sub-sub-sub-sub directories.

3) it appears that photos can't be in multiple galleries at the same time.  I would use this for
   pictures of apples and oranges, for example.

As I mentioned before, I've had my pics on my domain for 10 years.  smugmug was the *closest* to
winning my heart and photos.  Keep up the good work.

    - Rob!
