<p>Sunday Ami and I hung out like sleepy monkeys, though I woke up well earlier than she did, like
4am and meditated for my previous night's meditation, and then at 6:30am and meditated for my
morning meditation, and then worked on the thumbnailer program for a some time.</p>

<p>I was a bit bummed to discover that peeps from ultimate were going to practice way way out
yonder (Mizunomoto) about 3 hours by bicycle from here (1 hour by train).  Turns out that in order to get the
field where we played last week (Kuji) (on the other side of the river from where we always played before
The Typhoon mucked up the field), we have to be there by 9am.  Woah.</p>

<pre>
Jei:

We had a great time last week, and we will probably try to keep going to kuji in the
future. However, today nobody could go to the fields at 9am to reserve them, which is what we had to
do last week. See you at Mizunomoto! Jo, Adrian, it'll be great to see you in the wild meadow that
is Mizunomoto park!
 	


Wonderboy:
	
Wow. I didn't know it had to be so early.

How many people have to be there by 9am? Why 9am? I am definitely willing to be on the field by that time on some Sundays.

Thanks to Yoshio and Senco for being there so early last week!

<p>Yes, I'm using Wonderboy, my old name from SNS back in H-town.</p>

<p>Ami suggested that we have lunch, have woopie, then go see a movie.  We looked at the offerings,
and my first choice (Rush Hour 3, because I was in the mood for some Chris Tucker antics) wasn't
playing at the local theater (Cinecitta in Kawasaki) so I went for Hairspray because I was *not* in
the mood for wanton violence nor creepy thrillers.</p>

<p>One thing I really enjoyed about the movie was recognizing the actor who played one of the
characters.  I went in to the movie thinking it was Eddie Murphy, I guess because my mind was on
black comedians after thinking about Chris Rock.  At one point I was like, &quot;hey, that looks
like... &quot; and then I thought of who it looked like and then &quot;ohhhhh that's because it's
*not* Eddie Murphy&quot;</p>

<p>I'm purposely not mentioning who it was because I think I would have had even more fun had I
never heard who it was in the first place, and just recognized out of thin air.</p>

<p>During the movie; I guess near the end, I had this *feeling* that I get when I watch
&quot;movies like this&quot;  Truman Show, something else, Hairspray..  this feeling that I really
can do anything I want in the world.  I really can stand up for the right thing.  Something like an
untapped infinite resource is <em>right here</em>, if I could just twist my head inside out to see
the 4th spacial dimension.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the movie, we scored 20 free tokens at the local arcade and quickly pissed them away in a
stupid fishing video game.  I dropped in one token and got nothing and was like, &quot;this is
dumb&quot; and got up.  But Ami got intrigued and we used up all the tokens.  I had wanted to at
least piss them away on something *real*, like the ones where if you can stack enough round coins
edge to edge, they will push a prize over the ledge (I dunno what to call them)..  at least in those
games, there is some reality being used.</p>

<p>I wouldn't entertain the idea of buying more tokens.  NO Way; that would make me an even bigger
sucker.  It was bad enough to go down there and breathe the smokey air.</p>

<p>We wandered a bit looking for a restaurant, and went to a place I had never been before (8th
floor of More's building, deep batter fry at yer own table, but the line was out the door, so we ate
at Saizeria where I realized what Kazzah had told me: this isn't real food.  To prove the point, Ami
got sick immediately afterward, and then again after I had us run up the equivalent of four flights
of stairs (from Azalea to Kawasaki station).</p>

<p>On the train ride home, I was playing with the math to work out how to tell what percent of 3000
is 200?</p>

<p>So I started with a known: 2000 * 10% = 200.  And at first I was like, &quot;oh, it's the number
of times 200 can go into 2000.  But then I mentally tried 200 * __% = 200, and noted something not
quite right.  So then I realized it was just a trivial bit of algebra.  Forget the percent (as Fred
has often wanted):</p>

<pre>
5000 * _X_ = 200

_X_ = 200 / 5000
</pre>

<p>And then to make _X_ a 'per cent', divide its ass by 100.</p>

<pre>
_X_ / 100 = _.X_
</pre>

<p>I showed Ami, and she was like, &quot;???&quot; with no idea how to solve the equation form A * X
= B.  And I was a bit shocked like, &quot;oh shit, how can I like this girl who can't do basic
algebra?</p>

<p>That was in my brain all the way back to my house, and then we got onto the subject of TV, and my
belief that is terrible, and she was all, &quot;but I learned stuff about Airplane Day on TV and my
family uses it as a mode of communication.&quot;  I was like, &quot;I learned about Airplane Day on
internet, and TV communication is not real communication.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what's real communication?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What projects are important in your life?  What are you afraid to do right now?  What's
the greatest thing you've done so far?  What shame have you been hiding from the world?  What's
your dream?..  Stuff like that.&quot;</p>

<p>We got onto a topic that led her to cry for a bit.  She can't cry to her parents (perhaps her
mom, but not her dad).  I held her and encouraged her to cry.</p>

<p>&quot;This is real, Ami.  This is real.&quot;</p>

<p>And then we hung out like monkeys again.</p>
