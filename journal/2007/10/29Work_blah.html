<p>Long day at work.  One thing that stinks is that I often find myself waiting until 7pm to get
some instruction.  That's when 井上さん comes.  And even then, he seems to never understand my
Japanese, which is better than his apparently non-existant English.</p>

<p>The other thing that stinks:  I'm getting paid less overall than I was teaching, and am working
longer hours.  Pbbbbt.</p>

<p>I'm also kinda grumpy because the amazing instruction I waited 1.5 hours to get was &quot;gimme a
list of all the files that need to be uploaded.&quot; yah, I think an email would have sufficed.
but would have <em>really liked</em> to know I should have been keeping a list.</p>
