<p>Oops.  I just created a <a href="http://thunderrabbit.smugmug.com/">new account on smugmug</a>.
It's $40 per year if I sign up.  Actually $35 because I
used <a href="http://dough.smugmug.com/">Doug's smugmug</a> code.  I quickly admit I totally stole
his idea of putting his referral code on his bio page.  But it was a darn good idea, because I
totally wanted to find it and didn't have to look far.</p>
