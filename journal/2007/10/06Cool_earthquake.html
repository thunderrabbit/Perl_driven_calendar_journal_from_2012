<p class="date">4am JST Saturday  6 October 2007 (day 13709)</p>

<p>Was woken from the edge of slumber by a pretty good earthquake.  I felt shaking along east-west
axis (i.e. I was moving east-west) for about 15 seconds.  No damage, and slept again
immediately.</p>

<p>(this is being written the next morning with pre-dated date)</p>

<p class="date">11:47am JST Saturday  6 October 2007 (day 13709)</p>

<p>I found two maps, but I don't know how long they will remain intact.</p>

<p>In Tokyo area, there was a <a href="http://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/06035000391.html">Shindo 3 earthquake at
3:50am</a>, and another <a href="http://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/06035600391.html">Shindo 3 earthquake
at 3:56am</a>.

<p>However, in what appears to be my local area, as per the &quot;Station Name&quot; (not train
stations, but plain stations, as in &quot;the plains were shaken by the earthquake&quot;),
KAWASAKINAKAHARA only got Shindo 1 at both 3:50am and 3:56am.</p>

<p>I don't care what their seismometers felt.  I definitely felt it and woke up as a result.</p>

<p>From the map URLs, I bet they will be valid for only a month at most.</p>

<p>I wgot (*) the pics:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hp1039.jishin.go.jp/eqchreng/at2-3.htm">Shindo
scale</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency_seismic_intensity_scale">(Wikipedia)</a>
used by the
Japan Meteorological Agency is &quot;stronger&quot; than
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercalli_intensity_scale#Modified_Mercalli">Modified
Mercalli scale</a> used in the US</p>

<p>(*) wgot is the past tense of wget, the verb used when using wget.</p>
