<p>Connecting the dots, calligraphy, .  can't connect the dots forward.  Just believe they will
connect and follow your heart when it leads off the well-worn path.</p>

I loved what I did.  You've got to find what you love.  And that is as true for work as for your
lovers.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly
satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love
what you do.

Keep looking; don't settle.

<p>Lots of good stuff about evaluating life based on limited lifespan.</p>

Stay hungry; stay foolish.
