<p>Got good shizzle done at work today.  Found a bug cause by another guy forgetting to update all
references to a table after he added a field to the table.  That took a good several hours to track
down.  Part of my tracking technique caused more errors, but they went away when I removed my
debug-code.  I created one of the three new tables (Client_URLs) I'll make for this project.</p>

<p>And now I'm zooming off to meet Ami...</p>

<p>And her parents!!!</p>
