<p>Nice.  I was about to make a backup copy of this code before I started hacking on it, and then
came on the idea of starting a new subversion repository for it.  Hmmm.  That would take some doing
and perhaps not be worth it...</p>

<p>Oh, but one thing: I'm supposed to learn SVN this year.  This would be a perfect chance to
support that mid range goal.</p>

<p>So I cracked out the redbean book and got back into it with a minimum of fuss, and a more solid
memory of how to make a new repository *next* time.</p>

<p>Yes, my technique amounts to using the Dreamhost GUI to create the repository for me, but this
time I did the initial load with no mistakes in directory naming, etc etc.  My SVN brain is getting
better.</p>
