<p>The trial lesson was nothing like I expected: me and a teacher determining my Japanese level and
asking what kinda lessons I want.  That was a &quot;trial lesson&quot; at Gaba and EV.  This trial
lesson was throwing me into a class and hoping I could keep up.</p>

<p>The good news:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>one guy said the school was really good, but really difficult (I wouldn't be able to do
anything else)</p></li>

<li><p>I could keep up  (I was definitely ahead of the class)</p></li>

<li><p>I'll go back tomorrow to talk to them and ask about the class level</p></li>
</ol>
