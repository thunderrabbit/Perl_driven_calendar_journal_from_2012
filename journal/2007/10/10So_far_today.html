<p>Good start on the day, but a little bit stuck now.  I was all set to create some sample .html
files, but it's not as fun as I had hoped.  Also, I'm not sure what sample I want to do.  This is
for adding fields to the mySQL db.</p>

<p>I downloaded a bunch of maps of earthquakes that have happened in Japan in the last week, and
set up an emacs macro to help me get more as they occur.</p>

<p>According to their <a href="http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/copyright.html">copyright</a>, I
think I'm okay to copy them for my study on my personal website.  I'm certainly not makin' money on
their images.</p>

<p>Though they are not yet ready for public consumption (*), the pics can be found by digging under
/images/science/  ...... etc etc. </p>

<p>(*) I've been saying that a lot recently.  For my R.O.B.O.T. stuff I know, but I think one
other.  Oh yeah, m.robnugen.com/j  Am I doing nothing but starting projects??</p>

<p>Okay, I finished the basic thing, and ÃæÃ« approves of what I have so far.</p>
