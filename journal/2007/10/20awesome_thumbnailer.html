<p>I'm really really happy with the thumbnailer, though I want to make a few more tweaks.  The
version I have available for download is *not* as cool as the version I'm using.  Hmmm; perhapse I
will SVN it so people can grab the source.</p>

<p>I changed a few of the thumbnail images from the day I went to the <a href="http://robnugen.com/images/travel/tjbike/kyoto2006/Okihiki_log_festival/">Okihiki Festival</a> with Koji in
Mie while on my TJ Bike trek.</p>
