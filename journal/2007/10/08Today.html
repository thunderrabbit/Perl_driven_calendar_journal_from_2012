<p>Been a lazy rainy day with Ami today, sleeping, kissing, computering, reading.</p>

<p>I've been trying to set up an automagic way to download the images of earthquake maps that are
produced automagically when earthquakes are detected in Japan.  As a base, I've been using some
code that was written to smurf web-based comics from their respective web sites.  The code hasn't
been maintained in like 6 years, so many (most?) of the comics don't work properly, but the basic
code concept is fine.</p>

<p>I got it to download 1 image, but I haven't gotten the recursive part to work.</p>

here, and I left laundry outside last night (that was dry as of Sunday evening) so it was all wet
this morning.  Damn.  So now I've got a system of coat hangers trying to hold up corners of my
janette-quilt to let it dry.</p>

<p>I just took a shower during which I realized it will be easier to just write my own little
recursive dealio that wgets the files I want.</p>
