<p>At 3:40am I woke up totally freeeezing and climbed into my sleeping bag.   Aaahhhhhhh  instant
body heat retention.</p>

<p>Once I was all snuggled up, I didn't want to get cold again, but I made myself get out just a
bit to check the time so I could write this wonderful entry.  At that point the time was 3:44.</p>
