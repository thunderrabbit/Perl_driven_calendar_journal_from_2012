<p>Doug is halfway through his two year lease, so he figured he should have a housewarming party
(before it was more natural to have a going away party?) which featured peeps from ultimate and two
members' girlfriends I hadn't previously met.</p>

<p>Hitomi (not my ex) accidentally came before the party was scheduled.  Ami and I were next to
arrive.  David, then Koji and Eli, and then Yasuko, I think, and a good stream of people until
about 20 were crowded in his living/dining area.</p>

<p>The living room features a widescreen TV which told which song was streaming from iTunes in his
bedroom to the receiver under the TV.  The dining room featured a table covered in chips, cheese,
and snacky fruit.</p>

<p>I chatted with Jeremy, who told me
about <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>, which he enjoys (though he
specifically uses the free version 2.2 instead of paying 35 dollars version 2.6.  I *just* checked
out SubEthaEdit briefly, and I can't say I'm sold away from emacs.  Perhaps with the collaboration
part, but when I opened that window, there were no collaborators easily visible, and no indication
on how to find them.</p>

<p>Also chatted with Carl and Keiko, who called herself a music nerd.  I tried to impress her with
some unusual Japanese artist names.  I came up with Michelle Gun Elephant
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takako_Minekawa">Takako Minekawa</a>.  Perhaps I should
have mentioned Philip Gayle.</p>

<p>Within the same topic, I rapped from memory the first stanza of My Dad's Gone Crazy, and Carl
tried unsuccessfully to find some jungle music for me on his old school Discman.</p>

<p>Three pizzas were delivered, costing 500 yen per consumer.</p>

<p>Doug busted out with four wireless game controllers so some of the boys could virtually kill
each other in Halo 3.</p>

<p>&quot;Back in my day, our video game character was a white square!&quot;</p>

<p>We walked back to Shibuya starting around 11:45pm, and made it to the station where we found
Testuya with three (3) FREE HUGS helpers!  I joined them for a bit until we had to leave for our
last train.  I asked where/how he made his posters, and he said he had a laminating machine.  I
asked for how much I could reimburse him for a poster, and he simply gave me the one I liked.</p>

<p>So now I can offer FREE HUGS on my own schedule.</p>
