<p>Woke up early and decided to get going instead of continue snoozing.  Showered, then decided to
do my morning meditation early.  I set my alarm for 7:41, which would give me a 20 ~ 21 minute
meditation.</p>

<p>Just as I got started on the body-awareness part of meditation, my alarm went off.  <em>Wow!
That was a fast 20 minutes!</em> I felt really excited that it seemed to go so fast; perhaps I was
getting better at the meditation thing.  Perhaps tomorrow I should set my alarm for 30 minutes.
Wow.  Then I'll be well on my way to an hour each morning.</p>

<p>I hit snooze on my alarm, settled back into meditation.</p>

<p>Wondered why the alarm seemed a bit louder than it needed to be, <em>shhh shhh shhh no
thinking</em> and a bit later the alarm went off again, and again I pressed snooze, then came out of
meditation a couple minutes past that.</p>

<p><em>Awesome.  Just how long was that meditation?  That musta been like 28 minutes.</em></p>

<p>I checked my phone-clock.  7:38.  <em>Wow, so I started at 7:10.. wait, no I didn't.  I thought
it was more like 7:20.  Hmmm.</em></p>

<p>Oh, snap!  That was my WAKE UP alarm!  My 20 minute meditation hasn't even finished yet!  Well, しょ
がない, and back into meditation, not quite as ego-filled as before.</p>
