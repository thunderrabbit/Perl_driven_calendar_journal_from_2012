<p class="dream">During a train ride, I was debugging a window that seemed to act differently with
different parameters, but not in the way I expected the parameters to affect it.  I was right on
the verge of solving it (I was pretty sure), but then we reached the last station for the train, so
we couldn't test it.</p>

<p class="dream">I got off the train and was like, &quot;aw, man!&quot; in a not-so-serious tone;
all was not lost, just delayed.  I still had the code safely stored, but would just have to test it
on the next train.</p>

<p class="dream">I found my dad had been on the same train, and he *still* had the ice cream cone
he had had at the beginning of the trip.  I was shocked it had lasted so long, but when I took a
bite (without permission) I discovered it had become dry instead of melty.</p>

<p class="dream">Watching a video put on by some peeps from PB, including Phil (who's onboard now)
and all of his GET teachers.  I had put Francois on Phil's shoulder, where he stayed during most of
the video, but seemed like he might fall off.  I was a bit worried that he'd be lost, but soon
thereafter, Phil took Francois and personified him as acting out the lyrics of the song, like
swimming across the sea or whatever were the lyrics.  The video was totally focused on Francois,
and had some neat video effects to make it look like a dream.</p>

<p class="dream">After the successful video shoot, we were in a bar with ultimate frisbee peeps,
including tall Rob.  I had ordered some french fries (along with a bunch of other people), and the
order came up and the cooks were checking off the checklist to make sure the plate had all the
proper ingredients.  French Fries: check.  Ketchup: check.  Salt: check.  Tartar Sauce: &quot;oh no we
forgot the tartar sauce, well, shhh shh maybe he won't notice...&quot; and they called the name,
&quot;Joe Blahblahblah, your fries are ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Same thing for the next plate of fries, but for one detail.  They couldn't read
the name on the slip.</p>

<p class="dream">I offered, &quot;I ordered some fries.  And I underlined my name in all caps with
exclamation point like, ROB!&quot;  And they were like, &quot;you mean Rob?&quot; and held up tall
Rob's red cap.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;No, that's noisy Rob.  I'm patient Rob.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And someone said, &quot;how's that working out for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I quickly thought of a smartalec answer to his piercing question, &quot;it's
already finished thank you!&quot;   ohhh burn!</p>

<p class="dream">Hey wait that reply makes no sense!</p>

<p class="dream">Oh, snap!</p>

<p>and then I woke up.</p>
