<p>I was searching for a way in PHP to split the REQUEST_URI into its constituent parts.  Didn't find it, so wrote this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?php
$path = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
$parameters = basename($path);

// get the parameters into $params hash
$pairs = explode("&",$parameters);
foreach ($pairs as $pair) {
	$parts = explode ("=",$pair);
	$params[$parts[0]] = $parts[1];
}

foreach ($params as $key =&gt; $value) {
	echo "&lt;p&gt;" . $key . " is " . $value;
}
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>I'm sure it can be used (by someone way smarter than me) to hack yer system, so don't use it.
But against my own advice, I'm using it (cause I'm not way smarter than myself).</p>
