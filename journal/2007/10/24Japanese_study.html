<p>I came early to Shibuya to visit the Naganuma School, which is like 5 minutes from my work.  I'm
thinking I should just pour some money into my Japanese studyin' so perhaps I will seriously
study.  Also thinking of setting up some sort of thing with my work so I can shift my work hours so
I go to school in the morning and work in the afternoon-evening and then go home.  It would be a
rough schedule, but realistically my time at work would be better spent; most of my direction has
come from °æ¾å¤µ¤ó, who only comes after 7pm.</p>
