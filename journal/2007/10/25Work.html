<p>The goal at work today is to &quot;add 6 more date-search-fields like these.  For each date,
there are separate fields for year, month, and day.  And for each there's actually a begin date and
and end date.</p>

<p>I certainly won't be typing all those out by hand.</p>

<p>So far, I've moved the existing two date-html into a function so they can be called by passing
an array for field name (for forms) and date name (for humans).  The output HTML matches except for
whitespace.                  That's 


                                                                                                                  certainly

good 












          enough

me.</p>

<p>Shit.  I just realized that I did that cool work on the wrong file.  Well, now at least I know
how to do it.</p>

<p>And <em>probably</em> I can just reuse the code.</p>
