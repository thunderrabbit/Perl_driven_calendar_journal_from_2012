<p>Well, though I'm not a convert from Perl, I've found some goodness in PHP: useful string
manipulation functions.  Specifically three (3) sets of regex functions
(<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.regex.php">POSIX</a>, <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pcre.php">Perl</a>,
and <a href="http://jp2.php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php">multi-byte</a>), and stuff like
&quot;dirname()&quot; which returns the directory portion of a full path+filename (instead of me
having to parse for the last occurrence of '/'.</p>

<p>As a result, I was able to use
the <a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/2007/01/22/crop-resize-with-javascript-php-and-imagemagick/">Crop
&amp; Resize with JavaScript, PHP, and ImageMagick from Monday By Noon</a> to create this thumbnail, by
giving it just the name of the thumbnail.</p>

<a href="/images/mrlabs1.jpg"><img src="/images/thumbs/mrlabs1.jpg" alt="first Mr Labs" /></a>

<p>Even though the thumbnail itself didn't exist.  Nor even its parent directory!</p>
