<p>I've got a SoftBank 707SC with a USB cable that clearly says</p>

<pre>
Do NOT Plug this
device into your PC
<h1>STOP!</h1>
until all installation
steps have been
performed.

<p>Well, I can't find OS X version of the software, so I'm just going to plug it in and see what
happens.</p>

<p class="date">12:35pm JST</p>

<p>It's charging my phone, and there seems to be a new icon on the top of my phone that looks like
a computer.  I don't think I've seen it before.  Now checking Finder.</p>

<p class="date">12:36pm JST</p>

<p>No phone icon in Finder.  Now checking /Volumes.</p>

<p class="date">12:36pm JST</p>

<p>Nothing new in /Volumes.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>Well, at least I don't now own a (very thin) brick.</p>

<p>Hmm.  It seems they can't communicate through the cable, but they *can* communicate through Bluetooth.</p>
