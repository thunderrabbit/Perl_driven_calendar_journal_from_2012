<p class="dream">At a friend's house, watching some boys climb the smooth concrete supports of a
bridge.  There were little ledges where fingers could hang on.  The most difficult part was a one
handed upward jump from fingertips to fingertips.  I didn't even consider trying it until I realized
I was giving up before even attempting it.  One of the guys was able to do it and he spit on the
ground near the feet of my friend like a challenge had been won.</p>

<p class="dream">I got up to do it, but began to wake up as soon as I made the decision to attempt
the climb.</p>
