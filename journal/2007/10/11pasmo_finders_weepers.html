<p>Well, I'm not actually weeping, but I've been questioning appropriate behavior since I found an
anonymous PasMo in Family Mart this morning.  I forgot about it during work and free hugs, but then
remembered just before I got on the Toyoko Line in Shibuya.  I checked the value on the card: 9500
yen or there about.</p>

<p>I asked the train booth guy how I could recover &quot;my&quot; card if I lost it, and he said
it's impossible, so don't lose it.</p>

<p>And that could be my answer, but.... my brain finds it quite conceivable that the loser would
remember where s/he left the card, and go back to Family Mart looking for it.</p>

<p>So I've been wondering if I should take it back, how I can get credit for it if I do, why I want
recognition for returning it, should I just accept it as manna from heaven, etc etc.</p>

<p>For the record, I've decided to keep the card without any attempts to return it to the location
I found it.  This was decided by a 50% choice between ODD or EVEN on the current minute that I
happened to decide that was a good way to decide.  <em>ODD</em> . <b>12:13am</b> done.  </p>
