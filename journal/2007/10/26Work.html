<p>Huge awesome day at work.  Was able to get the proof of concept done for the bulk of the main
thing for today (checking to make sure the before-date is not greater than the after-date).
Remaining are just trivial changes to be made (don't check unless both dates exist, print the
correct error messages).</p>

<p>Also, we had a welcome party for three new people at work, including me.  Me, the cute cute cute
interviewer girl and another guy.</p>

<p>I believe I wrote in here that I work for a company with some sibling companies, including a
fruit/vegetable distributor and a video recording studio.  There are often guests who come in (I
have no idea who they are, but usually either old guys or young performers) and they are
interviewed by one or two cute interviewer girls.  One of them is cute and the other is cute cute
cute wow super cute.</p>

<p>Well, I have never known their names, but, being presented to the group along with the cute cute
cuter of the two, I learned her name: Nami.</p>

<p>I talked to her for quite a bit, staying away from questions about &quot;are you famous?  can I
see you on TV?&quot; but more normal topics.  She's been in her profession for 4 years, been working
here since about 2 weeks after I started, she likes to cook healthy food, and does yoga.  I worked
as programmer 8 years before coming to Japan, worked 3 or 4 years teaching English; I've traveled a
bit, including breaking my shoulder on a bike ride around Honshu.</p>

<p>After chatting with Nami, I met Mika (美香) who had distractingly beautiful contacts.  I can't
really remember what we talked about.  As people milled around the party, I got to flex a lot of
Japanese brain cells, and for a brief moment, I had the superlative 面白い moment of not being able
to switch back to English.  Wow.  I count that as a breakthrough on my Japanese ability.</p>

<p>Spoke with a woman named Yumiko who I had met twice before, though I didn't remember.  She came
in as the friend of a prospective student at EV, and she works the desk of the parent company for my
company.  She greeted and directed me to the interview when I came for what I thought would just be
handing in my resume to Akira.  Her English was pretty good, but we mostly chatted in Japanese.  I
realized after a bit she may be the perfect person to ask about renewing my visa.  So I did.  She
said she'd ask the right people [and get back to me (?)], so we'll see how that goes.</p>

<p>Stepped out of the party for a bit to call Ami to tell her I'd be later getting out of there than
I had previously thought.  Stepped back into the party to where Nami happened to be, so I stayed.
Three guys were talking about various reactions to being drunk, and one guy was saying he was soon
going to open a bar in Aoyama, which is pretty close to work.  He works there at night and has some
sort of massage therapy thing going on.  Not sure really what all that's about, but he seemed
earnest in inviting us to the opening.</p>

<p>We talked about music and who listens to what.  I like to rap Eminem tunes at karaoke.  Nami
likes to dance hip hop style.  We were like, &quot;見せて!&quot; and she was like &quot;やだ！&quot;
and didn't, but I made a mental note.</p>

<p>Near the end, I met a guy who had come in fashionably late and is some kind of big boss guy.  I
don't know his name, but after his little speech, people clapped.  When he saw me he said &quot;nice
to meet you&quot; and then when I happened near him at the end, he was like, &quot;you have good
energy, a good aura.&quot;   Wow.  Um, wow.  I wonder who he is.</p>

<p>I packed up my stuff and as I headed out, saying bye to everyone, I made it out *just* in time to
catch Nami as she was leaving the outer door of the building.  Turns out that we live on the same
train line; she hops off at Hiyoshi, the station after mine (Motosumiyoshi).  We ended up walking
out together, but when it came time to get on the train, I chose the back car so I could meet Ami,
and she chose a middle seat so she could sit.</p>
