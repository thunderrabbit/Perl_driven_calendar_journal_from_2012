<p>D'oh!</p>

<p>Well, I guess I should &quot;d'oh!&quot; closer to when the problem happened, but.  Today I
brought my computer to work, and brought my power supply, but didn't bring the plug.  I use the
long plug at home, and the short plug at work, but apparently the short plug stayed at home.</p>

<p>So I've not been using my computer today.  Except for brief little bits, with the screen off,
and feeding video signal to the other monitor on my desk (usually I use both monitors).  Actually
usually I use th big one, with the small one available just in case I need to look at some really
wide DB tables.</p>

<p>Speaking of DB tables, I correctly predicted that one of the tables that I was told to make
*actually* already exists.  So I will just use the one that's already there instead of wasting and
duplicating work.</p>

<p>On the problem list for today: wtf do we want the users to see?  The click-thru URL?  What about
the users' readers?</p>

<p>Otherwise, the copy will look like, &quot;go to our client's great website at
