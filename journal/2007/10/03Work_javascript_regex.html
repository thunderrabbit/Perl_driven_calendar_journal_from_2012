<p>Cool.  I just got a regular expression thing to work in Javascript.  Only caveat: during the
middle of my work, I realized I'll have to do a page refresh anyway to do a mySQL read/write.  I
was hoping to skip that page refresh so that it would be a hair faster and just to see if I could
do it.</p>

<p>I'll probably post the code when I get back from lunch.</p>

<p>Okay, in the remote chance that someone can benefit, I have made a downloadable
version of my <a href="http://robnugen.com/downloads/php/url_finder/">php code that uses javascript
regex to replace URLs within a block of text</a>.  Start with parentwindow.php[.txt].</p>

<p>Hahaha.  ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó just came back so I showed him what I have written so far.  Due to his brain on
different topics all day, language barrier, fast explanation, and limited visual cues as to the
purpose of my amazing creation, after I showed him, he was like, &quot;so what are you working
on?&quot;</p>
