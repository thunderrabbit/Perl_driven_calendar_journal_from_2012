<p class="dream">Google created a new mode of transportation that would normally be seen as from
outer space except that they said they designed it.  They made a promotiona video featuring about 50
Google customers (everyday web users) being flown along the Golden Gate bridge in two SR-71s which
were being escorted by F-16s.  The SR-71s arrived at the other end of the bridge and simultaneously
docked underneath a mothership type craft which they then lifted from the ground and up into lower
earth orbit where we could see an astonishing amount of space debris, all orbiting in streams like
traffic in cities of the future.  At this point I knew it must be a simulation because 90% of the
debris I could recognize as props from Star Wars movies.  Primarily Star Destroyers in various
states of completion.</p>

<p class="dream">As the movie camera panned along the orbiting stuffs, my attention was drawn to a
presentation being done by the Google Guys at some mountain where they had created a huge power
plant using the water that poured through the mountain.  They had inscribed hugely on the
mountain</p>

<p class="dream">
<br />This power plant is the last of its kind. 
<br />With superior data processing, we are on 
<br />the brink of determining how to produce 
<br />clean free power, limitless in its ability 
<br />to serve the needs of Citizens of Earth.
</p>

<p class="dream">or something like that.  I was like, &quot;good job, Google Guys.&quot;</p>
