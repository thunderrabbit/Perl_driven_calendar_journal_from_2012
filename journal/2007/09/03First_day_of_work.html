<p>Arrived at 10:50am for an 11am meeting which started at 11:10am and lasted til 12:30pm.
Featuring Murakami, Nakatani, and Nakagawa, with Yumiko, Yuji, Shinobu, and me on the listening.  I
understood about 2%.  I wrote the few words that I could catch, the meaning of which I didn't
know.  <em>This</em> will help my Japanese, jack.</p>

<p>Then we went to look at apartments in search of a new place to work, and then lunch.  Now we're
back at the office, and I don't yet have a work computer, so I'm writing this entry on my own.  I
can probably bust out of here at any time, but I don't yet have official confirmation of my
schedule, and I don't really have anything else to do.</p>

<p class="date">2:59pm JST</p>

<p>Had a meeting with my boss, and will be able to start *next* week, which is good for my free
time, but not as good for my wallet.</p>

<p>However, I will get paid well sooner than I expected.  On the 25th of each month, they pay
through the 20th of that month.  Nice.  So I'll get paid 1/3rd month worth on the 25th.</p>
