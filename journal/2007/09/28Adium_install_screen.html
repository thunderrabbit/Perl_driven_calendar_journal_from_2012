alt="Funny Adium installation screen" class="left" /></a> Hahahaha! The installation screen
for <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> is hilarious!  I had had it installed before, but
when I lost my HD some months ago I never bothered to replace it.  But Fred inspired me to; he used
Adium in our chat last night and this morning, but was unable to send me a file.  Had to resort to
old-fashioned email.  And it was a 5 MB tiff file, so I delizzled it from gmail.  I'll likely put a
.png or .jpg version online.</p>

<p>With his permission, of course.</p>

<p>Oh, and for the record, the install screen was actually functional.  Not just an image like
what's on my site.  I actually dragged the Adium icon over to the Applications icon.  Beautiful.</p>
