A T-shirt, once in the possession of Mr Michael Chan, a Californian now residing in Tokyo, has been
located.  Rob Nugen, self-proclaimed forgetful Texan, had been loaned the shirt on a temporary
basis, but conveniently "forgot" about the loan and was caught leaving the prefecture with the
beloved T.  "I thought Michael would have forgotten by now by golly. I sure did," commented Nugen at
a press conference early on Tuesday morning.

When further pressed on his intentions regarding the shirt, Nugen exclaimed, "fine; I'll drop it by
his work later tonight.  But no guarantees on what time I'll be there," he warned.

Police barricaded protesters with signs in support of the T's speedy return to its owner, chanting
"take the T back!" and "No tea for you!," although this reporter couldn't understand the relevance
of the latter chant.

Anti-protesters in support of Nugen's plight chanted, "yeah, well Michael has one of Rob's shirts, so there!"

Anti-anti-protesters had banners with slogans such as "yes, but you gave it to him," and "your chant sucks!"

Mr Towlie, a resident of Southpark was quoted as saying, "I just cain't understan what's all the fuss 
about a little shirt.  But who am I to guess?  I'm just a towel, I mean a person.  You wanna get high?"
