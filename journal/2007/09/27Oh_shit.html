emacs vs vi

g

If, hypothetically, you found yourself s'posed to work on a bash
shell, but you found no screen, nor emacs, what would you do?

I don't have full reign over the machine, so I don't *think* I can
just install a bunch of stuff.

But,

ah fuckit; it won't hurt to learn vi.

<p>That didn't last long.  Given that ssh wasn't even working properly, I decided to edit the files
locally using <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">Cyberduck</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Cyberduck!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quack!  Quack!&quot;</p>
