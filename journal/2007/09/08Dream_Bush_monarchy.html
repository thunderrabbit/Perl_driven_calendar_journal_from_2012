<p class="dream">Some announcement in the newspaper that someone in Bush's family had married
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, so Bush was now the leader of Canada and the United States.
There was a subquote by the wife, saying, &quot;let's wait until we have kids so that the plot is
not so easily spotted.&quot;</p>

<p>(before I wrote this, I didn't know the name of the Canadian Prime Minister.)</p>
