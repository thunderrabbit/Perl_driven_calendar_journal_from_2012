<p>I've killed my comment sender thing on what will probably be a pretty permanent basis.  I was
getting too much spam, even when I tried changing the name of the file that sends the comments,
they would find the new name pretty quickly.</p>

<p>So now, comments can be sent the good ol' fashioned way via email.  It's just a bit harder to
abuse than before.</p>

<p>This is part of a larger project of getting my website to do cool things like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>have my site validate as proper XHTML</p></li>

<li><p>let my images be more easily searched/sifted/etc</p></li>

<li><p>let all my source code be free</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any complaints?  Just send a comment.</p>
