<p>Just called Ami, but the phone died before I could even finish saying &quot;my phone might die in
a second,&quot; but fortunately, I had already copied her number down so I can use someone else's
phone to call her.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a bit anxious now because I &quot;left her hanging&quot; and the guys are all talking
and I'm embarrassed to just go ask someone to borrow his phone.  I'll go do that now.</p>
