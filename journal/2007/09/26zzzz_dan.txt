I know you're reading backwards, but I hope you don't mind a little
background information: (*)

(*) I'm not sure how to make this funnier.  Basically the joke is that
something written in the future of what you're reading has become
background information because you're reading backwards.

Normally (in the forward direction of time and reading) it would be a
plot spoiler, and I wouldn't tell you, but since you've already seen
it, I imagine you won't mind.  :-)

Thanks for being so great!
