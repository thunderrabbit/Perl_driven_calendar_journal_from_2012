<p>I did laundry today, and happened to notice a weird green thing on the inside of the washing
machine drum.  I popped it off to see what it was.  Ah - the filter.</p>

<p><em>I wonder if it needs cleaning?</em></p>

<p>I wish I had taken a picture.</p>

<p>It was utterly full of an utterly mud-filled linty conglomeration the color of the muck at the
bottom of a lake.  I guess basically that's exactly what it was, but with more lint.</p>

<p>I spent about 20 minutes cleaning it, and volunteered the assistance of an old toothbrush which
I hope was not being used by anyone, mostly because it was so old that they definitely need to be
using a better toothbrush.</p>

<p>I wrote a note in English and Japanese and taped it to the brush, next to a new toothbrush in a
wrapper (Ami and I recently bought a 3-pack of brushes for a cheap price).</p>
