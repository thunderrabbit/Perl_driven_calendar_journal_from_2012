Actually, I just had a big weekend as well, and I haven't fully
written about it in my journal....  I'm into personal growth work (*)

(*) Usually I write, "I'm in a men's group, as part of Mankind Project
(http://mkp.org).." but after this past weekend, I find that there's
more available than just MKP..

and this past weekend I attended a workshop which taught how to
mentally step back from an emotionally charged situation (be it shame,
anger, fear, etc) in order to see how the emotions affect my actions.

For example, I feel "fear" to speak up in public because "people might
reject me," so that keeps me from inviting people to come play... but
by not inviting, I've already rejected them, and missed any chance for
connection.

Hmmm. not sure that example quite matches the description above it,
but we did lots of work on untying these types of patterns.

And most awesomely, my girlfriend Ami did her first bit of emotional
work this weekend.  So nice to see her start.

So, how was *your* weekend??

   Love Love
