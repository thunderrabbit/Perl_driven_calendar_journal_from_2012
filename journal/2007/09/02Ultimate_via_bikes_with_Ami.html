<p>Ami and I rode our bicycles to ultimate &quot;today,&quot; and determined that it's actually
faster to ride our bikes than to walk to the station, ride the train, and walk from the station on
the other end.</p>

<p>And it's a lot cheaper, better for the environment, and arguably healthier overall.</p>

<p>Ultimate was fun</p>

<p>The ride to ultimate seemed a bit tiring for Ami, and the way back seemed a bit tiring for me.
Perhaps that's cause I played a lot more ultimate than Ami did.  She seemed to have fun watching
us, though.  I was really happy to have her out there.  She did throw the disc around some, but
didn't actually play during a game.  (She did last week, though)</p>
