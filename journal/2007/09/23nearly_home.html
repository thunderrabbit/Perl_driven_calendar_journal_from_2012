<p>Have just arrived on the train I'll take from Shibuya to Motosumiyoshi, although somehow I think
I've errored in that it's not going to be the first train to get there, but I've got plenty to
write, so I'm stayin' put.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts from the weekend experience; I had never thought about it as just as
important or life changing as my initial warrior training in November 1997.  But what changed my
thinking was our check out, especially after receiving talismans.  We checked out with our training
date.  I enjoyed being able to say  Japan as the location; I project into the future it will be
&quot;cool&quot; to say Japan and such an early date for the country (the first training in Japan)
especially if there are many trainings with which it can be compared.</p>

<p>I'm really glad to have had ±ÉÆó on the weekend.  He's new to personal work, and did a great
job, integrating with us, especially considering the age difference, and especially especially
considering that he did most of his work in Japanese, we got to see Takeshi doing his work in
Japanese and facilitation done in Japanese, and it gave me a vision of a future where we can have a
lot of Japanese men helping heal themselves and each other through this work.</p>

<p>I got some real blessings during the weekend.  I discovered a lot of shame I have held since 3rd
grade when my heart was hurt (I want to use the word &quot;crushed&quot; or &quot;destroyed&quot;,
but we were cautioned against  giving too much power to our stories via word choice..)</p>

<p>My heart was hurt by a miss in love, </p>

<p>Interesting, I seem to be falling asleep, perhaps as a way to not tell the story.</p>

<p>I really liked this girl though I can't consciously recall her name now) and some girls put fake
love notes from her on my desk.</p>

<p>I was all upset when I found out they were fake, but it was a bearable pain.  haha you're jerks;
fine.</p>

<p>But, around the same time, I had written a love note to her and wadded it up super small, and
placed it on her desk, hoping she would open it, read it, and we'd get married or something.</p>

<p>She saw me put the small wad of paper on her desk and instead of opening it and marrying me, she
flicked it off the desk with her finger.</p>

<p>Dang.  That hurt.</p>

<p>During the weekend it became apparent I still have a great charge over this story, and a lot of
sadness / shame around it.  So, (I'm falling asleep again)</p>

<p>So it looks like I would benefit from having some closure with her.  I may do some work on it
myself, or at our next i-group meeting, or perhaps tomorrow (perhaps), when we are having one more
training thing: Emotional Mastery.</p>

<p>I'm super super happy that Ami will be there.)</p>

<p>Ami and i are already well versed at communicating on these subjects, so I'm looking forward to
her getting a bit more of the vocabulary, and a bit of an idea of what I do in i-group.</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm definitely definitely getting tired.</p>

<p>And we are supposed to be in Kokubunji at 7:45am tomorrow morning for the next training.</p>
