<p>At Lawson's I saw Akami and Tsunashimsan for the first time in about 6 weeks.  They were good
and genki, though Akami no longer sports red hair!  I considered changing her name, but couldn't
really bear to change it.</p>

<p>I helped them stock new products and shuffle some old products off the shelves to make way for
new items.  We joked about me getting a job there.  Even though at first she was like, &quot;great!
send me your resume!&quot; the manager said it would be impossible to let me work for just a week. I
was like, &quot;not a week, just four days!&quot;</p>

<p>I asked them how to redeem my hard earned (100 yen per) points, but the system they have doesn't
allow me to just buy an 84 yen item for 84 points.  I have to redeem for a coupon of either 150,
300, or 500 points, and then get no change back for the difference.  Bah.</p>

<p>So Tsunashima-san was like, &quot;here; I'll give you 84 yen until you get paid.&quot;</p>

<p>Awright.</p>
