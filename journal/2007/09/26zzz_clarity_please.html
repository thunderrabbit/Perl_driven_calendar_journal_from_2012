&gt; I started on September 24th and I'm working my way back, made me think- I've
&gt; never read a book backwards. 

Well, you're the only one who I know that has read my book backwards..  I've had one person try to
start at the beginning and come *forward*, but I think he got overwhelmed after about 1997, when the
entries just become relentless.

&gt; 
&gt; We snoozed for a bit and she just headed home. Wonderfully, that entails
&gt; just 15 minutes walking, and 6 minutes of bicycling. No more hurrying before
&gt; last train, nor taxis if she misses last train. Lovely! 
&gt; 
&gt; Why can't you just walk or just cycle.... is it a 22 min walk or a 9 min
&gt; cycle?? 

At the time of the entry, she came directly to my house after work, by way of Motosumiyoshi Station.
But that morning, she had gone *to* work by bicycling from her house to Hirama Station (on Nambu
Line).

So after chatting with me in the evening, she had to walk 15 minutes to Hirama Station to pick up
her bicycle and then ride 6 minutes home.

Now she comes to my house in the evening by way of Hirama Station so she can get her bicycle.

Does that make any sense?
