<p>Just had my first lesson with ゆりか since I went to the US.  I was happy to see her again, so I
suggested just 2000 yen for the hour.  I've requested 3000 yen for subsequent hours.</p>

<p>We met in the bookstore / coffee shop where I got the popsicle sticks for Maggie's Marble Track.
It would be interesting to make a marble track with those sticks and display it in the coffee shop.
Hmmm.</p>

<p>She practiced using the language &quot;looking forward to,&quot; and had done homework in future
tense for that phrase.  I encouraged her to do some past tense versions; she had told me about
getting a new iPod, but having it not work with her OS X 10.3.  She had been looking forward to
listening to music during her commute, but it looks like she'll just have to deal with those 7
minutes in another way.</p>

<p>She told me she was looking forward to performing with Greenhorn, but it won't likely be before
Spring 2008.  I encouraged her to find another bass player, or form a new band altogether, but she
said no way.</p>

<p>At the end of the lesson, I told her a little story that Kevin told us this weekend regarding
the Roman alphabet.  It was imported for use in English, German, French, etc, but for those
languages in particular, it's insufficient to properly describe all the sounds in those languages.
He said something like English has 9 vowel sounds, German has 11, and French has 15...  Or some
numbers close to those.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;oh shit!&quot; because I've been pretty grouchy at Japanese using their
alphabet to approximate English words, but they simply don't have all the sounds available.  Now I
see that English is just as guilty of using a syllabary insufficient for expressing its
spokenness.</p>

<p>Holy shit, are these words?</p>
