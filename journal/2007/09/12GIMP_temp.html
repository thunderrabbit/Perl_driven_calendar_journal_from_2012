<p>My temporary solution was to install The Gimp on the windows machine, do the edits there, and
then copy the files back to my machine to use emacs for htmlification (putting them into a table).</p>

<p>It is my understanding that they were going to but a new Mac for me here, but I'm not super sure
that's actually going to happen.  I've been toting my Mac back and forth, and it's a bit heavy
(machine, power supply, wireless keyboard, mouse)</p>

<p>Wow.  Just talked to a cat named Koichi, who happens to be the president of this here
operation.  He's trying to merge five companies at once, so he said &quot;don't worry too much
about chain of command,&quot; after I had asked him to whom I should be reporting.</p>

<p>His English is fine.</p>
