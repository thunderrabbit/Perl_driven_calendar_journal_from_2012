<p class="dream">Back with Wende and Fred in an old house of the families, but there was some
spookiness.  I was waiting outside on the porch for her to come home and she did then we went
inside and I saw a present from Fred to ma: a book called 1LDK, whcih in this case was a book of al
th available 1 story houses in the neighbrohood.</p>

<p class="dream">We went inside and the roof was slightly mising, because it had been damaged and
was eing replaced, but it was now raining, so I headed up to the attic to put an umbrella where
there was a hole in the ceiling.  When I went up there, the roof was in place except for a few
holes, and I put the umbrella where I thought it should go and then Ami was calling me to come down
to the room again.</p>
