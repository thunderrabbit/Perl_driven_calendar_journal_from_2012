<p>Current top four reasons to love Ami:</p>

<ol id='reversi' class='decimal'>
<li><p>TV-free lovely meal (ramen with veggies and sausages), then washed dishes together.</p></li>

<li><p>Lovely romp after I took a shower</p></li>

<li><p>Heartfelt honesty by Ami, saying she's feeling closer to me than ever, and looks like the
trend will continue....</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overflowing with joy for Ami's ability to share her true emotions, I thought it would be a good
chance for me to do the same.</p>

<p>&quot;Ami, can I tell you a secret?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you said Mariko wanted a boyfriend, I was like, um,&quot;</p>

<p><em>holy shit what are you doing?  this can not possibly be a good thing to say right now.
stop! stop!</em></p>

<p>&quot;I thought for a second that, um, that would be nice.&quot;</p>

<p><em>that's it! I'm outta here...&quot;</em></p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>Tears welled up in Ami's eyes and started to drip down on the bed.</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p>and now, back to our countdown:</p>

<ol class='decimal'>
<li><p>Even though I was an idiot, and tried to relieve my guilty feeling by being honest with Ami
at the hella wrong time, we were able to talk through it in less than an hour.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>She was like, &quot;Rob, next time you have a fleeting fantasy of a new girlfriend, don't tell
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; she continued, &quot;if your feelings actually change, then absolutely tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>That's just what I was going to suggest.</p>
