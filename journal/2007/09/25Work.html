<p>At work I successfully embedded a .swf video viewer thing.  I had had trouble with it on
Thursday, but then when I figured out exactly *what* was causing the { } characters to fail
(SMARTY), I looked up the documentation and quickly found the {literal} {/literal} construct.
Bang: no problem.</p>

<p>Since then, I've been just about chillin'; I've written a bit more on my R.O.B.O.T. page, and am
getting a better hold on SVN, and can *almost* say I'd be comfortable putting a larger project in
SVN (a chatforest.com flash file management system, for example).</p>

<p>On that end, I've read a little bit on open source flash tools, though haven't gotten to where I
can even begin to replace Adobe Flash IDE.</p>
