<p>Ami just called me, and she was like, &quot;good news!&quot;</p>

<p>And I'm like, &quot;you're coming home?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just guessed..&quot;  (I thought about saying Mariko called me, but figured that's still
a bit too sensitive a topic.)</p>

<p>She clarified my guess:  &quot;If the typhoon gets bad, then we'll be able to go home..&quot;</p>

<p>At first I thought it sounded like a good deal, but then I thought about Japanese people and
rain.  &quot;What?  If the storm comes and is bad, you can go home in it?&quot;</p>

<p>Hhahahhahahahahaaaa!  WTF is that supposed to solve??</p>

<p>For the record, she didn't come home early.</p>

<p class="date">1:47am JST Friday  7 September 2007 (day 13680)</p>

<p>I just stuck my head outside and opened the windows for a minute to let some fresh air come
through the room.</p>

<p>Shinkansens are running again; they didn't seem to be running at 7:30 when Ami and I were out.
I guess they are running late now; I think they normally finish by 1am.</p>

<p>After looking at a radar map, I'd say we're halfway done with the typhoon.  If it were a
hurricane, I'd call it about a Category 3.  We have not lost power, limbs, windows, nor internet
access, so it's a pretty gentle storm in my judgement.  Around 7:30pm I asked Ami if she'd go walk
around with me outside.  I'm glad she was game, though she wore more rain protection than I, with
her (my) hood pulled tightly around her head.  She was so cute!</p>

<p>Just rode bicycles with Ami to her house.  Saw several things turned over by the wind: bicycles,
potted plants, and some benches for the bus stop.  No real damage though.  No broken branches,
windows, roofs, etc etc, nothin'.</p>

<p>Can hurricanes/typhoons produce hail?  This one didn't.</p>

<p>Now it's basically completely over.  Overcast with some breeze.  No rain.</p>
