<p class="dream">I hadn't really been paying attention to the announcements; perhaps they were in
Japanese.  I looked over at my friend and was like, &quot;I don't really understand *why* we're
packing.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">She looked at me as if I had asked an important question.  &quot;Well,&quot; she
started, &quot;this is a single bag that we have ready so we can leave immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Oh, that's easy,&quot; I said with relief. &quot;My backpack is packed like
that all the time anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Yeah.  I've got my computer and Japanese study materials.  I'll just replace
the Japanese with food and clothes, and I'll be set.&quot;</p>
