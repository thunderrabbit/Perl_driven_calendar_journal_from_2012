<p>I've just been informed by Yumiko that it's time to finish work today.  Thank you very much, Yumiko!</p>

<p>Basically I have no idea what it's supposed to mean culturally.  Yesterday, when I left at 6pm
(given that the guy who I believe is my boss said &quot;we work from 10am to 6pm&quot;), a
different co-worker was all, &quot;yeah, it's okay to leave at 6pm this week, but normally we leave
at 7 or 8, yeah.&quot; (think office space, but in Japanese.)</p>

<p>So today I was all set to have a waiting game of who can leave later, just to play.  I brought
lots of food and drink and I am still set to keep working (half surfing, half writing journal
entries, half reading about CSS (that's the work part), and half reading about XHTML (that's
something in which I'm interested which I can arguably say is work-related))</p>

<p>But, I'm cool with leaving.</p>

<p>Although in the five minutes since she informed me, Yumiko hasn't made any escape attempts.  I
wonder what will happen when I upload this entry and pack up my shtuffs.</p>
