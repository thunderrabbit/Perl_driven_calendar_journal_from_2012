<p class="dream">At a pizza place with Wende, basically on a date, we were too busy at first to eat
our first pizzas, so we asked the guy if he could hold them for a bit.  Then when I went back to
get them, they had been thrown away.  I was like, &quot;is it possible to make new ones?&quot; but
no one I talked to would help me.</p>

<p class="dream">I saw a woman just getting off work from pizza serving, and remembered I had talked
to her during the day.  I asked her if she knew the situation, and she was like, &quot;yes,&quot;
but she was off work.  I asked her with whom I should speak, and she gave me a name, and I just
asked to talk with the manager.  He came out and as I was talking to him, he became a woman, and
grew shorter and shorter until I was crouched down to be at eye level.  I maintained a calm
composure and explained that I didn't care so much that the pizzas couldn't be remade, but just that
no one was willing to simply tell me that.</p>

<p class="dream">I went back to Wende and apologized (it had been a really long time, especially to
come back pizzaless).  She was like, &quot;I didn't even want the pizza when you left,&quot; in a
snotty way which pissed me off.  I was all, &quot;hey fuck you for your attitude.  That's not a
Warrior way of speaking, nor even Woman Within, is it?&quot;  She said it was at first, and then
admitted it was not.</p>

<p class="dream">By that time we had turned right into a little shop, where I thought we should
have gone left around the shop, so I asked if we were here intentionally; this was a pet toy
store.  Nothing much to eat here, right?  But she told me she needed to buy the things, and I was
like, &quot;oh yeah,&quot; and talked to the guy behind the counter, who had been quiet while we
came in bickering, and I was like, &quot;despite our marital problems,&quot; (I used the word
&quot;marital&quot; to simplify my language, even though I knew we were not married), &quot;we
would like to buy some orange cones for her dog.&quot;</p>

<p>(orange ultimate cones.  I don't know why.)</p>

<p class="dream">He began to get some cones, and went inside, and came out with a flask and climbed
down into a little valley where spring water was pouring through some holes.  He scooped up some
water and inspected it, saying there were some air bubbles, but no visible particulates; therefore
this water should be sufficient for our needs.</p>

<p class="dream">A little kitten had jumped from the fence between me and the valley area, and I
was glad to have caught it on the back of my hand, where it curled up to sleep.  Wende was behind
me watching the guy and talking to him about the water, when the guys brother came out, and Wende
greeted him with a hello kiss.  Actually they kept kissing and I turned away, with a big
realization of our location.  This was her fiance's house, and the guy in the valley (who was now
ice skating in the valley) was her fiance's brother.</p>

<p class="dream">Things started clicking into place for me.  That explained why we were here, why
the brother had been skating before (it was his passion), and, and, oh snap.  I guess I really have
lost Wende now.  No going back.</p>
