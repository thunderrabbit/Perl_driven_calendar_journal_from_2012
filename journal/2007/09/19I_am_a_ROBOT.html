<p>Some months ago, Jesse said something like, &quot;the problem with your religion is that no one
else can join you.&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;durn tootin'!  Who am I to say what another person needs for his/her
religion!&quot;</p>

<p>Last night, on page 174 in Mel Ash's book <em>Shaving the inside of your skull</em>, I read a
suggestion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Start Your Own Religion!</b> - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>This is the advice from Timothy Leary in <em>The Politics of Ecstasy</em>.  He says that in order
to make your religion work you should &quot;write down and defined your: Goals, Roles, Rituals,
Rules, Vocabulary, Values, Space-time Locales, Mythic Context.  Develop your own rituals and
constumes . . . You will eventually find yourself engaged in a series of sacred moments which feel
right to you . . . Unless you form your own religion and devote an increasing amount of your
energies to it, you are a robot.  Your new religion can be formed only by you.  Do not wait for a
messiah.  Do it yourself.  Now.&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p>So, I started my religion!  I am no longer a robot.  I'm a ROBOT: Rob's Own Brand of Organized
Traditions.

<p>So far, I've come up with two hard and fast rules for being a ROBOT:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Meditate at least five minutes every morning</p></li>

<li><p>Give at least $20 every month to an open source programming project</p></li>

<li><p>Floss and brush teeth every night</p></li>

<li><p>Learn at least two things every year.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding learning new things, this year I plan to learn SVN, the prefectures of Japan, and the
capitals of all the US States.</p>

<p>Yes, that's three things.</p>
