<p>Here's a first for me, the lovely voice who does all (?) the train announcements, after a
semi-unexpected slowdown, said, &quot;Attention, please.  The emergency brakes have been
applied.&quot;</p>

<p>And sure enough the slowdown continued, until we stopped.</p>

<p>Moving again.</p>

<p>Great day in Chigasaki meeting Soness, Daniel and a whole slew of other peeps, including Kelly
and Margaret from Ottawa, the capital of Canada.  The last little detail was a hard earned bit of
information as Margaret had been all, &quot;I'm from Canada,&quot; and I was like,
&quot;where?&quot; and she's all &quot;the capital.&quot;</p>

<p><em>oh shit</em></p>

<p>I had no idea what was the capital of Canada.  I could name the provinces, the date of Canada
Day, the prime minister's first name, sing most of (now almost all of) the national anthem, knew the
secret of Toronto's name, that a ship accidentally destroyed Halifax, ... but</p>

<p>I didn't know the capital of Canadia.  Damn.</p>

<p>Now I know.</p>

<p>Hawks (?) knew the location of food and one swooped down and took the piece of bread I had in my
hand, just holding it casually as I was talking to Margaret about everything regarding Canada
except its capital.</p>

<p>We tried later to get a picture of a hawk doing the same for a piece of bread I held up in the
air, but they weren't going for it.</p>

<p>Mostly I talked to Margaret and Kelly; they have been in Japan for &quot;longer than four
years,&quot; and knew a fair bit about the world outside their world.  I gave my email address and
look forward to continued communications.</p>

<p>During the beach clean up, we did at least as much chatting as cooking, and more of either of
those than cleaning up, we *did* retrieve about 8 bags of rubbish from the beach.  It's not like a
total shmell hole, but there were lots of little bits.  I went to work on removing a fence that
perhaps shouldn't have been removed; I imagine it was designed to keep the sand in place.  However,
it was all broken down to right at sand level, and therefore made for sharp stabby things sticking
just over the surface.  I dug up a section about six feet long.  (and didn't cut my hands in the
process, even though I was untying wire and breaking bamboo.)</p>

<p>After the beach cleanup, we trekked to Soness and Daniel's house for showerage and then to
karaoke for songage.</p>

<p>I sang &quot;Business&quot; and was shocked that Soness sang it so well!  Then &quot;Be Our
Guest&quot; and was quite happy that everyone joined in and loved it.  I had to leave before
&quot;My Name Is&quot; came up, but just before I left, I got some pictures of Daniel dancing with
Ken (&quot;My boyfriend is gay!&quot; shouted Soness) and then with Soness dancing with Jennifer, a
woman who had dared me to put a whole huge handfull of chips into my mouth and then said, &quot;you
did it?  oh I didn't notice..&quot; As I was leaving, Jennifer stepped out to pee, put the house
slippers on the floor and then stepped into <em>my</em> shoes which I had just put out to leave.  I
was like, &quot;どこ行くの？&quot; and she didn't reply, but was shocked when I followed her *not*
wearing the slippers.</p>

<p>Dammit!  That was an obvious flirtation and I was too caught up in leaving &quot;on time&quot; to
notice.  Because her face, hair, and overall composure reminds me of high school Miki (the girl who
dated Mike back in my days at Nova), I have a lot of projections and want to have done the right
thing to flirt with her.</p>

<p>But, meh.  She's just a girl I don't know, so it's all silliness anyway.</p>

<p>I'm on the train now (have been for this whole entry), currently stopped in Yokohama.  Wow; that
was fast.</p>

<p>Next time I go to Chigasaki for a Soness and Daniel extravaganza, I hope it will be 

<ol>
<li>with Ami</li>
<li>an overnight adventure</li>
</ol>

<p>Got pics; I'll put them up by tomorrow, I imagine.</p>
