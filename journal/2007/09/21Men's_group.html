<p>Headed off to men's group for the weekend.</p>

<p class="date">9:18am JST</p>

<p>I have enough time to get ready (buy food and train tickets), but gotta move now.</p>

<p class="date">12:50am JST Saturday 22 September 2007 (day 13695)</p>

<p>I recommend this training by Steve Kushner.  Good stuff.</p>

<p>Doing golden magician work as opposed to shadow magician work.  Using our magicians to process
our stuff, which requires a different method.  The warrior likes to get in there, do our work and
go home.  The warrior thinks that if he doesn't do the work now, we'll never be able to get healed,
and never even have access to this wound again.  The magician knows that's not true.  If we have an
issue, we can access it at anytime; we just need to talk about it.</p>

<p>So what we're going to do is process our work in three discrete phases; we could do more, but
this number is what he's found works.</p>

<p>First, we just set up the scene.  Mine:</p>

<p>David, representing my deepest fear: &quot;I'll never master my professional life, meaning I will
always work to make money at a job instead of doing what I love and making money at that.&quot; He's
sitting at a computer saying, &quot;this is all I can do; this is all I can do...&quot;</p>

<p>±ÉÆó, representing my deepest shame: I can't speak up.  He's sitting behind the computer in a
ball on the floor saying, &quot;no one cares; no one cares...&quot;</p>

<p>I went first today.  I set up the scene, and they ran it, and I was like, <em>oh shit; that's my life.  oh shit; this
is going to be some good (hard) work...</em></p>

<p>Then Steve was like, &quot;okay that't it; we just want to set up the scene and we'll work on it
tomorrow.&quot;  I was shocked.  &quot;The magician needs time to percolate; to dream; to see how
things feel and choose the best solution...&quot;</p>

<p>I really appreciate getting a better understanding of the archetypes we use in this work.</p>
