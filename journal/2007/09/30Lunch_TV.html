<p>I worked on m.robnugen.com/j most of the day.  I've got it basically working, but I need to add
a file parser to fix the links for images and links to other journal entries.  Not sure of a way to
keep from parsing each file as it comes in except to have an index of which need to be parsed, and
which are okay, or to duplicate the files for m.robnugen.com, which would basically ...</p>

<p>Oh, I just remembered how to do it.  Put a meta tag BASE something something.  Okay.  Problem solved.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  Basically, Ami went down to fix lunch, and I was up on my
computer.  I decided it would be nicer for me to go downstairs to acknowledge her work.  She was
watching TV, so I brought my computer.</p>

<p>The TV had some inspid Japanese stupid-show with a bright eyed girl walking around different
shops and oohing and aahing over what she wanted, cut-to-commercial, then being served an ice cream
cone with like 15 flavors stacked up &quot;to Heaven!&quot; as Homer said then taking one (1) little
bite, &quot;delicious!&quot; cut-to-commercial.</p>

<p>I found the whole thing offensive and うるさい obnoxiously loud, and asked Ami what she was
doing, when it was obvious she was watching a commercial.</p>

<p>Back upstairs I was like, &quot;sorry, but I just hate TV, well actually *that* type of TV, and
I actually don't want you to watch TV ever, but I know I am on my computer too much, but I like to
imagine that I'm being &quot;creative&quot; while on my computer (most of the time) and when I'm
being passive, I'm being passive <em>quietly</em>.</p>

<p>In the end, we decided to play it by ear, allow TV / computer time, don't duel TV - computer:
just turn them both off.</p>
