image.  Not sure exactly what it will look like, but meh, what can it hurt?</p>

<p>I'm a bit worried because I'm supposed to be &quot;in charge&quot; (?) of this website, but I can
barely read it.  I can read parts, but it takes a while.  I'm hoping to be in charge of the
technical side... not the copy side.</p>
