<p class="dream">Outside at a ski resort, with lots of friends around, watching a little sidewalk
pond thing as translucent angel fish that looked more like piranha were coming up to the surface to
get a chance to breathe air or bite the dogs that were interested in biting the fish.</p>

<p class="dream">The dogs were patiently waiting for the right fish to come up, be they waiting for
angel fish or gold fish.</p>

<p class="dream">As I was looking down, I noted my friend the ski instructor had taken off his
boots, leaving them in the way of the sidewalk.  I threw some snow at him and he instantly whipped
some back at me, harder than I had thrown it at him.</p>

<p class="dream">I watched a promotional video of the ski thing; we would be able to go backwards
down the slope, which allowed us to do a flip at the end and come down forward toward the start
again.  I thought it was a great idea, but didn't know if I'd be able to go down backwards at the
beginning.</p>
