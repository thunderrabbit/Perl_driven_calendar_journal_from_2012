<p>I've really enjoyed talking with Kevin today.  He must have a PhD in all things metaphysical.
He's done all kinds of trainings with different shamen, Vipassana, Monroe Institute, spent months
meditating in temples, and more more more.  Dang.</p>

<p>I was telling him today about the alien stuff I've been reading, and most recently about the
Gnostic teachings about aliens wanting earth to be in chaos because they thrive off our negative
energy.</p> 

<p>He was like, &quot;yeah, it just depends on if you have a dualistic view of the universe or a
Oneness view of the universe.  If you're a dualist, no matter what the traditions, the stories end
up that the bad guys are fighting the good guys, be it Satan vs Jesus, or ____ vs _____ (*), or
vampires trying to eat your soul.  If you believe we are all one, then the stories all fall apart
because what I do to you I'm actually doing to myself and vice versa.</p>

<p>(*) he gave a couple of other good vs evil examples from different belief systems.</p>

<p>&quot;But maybe there's some validity to [dualism].  You know they say that the best way to ward
off the bugaboos is to live life with purity of intention.  If you live life thinking that you have
something to gain by taking energy or whathaveyou away from another being, then you're living in
duality, and attract other beings that believe they can strike a deal with you, saying 'I'll give
you this if you let me eat your brain, or whatever it is they want,' and it just builds up until
we're all just unbalanced.  Unbalanced individually, and unbalanced as a culture.&quot;</p>
