<p>Nice.  Or maybe not cause it means I actually have to do stuff for work instead of just surfing
and playing on my site.</p>

<p>I've got my .ssh/id_rsa.pub key added to the authorized keys of the server I'm supposed to be
working on, so *now* I can actually connect to it with my machine and not all this time wasting
biznass of using Japanese Windows to connect with a Red Hat machine.</p>

<p>These pics represent the first bit of real work I've done here at my IT job in Shibuya.</p>
