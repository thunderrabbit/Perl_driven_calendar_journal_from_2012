<p>I'm not sure, but the stuff I put together today *might* just be enough to say I've completed
this task here at work.  It was to add a popup window that displayed a dialog to search through a
DB and display the results in a sortable table, and then click a button to get details for a
certain record.</p>

<p>I had a slight advantage: the code had already been written before; I just had to copy from a
different page and actually trim it down some.  The only things I *added* were the link and code to pop up the
window.  The only thing I *wrote* was &lt;a href=&quot;....&quot;&gt;THIS PART&lt;/a&gt;, which I
asked Yumiko next to me what the Japanese should be.</p>

<p>ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó likes it.  There's some DB stuff to be done behind the scenes, but my job is done.</p>
