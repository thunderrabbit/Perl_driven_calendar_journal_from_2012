<p>I'm at Matt's house, and we're debating the stories about Airplane Day.  He says he no longer
believes the Bush Administration masterminded some master plan to destroy the buildings and hide
their responsibility.</p>

<p>Even if they did, he says, there's a lot of other fucked up things in the world that we can help
solve instead of just digging through all the (mis)information that has been built up around this
event.</p>

<p>He says it benefits the Bush administration to believe they did it; they're not smart enough to
do it, and believing they did renders moot an entire movement.</p>

<p>He says the crimes committed against the middle east and developing countries are the real reason
Airplane Day happened.  Not that Bush wants to control the world, even though these two points are
related.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm not saying that the people in the middle east could not have flown airliners into the World
Trade Center, but I don't think that's what happened.</p>

<p>The Middle East meets The Midwest brings a set of issues that we need to embrace.  How do we respect
each other's cultures?</p>
