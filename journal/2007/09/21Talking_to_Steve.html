<p>Steve, in one of his million sidebars, said he could explain how words used to be magic.  That
back in the day 5, 10, 20 thousand years ago, we didn't have concrete and MTV and cars and all this
stuff that blocks us from earth and the universe.  Nowadays we are so out of touch with the
universe that there's no clear communication.</p>

<p>&quot;I imagine it used to mean we would say, 'I'm hungry; I need a rabbit,' or 'we're hungry; we
need a deer,' and the universe would provide one immediately.  But now it takes years to manifest
anything.  &quot;I want a deer,&quot; so we arrange a hunting trip with our friends in
June...&quot;</p>
