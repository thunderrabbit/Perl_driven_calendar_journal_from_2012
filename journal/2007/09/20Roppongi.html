<p>I won't argue that Roppongi represents the opposite of living mindfully, but I can attest that
when Ami and I left Roppongi, I was a lot less inclined.  Perhaps it was all the stinky smoke.
Perhaps it was the crazy-violent movie segments on repeat (Deathproof and Terrorplanet).</p>

<p>Fun times talking to JC from ultimate.  Pretty fun listening to him, Ami, and her friend Tama
chatter in Japanese.  Glad to know he's been here 8.5 years.  He speaks English, French, Japanese,
and perhaps others.</p>
