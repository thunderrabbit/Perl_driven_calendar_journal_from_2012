<p class="dream">In the shower area after playing ultimate, and I went into the stall that Jason had
just used.  I accidentally splashed him with water and he got pretty whiney mad like &quot;wah wah
wah,&quot; but I knew he was just looking for attention, so I sprayed him in the face with water.
He was shocked, and tried to cover it by smilingly shaking my hand so that he could punch me with
his other hand.  I knew what was coming, so I dodged a bit while telling him why it would be a bad
idea to do that.  &quot;I won't hit you back, so you won't get the satisfaction of a fight, so why
would you even want to start one?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">We were on a bus, stuck in traffic, and an old woman carrying groceries fell on an
escalator.  I saw that no one else was helping her, so I busted off the bus and ran over to her.
Tossed some eggs out of the way and picked her up in both hands.  She was tiny, like a little just
born kitten, kinda squirmy and with egg white on her.  I didn't know what to do, but she appeared to
be okay.  A nurse came over and was impressed with my help so far.  I was like, &quot;yeah, but I
don't know what to do now,&quot; and she was like, &quot;give her to me, and it will be okay,&quot;
so I handed her over and then looked up at where the bus had been stuck in traffic.</p>

<p class="dream">Traffic was completely cleared out and there were multiple soldiers in fatigues,
facing in toward the street pointing their guns.  Then there was a soldier behind each of them, with
their even larger guns directly pointed *right* at their lower backs, with basically the message,
&quot;if you don't do your job, I will kill you instantly.&quot; I was shocked, and believed I'd be
safe if I took a picture from my vantage point.  I did, and my camera was on super-fast mode and
just like click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click taking pictures of this scene, and then
the presidential limosuine came through with its accompanying vehicles.</p>

<p class="dream">After it came through, all the soldiers packed up their gear, and then I was
whisked forward to where the bus had been headed, passing the bus in a blink of time.  I had been
grouped up with the hospital group by getting off the bus and helping that woman.  Just waiting for
the bus and woke up.</p>
