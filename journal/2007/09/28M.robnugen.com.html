<p>Great progress on m.robnugen.com, but still not done yet.  I guess my guess of a few hours was a
bit wrong.  Anyways, the navigation section is in progress...  I have what I think is a pretty cool
navigation plan, but I'm not sure how to implement it.  Next step is to figure out how the little
number things are encoded on phones here in Japan.</p>

<p>Ami has just finished work, so I'm headed home too.</p>
