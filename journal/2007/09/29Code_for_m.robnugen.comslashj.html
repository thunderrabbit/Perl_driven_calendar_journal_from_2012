codes for the icons, and now a qr code for the mobile version of my journal, although it's still not
fully functional.</p>

<p>Ami is here (has been reading for hours while I've been creating the wikipedia page) and I'd like
to have her use the qr code to visit my mobile site, and she'll be able to see the little icons in
their full navigational glory.</p>

<p>Fuck!  The icons don't work on her phone.  Fuck.  Sigh.  Now I've got to fix the Wikipedia entries.</p>
