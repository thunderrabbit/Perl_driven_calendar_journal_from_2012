<p>I have just confirmed I can get 20th and 21st off, so I am happy about that.</p>

<p>I have not asked details about overtime work.  But it looks like I clearly have a job here.</p>

<p>I have completed my first actual work task today, and my senior co-worker (*)
was very happy.</p>

<p>(*) her name is Yumiko, and she's probably less than 30 years old.</p>

<p class="date">5:45pm JST</p>

<p>Today I mucked around with some CSS (that's the one productive thing I did today, including the
one I mentioned above); Yumiko asked me to format some text she had laboriously transcribed from
images to text.  A little problem at first when my computer seemed unable to understand shift-jis
encoding.  It can, but I just have to tell emacs how to display it.</p> 

<p>After that, I mucked around with more CSS, just sorta seeing how things work.  Then Yumiko asked
me to do a bit more on that which I had written before: muck with line spacing and colors.</p>

<p>Downloaded some CSS authoring tool just to get a sense of how to do stuff.  Also
found <a href="http://w3schools.com/css/">w3schools.com/css</a>, which seems pretty useful.</p>

<p>Then Yumiko asked if I can use photoshop and at first I was all, &quot;yeah,&quot; and then I
realized the answer is actually no; I suck at photoshop and don't really want to learn it.  But I
installed photoshop on the available M$ PC, and now I fucking hate windows.</p>

<p>more than ever</p>
