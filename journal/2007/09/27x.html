<p>Oh, I found out something that would be &quot;super amazing,&quot; but since it doesn't work
reliably is just &quot;sorta cool.&quot;</p>

<p>From X11 in OS X, I can do</p>

<pre>
ssh -X robnugen.com
</pre>

<p>And it will set up a terminal with the $server variable set to the $DISPLAY variable to display
apps on my local machine!</p>

<p>But, emacs loaded up quite slowly, and broke after only a couple clicks and such.  I'm not sure
that I'll try much to get it working, but it sure would be neat.</p>

<p>Only other bad thing is it doesn't seem to work if I'm running screen on robnugen.com.</p>
