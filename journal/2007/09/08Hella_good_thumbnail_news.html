<p>So happy to have found such excellent code!</p>

<p><a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/2007/01/22/crop-resize-with-javascript-php-and-imagemagick/">Crop
&amp; Resize with JavaScript, PHP, and ImageMagick</a> by Jonathan Christopher is da bomb.  He gives
props to the peeps who wrote the libraries, but I'm just thrilled that he put this set of scripts
together.  I uploaded the directory to my site and it worked perfectly the first time.</p>

<p>Now I'm tweaking the shizzle out of it so I can use it to create thumbnails for my pictures.
None of this uploading biznass for me.</p>

<p>Well, first, I imagine I should put the files in a locked down directory so no Shakespearean
monkeys can get to it and fuck up my site.</p>

<p>Basically done.  I've got it in a .htaccess protected directory, which is not perfect, but I
don't know much about PHP security.  I've worked out a way that if I can give it two parameters
(original image and thumbnail image names), it will let me carve a thumbnail out of the original
and write it where the thumbnail should go.  Perfect.</p>

<p>I'll clean the code up a bit and then release it.</p>
