<p>Cool.  At Lawson's I was talking to a couple of Elders who came in and they said as part of their
missionary work, they do community service: teaching language classes for free.  It seems,
therefore, that I can go to free Japanese lessons once a week (Tuesday nights).</p>

<p>And Ami can go to free English lessons, but I don't know when.  Presumably more English lessons
are available because there is likely more demand.</p>
