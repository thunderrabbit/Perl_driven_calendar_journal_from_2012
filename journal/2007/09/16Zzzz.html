<p>Exercised with Ami and then we rode our bikes to ultimate, but ended up not staying so long
basically because it was hot and I was too tired, perhaps from being in the sun all day yesterday,
plus the previous exercise at home.</p>

<p>Back for more exercise and then sleepin' and food and now I've been on my computer, basically
sidetracked after a brainstorm about chatforest.com and how to implement some of the stuff we want
to have on there.  I thought</p>

<ol>
<li>XHTML Strict</li>

<li>CGI::Ajax</li>

<li>RSS</li>

<li>CSS</li>

<li>Flash</li>
</ol>

<p>And I got as far as determining CGI::Ajax does *not* make any guarantees about XHTML (at least
not in the man pages), and that some cat here in Tokyo has made a perl module interface to Lingr.
This is good news, though he hasn't updated past version 0.02 and 0.04 for the base module and the
useable versions, respectively.  Found an interesting site in his links called iusethis, and got
hella sidetracked there.</p>

<p>Links (I'm too tired to imbed them above):</p>
