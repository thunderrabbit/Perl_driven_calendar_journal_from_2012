<p>All day &quot;today&quot; has been focused on images.  During actual today, I got all the images
from my computer moved online.  Then I started digging back into my image indexing code to see if I
can make sense of it, or better yet: make it work.</p>

<p>So far...  I've gotten it running with perl -wT switches.  But it doesn't run very far.</p>

<p>I found this <a href="http://www.roblocher.com/technotes/regexp.aspx">Regular Expression
Tester</a>, which helped me make sure my regex for parsing valid paths is pretty good.</p>

<pre>
(\w{1}[\w\-\.]*\/?)*
</pre>

<p>That's after any leading . or / have been stripped.</p>

<p>It does not allow directory names to start with . but I don't care because none of my image directories do.</p>
