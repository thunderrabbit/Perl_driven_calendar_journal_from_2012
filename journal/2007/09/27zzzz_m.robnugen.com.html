<p>Getting closer on m.robnugen.com.  Basically I'm carefully going through the code that Fred
wrote for me some 6 or 7 years ago.  It's been working well since then, and I'm glad to have its
functionality.  Perhaps I should send *him* $20 next month for his coding expertise.</p>

<p>I was hoping I'd be able to simplify it, but there are so many tricky points (boundaries of
years / months with sparse entries on various days) that it would basically take putting all the
data into a DB to simplify the code very much.</p>

<p>Definitely not doing *that* anytime soon.</p>

<p>But I am getting a better version of his code written.  Now it will compile with use strict and
perl -wT.</p>
