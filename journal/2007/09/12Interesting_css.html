<p>So, now I've tested the thing; it works on my browser, and I'm plenty happy with that.</p>

<p>I noted that the first lines of the paragraphs before this entry are not affected (the
&lt;style&gt; block shows up after those.  So I figured I would write a new entry just to see if
the style would continue into the next entry.</p>

<p>But, as I'm writing it, I know it must: the browser can't tell a difference between what parts of
the page come from what files, etc, so this might as well be a continuation of the previous page,
blah blah blah.  The point is, these paragraphs will also have their first letters and lines
highlighted with Deep Sky Blue, as above.</p>
