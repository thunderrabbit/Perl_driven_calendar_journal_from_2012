<p>I've never really been a fan of CSS, partially because it didn't exist when I started my website,
and partly because there are *still* browser incompatibility issues with the more interesting CSS
doodads.</p>

<p>However, in my new job situation, they have customers with great interest in CSS.  I don't mind
learning new markup techniques, though I don't want to worry about what works on which browser and
who wants what to look like which and why we who wear what where were when while which.  But, these
do make good words to toss into a meaningless paragraph.</p>

<p>The point being, I have added the following code to the top of this entry:</p>

<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
p:first-letter 
{
color: DeepSkyBlue;
font-size:xx-large
}
p:first-line 
{
color: DeepSkyBlue;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<p>And while it may not work properly given that there are now <em>two</em> style blocks on this
page (online), when I run it locally, it changes the first letter to big and <strike>red</strike> green (*), and the first line
to just <strike>red</strike> green (*).  Changing the width of the browser window changes the length of the top line of each
paragraph, and therefore changes which words are <strike>red</strike> green (*).</p>

<p>I think I'll change red to green (*).</p>

<p class="date">3:37pm JST</p>

<p>(*) Wow.  In researching the hex code for green, I found
a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp">list of HTML color names apparently
supported by all major browsers</a>.</p>

<p>I think I'll change it to DeepSkyBlue.</p>

<p>For the record, I've written all this, including the strikethroughs for colors, etc, and haven't
tested it on my site with my existing CSS styles.</p>
