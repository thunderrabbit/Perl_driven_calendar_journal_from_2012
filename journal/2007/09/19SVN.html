<p>I *think* I know enough about SVN to use a repository that I'm about to let dreamhost set up on
my server.</p>

<p>My plan is to have my svn server set up, and have it track changes to (parts of) my website.
Generally speaking I don't need to track my entire website because I don't take files off the site;
I just add them.  It would likely be good to subvert my cgi-bin directory, though.</p>

<p>So the plan is to have subversion keeping track of changes to my future /ROBOT directory on my
site, and then make the *working* directory be what's visible via http on my site.</p>

<p>Then I can have a local working copy as well.  Make changes on my local machine, then do svn
update on my site, and it will pick up the changes from subversion that I made locally.</p>

<p>So far, almost so good.</p>
