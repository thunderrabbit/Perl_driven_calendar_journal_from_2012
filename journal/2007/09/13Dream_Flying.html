<p class="dream">With my friend, who was trying to learn to fly, and a bad guy who was trying to
catch my friend, I was between them, like literally right between, and being the referee slash
trainer for my friend.  I showed her how to fly like at super high speed through  walls, through
the ground, way into outer space, etc.  And I was helping the bad guy practice chasing through all
these harsh environments.</p>

<p class="dream">The setting for this madness was after the end of the world began, with earh
beginning to flood not just with water, but with volcanoes covering everything with molten rock.
Now *that's serious business, and we would have to learn to deal with it, by flying through and
being able to travel despite the infrastructure being erased by four thousand degree molten lava
turning everything to a nice surface of granite.</p>
