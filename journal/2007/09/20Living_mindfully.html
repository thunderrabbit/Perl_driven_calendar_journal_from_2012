<p>I've read bunches of books that remind me to be here now.  I've been living in such a manner
more intentionally the past couple of days.</p>

<p>Like instead of reading, talking to Ami last night while she was cooking.</p>

<p>Leaving work so that I have time to meet Ami without rushing.</p>

<p>Walking gently to the bus; I have plenty of time.</p>

<p>Stop writing this; be here now.</p>
