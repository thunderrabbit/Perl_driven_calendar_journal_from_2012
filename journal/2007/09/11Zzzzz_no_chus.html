<p class="date">3:10am JST Wednesday 12 September 2007 (day 13685)</p>

<p>This is the third night in a row Ami and I have been too tired / busy for serious kissing.  Last
night we lay down for 10 minutes and woke up with a bit of a shock that it was already 12:30am.</p>

<p>Tonight we lay down for a few minutes and I woke up around 2am, and she woke up at 3am.</p>

<p>She asked what time it was and thought I must be joking when I said 3.</p>
