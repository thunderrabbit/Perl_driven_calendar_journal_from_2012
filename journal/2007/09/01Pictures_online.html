<p>I've made my picture uploading process more efficient by not requiring my brain to think as much
during the process of uploading.  The step I've removed is one of creating a &quot;directory
path&quot; for the images.  Each time I would have to figure out a proper structure, and likely
make it match the directory into which they would be copied.</p>

<p>However, I wasn't keeping the navigation index updated, so the directory path in the index.shtml
file was being wasted.</p>

<p>SO, I don't specify that line any more.  Just convert using iPhoto_2_legible which makes the
image file names human readable and make the index.html filename *not* human readable (so that the
directory listing won't be visible if people go to just that directory name.</p>

<p>Before I forget, I should upload the updated version of iPhoto_2_legible.</p>

Hello

I'd like to replace a word in my most recent command with a new word.

For example, I just ran

&gt; scp -r  local_dir_A/  mydomain.com:directory/

and now I want to do

&gt; scp -r  local_dir_B/  mydomain.com:directory/

I can do it with a substitution, but it requires actually explicitly
typing "local_dir_A" again:

&gt; ^local_dir_A^local_dir_B^

Is there some quick way to tell the substitution to use the 2nd
argument of the previous command?

After reading documentation, I've tried the following:

&gt; ^:2^local_dir_B^
&gt; ^2-2^local_dir_B/^
&gt; ^!!2-2^local_dir_B^
&gt; ^!2^local_dir_B^
&gt; ^!2-2^local_dir_B^
&gt; !!:s%:2%local_dir_B/%
&gt; !:s%:2%local_dir_B%
&gt; !:s%!:2%local_dir_B%

These all result in "substitution failed"

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance!
