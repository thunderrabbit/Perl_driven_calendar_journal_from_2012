<p class="dream">Chillin' with Eddie Murphy, eating pizza, we both were grabbing pieces of pizza at
the same time and they were cheesey-stuck together, and I commented how it was neat to be eating
pizza with him and how usually in cases like this, it would turn out to be a dream.  And I was
really glad that this was definitely not a dream.</p>
