<p>I've got a bunch of pics on my site, and I don't want to move them.  But I do want people to
easily browse through them.  At the same time, I know there are viable solutions available.  I'm
testing a couple.</p>

<ol>
<li>Picasa: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/thunderrabbit/Francois/photo#4958902993139007506"><img src="http://lh5.google.com/thunderrabbit/RNGP_7WsABI/AAAAAAAAAD4/ny30IXQLuE8/s144/MyPicture.jpg"
													/></a></li>

<li>Flickr: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63854242@N00/728691377/" title="Photo
Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1347/728691377_743a0f9d6c_t.jpg" width="83"

<p>Hmm.  Well, on first glance, both services make it equally easy to post a thumbnail on my site
and link to a &quot;full size&quot; image online.</p>

<p>But they don't offer all that much space in the free accounts.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  *but*, I just uploaded this pic from my cameraphone to flickr:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63854242@N00/1401311338/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1127/1401311338_c9ddb16eec_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="cellie-0038.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I can't use photobucket because someone else took &quot;thunderrabbit&quot; as his username.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  I've just discovered a command line album creator thing simply called <a href="http://marginalhacks.com/Hacks/album/">&quot;album&quot;
by David Ljung Madison</a>.  It's pretty much the closest I've found to what I want.  It doesn't
work *just* the way I want, but it's apparently got the guts of what I want.  I'll email him to see
if he minds me hacking on his code.</p>
