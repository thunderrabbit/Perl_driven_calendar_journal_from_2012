<p>Got Ami's call and headed up to the spider and spied her and her friend.  Her friend saw me, but
I dramatically looked away, and then back and when Ami saw me, looked away again.</p>

<p>Ami introduced her friend, &quot;this is Mariko; we work in the same company, in the same
office.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;At the same desk?&quot; I inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;No, silly!&quot;</p>

<p>Met Mariko in Japanese and then in English.  Also in English she was like, &quot;I just wanted to
see who she's been talking about.&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;here I am!&quot; then jokingly turned around, &quot;and here's the other half
of me.&quot;</p>

<p>Then back to Japanese mode, Mariko was like, &quot;next time we'll have to go out, but this time
I have to work.&quot;  Plus, &quot;I snuck out of work just now; gotta head back.&quot;</p>

<p>We were all like, &quot;bye bye&quot; and Tokyo waved and then Ami and I headed to Hibiya Line
to come home.  Just before the turnstiles Ami was like, &quot;yeah; Mariko is single and looking..&quot;</p>

<p>In my head I was like, <em>woah, hmmmm,</em> then <em>don't be an idiot.</em></p>
