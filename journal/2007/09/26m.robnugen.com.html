time I decided to make a mobile version of robnugen.com.</p>

<p>Though I haven't been able to test it, the above should be equivalent to http://m.robnugen.com/</p>

<p>Now I'm making http://m.robnugen.com/j, which will display a version of my journal.</p>

<p class="date">8:43pm JST Wednesday 26 September 2007 (day 13699)</p>

<p>Unless I'm overlooking a huge detail, I should be able to get m.robnugen.com/j working with just
a couple more hours of work.  I wonder if that means I should rewrizzle my main journal.pl code.  A
big difference between the two is journal.pl allowed comments (though it does no longer), and it has
some error checking that would not be necessary if I disallow any monkey business with parameters.
I remember thinking that we should allow the user to enter just 1999, and journal.pl would come up
with the most recent 1999 entry.  That all required a bunch of checks and shit that simply aren't
used all that often (are they?)</p>

<p>And journal.pl outputs log files for all the hits it gets.  I'd like to know how many hits come
to the mobile version, so I'll keep the log writing action.</p>
