<p>Doeth!  I thought I should take a second to look for my DVDs cause I want to install GIMP on my
computer to do some image editing, but I thought I could just download X11 for OS X 10.4.</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p>So it looks like I'll have to use stupid photoshop on the stupid M$ box.</p>

<p>The reason it's stupid may just amount to me not knowing how to use it properly, but the key
issue for me is that I can't undo edits after saving the file.  Even Save-As kills the edit
history.  Fuck.</p>
