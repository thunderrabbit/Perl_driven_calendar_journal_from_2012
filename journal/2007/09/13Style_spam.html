<p>Certainly unwanted style markup should be called spam.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this little experiment will only last down to the bottom of the page.  I don't plan
to add this type of &quot;decoration&quot; to all of my pages, unless later I decide it's just the
best thing in the world.</p>

<p>I've just gotten my main css file up to par as defined by CSS2 of w3.org.</p>

<p>Since it's not all that big a deal, I'm not going to set up links to prove it.</p>

<p>Hahahahahahahah..  I had no idea they would stairstep like that!  At least they do on my browser.
I guess it's a function of the number of lines in the paragraph... I'll make this paragraph a bit
longer to try and get the stacking to reset.  This way there won't be a whole bunch of lovely
letters stacked up like blocks on the page.  Though they do look nice.  I like the color.</p>

<p>There.</p>

<p>That should do it.</p>

<p>To be honest, the letters said F S H I, so I changed the middle two paragraphs to make it say F I
S H.  Not going to mess with the C, for now.</p>

<p>Though I may change it later.</p>

<p>The code I used to do this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
p:first-letter
{
float:left;
font-size:400%;
font-family:courier;
border:10px dotted DeepSkyBlue;
margin:0px 15px 15px 15px;
padding:15px 15px 15px 15px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>
