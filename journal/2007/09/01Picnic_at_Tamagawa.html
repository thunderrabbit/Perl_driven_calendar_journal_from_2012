<p>Though we didn't actually touch the water, we did *see* it as we ate lunch.  Well, I ate and Ami
watched because she had eaten just prior.  She brought a pack of 12 cake-like things - pastries
with sweet bean paste inside.  They were set to expire tomorrow.  I asked Ami if she wanted one.
No.  I counted the youth playing tennis in the court next to us.  Eleven.</p>

<p>I put one in my pocket and handed over the rest.</p>

<p>For some reason my chopsticks were not in my backpack, but I do have my toothbrush, and an extra
one.  I used those to eat my lunch.  Didn't think to take a picture, but.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot playing rock-scissors-paper with feet, then both feet, then both feet and both
hands.  So difficult for my brain to drive all four correctly!</p>
