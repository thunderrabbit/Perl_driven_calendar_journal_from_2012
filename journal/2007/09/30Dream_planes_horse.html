<p class="dream">With my friends from GET, who had just finished another world voyage.  I wanted to
hang out with Natalie, but she was still busy with getting people sorted and where they need to
go.</p>

<p class="dream">I looked up and could see some guys from the ship watching and waving happily at
something.  I looked back over my shoulder and could see a plane coming, and for a bit thought it
was coming dangerously close to the control tower where they were clustered, and wondered if maybe
they were not happy, or unaware that they were in danger.  I was wrong, though, the plane was
properly headed directly for the landing strip; I had just been tricked by seeing things from a
strange perspective.</p>

<p class="dream">The plane was old, with wings a bit fatter than I would imagine them now, both in
thickness and depth.  This made them shaped like ellipses more than wings.  The plane was
painted as with jungle fatigues and someone said it was a lufthansa, an old French airplane (*).</p>

<p>In my dream, it was French, not German.</p>

<p class="dream">The plane was cool enough that I grabbed my cellphone camera and wanted to take
some pics, but it flew over the airport building (in this case The White House) and then
landed gracefully on a runway perpendicular to the way it had just flown overhead.</p>

<p class="dream">I could hear on the airport control radio that the plane had made it down to the
mess hall, which was a fair ways down, but I knew planes have a way of going faster than humans
normally do.  So I simply started walking that direction so I could take a picture.</p>

<p class="dream">For some reason, my walking was labored, as if I was also pulling some heavy mass
behind me.  I kept plodding along as best I could.  As the trail on which I was headed drove into a
deep woods, a horse came up beside me, led by a police officer who offered to help me along by
letting me ride his horse.</p>

<p class="dream">I thankfully accepted the offer, and got on immediately, noting that I didn't get
on from the side, via the saddle and stirrups, but from the back right hindquarter of the horse,
and then just pulled myself up using the bridle (though it caused the horse no pain) and over his
rump and seated gracefully (there was no saddle).</p>

<p>The officer said as if to answer my question of why he had offered help, &quot;I'd like to ask
some questions about your group, referring to GET.&quot;  Walking didn't go any faster, but we did veer
off the trail and down the ravine deeper into the woods where the plane was located.  I leaned back
as we went down; it was rather steep, but we made it with no worries.</p>

<p class="dream">The horse playfully took me through some slippery mud and over some humps that
could have been avoided, but then hesitated a bit as the dog leading the horse went suddenly over a
large ditch.  The horse hesitated a bit before going over, but then stepped across gracefully to
where the police officer was talking with the pilot of the plane.</p>

<p class="dream">I noted there wasn't a big crowd for what had been such a well-received plane: just
the pilot under a tarp with his camp stove in the woods, the police officer who had come with me,
and a woman unrelated to either of them, but who had been there before we arrived, standing and
talking with pilot.</p>

<p class="dream">The police officer was saying to one of them, &quot;it's too bad that the size of
the plane doesn't matter.  You pay the same amount of money in the end.  You pay money for points
and then points for landing privileges.  One point will let you land 1 plane.  Two points and you
can land up to three planes.  Three points will let you land five planes.  So for this small plane,
it's 1 point, just like for a jumbo jet.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I noted that we had arrived *not* at the plane I had intended to photograph, but
at some guy's random 2 seater.  I mentioned to the police officer, &quot;um, actually I had been
hoping to reach the Lufstansa plane that landed just a little while ago...&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The officer was still speaking, &quot;... emotions tend to run high here because we
deal with very emotional topics: The President of the US (who some people love and some people
hate), aircraft in general (hobbyists and professionals), and flying (which some people love and
some fear.)</p>
