<p class="date">1:56pm JST Monday 10 September 2007 (day 13683)</p>

<p>I'm here just before 2pm, and none of my hopefully future colleagues are here, though I've got a
meeting at 2pm with my boss.  Ah, Shinobu just came in.</p>

<p>I can't remember the other two Shinobu-level names</p>

<p class="date">2:04pm JST</p>

<p>Woot.  Thanks to the marvels of the internet and my journaling, I have the names from when I met
them all a week ago.</p>

<p>When my coworkers arrived right around 2pm, they encouraged me to come sit at the table area
where they sit (no cubicles per person; it's a collaboration-inducing open environment), but there
wasn't a space for me, nor even an ethernet cable.  They had to clear off a section of desk (top and
under), steal a cable from the printer, and bring in a chair.  But now I'm all set.</p>

<p class="date">3:19pm JST</p>

<p>Woo.</p>

<p>So far today, in the past 1.25 hours, I have set up a new email account sent two messages,
received three messages, and looked at all the websites this company supports.</p>

<p>Lots and lots of Japanese and I'm falling the fuck asleep.</p>

<p>Still no real idea what I should be doing.  Haven't seen my boss yet today.</p>

<p class="date">3:46pm JST</p>

<p>Woot!</p>

<p>My computer was just used to confirm the site works using Safari on Mac.  Awww yeah.  Supa
productive now, boiiyyy.</p>

<p class="date">4:08pm JST</p>

<p>Boss has entered the building.</p>

<p class="date">4:42pm JST</p>

<p>Haven't talked to my boss, but have logged into the scheduling system, changed my password, added
my contact information, and made a note of something that should be changed on a website.</p>
