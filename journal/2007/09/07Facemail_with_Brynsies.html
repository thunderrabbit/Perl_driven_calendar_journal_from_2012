Rob, i did a silly thing and tried to email your thunderrabbit address which is no longer functional
apparantly and then i couldnt search for your more recent addresss bc the internet connection was
being slow so i've resorted to just copying and pasting here...

hi rob!

how is being back in japan? what sort of work are you doing?

it is hot here and i am very much anticipating my vacation in two weeks. i need a break from africa
for a little while. i had a dream about you last night... i was with a pc friend at the beach and we
were wandering along and someone said to me, hey rob is back there, and i didn't know if they meant
you but they did and then i was apprehensive about approaching you because its been so many years
and i didnt know what to say but of course i did come up to you and we hugged for a long time,
probably a minute, and it was great but then all these yruu girls who i only sort of remember
appeared and the 'rob is uu celebrity' thing sort of took over and we were pulled apart and you were
whisked away by them. but it was great to see you and give you a hug even if it was just a dream.

i hope your men's conference went well before you left america as well!

smiles and love
me

Hey Brynsies!

I'm guessing you mean thunderrabbit@cheerful.com .. that's definitely no longer working, but it was certainly a great address!!

Currently, and my intention is forever: my address is ______@robnugen.com where ______ can be anything you want!

I understand you want a break from Africa. I remember reading on your blog (?) that you are facing a
lot of alone time, and that it's a challenge for you. I'm glad you're continuing to grow as a
person! (**)

I'm happy to hug you as long as you want in dreams!! Not sure if that will help or exacerbate any
loneliness though.. :-) Thanks for taking the time to type it up for me!

My men's group thing was great, but I remember it being greater than I remember now. i.e. I look
back on it and think, "yah it was okay," but in the moment I can remember "wow this totally rules!"
or the equivalent. Weird how my brain can be sometimes.

I'm back in Japan, and living pretty close to my girlfriend (20 minutes by bicycle) in an apartment
that feels a lot more like home than the previous apartment I had occupied. My then-apartment mate
was a fine person, but we just had no real basis for connection, it seemed. Now where I'm living
there are two German men (Max and Jergen (sp)), a Brazilian woman named Karen, and a Chinese man
nicknamed Q.

I talk to Max and Jergen every day, but almost never see Karen nor Q. Not sure why that is, but.

I have a new job (in IT) starting Monday. I've been coasting carefully on savings for the few weeks
I've been here since I got back. It's been a great chance to upload many many pictures to my
website, BUT I still don't have a good way to display them all. (*)

(*) I could install a photo gallery thing, but that would require making some sacrifices I've not
been willing to make. I'm thinking of writing my own to fill my exact needs, but it's taken a while
to do.

The job will be an excellent (!) chance to improve my Japanese ability, and in many ways is just
what I've wanted: be able/required to speak Japanese during work. I didn't really want to get back
into IT, but it seems like the most viable option right now.

Huge hugs and love to you,
(no matter how many years go by)

- Rob!

<p>(**) I had to use Google to find any reference to this aforementioned lonely feeling.  It only
appeared once in her blog, way back when she was first there.</p>
