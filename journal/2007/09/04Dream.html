<p class="dream">In a camp type situation with people setting up to go to a protest.  An illegal
protest.  I wasn't going, but would stay back.  Collecting he items into a pickup truck, helping
them prepare and pack.</p>

<p class="dream">I knew it was a dream, and to prove it I killed people at a distance, though it
took some concentrated mental effort to overcome the laws in my head of 3D physics and karma.</p>
