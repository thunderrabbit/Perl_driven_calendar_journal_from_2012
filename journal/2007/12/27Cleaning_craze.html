<p>Today is the last day of work for the year, so people are on a bit of a cleaning festival.  I
helped by cleaning up some pastries (among other helpful points, like writing this entry).</p>

<p>Wow.  I just helped shred some documents.  This shredder is the best I've used (though I know
there are far better ones)..  It can shred about 25 sheets at once (rough guess), and it has a
CD/DVD/credit card slot.</p>
