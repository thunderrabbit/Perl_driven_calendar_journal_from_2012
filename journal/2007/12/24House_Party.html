<p>In celebration of the holidays, Natalia's birthday (23rd), Karen's birthday (23rd?), and Suzuki
√À's birthday (26th), (and perhaps indirectly Delayna's birthday (25th), and Danielle's birthday
(25th)) there was a party yesterday downstairs in Sakura House, and though I wanted to write, I
went downstairs and rather enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Oh wait, I already wrote about this yesterday.  I forgot.</p>
