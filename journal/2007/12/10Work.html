<p>Work work work work today, though I've left to attend i-group.  I think I shoulda gotten farther
than I did, but I got stuck for a bit trying to get some good data-entry checks going.  Had to scale
back my plans..  for some reason I was not able to check for alphanumeric entry on two different
fields.  I just couldn't get the preg_match to work.  I'm sure it was something trivial I missed.
Now the check is simply on the length of the field.  I'm not too worried; the data is being sent
through hidden fields, checked for validity against a DB, so I don't think they can get *very* far,
and the data I'm protecting is pretty much a list of bloggers' URLs, and I'm sure they would love to
get extra hits.  So who cares.. but it was the point of testing that I was trying to test.</p>

<p>I'm a bit concerned about my novel; I haven't written shit in a few days.  I think I'll skip
free hugs tonight and just go home and hopefully write.  We'll see.</p>
