<p>Went down to breakfat with the other CDF.  The</p>

<p>point is, she was all, 和食は大丈夫ですか？</p>

<p>And I slathered her with たてまえ：「おおお和食がいいいいですよね」</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Basically, translated: &quot;is Japanese food okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhhh, Japanese food is sooooooo goooooood.&quot;</p>

<p>WTF(*) is she asking me if I can eat Japanese food?  Am I not in Japan?  Am I not in a Japanese
restaurant?  What if I said &quot;no&quot; would she have brought out a big slab of cow for me?</p>

<p>Racism is a good thing for me to experience.  It certainly helps me be aware of my own
projections on people I see.</p>

<p>(*)Why, not What.</p>
