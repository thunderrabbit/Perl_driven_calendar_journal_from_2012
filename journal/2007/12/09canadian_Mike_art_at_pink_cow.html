<p>After ultimate, good times at The Pink Cow where we saw Mike's art.  Lots of cats and a duck and
rhinoceros.</p>

<p>I match-made Jason Collin and Gennie with a G; they are going to live in Hawaii and he's going
to be her house husband.  I'm a bit envious, but only in theory.  I sorta doubt it will come to
fruition, but if it does, they said I can come visit.</p>

<p>Ami threw Francois; I thought it was because she was mad that I put my harm around Gennie, but
it seems I was associating too much with history.</p>

<p>Talked to Tracie; I may put my art in there some time.</p>
