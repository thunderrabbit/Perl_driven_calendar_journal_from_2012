<p>jQuery seems pretty awesome, though I haven't yet found a succinct guide to all its functions.
I like to learn programming languages by looking up function descriptions and example usages.</p>

<p>I'm working on the new project (similar to chatbotchats, but not that one, the other one).. just
trying to get the login form to work the way I want.  And I'm not even talking about DB stuff yet. I
think I might be going about this in a too detailed way before I have a big map from which to work.
Sigh.</p>
