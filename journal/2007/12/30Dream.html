<p class="dream">train ride was cold, and I had no jacket.  But it wasn't that cold.</p>

<p class="dream">as I arrived at the party, I noticed I had a pimple right under my eye, but I went
in and was surpised to see everyone sitting around like slugs.  I was like, &quot;hello
party!!&quot; and they were like, &quot;there's no party...&quot; and I'm like, &quot;what are you
talking about?  We can have a great party!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">There were cups and drinks available, but untouched, music on in one side of the
room.  Weird that they were bummed.  But I was like, &quot;first, I gotta go to the restroom and
see about this zit.&quot;</p>

<p>I woke up and no zit.  Nice.</p>
