<p>I remember two dream snippets from this morning:</p>

<p class="dream">In a car with Fred driving, we were headed to meet Dude.  Fred was on the cellie
with Dude, and I asked him to ask Dude to bring his golf driver because I had a golf ball
that... and Fred said Dude asked if he should bring a box of balls, and I was like, &quot;no,&quot;
and Fred handed me the phone.</p>

<p class="dream">I was all, &quot;hey Dude, yeah, I just wanted you to bring your driver; I've got
a golf ball with the white cover peeled off; I wanted to record it exploding into a bunch of
rubberbands and put that shit on youtube.  Nah; don't worry about bringing another box: I don't
actually want to play.&quot;</p>

<p>I wanted to write down the dream, and I remembered I <em>should</em> be writing my novel
instead, and I decided &quot;fuckit; I'm going to shift my goal from 2000 words per day to 1000
words per day.  No wait; 2000 words per day <em>including what I write in my journal</em>.  That
way my journal won't have to suffer while I'm noveling.</p>

<p>Fell asleep again.</p>

<p class="dream">At a bank with Ami, wanting to open a new account.  Ami asked the woman at the
counter for a new account form, and I got
my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seal_%28Chinese%29&oldid=168490487#Japanese_usage">hanko</a>
ready to stamp,</p>

<p>but woke up before I could use it.</p>
