<p>I was determined to sit (and sleep) on the way home, so I skipped an express and local train (on
which no seats were available in the back) so I could get a seat on the next local train.  I took
off my glasses and had just hung them in my shirt color when a bright red blob sat down with a sigh
next to me.  I opened my eyes and noted the blob had long sparkly fingernails and blonde hair.
Hmmm; this could be interesting enough to *not* sleep on the way home.</p>

<p>There actually was something interesting: in addition to the normal cutsey glittery dangly
bobbles, she had some sort of reusable charger dongle hanging from her phone.  I watched as she
deftly texted out a message using just one hand to hold the phone and the pad of her thumb to tap
out the letters.  Her nails were way too long to use the fingertips.  She noted me staring, and she
looked over at me.  I looked up at her and we locked eyes for what would normally be an
uncomfortable amount of time (for me), but I didn't look away; I was like, &quot;こんにちは&quot;
and she goes, &quot;こんにちは&quot;　　And I was like, [how many times can you use that
charger?]</p>

<p>[oh, this?]</p>

<p>[yeah]</p>

<p>[well,] and she blurted out a long explanation of which I got basically nothing, but I had
already made some guesses about the function of the charger, so I assumed that what she had just
told me, so I asked her, [so you charge the charger here?] I asked; indicating its female
adapter.</p>

<p>[yeah, pretty convenient, isn't it?]</p>

<p>[pretty cool.]</p>

<p>[where did you buy it?]</p>

<p>[at a cellphone shop in Shibuya.]</p>

<p>Though the answer to that was pretty obvious, I was glad that I actually did understand her.</p>

<p>That was the end of our conversation until it was time for me to hop off the train.  I
considered pulling out my cellphone as a conversation piece (and to disclose Ami); I could have
told her that I just went to get a replacement charger today, in fact.  It was genuinely good
timing that I was introduced to this type of charger.  I thought about asking her if the wall
adapter charged the charger and the phone at the same time (would make ultimate sense)..  In the
end I just said nothing until my station.</p>

<p>In the brief final conversation she said she was getting off at Yokohama, at which I asked why
she hadn't taken a faster train (that is the last station on the line, so by definition all trains
stop there), and she said it was cause her feet hurt from work.  She took it to the next level and
said she works at __________ in _________.  Hmmm; now I can stalk her if I want.</p>
