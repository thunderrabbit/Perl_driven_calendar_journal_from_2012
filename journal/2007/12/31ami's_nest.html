<p>Ami's parentals are on Kyushu (different island) for the transition to 2008, so Ami invited me
to her house where she would have an oven with which she could cook lasagna!!!!</p>

<p>The lasagna was great great great and featured pumpkin and れんこん, the name of which I forgot
in English.  It's the white tube vegetable that slices into wagon wheels.  Lotus root, according to <a href="http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1MUJ%E3%82%8C%E3%82%93%E3%81%93%E3%82%93">Jim Breen</a>.</p>

<p>While she cooked, I worked on getting freakauth installed on my codeigniter installation..  If I
don't get it finished pretty soon, I may give up on it.  Actually I *think* I'm just one step away:
get the captcha to work.</p>
