<p>At a bit after 5am I woke up with an oh shit feeling.  Lights on, glasses on, lumpy teeth.... <em>oh
shit; what time is it?</em>.  Just after 5am.  I flossed, brushed, peed, bit down on my mouthguard.  Now
I'm going to bite down on some writing.</p>

<p>I rememember the last thing I did was turn off my meditation alarm, which woke me up after I
hung up with Ami.</p>

<p>Interesting!: Last night I wrote for exactly one hour (the timestamp of the last save is 12:00am,
and the first save is 11:00pm.</p>

<p>During that time, I wrote 856 words.  I think the time includes walking from Motosumiyoshi to
home and eating a bowl of granola.</p>
