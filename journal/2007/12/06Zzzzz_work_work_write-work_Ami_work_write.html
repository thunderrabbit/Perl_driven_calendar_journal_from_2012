<p>Pretty tired; headed home  from work now; was basically there for 13 hours.  Tried going to
Shakey's after the meeting today but Shakey's coses for lunch at 4:30; i had arrived at 4:40.  I
know Japan well enough to know it wuld be useless to try and oconvince them.

<p>Last night  was a terrific blessing; Ami went to Mark and Yoko's place to see their new baby, so
I went over as well; I like Mark, and Yoko is quite cool for a girl (haha) and what a surprise to
find Mark's mom there totally feeding us like more food than imaginaable.  Wowowowowow  So
great. So so great.  Mark was lie, &quot;yeah, so areyou coming over for Chistmas dinner?&quot;
and I was like hells yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Got hom and rode Ami thehn gaver her a ride home or to the station and then back to my crib and
wrote; trying to catch up with my goal of writing 2000 words per day this month.  Working on a
novel for Castle of Dreams.  I finally did get caught up to 10052 words, but now I'm behind again
today  I have written I htink 400 words while on the train here, but I'm tired as something that
too tired to think of how tired I am, and I don't know that I can write much more.</p>

<p>Plus it's freezing as fuck and not so good for the ol' desir to stay awake..  Just want to curl
up and melt away in covers or even better a warm bath or ocean.</p>

<p>Got ppissed as shit t my computer at the end of the day today.  Basically I've got</p>

<p>okay, no basically.  I have all my songs stored on Amazong A3,.  I mean all my itunes songs.  I
was happily listening today on headhhpnes (part of the reason i was able to stay so focused for so
long) and it was all good, and THEN the internet went out.  Okay, fair enough.  The tubes leak
sometimes and things fall out.  Fine.

BUT iTunes kept trying to find songs online and when it couldn't find the internet connection,
assumed the song was gone and put a little (!) icon next to the song.   And it won't fucking tri to
play that song again until the icon goes away.  How to get that idcon to go?

Fastest method i've found is  super manual and shitty, basically hitting</p>

hittlng alt-R to reveal the song in the finder, but then I have a finder window in my face, so I
have to hit either option W to get rid of it and then option tab to get back to iTunes, or skip
otptoption w and get a tack of fuding  finder windws in the way until I clearn them all out.

I can't sort on that feield, and I can't find a way to hit the DB; there is a  there is an XML file
, but it is apparently read from a DB that I can't find or is binary.  fucking pissed me off like
fuck

<p>But the good news: as soon as I get out of Motosumiyoshi station, Ami called me and said Nambu
line is fucked up so she can't use it. so she is going to use Motosumiyoshi, so I was like,
&quot;I'll wait foryou. in the ramen shop.</p>

<p>Got my ramen, but it's not a flavor I want.  I don't know how she finds the awesomest ramen for
me.  I'm going to save this for her I hope it doesn't get too cold before she gets here; she was in
Nakameguro when she called me. and then I'll have her show me what one she always orders for me.</p>

<p>The orders are done though a vending machine and there are no pictures on the buttons so I never
remember which one.  haven't really tried, cause she's always been here when I'm here.</p>
