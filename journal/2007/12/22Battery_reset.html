<p>Okay, I'm running a white MacBook 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo, and my battery said 86% and the
machine just powered off.  No sleep, no warning, just off.</p>

<p>I looked over and my power cord was unplugged from the wall.  I hadn't noticed that detail.
Ooops.  But 86%!</p>

<p>I thought this would be a good time to do a battery reset:  I unplugged the computer, removed
the battery, pressed the power button for 5 seconds.  And by 5 seconds I mean five times for about
10 to 20 seconds each.</p>

<p>Put the battery back in, (did *not* plug in the power), and turned it on.  It powered on no
problem, and the battery reported 85%.</p>

<p>Now the battery is reporting 80%, which sucks balls for sure, but it's proof (to me) that the
battery reset did *something*.</p>

<p>OTOH, I had a couple of Apps open before the (*)</p>

<p>(*) I was going to say before the first power off, but it powered off again (at 79% battery).</p>

<p>So though the reset works (a little bit), it didn't work very well for me.</p>

<p>I did a series of power-ons with no battery resets, and power-ons with resets to see what would
happen in various cases.  Summary: resets helped a little bit, but the battery still sucks.</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No reset</p></li>

<li><p>died before I could enter my login credentials</p></li>

<li><p>No reset</p></li>

<li><p>died just as login window came up</p></li>

<li><p>reset 30 seconds</p></li>

<li><p>login screen stable for a minute, then the monitor powered off and the sleep light came on,
but the HD was still whirring.</p></li>

<li><p>I waited a bit to see if it would put the HD to sleep or die first, but I was too eager to
get this little experiment finished so I can write it down and work on my novel.</p></li>

<li><p>logged in and it died as I was jotting down (on paper) that I had been using a USB-powered
optical mouse at the time of the first power-off and had just plugged it in.  (i.e. it dies after
about 2 minutes of being on, just around the time that the top bar was being filled with icons after
I had logged in)</p></li>

<li><p>No reset, power on to see if I could check the battery status.</p></li>

<li><p>entered my login credentials, but it died before the top bar could be filled in</p></li>

<li><p>reset 15 seconds</p></li>

<li><p>logged in without plugging in the mouse</p></li>

<li><p>71% battery reported and then dead before anything else</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that was a fun little waste of time, but it provided a long (though boring) journal
entry.</p>

<p>Going to work on my novel now.</p>
