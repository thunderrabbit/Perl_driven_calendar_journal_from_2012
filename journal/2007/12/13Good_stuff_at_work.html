<p>Rocked in to work a <em>bit</em> early, and have completed the project on which I've been
working for the last couple weeks.  I'm using present perfect because I still need to get final
approval from some people who aren't currently here.  So for now I'm chillin'; I think I'll write
an SoML.</p>
