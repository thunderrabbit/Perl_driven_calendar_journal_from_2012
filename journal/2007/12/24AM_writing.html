<p>41186 words now.  Just 1259.14285714 per day and I can finish by the end of the 30th.</p>

<p>There's another party going on downstairs.  I don't really want to go, but I will.</p>

<p>Hmmm..  good times.  Met Manami, a friend of the Suzukis who lives in Tsurumi.  She asked if I
was Christian (to make conversation?) and the whole table joined in on that way.  Natalia and I were
like &quot;no way&quot; for the same basic reasons, and Juergen and Fatima were describing their
beliefs.  Pretty interesting.  I got the sense that Manami was Christian, though she didn't actually
say this; I'm sure it's mostly just me stereotyping people who ask, &quot;are you
Christian?&quot;</p>

<p>Natalia and I decided to be bad so we can become animals next lifetime and therefore be monkeys
and preen each other all day and climb around and play in trees.  How lovely would that be!</p>
