<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p>I have just come to a very shocking and embarrassing moment in my life.</p>

<p>&quot;hampster&quot; should be spelled as &quot;hamster&quot;</p>

<p>I may have known that before, but I would have given the wrong answer if asked just a few
minutes ago.</p>

<p>Just want to write it down so I'm less likely to forget again.</p>

.......................this isn't a very comprehensive entry- I think you owe more to the loyal
reader of robnugen.com, on a lighter note (but bloody important) I'd like to wish you an exquisite
yuletide. I've said it before, and I'll say it again- you are a top man Rob and I look at you like I
would a brother. And, I'm the biggest robnugen.com fan bar NONE.

<p>It all started with reading an article on wired.com.  I was happily reading misspellings of
hamster.  Then I came down to the comments from the peanut gallery.</p>

<p>'<a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/12/macgyver-scienc.html#comment-92356076">&quot;Hampster&quot;?</a>'</p>

<p>And I was like, &quot;yeah, what of it?&quot;</p>

<p>I read a bit further: &quot;<a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/12/macgyver-scienc.html#comment-92357452">way
to know how to spell chris</a>,&quot; from a guy with no shift nor punctuation on his keyboard, and I was
like, &quot;hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>And then, and then... &quot;<a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/12/macgyver-scienc.html#comment-92376712">Hampsters
are people who live in the Hamptons.</a>&quot; and then it began to dawn on me.  Something was amiss.</p>

<p>Quickly, Rob N, to Wikipedia!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampster">The word is rather frequently misspelled as
"hampster". This may have been popularized by The Hampster Dance meme.</a></p>

<p>STUPID HAMPSTER DANCE!!!!</p>

<p>Super special thanks to Dan for encouraging me to flesh out this important moment in my life.</p>

<p>And a bonus from the peanut gallery, which I found while writing this extended version of the
entry:</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/12/macgyver-scienc.html#comment-92394852">Or
maybe I should say cation.</a>&quot;</p>
