<p>Shockingly obtuse day of programming at work.  I don't even know if that word works for this,
but I've spent way way way hella too much time on this problem for what it's worth.  I'm sick sick
of this crap and I don't want to go any further with it.  The bummer thing is that I had it working
better at one point, but I realized that was a bad way to code it (it allowed editing of a field
during a view) so I moved the code and the shit has just collapsed into a pile of shit-code that my
tired brain can't recover right now.</p>

<p>The other bummer thing is that I didn't show ÃæÃ«¤µ¤ó what I had, and I didn't save a snapshot
at that point, so fuck I have no proof that I did anything worthwhile today.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>
