<p>Kicked off the New Year with frozen ice cream and a hot shower.  Pounding water on my back and
the same verb for Ami.  Nice to be able to be a bit loud, what with all the other festivities going
on around the city.</p>

<p>The ice cream was great.  White chocolate center with vanilla ice cream around it and then white
chocolate shell with little light crunchies on the outside.   So so so yummy!</p>
