<p>Ami slept through the party, but I gently woke her up with the reminder that she wanted to go
shoppin' for Yuko (Noah (Mark)) tomorrow.  We headed out to the gentle frenzy of Kawasaki station
and she got a white bib that says milk on it and a matching body suit.  I found some cool tumbler
cups that were unbreakable, chewable, stackable, useable (for drinking purposes), and visually
interesting (with plastic bits inside that would shake around).  I was ready to get them, but while
in line (oh what a line (though it moved quickly; all 14 registers were open)) I realized I was
wrong about one of the abilities listed above.  There were little holes on the bottom of the cups.
I took a picture to show Mark I was thinking of his tyke, but not going to put more useless plastic
into <a href="http://storyofstuff.com">the stream</a>.</p>
