<p>Free Hugs tonight, for the first time in a long time (like a few weeks or a month).  I was a bit
surprised to find Tetsuya there (in a santa outfit) and a posse of elves (not in outfits) and a
reindeer outfitted guy.  I joined them and it was all fun for a bit, but they seemed more focused
on <em>soliciting</em> hugs and seeking people wose birthday was within the previous or next six
months so they could sing and they were loud etc, so I just left.  I prefer to be the lone hugger
(as if it was my idea and as if I made the sign (it wasn't, and I didn't)).</p>

<p>During their songs, I tried to carefully keep focused on the standing wave of passing people so I
could give hugs as needed, and I was happy to find some people who needed hugs and not singing.  I
dunno if needed is the right word, but they hugged me and none of the rest, and left without a
song.</p>

<p>Anyway.. interesting that I was thinking &quot;get off my lawn&quot; even though Tetsuya was
there first (in terms of first with a sign (giving me the idea and a sign) and the first tonight) so
I have no rights, plus it's public space.</p>

<p>blah blah blah</p>
