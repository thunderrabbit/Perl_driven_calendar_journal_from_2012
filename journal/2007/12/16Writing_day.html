<p>I wrote some thousands of words in my novel yesterday (Sunday 16 December).. Perhaps four
thousand words.  This morning on the way to work I got a seat on the train (by going back a couple
stations to Tsunashima (my original home station)) and wrote 370 some-odd words, about how Francois
is a scientist at CERN (actually I want it to be the new facility that had a problem with magnets
in their pre-test) and is taking a break now while the fix the rabbits.  He only speaks French in
the book; I'll need to get a translator to translate it.</p>
