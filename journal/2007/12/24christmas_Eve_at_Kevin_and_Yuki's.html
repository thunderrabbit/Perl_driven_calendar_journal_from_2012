<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thunderrabbit/2139621739/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2279/2139621739_67d7679848_m.jpg" alt="Rob, Kailash, Francois, Ami" align="left" /></a> Went to Kevin's house last night.  His wife and new baby were there as well.  Kevin has done all
variety of spiritual/metaphysical/ethereal training, and is a trainer of various methodologies.
Just recently he did a process that basically removes the ego from the equation in why one chooses
things.  He said all the karma and such is still there, but (in my words:) he is far less likely to
get bound up in new karma.</p>

<p>He said that Bob Monroe described life on earth as addictive.  That souls come here and become
trapped in the 3D hologram of it all.  I had never heard that before, but it makes an interesting
explanation for several things (population growth, downward spiral of spirituality), but not others
(spiritual growth, imminent collapse of ecosystem and billions of human lives).  Meh.  Who am I to
know what drives the planet?</p>

<p>I asked him about meditation.  I've really fallen off my practice (R.O.B.O.T.) and he said a few
different times &quot;that's &quot;doing,&quot; instead of just &quot;being&quot;,&quot; and I
sorta get it.  He was talking about being in meditation instead of doing meditation because there
is no &quot;doing&quot; going on.  In meditation we are shutting down program after program,
dropping veil after veil, turning everything off, while remaining aware... </p>

<p>I really enjoy spending time with Kevin.</p>

<p>When I arrived home, I jumped on the chance to do a workshop that he recommended:</p>

TRANSPORT
JR Yamanote line to Otsuka station.

LUNCH
I suggest we go to Surya Indian restaurant for a nice
vegetarian lunch. Their food is very tasty and good
value. Surya is about a 15 min walk from where we are.
Meal price is not included in the course fee.

CLOTHING
The course will be taught sitting on the floor.
Loose-fitting and comfortable clothes are best. Try to
wear light-colored fabrics, at least for your top
half. Black and vivid patterns are best avoided for
the vision practices.

BRING
It is a good idea to bring your own soft mat and a
blanket to cover yourself for lying down practices.
Some people prefer to bring their own meditation
cushion or stool to sit on. If that is difficult,
there are a number of cushions and mattresses
available.

TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THE WEEKEND
* Please refrain from drinking alcohol during and 24
hours before the course. It does blur your practices!
* For the similar reasons strong coffee on the morning
of the workshop is best avoided.
* To go deeper into the practices on the weekend, it
is a good idea to start practicing from Samuel Sagan's
"Awakening the Third Eye" book, free download at
