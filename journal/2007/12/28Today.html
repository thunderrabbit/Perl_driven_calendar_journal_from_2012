<p>Fell asleep while writing a chapter called &quot;monkey&quot; in my novel while on Toyoko Line on
the way home.  Ami met me at my apartment (Sakura House) and we took a nap for a few hours.  Then
she got up and made ramen while I typed a bit in my novel.</p>

<p>Chowed yummy ramen, did dishes, did each other, and then cuddled and played silly games for a
while until it was clear the weather would not become clear anytime soon, so she headed home in the
drizzly rain.</p>

<p>I wrote a bit more than 800 more words (the file monkey.txt now has 1146 words) for a total now
of 47,427 words.  I just need to write 1286.5 more words &quot;tomorrow&quot; and the next day to
reach the goal of 50,000 words in my first draft.</p>
