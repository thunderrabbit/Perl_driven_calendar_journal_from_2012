<p>oh shucks.  I went to bed last night thinking that today was the 20th, and that I could easily
finish my novel at a rate of 2000 words per day and finish before 30th ended.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>A plot is seeming to form, but I don't quite like the smell of it.  There are some aspects that
don't make sense given the &quot;rules&quot; that I've set up.. or I should say character stories
don't quite match up to make the plot that is coming to mind.  Not sure which I like more, the
characters or the plot.  I think the characters, but I'm open to changing either if it will solve
it nicely.</p>

<p>It makes the whole book smell like a conspiracy theory, but the conspirators are these wise old
charcters that live for 200+ years so they would know all the secrets... but I've casted them as
generally good and</p>

<p>oohhh.. hang on.  I forgot about one unexplored aspect of their character.</p>

<p>They *do* eat people on occassion (these are dragons I'm talking about) but the are still
respected.  I haven't figured out why they eat  people exactly.  I know *why*, but what is the
next level deeper than that.</p>

<p>Right now I'm one stop away from the *far* end of the line from Shibuya.  I'll take an express
train to get back.</p>

<p>Funny story: yesterday I kept, wait.. I have to explain a bit first.</p>

<p>right now I'm typing with the monitor light off because my battery <em>-*! SUCKS !*-</em>,
perhaps because I have kept it plugged in a lot, and perhaps because it sucks, or a combination of
both.</p>

<p>Anyway, I kept turning on the montor light yesterday.</p>

<p>I just changed trains.</p>

<p>Okay, so I kept turning the monitor light on to monitor how my writing was going, and at the very end
of the ride (around Nakameguro) my computer conked  out dead.  I lost a *bit* of text, but Emacs
autosave saved my ass.  I hadn't saved in a while.</p>

<p class="date">9:03am JST Friday 21 December 2007 (day 13785)</p>

<p>Okay I'm going to shut the computer for a bit and draw some ideas on paper.</p>

<p>I was writing a bit, but it's not coming very quickly. </p>
