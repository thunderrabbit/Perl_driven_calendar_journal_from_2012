<p>Ami and I bought a rice cooker today.  For some semi-unexplicable reason, there isn't one in the
community area of my building.  I guess cause it would get all mucky with misuse and abuse.  We
bought one with a decently heavy duty cooker bowl thing and a setting for cooking the type of rice I
had bought for the i-group shadow magician weekend in Kusatsu some months ago.  The remaining rice
had remained unused for those months until today; we cooked two cups and it turned out most
deliciously.</p>

<p>There's still some rice remaining so I can chow it with my lunch tomorrow (leftover stew that
Ami cooked today).  すばらしい！</p>
