<p>Chez is a dear soul who chose to jump from the roof of a hotel in Dallas to her  so she could be
remembered in tattoos on various friends' body parts..  anyway, she would often ask me, &quot;how
are you feeling *right* now*?</p>

<p>Right now, Rob is feeling a bit sad, but a bit productive in getting a lot of stuff written for
his joural.  rob is wondering the point of life and how to make the world a better place.  Rob is
considering  doing the ego separation thing that Kevn did recently,  (and Rob wants to note, for
the record this does not mean physical death or suicide or anything of the sort.; don't worry)</p>

<p>Right now, right *now* Rob is </p>

<p>and Rob is chillin' on a train going to work in shibuya.  There is a woman reading French next
to me, andother woman sleeping next to me and I'm in the middle looking at a guys's bag slung over
his shoulder as we arrive in Nakameguro and will sooon roll in to shibuya.</p>

<p>I'm going to check out for a nap for a bit until we reach shibuya (5 minutes at most)</p>
