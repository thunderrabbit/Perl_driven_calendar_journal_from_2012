<p>Sweet.  I'm now up to 38637 words in my story.  Having an exciting plot seems to whip things
right along.  I'm a bit tired of typing, ana a bit stuck on how to get them out alive (or to kill
one or both), but I'd rather get them out alive, but not in too cheesy of a way.</p>

<p>Sweet.  And I just have to type 1420.375 words per day to make 50,000 by the end of the 30th.</p>
