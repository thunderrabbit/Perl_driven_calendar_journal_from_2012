<p>Good stuff at work today.  Got some done on my new website (my new website) and some progress on
work website (adding &quot;medal&quot; &quot;medals&quot; for bloggers to display on their sites
using the  code I posted on my wiki yesterday.  

<p>Um,  also chatted with Colleen for a bit; great to hear that she got a 3.67 GPA on her core
classes!  I'm sure that's higher than what I got on mine, and definitely higher than my score
overall.</p></p>

<p>She'll be zipping off to Portugal in a few weeks, and Francois is considering a visit.</p>
