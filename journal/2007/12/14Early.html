<p>I intend to write in my novel now, and then catch the 8:44am train to Minatomirai so I can get a
seat and write on the train on the way there (perhaps not until we reach Kikuna) and write all the
way back to Shibuya.</p>

<p>18042 words now.  Let's see how it goes.</p>

<p>Well, that worked rather well.  I wrote over 2000 words.  20082 now.</p>
