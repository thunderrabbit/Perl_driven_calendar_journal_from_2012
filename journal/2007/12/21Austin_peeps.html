<p>Saw some people with a map, looking a bit lost.  I think they were a nuclear family: mom, dad,
grown son.  They were looking for Oriental Bazaar, of which I had never heard, but they had a map so
I got them oriented.  Turns out the mom used to live here and would walk from Roppongi to OB (we go
way back, me an' OB), so once she knew she was going the right way on 246, she was set.</p>

<p>&quot;Where'ya from?&quot; they asked.</p>

<p><em>I'm from</em> &quot;Texas,&quot; <em>yeee haww</em> [sound of guns being fired into the
air.]</p>

<p>&quot;What part?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Houston.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh really?  We're from Austin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow! cool&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, see ya later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bye!&quot;</p>

<p>Fuck.  I shoulda asked if they knew my peeps in Austin!!!  Rargh.  So here's a hello to janette
at UnCommon Objects, Fred and his roommate Bill, Ma and Jon, Dude and Vero, and probably a million
others I can't think of in the short list. (Nathan and Lauuryn, Josephine, Katy B-H, ....)</p>
