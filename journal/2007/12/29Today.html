<p>Got a good deal done on my list.  Watched <a href="http://10mph.com/">10mph</a>, which is quite
an inspiring little story.  I like that they have a DIY section on their site.  I may read it,
because that is exactly what I wanted to ask them.  I mean, I did my own little TJ Bike adventure;
2000km or something 4000? I forget... anyway, I just did it alone, broke my shoulder; it was
great.  But I have very little documentation, and a semi-dead HD with a bunch(?) of photos on it
that I would like to put online.</p>

<p>I added a section called Constants to <a href="http://memorizable.com">memorizable.com</a>, and
put the first 12 digits of pi on there, and then the first 48 digits of pi...  not sure how well it
will work though; they get shuffled when we do the memorizing, so it's a bit of a mess, but still
semi-effective, I would think.  I didn't actually try it.</p>

<p>I'm down to just having to write 1200 words in my novel to get 50,000.  So long as I do it within
the next 27 hours, I'll have done it in the first 30 days of December.</p>

<p>Meeting with Tariq and Hitoshi was good.  I need to get crackin' on my chatbotchat site; actually
I am a bit stuck between wanting to start with a login framework, a voting framework, and snagging
code from my work to do it.</p>
