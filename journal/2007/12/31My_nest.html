<p>Ami asked if I would be willing to cln my room to start ehe new year, and I was ereluctantly
willing.  As the cleaning progressed (far too quickly for my happiness), I realized what might be
happening>  Basically I know whre ll my stuff is.  Its like an animal living in a little
comfortably messy nest.  I could make it a clean nest, given enough time and space to put
everything,, but I don't really have the sapce .. basically need shlves for something baskets for
clothes etc</p>

<p>I focused on my one (1) laundry net-bag thing that Wende and I got back like 6+ years ago.  I
used to have three bags: a white one,a yellow one and a gray one, and I had specifically chosen
those colors to represent whites, something else and something else.  There was a frame to hold
them up.  Fuck we had a whole house with three stories that was twice as big as the house Mark and
Yoko live in now (which seems big by Japanese standards)..  I gave it all up to travel adlearn
about the world and just started to cry cry cry as I was telling Ami.  So sad just to not know
where I had released the bags along the way, and not even remembering doing it.  I bet it was at
janette's house, but I don't remember seeing them in the stuff . oh I never saw that stuff when I
was back in the US this summer.</p>

<p>Anyway, anyway.  anyway.</p>

<p>Ami slightly interrupted my flow (of tears), though she gave me a good deal of time and didn't
interrupt until I started speaking and explaining what was going on in ny my little head.  I had
gone off on a tangent of trying to caref or the earth by not getting a lot of shit that I don't
need and wanting, for example to return pachinko balls to the panchiko parlors, with the imagination
that I could make my conservation pay off by depositing a lucky ball into the slot and cashing
out.. but I'll never go to a pachinko place while they are so disgustingly filled with smoke.
Ack.</p>

<p>So I sidetracked myself and talked about things to do to take care of the earth and how
ineffectual my efforts seemed, and Ami was like getting me to list things that I can do as a
person: not usingplastic bags when buying a single item, reusing bags, turing off lights,
airconditioner, eating vegetarian, and we went off on a tangent on how that helps the earth and she
didn't quite buy it or thought Japan was innocent in this rainforest destruction for beef
consumption game.  I don't know that it it's innocent, but I doubt it could be.  Japan usese a
bajillion wooden choptickas and plsatic bags every day; I doubt they suddenly care about rainforst
beef.</p>

<p>Blah anyway I just wanted to capture my tears on the last day of the year.</p>
