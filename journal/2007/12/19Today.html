<p>Did an interesting little tidbit today with images using PHP.  Basically we are letting users
have &quot;medals&quot; on their website.  The code I put together will check the URL where the
image is being displayed and make sure it matches the code they send to the image outputter.  If it
matches, then it will show the medal they should see.  If not, it shows an error message.  It's
interesting to &quot;view image&quot; and get a different image.</p>

<p>I think I'll post the code in my wiki.  I'll just slap it in there for now and then tweak it
later, whenever that is...</p>
