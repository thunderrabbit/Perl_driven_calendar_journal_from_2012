<p>Sweet.  I just wrote this as the commit message for my latest SVN of the Castle of Dreams novel:</p>

<pre>Scout and Alex are in the cave; it's getting dark outside and about to storm, though they don't know
that.  They've found the secret of the rock cave, but they don't yet know what it is.  Also, I just
got exactly to 37,000 words without specifically trying.</pre>
