<p>Met Gabriel on the bus from the airport over here. (!)  <! He's having to make up a story to get
out of work tomorrow.  Eeek.  > He's from Ottowa, but doesn't have a particularly strong accent.
Two Russian guys in the trial thought he might be Russian.  Gabriel was pretty happy about that,
actually.</p>

<p>Ended up staying up chatting with Gabriel last night as we had our last meal (before tomorrow
mid day-ish) of convenience store food.  I got some tofu and pudding and milk tea and little
carmelized doodles that look like poo.</p>

<p>Gabriel and I were talking about the normal stuff we talk about when meeting another foreigner
in Japan, and then I wanted to tell him about Barcelona in terms of it not being as safety [sic]
(quoting thousands of Japanese) as Japan, and asked if he had heard of PB, and then got
delightfully sidetracked as he excitedly queried me on all aspects of the voyage (he hadn't heard
of it).</p>
