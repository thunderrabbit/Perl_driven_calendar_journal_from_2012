<p>I'm looking a
different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_application_frameworks#PHP">PHP
application frameworks</a>..  I didn't realize there are so many.</p>

<p>I first found <a href="http://wasp.sourceforge.net/content/">WASP</a>, but its wiki has been
left behind by a cobweb of a syntax error...</p>

<p><a href="http://myranti.livejournal.com/38452.html?thread=330036#t330036">http://myranti.livejournal.com/38452.html?thread=330036#t330036</a></p>

<p>I looked at prado, but it seems way too big and too much API to learn.  But I was duly impressed
with its <a href="http://www.pradosoft.com/demos/composer/">Component Composer</a></p>

<p>I looked at Symfony, but it seems overly complex in a different way that I won't take the time
to try and describe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/">Codeigniter</a> is the first one that I thought &quot;I
can do dat&quot; after seeing the toots for making a hello world and then read/writing some data in
a DB.</p>

<p>So I'm going to download it now and see if I really can do dat.</p>
