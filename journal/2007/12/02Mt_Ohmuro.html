<p>Pretty cool, and fun on the lift, though quite touristy.  Special bonus: paragliders.</p>

<p>Ami and I enjoyed walking around the top of the mountain.  For some reason I seem not to have
taken any pictures of the archers in the caldera, but there were some.  It seemed as good a use of
the grassy field with solid rock backdrop as any other.</p>

<p>I did, however, eat wasabi flavored ice cream.  Woohhhoooohhhhhoooooooo  yahch!! was my overall
response.  Really weird flavor.</p>
