<p>Okay, now Emacs does in fact, officially rule fo sheezy.  I'm running my local emacs, and have
just opened a remote file via ssh using tramp, *and* have run my days old calculatin' stuff and
shtuff...  Basically I just run a macro on my local emacs and the rest is handled transparently.

<p>Put this in .emacs:</p>

<pre>
(require 'tramp)
</pre>

The filename to load is</p>

<pre>/ssh:username@machine.domain.tld:/directory/name/file.extension</pre>

<p>These can be given default values in .emacs:</p>

<pre>
(setq tramp-default-method "ssh"
      tramp-default-user "username"
      tramp-default-host "machine.domain.tld")
</pre>

<p>And it's allllll groovy.</p>

<p>Just a couple more tests before I switch my default to do journal files remotely like this.
One: can it write ÆüËÜ¸ì and send the characters properly?</p>

<p>Yes.  Good.</p>

<p>And next, what happens if I try to save, but have no internet connection?</p>

<p>Hmmmm.  That wasn't as good.  It seemed to lock up emacs' brain for the duration of the internet
outage (about 2 minutes), but once internet was restored, it recovered as if nothing had happened.</p>
