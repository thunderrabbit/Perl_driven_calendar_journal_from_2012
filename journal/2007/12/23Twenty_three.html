<p>Not sure why I donn't have an entry for the 23rd et.  That was Sunday, right?</p>

<p>Oh, that's the day Ami and I joined Genny with a g et. al. at Gwag's parents' house on American
land on top of Jaanese soil.  Reall weird to see such wide streets and  yards and then across the
fence to have the normal cramped Japanese apartments with tiny streets squeezing in between.</p>

<p>The food was fantastic; her family wonderfully welcoming, and we all had a great great time.</p>

<p>I have several several pictures from the event; I'll perhaps post those soon.</p>

<p>Oh...  now I remember...</p>

<p>That was the day I fell in love with Maki and made te mistake of telling Ami that I had
carefully found something to not like aboutMaki so I could stay happily with Ami.</p>

<p>Maki  (a friend of JC's fromwork, not Maki who has come to ultimate for years) had boys around
her petty much continuously the whole night.  She's quite fluent in English and Japanese, has quite
a smile, figue, etc.  She soaked up the attention like butter  in a biscuit and I enjoyed sitting /
standing next to her on more than one occassion.</p>

<p>Then, while we were walking around the camp to seecolored lights and plastic inflatable things
in tsome of the yards (including a couple of carousels that worked magically, I noted the tragic
flaw.  Maki isn't particularly tall.</p>

<p>Super cute though,  I'll give her that.</p>

<p>Anyway, so I was like, &quot;so yeah Ami, that time I was like, &quot;oooohhhh&quot;  but I
didn't tell you what I was saying, &quot, I meant that that girl who was really hot and a dgeat
English  speaker.. yeah I noticed she was short, so  so don't worry; I'm over her like a sprinter
over a hurdle.</p>

<p>whew; glad I got that out of the way.</p>

<p>Now, the main err in this action of mine: Ami had already requested that I *not* mention my
passing lusts for other women.  I just forget about them in 2 days and she locks the story in to
her brain and wakes up with bad dreams of me leaving her,  hating her, etc.</p>

<p>It was for that mistake also that I couldn't join the party ofor Natalia and Karen on their
actual birthday...  but had to go upstairs and do (what we call in the secret CIA) &quot;damage
control&quot;</p>

<p>I was lik,e &quot;Ami, the only reason I told you  is because this represents personal growth
for me.  In college I would kiss and dis (*) (*) I was going to write kiss and discard, but kiss
and dis rhymes  I would kiss and dis girls like the thoughtless mass of testosterone that I was.
For me to now realize that I shouldn't break up as soon as I see a flaw in my girl, or another
woman who has a particular quality that exceeds the equivalentquality in my girl...  and  to see
all that and not break up, like with Wende because I have to be free or with  j cause you're too
far away or with K because</p>

<p>Hmmm lost my brain there for a second.  Anyway, &quot;it's growth Ami, so you should be happy
for me.&quot;</p>

<p>still need to grow some more.</p>

<p>Everything was generally fine after that.  I've got to figure this shit out sometime soon.</p>
