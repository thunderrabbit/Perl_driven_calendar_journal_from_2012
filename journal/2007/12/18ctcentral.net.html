<pre>What's your take?  Who had the motive?  What was the plan?  In one paragraph, state your
theory.   Folks will tag and vote.  Spam will be removed quickly; don't waste your time.

Once a theory has been tagged or ranked, it cannot be edited, just deleted by the original
poster, admins, or anyone who cracks your password.

Passwords are stored in md5 format in the DB; they cannot be recovered.</pre>

<p>I've decided to make a website of one paragraph conspiracy theories.  I guess I should make this
entry private until I get it up.</p>

<p>I designed the DB tables today, and will hopefully start coding some shizzle tomorrow.  This is
going to be basically from scratch; I'm not going to use any frameworks except PHP and jquery.  But
not like Drupal or mediawiki or some pile of .php files the contents of which I don't fully grok.
I'm going to know every inch of this code.</p>

<p>And yes, I'll make it free.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, I should draw out some designs before I try writing any code.  I think I'll
be in for lots of programming heartache otherwise.</p>
