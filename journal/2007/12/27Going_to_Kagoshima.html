<p>Okay, I'm headed out for Kagoshima.  Back tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p class="date">6:03pm JST Thursday 27 December 2007 (day 13791)</p>

<p>At the gate in the airport.  52 minutes until departure.  Found free electricity at a little
bring-yer-own-computer bar.  I got a new mileage card because the free tix are with a different
airline this time.  Ah well.</p>
