<p>Nice.  After a few year lapse in practice, I can tell my programming skills are coming
back... not the skillz so much as the knowledge of languages.. I didn't know as much Javascript nor
PHP (especially not the PHP) as I do now.  I can solve problems with Javascript now that I remember
being unable to handle some years ago.</p>

<p>AND, I'm beginning to learn jScript, which is going to open up a new set of possibilities..</p>
