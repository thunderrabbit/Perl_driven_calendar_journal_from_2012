<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm working for Aclass Interactive, doing website updates
to <a href="http://bloggerstation.jp">bloggerstation.jp</a>, about which there are some wonky
things I can't control, but I'm pretty familiar with its intimate details.</p></li>

<li><p>I've just finished the first draft of some changes that will allow us to solicit feedback
from bloggers about products that we send out.  It took about 2 weeks to lay out all the changes
and get the shit all coordinated.  Most of the time I found it a nicely engaging project.  A couple
of tiems I was like, &quot;oh shizah; I didn't think about that.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Doing this PHP work has actually done the incredible: switched me from being a Perl-prude to
realizing that PHP does what it does really well.  It's designed to augment HTML, so it's built
into the HTML structure.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a moment away from my SoML to
explain <a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:PHP_code&oldid=183">why I didn't
like PHP</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>My general schedule includes meeting Yurika once every 2 weeks (I mention her first because
I'll see her tonight), and seeing Ami about 4 nights per week.  Work is from 10-7 with hour lunch,
but the hours are semi flexible, especially toward longer hours.</p></li>

<li><p>I told Kim Sawyer about my current work hours and he said, &quot;Careful. Giving away free
time and talent (unless as charitable contribution) is considered "under-earning" by DA (Debtors
Anonymous), a symptom of addiction around money.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really worked on chatforest in the past several weeks.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, I'm writing a novel about Castle of Dreams; trying to get 50,000 words written this
month, a la NaNoWriMo.  Currently at 15881 words.  I'm doing this in addition to the Castle wiki I
put together at
<a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle">thunderrabbit.com/castle</a>.  I would really like to tell
Nim and Deek so I can get their blessing.</p></li>

<li><p>Have been playing ultimate pretty regularly on Sundays.  The weather is beginning to suck,
so I'm less anxious to go out there, but have still been pretty dedicated.</p></li>

<li><p>Have been sinning like a sailor with regards to R.O.B.O.T.  I haven't really meditated for
like 2 weeks.  Busy writing and busy not wanting to meditate.</p></li>

<li><p>Went to The Pink Cow to see Canadian Mike's paintings.  Most of them sold on that first
night they were up.  I've been working on my paintings infrequently for several months.  I need to
get crazy busy on them, and perhaps start more and probably work with oils next.  Not sure if oil
and acrylic will go together in a way I like, but we can certainly try it.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Sakura House in Motosumiyoshi.  Room 203.  Currently in the building (not counting
Suzuki-san, in order of longevity: Karen (Brazilian girl who never talks to me), Juergen (German guy
who I like), Natalia (Spanish girl who lost her NOVA housing in Osaka), and Fatima (French girl who
replaced Max (who left about 2 weeks ago, and is currently on the Siberian (t)rail, headed
home.)</p></li>

<li><p>My finances are coming around to positive.  I should be out of CC debt in March, and then
start paying back Ma and Fred for my shoulder breakage.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is white MacBook, 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo, with 1Gig of memory, and 41 of 74 Gigs
used on HD.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access is quite stable at work, but generally crap at home.</p></li>

<li><p>I-group is inadvertantly taking a break for the holidays.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really studied much Japanese lately.  Motivation is sparse.  Even tried sex as
reward for motivation, but it didn't help.</p></li>

<li><p>websites currently semi in my brain: robnugen.com, thunderrabbit.com/castle,
chatbotchats.com, chatforest.com</p></li>

<li><p>No pets, but for about an hour last week or so, I considered getting some gerbils. (this was
when I realized &quot;hamster&quot; doesn't include a p.</p></li>

<li><p>If I lost my computer now, I would lose a fun weekend worth of pictures with CDF (near Atami
on 1 December)</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't felt any cool earthquakes recently.</p></li>

<li><p>It's getting to be winter, and the weather is whiney rainy today.</p></li>

<li><p>I've applied for my visa extension, but it hasn't come through yet.  Not sure how long to
wait, etc..  but it expires on 22 December.  I don't know if I get an extension by having the
&quot;Application&quot; stamp in my passport.</p></li>
