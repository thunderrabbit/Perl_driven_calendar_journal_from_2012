<p>Note to self:</p>

<p>Self, if you need to write a hairy mySQL query, and you have a choice between</p>

<ul><li>editing, saving, running code</li>
<li>using phpMyAdmin</li></ul>

<p>use phpMyAdmin.</p>

<p>What I couldn't do all day (I'm talkin' 8 hours) via the first method, I did in 1 hour the
second way.  Here is the resulting mySQL:</p>

<pre>
SELECT um.uid, mi.mission_type, up.mission_id, up.publish_id, ur.status
FROM User_Remun AS ur
RIGHT JOIN User_Publish AS up
USING ( publish_id )
LEFT JOIN Mission_Info AS mi
USING ( mission_id )
LEFT JOIN User_Master AS um
USING ( uid )
WHERE uid =4
AND mi.start_term &lt;= now( ) AND mi.end_term &gt;= now( )
AND ((mi.mission_type = 'normal' AND ur.status IS NULL)
     OR (mi.mission_type = 'monitor' AND ur.status = 9))
{AND mi.mission_id = 46}
</pre>

<p>The last line is optional, depending on whether the user said &quot;tell me what I can do&quot;
or asked &quot;can I do this?&quot;</p>

<p>All in one beautiful query, that merges four (4) tables and runs in about 0.0006 seconds...</p>
