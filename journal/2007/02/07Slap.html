<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Kindof a slap in the face today when I bought next month's train pass.  Reiko was all confused,
&quot;why did you buy it so early?&quot;</p>

<p>As if it's a super complicated question.</p>

<p>Fucking stupid bureaucracy.  Let her just <em>try</em> to get me to turn in my ticket *next*
month.  I'm going to exchange this one for the three month version just to fuck up the system.</p>

<p>But to what end?</p>

<p>I just want to be appreciated for getting things done.</p>

<p>I appreciate myself getting things done.</p>

<p>Reiko often says I'm not very professional.  I guess this counts as an example of that.
Barf.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I decided clearly that I would not try to scam this system of having our train
passes reimbursed.  I could, for example, ride my bicycle to work instead of using the train; it
would be a trick to get everything aligned so I'd actually make money at it, given that they want a
copy of the train pass.  And we're not allowed to buy more than 1 month at a time, in case I quit
before the pass is up, and then the school has to eat the extra train pass days.</p>

<p>But now, I'm thinking about ways to scam the system.  I can, perhaps, buy a three month version,
and then somehow simulate the three corresponding 1 month versions.  I just need to present a photo
copy, or a photoshopped copy...</p>
