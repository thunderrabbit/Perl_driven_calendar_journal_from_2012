<p>Just had a fun lesson with a woman named 愛, who is a vet.  She's currently in pro-biotic sales,
but we had quite a fun time talking about dogs who eat only soft food (it destroys their teeth with
plaque), and iguanas.  愛 had an iguana named イグ and she used to fall asleep in the bath water and
then make quite a splash when her nostrils dipped below water level.  Funny times.  Oh, and also
about the time イグ layed 20 eggs in 愛's bed.  I told 愛about Christine's iguana Ziggy a bit.  I
wonder how they are doing.</p>

<p>Haha oops.  I went out to get my next student, but she's not here yet.  Turns out I had
inadvertently cut the previous lesson short by 20 minutes.  It was so boring that I couldn't wait
for it to end.  (so I (accidentally (?)) didn't)</p>

<p>Right now in my first lesson with 尚里 who is very genki and funny.  :-) Today she is 8308 days
old.  She'll be 8500 on 14 August of this year.  However, she does not yet see the value of counting
days instead of years.</p>

<p>We rode the same train together as far as her station as I headed on to Shibuya to meet Shimpei.
She grabbed my arm a couple times for balance, but generally it was hands off.</p>
