<p>Despite the chilly wind, we had a decent turnout today.  (and by today I mean yesterday)  I had
a few great plays and catches, but I also threw the disc away as many times as I got good
completions.  The wind wrought havoc on a lot of points, though generally we all played well.  Team
Iku players actually came out around noon for practice, which I'm like...  uh, no way..  I don't
want to work hard at playing; I just like to play.</p>

<p>I covered big Jason, little Jason or Adrien most points, during which I generally banter with
them and comment on our respective moves and plays.  Good times.</p>

<p>Afterward, we headed to Draft King for foodage and silliness.  While Mike, Rob (not me; I'm
Wonderboy (*)), Bruno and Troy, I mean Little Jason, declared themselves the Brain Trust for Iku in
the new league, along with Wendi and Jolian, er Yoshio-because-Jolian-is-leaving.</p>

<p>(*) my name from ultimate in Houston; I've just gotten comfortable enough with these guys to
crack out the old name.</p>

<p>They chided big Jason for being at the ass of the table, which was then declared to be the crotch
of the table, seeing that it sported the multi-liter phallic beer tower.  Jolian claimed to enjoy
pouring said beer for everyone, including to himself in 3rd person, and began to &quot;catch&quot;
discs that were being sent across the table in a game I was playing with Maki with paperboard
coasters.  We went from sliding to rolling to speed-rolling to speed-rolling multiple coasters.
Other people at the table began to get in on the coaster action, which included Yasuko tossing a
coaster like a frisbee to me, but hit one of the waitstaff in the pub.  And then she threw to the
other end of the table, but hit another customer.</p>

<p>Jolian blocked all attempts for me to toss a coaster to her for further antics.</p>

<p>To Shibuya for bowling at Tamau's suggestion, we all piled onto the train and headed up there.
Little Jason and Rob had to meet friends and do some work, respectively, so they planned to meet us
a bit later.  Their timing turned out to be quite fine as the wait was about an hour for us to get
lanes, and even then they were not next to one another.  During the hour wait, we headed down to
sing karaoke, but then decided to just hang out and drink.  The AM/PM across the street didn't have
alcohol, so we tromped semi-across Shibuya to another conveni.  I randomly saw a smashed white tile
at the foot of a building and instantly grabbed a small piece of it.  At the conveni, Jason was
like, &quot;oh, for a second I thought that was a new kind of white chocolate..&quot; and then he
offered my white chocolate to Mike who was like, &quot;I think that looks more like a piece of
plastic,&quot; and clonked it on the nearby pallet.  I was like, &quot;it's just hard cause it was
refrigerated.&quot;</p>

<p>We hung out there for a bit until Mike wondered if we oughta start heading back.  Interestingly,
Tamau had already wondered the same, but Jason had been like, &quot;no, this is what we came to do:
just hang out.&quot; and I chimed in, &quot;we're already *here*,&quot; though actually I had been
feeling a bit antsy to go back &quot;on time&quot; as well.  (the bowling center had told us 30 or
45 minutes, and it was getting to be that long, plus we still had a 10 minute walk to get back)</p>

<p>During that ten minute walk, I stood up on the edge of a flower bed, looked down and saw
something weird sticking up.</p>

<p>I grabbed it, and was the new proud owner of a cell phone antennae, which fit perfectly with my
new white tile cell phone!</p>

<p>「あっ、もしもし。はい。うん、いるいる。」</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, Sarah, it's for you.&quot; and Sarah talked for a bit, and said they wanted to talk to
me.  I answered and said, &quot;oh, not me.  they want Hisa!&quot; and handed the phone to Hisa,
who didn't talk for very long.</p>

<p>Tamau was the funniest; at the end of her conversation she was like, &quot;yeah, okay, I'll be
there in five minutes,&quot; I was quite glad everyone got to talk for a bit.  (( I have just glued
the antenna on so I can use it at work as well. ))</p>

<p>A little bit more waiting at the bowling center before we got our lanes.  I was standing next to
Jolian who saw my cell phone antenna.  He almost finished a question before being interrupted, and I
forgot to answer my phone and offer to to him.  I imagine he woulda been keen to the gag and
funny.</p>

<p>We played on lanes 26 and 31.  The names サラ、ロブ、ロブ、ジャイ、and タマウ on lane 26 were played by
Sarah, me, Hisa, Rob, and Tamau, respectively.  I enjoyed the SKIP button, and pushed it as a joke
before Sarah bowled, but she didn't hear us say &quot;wait!&quot; and I tried to SKIP SKIP SKIP SKIP
really quick, but ended up going just past her name <em>again</em> so we had to ask the staff to
come by and fix the score for us.  Funny fun times.</p>

<p>Hisa played Rob's name because Rob hadn't come back yet.  Rob came back and played Jay's name
because little Jason hadn't come back yet.  Little Jason came back and played Troy's name on the
other lane, which, by that time had been moved next to us at 25 after the kids there had finished
and taken pictures of their guys without shirts, so I quickly threw Francois into the photo from the
side, and they pulled me into the picture sans shirt, but I don't even know who Troy is or was
supposed to be.</p>

<p>I told them Francois' name just in case it helps him become famous.</p>

<p>I played silly each frame, including a new trick of bowling from my seat (got 1 pin), for a grand
score of 49.</p>

<p>The next game I actually tried, and got 104.</p>

<p>But Rob wins them all with a youtube moment not captured on video: no-look, walking, between the legs
backwards for a strike.  The ball bounced off the floor as he sent it between his legs.  Total beauty.</p>

<p>Another beauty was bowling a few lanes down from us, and all male activity stopped on our lanes
to watch her, and hope for another panty shot as she grabbed her ball for the spare.</p>

<p>Midnight loomed large on the clocks, so people started to scatter.  Jolian handled cash
collection; I hung back and worked on ball cleanup.  Sarah needed a place to crash (she lives 3
hours and 2500 yen away (each way)) and had offers from both Robs.  This Rob won due to larger
apartment and separate bed.  Rob had said, &quot;my apartment is pretty small, but I have a sheet
to put between us so you don't accidentally have sex with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Sarah and I each surfed the web as the other showered, then chatted about randomness.  She's
going to Hawaii next week or so; I showed her pics of me at Wailua Falls.</p>

<p>Zzzzz.</p>

<p>Walked her to the station by way of 99-shop and just got back (2 hours ago).</p>

<p class="date">12:13pm JST</p>

<p>Bah.  bummed that I did a &quot;lot&quot; of work to get pics of the phone up, but they are all
blurry.  I gots to get a better camera.</p>
