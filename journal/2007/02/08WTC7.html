<p>My basic outline of some questions:</p>

<p>Whatshisname said <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=7WYdAJQV100">there was so much loss of life,
we decided to &quot;pull it,&quot;</a> referring to WTC 7.  Okay.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>But, how long, on average, would it take to set up such a demoliton?</p>

<p>An hour?  A day?</p>

<p>Could it be set up in a day on the day the WTC came down?   Um...  I don't really think so.</p>
