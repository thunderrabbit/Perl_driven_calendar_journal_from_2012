<p>Work was short today but seemed long, though I got a cancellation.  80 minutes with a woman named
Junko was no worries for she filled it with questions about emails and then questions and stuff
about stuff and whatever.  Nearly as fun and easy as with Tomomi, with whom over her emails I went
for 40 minutes.</p>
