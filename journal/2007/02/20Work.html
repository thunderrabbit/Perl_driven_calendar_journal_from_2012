<p>Pretty great day at work; had two cancellations (including Ami (boohoo)) for a total of 2 hours
paid to work on my marble track.  However, I donated 20 minutes to my little sister Rie, whose
British accent and dramatic self-corrections entertain me to no end.</p>

<p>Last lesson was with Natsuki (Âç¹¥¤­) with whom I equally enjoy chatting.  She didn't bring any
materials, so I told her the full Story So Far of Francois</p>

<p>Richard, engineer by profession, made some suggestions for how to finish the second switch on
the marble track.  He made one suggestion I hadn't previously considered, but I'm not sure if I'll
implement it or not.</p>
