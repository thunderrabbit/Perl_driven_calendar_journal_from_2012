<p>Oh mate these guys are great!  They <strike>orchestrated a big joke</strike> set up signs (as
part of an ad campaign) that triggered memories of all the scare tactics the media has been pounding into our
heads about TERROR and OH NO and ORANGE ALERT and all the BS designed to pacify people.  The
government and media should be sued for having made <strike>the whole country</strike> Boston
scared.  These guys are heroes for screwing the media's feeding frenzy.</p>
