<p>Dang.</p>

<p>I headed out to Osambashi this morning to greet PB peeps, especially Shunji, Kazzah, Phil, Rei, and
Kentaro.</p>

<p>The ship arrived *yesterday*, though the site clearly says it would come back today.</p>

<p>I guess I should stay in closer touch with the home office.</p>

<p>But on the good side, I got a lot of planning done for flash project, which I will work on
coding now.</p>
