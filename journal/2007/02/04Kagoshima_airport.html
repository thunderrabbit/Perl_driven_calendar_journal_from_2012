of/during/about his travels in India.  He had done plenty of traveling and basically wondered if
they could make it into something more than just memories and stories.  Now there's video to
boot (*).</p>

<p>(*) this is the second time I've used &quot;to boot&quot; recently; I wonder why.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he said a documentary about them making a documentary would have been more
interesting than the documentary they produced.</p>

<p>He said he's interested in doing the Vipassana meditation, and even knew the name of it before I
mentioned it.  I was like, &quot;if you are interested in doing it, you *have* to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing his documentary.  He said, &quot;when people see it, they're like
'oh, it looks like you had a lot of fun!'&quot; when actually his experience was a lot of difficult
work, but great memories.</p>
