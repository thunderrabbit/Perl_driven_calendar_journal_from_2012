<p>At the convenience store next door, I've basically made friends with the staff, and it's paying
off in terms of free food and drinks!</p>

<p>There's a lottery campaign thing where we grab a paper out of the magic box and get a prize or
get nothin'.</p>

<p>I grabbed a whole pile as a joke and they took the pile, sifted through it to find the winners
and dumped the rest in the trash!!</p>

<p>This has happened three times now.</p>
