<p class="dream">Had a big earthquake that woke me up; I was trying to stand up, but I almost
couldn't.  The earthquake lasted about 30 seconds; I was watching some kids on a huge trampoline
suspended between the trees; they were unaware of the earthquake as it was happening until their
dad came outside, saying &quot;there's an earthquake; we have to take cover.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I stayed outside not worried about it and met some new men from my men's group; I
was going to help them gt started in the organization.</p>

<p class="dream">Vacuuming with a pretty powerful vacuum cleaner a a place where my peers lived.
At the end, we looked inside the cleaner to see if it had successfully sucked a piece of paper all
the way down, and when we looked inside the bag, we found three red Grateful Dead bears about the
size of Francois.  There wasn't ea lot of dust, but just junk.  Pretty powerful vacuum.</p>
