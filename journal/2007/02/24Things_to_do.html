HI Wende!

Happy Birthday!  How are things with you?  I think about you often and hope things are just peachy.

I'm doing well in Tokyo.  Students often ask where I'm from, and I always say Texas.  Sometimes they
ask more and I give mental blessings to you as I talk about the life I gave up to come here.  I
wonder how our lives would be different!

I've not heard from you in a while; for a bit, I was afraid I had made you upset; one of the twins
said you were just busy.  I would love to know what you're up to!

As you may have heard, I broke my shoulder in May last year.  I'm about 1/2 way done paying for
that.  No insurance = whoops!

A friend of my roommate is starting a company, making a video game or two or three.  I've been
working with him and one other guy to make samples to entice Sony or some other big boys to give us
big money.  If all goes as planned, I'll double my salary in a couple of months, and be back up to
what I was making at FSD.

I'm not sure when I will come back to visit, but I will come back before the end of the known universe.

Happy Happy Birthday!

    Love Love
      - Rob!
