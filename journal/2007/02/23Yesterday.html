<p>Yesterday was a blur of work on the flash project; I was up late late working on it (until 2am)
two nights ago, and then woke up at 6am yesterday (*) morning to work on it for about 3 hours until
I got it basically to the point I wanted for Tariq to show it to a guy yesterday.  Woke up at 10am
to meet with Tariq online for a couple of hours to make some more final changes and then had a tired
day at work yesterday.</p>

<p>(*) as I write this</p>

<p>At home, I was ready for a break, and delightfully enough, Aiko was online, so I chatted with
and then Skyped with her for a bit over an hour.</p>

<p>Turns out her being removed from the Rob Update list was a mistake; she had misclicked while at
work and didn't have time to read ¤«¤Ê as her boss came up, or some such, etc..  so when Sai Panda
looked at the source for remove.pl, I went to the update list to see what happened, and Aiko's name
was removed (users don't have access to the DB; it just writes a text file of the requested removes
that gets processed when I log on).</p>

<p>Aiko and I are beginning to make plans for me to come visit; I'll invite my girl to help her boy
not be jealous and then we can just go hang out.  Not sure if it will all work out that way, but it
would be nice.</p>
