<p>I have had my journal online since before blog was a word.  I have had my <em>journal</em>
before online was a word.  Or before &quot;online&quot; meant surfing the net.</p>

<p>At times I have claimed that I don't care how many people read my shtuff online, but the reality
includes my server sending me an email featuring the log of the each hit from the previous day:
timestamp, which date of my journal was read, and, if the person has entered them in the comment
form, the name and email address.</p>

<p>Some months ago I got a message from an email address that I'll call Panda.  Panda sent me a
message asking if I had seen a particular japanese study website.</p>

<p>I checked the IP address to try to verify the identity, and it was the same IP address as Hitomi
had been using before.</p>

<p>Aha.  So I basically ignored the message, as I'm wont to do with messages sent via comment via
unverified senders.</p>

<p>Today I received the log of hits on my source_viewer.  This is an interesting one because I like
to imagine people care slash can use the source code of my stuff.  And because people often try to
view the source of ../../../../, |etc|, etc.</p>

<p>This was Panda viewing remove.pl</p>

<p>remove.pl is the code that removes people from my Rob Updates email list.  Woah.  I thought
Hitomi was already off that list.</p>

<p>So I checked the Rob Update list, and here's where Belief crashes with Reality:</p>

<p><em>Aiko</em> has removed her name.</p>

<p><em>Aiko is Panda???</em></p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I haven't talked to Aiko in a while, but last time we chatted briefly about wanting to chat at
length because we hadn't talked in a while.  Hmmm.</p>
