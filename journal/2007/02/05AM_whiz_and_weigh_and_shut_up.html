<p class="date">8:14am JST Monday  5 February 2007 (day 13466)</p>

<p>Peed in a bottle to kick off the day.  I didn't drink &quot;enough&quot; water yesterday; pee
was dark like beer.</p>

<p>Got back to my bed and the nurse asked me if weighing was okay.  I was like, [sure; go ahead
(and weigh yourself)].  She said the scale might break.</p>

<p>[Oh, me???]</p>

<p>82.8 kg = 182.5 pounds</p>

<p>Starting tomorrow we are supposed to accumulate all our urine in bottles throughout the day.
Find my name on an empty bottle and whiz in it.</p>

<p class="date">8:44am JST</p>

<p>The next nurse was like, [blah blah blah blah,¡¡¤Í¡©] and then &quot;please shirt up&quot;
wanting me to lift my shirt, but when she said &quot;shirt&quot; without the R it was more like,
&quot;please shut up&quot; so I was like, &quot;you shut up!&quot;</p>

<p>I made sure she understood the pun and then taught her &quot;raise&quot; and then with comedic
timing, I was all, &quot;please raise your shirt&quot; and she was like, [I'll do it (I'm warning
you)] so I was like, &quot;please close the door.&quot;</p>

<p>hahah we're so funny.</p>
