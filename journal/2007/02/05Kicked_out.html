<p>My QTC is 4/1000ths of a second too long.</p>

<p>QTC = the time from when my ventricals contract, to when they are ready to go again.</p>

<p>The limit is 450 ms, but I am 454 ms (milliseconds).</p>

<p>Thank you, angels, for taking care of me.</p>

<p>Just chowed free lunch with the guys, who gave their condolences..  Now it's time to pack and
head out!</p>

<p>I'm in a taxi now, headed to the bus stop where I can get a bus to Kagoshima airport. (All
transportation paid by CPC.)</p>
