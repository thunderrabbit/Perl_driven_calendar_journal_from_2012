<p>I'm scheduled for 20 minutes' break during 8 hours of work today.  I'm therefore not going to
bring my computer; I likely won't have time to do anything with it.  And if I do get a no-show or
cancellation, I need to work on flowcharting some code instead of coding some flash.</p>

<p>And this way my machine can help SETI and Einstein @ homes.</p>

<p>Had a good chat with Phat Pat, but had to cut it short when I realized I was late for getting
ready for work.</p>

<p>Bought pizza and stew from downstairs; even though I had brought my plate, they were trying to
put the stew into a bag, and give me plastic silverware, and a wetwipe napkin thing.  I was like, 
いい、いい、いい、いい to make them stop.</p>
