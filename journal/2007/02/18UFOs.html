<p>I just want to state, for the record, I am seeing more UFO press releases recently than say,
before the recent Chicago incident.</p>

<p>I believe in synchronicity, which may be a simple explanation, but..  has anyone else noticed
this?  Are we on the verge of something?</p>

<p>I hope so.</p>

<p>And soon <a href="http://fastwalkers.com">the movie Fastwalkers</a> will be released.  I've
downloaded and it watched snippets.  It doesn't seem like it will change the debate much, but I
noted a guy quoting the aliens, &quot;if you [who are hiding our existence] don't reveal us soon,
we'll reveal ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm ready.</p>
