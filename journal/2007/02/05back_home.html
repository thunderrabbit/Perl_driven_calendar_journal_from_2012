<p>I'm safely back at home.  I'll ask Dr Cutie what it means that my QTC is too long.</p>

<p class="date">8 February 2007</p>

<p>I wrote to Dr Cutie and to Fred, because he has been doing heart stuff for a while.  Fred replied:</p>

For the study, four milliseconds isn't going to make any difference,
but they have to draw the line somewhere.  On a different day, you
would have given a different reading, and maybe low enough to get in.
Whatever.  Studies are weird, and come in all shapes and sizes.

But why are you enrolling in clinical drug trials?  For the money?
The more I learn about drug companies, the more convinced I am that
they are evil.  Enron levels of evil.  No way I would try any new
treatment unless I had a very serious condition, and I couldn't think
of anything else to try.

> Is my "slow" QTc something I should have checked?

Nah.  That measure doesn't really mean much, and you have no other
(known) symptoms or risk factors.  Just forget it.  That said, you
need to start getting annual physicals to check for prostate cancer
and shit that can be treated if caught early.

If you happen to have a 12-lead EKG, go ahead and send it to me just
for grins, but the cost-to-benefit ratio of checking you out for
cardiac or genetic defects, based on that particular piece of
unverified information, is too high: you'd pay a lot (many thousands
of USD), and it's overwhelmingly likely that the dr. wouldn't be able
to tell you anything interesting, whether you had a latent heart
condition or not.  For a healthy young guy like yourself, the
treatment would be more dangerous than the condition!

It is true that a prolonged QT interval can lead to life-threatening
arrythmias.  Sudden cardiac death occurs pretty often (300K deaths per
year in the US), but the term covers pretty much any cardiac-related
death that didn't show symptoms beforehand, including heart attacks of
people with advanced diabetes, fat people, and lifetime smokers.
Prolonged QT intervals are waaaaay down on the list of risk factors.
Far and away more common is death related to coronary artery disease.
I mean, if you had told me they checked your so-called "calcium
score," and it was over 800, we would be having a totally different
conversation.  But I'll eat my shoe if you have coronary artery
disease, and I'll eat the other one if your QT interval ever causes
you problems.

(For the record, G, lest you be impressed that I knew all this off the
top of my head, I only knew about half of it.  The other half came
from my fact-checking of the first half!)
