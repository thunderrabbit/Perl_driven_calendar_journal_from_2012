<p class="dream">During a lesson with Masako, my favorite tall married student, we were looking at her
computer, and trying to figure out how to do something; I thought it was one thing, and she thought
it was another.  I was like, &quot;it's not by pressing F9&quot; (her idea) &quot;Okay, if it's
done by pressing F9, I'll give you anything you want.&quot; and when we discovered how to do it,
the answer was neither pressing F9, nor my idea, but then she kissed me, which was the something
she wanted.</p>

<p class="dream">I was well-pleased by her request, and we went to a restaurant with a few other
peeps. I tried to look inconspicuous, and I saw the guys from the CPC trial.  They were all like,
&quot;hey; who's that girl?&quot; and I was like, &quot;what girl?&quot; and they go,
&quot;Ohhhhhh; I see.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The restaurant turned out to be a love hotel, though we didn't actually pay for a
room.  Later, we were in another lesson and I was nibbling on her hand a bit.  She asked how long I
usually spent in establishments like the one in which we had just been.  I was like, &quot;minimum
4 hours, but usually stay all night.&quot;  She agreed that was a good amount of time and said
she'd like to try it some time.</p>

<p class="dream">Driving home after that, I saw a road sign that said, &quot;FEVER
PROHIBITED&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Hmmmmm.&quot;</p>

<p>and then I woke up.</p>
