Ah.

I totally emphatically believe God is unfathomable.  We cannot begin to begin to think about
comprehension of that which is God.

It's not annoying; I was just busy, and it takes me a while to figure out how to explain what's in
my brain.. ))

I think we differ on basically one (1) point:

I don't think it's necessary to invoke the name "Jesus" in order to be connected to God.  Okay,
well, in English it's Jesus, while in Spanish it's Jesus, etc.

I mean, I don't think it's required to think that there was exactly one son of God, and He died on a
cross and all that stuff.

We've already discussed that names are just names.  Various languages use different names.  

What about a deaf / mute man who can't say "Jesus" but can make the sign in sign language?  So the
point is the *word* "Jesus" is not the point.  It's just a concept: "Son of God" 
So we could say "In the concept of the son of God I pray, amen."

So, if it's just a concept of the son of God, then why not the daughter of God?  Why not the love of
God?  Why not the idea of God?

Why not just God?

So I  figure I'll just talk directly to God and not any of God's designated authorities.

But then I feel like God, being God, and infinite, and infinitely unknowable, is perhaps a bit too
big for me to grasp.

So I bring in my own concept of "my angels."  In my mind, they are equivalent to the progeny of God
(e.g. the daughter of God, or the son of God, i.e. Jesus) but they are my own.

The word "Jesus" (or its equivalent in other languages) has been...  shall I say ...  tainted by a
lot of writings, emotions, just a lot of cruft of other living human people over the years.  Same
with Mohammad, Buddha, and to a lesser extent, Elvis, Madonna, Diana, and Oprah.

So I want a pure connection.  My own connection to God.  No name calling.  No "my connection is
better than your connection."  Just my connection to God.

Your connection to God is great.  I just don't want to use it.  I have my own.

Same with chopsticks.  Your chopsticks are a great connection to food.  I have my own.
