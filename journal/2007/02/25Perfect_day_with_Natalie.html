<p>PB set sail for its 56th global voyage around the world, and Nat and I met to see the ship away
and chat chat chat about any and every thing of which we could think to offer.  Started just after
9:30am at Hachiko, headed down to Osanbashi, missed the stop cause we were snuggled so well, went
the extra stop to the end of the line and then back on track.</p>

<p>Saw a bunch of PB cats at departure: Pat, Beah, Tomoyo, 愛 (baby due in May!), Stacy, Kazzah,
Akane, Nachiko, Saki, Keiko (though only in passing), and then on the ship: Chris, Levi, Jen, Kentaro.
Great great great to see everyone.  During the screaming goodbyes across the rails, I had Francois
well-visible to the ship, waving and flopping back and forth, like, &quot;throw your rabbit in the
air, and wave him like you just don't care.&quot;</p>

<p>With all the people there, I didn't actually expect to get more time with Natalie after
departure; I figured she'd be hyper-busy with other people, but we were able to escape together,
wandered around Chinatown for a bit not finding any non-stinky (smoke-filled) areas to eat, so
headed to Shibuya, cuddled on the local train as the time for me to be on time for ultimate passed,
for pasta at a restaurant I hadn't previously patronized.</p>

<p>More more more talk talk talk as I consciously missed my chance to go to ultimate at all.
Shared all our past stories and all our PB stories and all we knew about everything else and
in-between as well.  Plus, Francois and his hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>She told me about Nana and life back home; I told her about Mankind Project and Woman Within;
she told me about turning away from her greatest love; and I shared similarly with her.  All the
while offering hand massages, etcetera, across the table.</p>

<p>&quot;If we ever <em>actually</em> had a chance to do it, do you think we would?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nah.&quot;</p>
