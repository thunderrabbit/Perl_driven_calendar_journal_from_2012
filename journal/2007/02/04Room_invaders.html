<p>I am here to take part in a drug trial.  This is a drug that has been tested in the US, and is
now being tested in Japan.  Basically the drug company is testing the drug on Japanese men and
foreign (caucasian) men.  We foreign men were all chillin' in our room (large hospital room with
separate beds) and then all these Japanese guys came shuffling in.  It feels a bit spookier to me
because they're all quiet.  Granted, we were quiet when they came in.  But as <em>we</em> came in,
we were loud.</p>
