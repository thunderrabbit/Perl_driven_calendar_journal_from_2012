<p>Um,</p>

<p>I asked the receptionist how to turn off the beeps on my electronic dictionary.  She wasn't able
to figure it out, so I messed with it for about the same amount of time (actually a bit less), and
I got it.</p>

<p>Is it just a knowledge of how technology &quot;should&quot; work that allowed that?  Why
couldn't she read the kanji and find whatever means &quot;settings&quot; or some such?</p>
