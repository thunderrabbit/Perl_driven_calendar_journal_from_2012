  I just saw this hilarous vid on youtube
  Stephen Colbert on "The O'Reilly Factor"
1:41 PM Colbert destroys O'Reilly while O'R is trying to ... depants Colbert
  I can't think of the perfect word, but
1:42 PM basically O'Reilly is trying to make Colbert look like a fraud, but C 
  isn't even phased, and just jokes the shit out of O'Reilly all over the place.
