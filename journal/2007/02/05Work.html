<p>I stopped by work on the way home to confirm when I can work again.  Fortunately, I have a huge
full schedule tomorrow.  Wow.</p>

<p>Reiko (receptionist) jokingly asked if I had brought anything.  I hadn't, and then I felt bad,
because she always brings stuff for us when she goes out of town.  Even to her best friend's
funeral.</p>

<p>Ah well.</p>
