<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Well, that was hella easier than I thought it might be.  Contrary to my own prevailing belief,
it was easy-squeezy to copy-n-paste frames and objects between to .fla movies.  I thought it would
be a nightmare of library disconnects and all sorts of crap.  But magically all the needed items
are referenced properly.</p>

<p>Fair enough.  I hope it doesn't bite me later.</p>

<p>I was able to do it all and do some preliminary testing while on the train headed away from home
at first and now almost home.</p>
