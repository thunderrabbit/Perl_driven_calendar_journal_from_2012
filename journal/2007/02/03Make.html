<p>What is called &quot;makeup&quot; in US English is called &quot;make&quot; in Japanese.  The girl
standing next to me on the train to Shibuya had interesting eye makeup.  Gold and green glitter eye
shadow and dark mascara.  I liked the gold and green.  And the glitter.  I was gazing at her eyes
when she made eye contact with me.  Instead of looking away, I held my gaze.  And my poker face.  I
should have smiled.  Ah well.</p>
