<p>At the conveni just now I bought some chocolate, jello-stuff, and a &quot;burrito&quot; type
thing.  The clerk asked if I wanted the burrito heated and I was like, yah, and the other clerk
helpfully popped it in the microwave.</p>

<p>Before she scanned it.  I paid for the rest, asked for the receipt (as I always do) and picked
up the burrito from the next clerk.</p>

<p>Free burrito.   Mmmmm.</p>
