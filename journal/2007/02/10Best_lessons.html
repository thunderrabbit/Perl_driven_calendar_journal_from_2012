<p>Just had the two best lessons ever.</p>

<p>First was a guy with whom I drew an exquisite corpse (the term Matt The Artist taught me on PB
last year).  He used to work in Bunkamura, a museum - art - なんとか complex in Shibuya.  He wanted
to learn how to draw more freely, so I told him about the exquisite corpse technique..  and we did
one!  At first he would only draw closed rounded shapes around what I had drawn, but then a bit later he
was drawing lines and angled shapes.  Cool stuff.  AND, he drove from SF to Key West and back..
Nice.</p>

<p>The next student is a new mother (with little Yuri sleeping in front pouch thing) who agrees with
my disagreement over Bush's kill-everything policy, and who intends to teach her baby English and
Mandarin, and who really liked my idea about days old celebrations.  She is 11299 days old
today.</p>

<p>I need to write up a bit more about it, and tweak my site to account for time zones.</p>

<p>Saw Naori as she was leaving Jamie's lesson; I nearly have a crush on her, but I'm sure I'll get
over it sometime soonish.</p>
