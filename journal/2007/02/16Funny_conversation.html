<p>Funny lesson with a girl started like this:</p>

<p>&quot;What do you do in your free time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;part time job&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where do you work?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;waiter&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is the restaurant name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Japanese food&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like Japanese food?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yes&quot;</p>

<p>It all turned out basically okay; she's going to make clothes for Francois for 1000 yen.  She
reminds me of Meg Robinson, actually.</p>

<p>In the lesson record I wrote</p>

<pre>funny girl in a non-joking way:  silver shoes, sparkly scarf, army jacket, blonde tail &amp; 
a dog tag.  1000 yen if she makes new clothes for Francois.</pre>

<p>She'll be back on Monday.</p>
