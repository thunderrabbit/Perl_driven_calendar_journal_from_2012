<p class="dream">Bruce Willis was over at my friend's house, so I met him and as he was leaving, we
were like, &quot;let's hang out sometime,&quot; and he suggested we could get together and play
video games, and I was like, &quot;I don't really play video games, just writing one,&quot; and he
was like, &quot;well that's cool, we can still hang out,&quot; and he was walking down to him
Hummer 2 in the parking lot.  I came down the hill a way to say bye, and asked him if he lived near
Minnie Driver's house.  He was like, &quot;yeah,&quot; and sorta pointed out a couple of landmarks
that we could see on the top of the hill, including the ball on a tower that's in Dallas, a new
tower built by Google, and some famous Chinese Mafia place.  I realized he had to go soon, so I was
like, &quot;should I send you an email to remind you, or will you remember?&quot;  He was like,
&quot;I'll remember, so go ahead and send an email.&quot;</p>
