<p>Tomoko is a woman who takes Jamie's lessons each week here in Kichijoji.  She's &quot;trying to
convert&quot; a gay man to straight (as if that can happen) and gives updates of her progress (in
terms of bases that were vogue in 3rd grade).</p>

<p>Last week or so, Jamie told Tomoko I was attracted to her and that I like strange girls and girls
with braces. During my break, Jamie was like, &quot;Rob, c'mere; Tomoko has something to show you&quot; so I
went in and Tomoko was all saying she would get braces, and for an instant I thought about saying,
&quot;if you get braces, I'll kiss you&quot; and was thinking I could kiss her semi-jokingly right
now.. but I was wise enough *not* to engage in such antics.</p>

<p>Then she was trying to set me up with some of her friends, via pictures on her cellphone and my
YES/NO vote like hotornot.com.  I agreed one of them was cute, and she was all excited for a bit,
etc..  At the end of the lesson I was like, &quot;but I have a girlfriend, so 全然できない&quot;</p>

<p>Can't go chasing random tails.</p>
