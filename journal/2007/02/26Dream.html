<p class="dream">One of my students started talking to another teacher during our scheduled lesson.
At first I wasn't worried, but then it went on, and when I looked over, they were protecting me (and
anyone else) from listening in, though I noted they were talking about gang violence with guns and
such.  As in they were in a gang about to perform such violence.</p>

<p class="dream">I grabbed the guy into the center of the room and called him on it; basically told
him I don't care who he talks to, but I need to know if he expects to talk to me again; a little
courtesy would be courteous.</p>

<p class="dream">He apologized and then I sent him away, but he was hesitant to go; slow at
collecting his stuff, and then wanted to take a &quot;shower&quot; in the sink, and then something
else, and I was like, &quot;you're just wasting time,&quot; and he started to come on to me
sexually, and I was like, &quot;I'm going to start punching you,&quot;</p>

<p>and I woke myself up when I jerked my fist to punch him.</p>
