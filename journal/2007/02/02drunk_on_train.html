<p>I just missed the 10:26pm train, so I'm going to go the other direction so I ca (*)</p>

<p>(*) fucking hell.  Some drunk-ass salaryman dipshit is all laid out drunk on the train and
dropped his fucking beer so it poured all over the floor and is now streaming up and down the train
ready for some old wo/man to slip and bust their ass on it.</p>

<p>While I wrote the above, three people vacated the seats around the spill and someone informed
him of his disgusting self, and he got off the train.</p>
