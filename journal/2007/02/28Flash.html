<p>Last night and today, more more more flash.</p>

<p>Found an article
called <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/developer/flash8/best_structure_flash_site.htm">Best Structure
Flash Site</a>, which I've read through and semi-pretty much understand, though I don't yet see the
&quot;proper&quot; way to extend it the way I'd like to for my big movies, nor even the little movie
on which I'm now working.</p>
