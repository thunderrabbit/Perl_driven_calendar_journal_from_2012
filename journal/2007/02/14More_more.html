<p>Just finished applying for my gaijin card at the Setagaya Ward office.  Also discovered where I
can apply for health insurance, which I plan to do when I pick up my card in a couple weeks.</p>

<p>I tried to get a photo including Francois, but the photo-booth machine cut the photo so short
that Francois didn't show up.  Ah well.  Sorry, rabbit.</p>

<p>Setagaya line is practically tiny.  It features 1 double-car per train, and the driver and
conductor are not in their own box like on most lines in Tokyo.  Like a bus driver, they can
interact with the passengers.  On the way back to Sangenjaya, there were two conductors.  Both
female, and both cute.</p>
