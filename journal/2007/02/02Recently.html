<p>Random things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Recently sent Masako my Pascal source code for DOTS that I wrote in 1990.  I'd like to
rewrite the game in Java, though overall, it's a low priority project.</p></li>

<li><p>My girl stayed over last night, and missed her train to go home on time this morning.  She
said she wasn't late for work, but I was a bit worried.</p></li>

<li><p>I took pics of Marble Track 2 tonight before &quot;archiving&quot; it for the next 13
days.</p></li>

<li><p>I've not been working on the flash project as much as last week; without feedback from
Tariq, I just wasn't as motivated.  I did do some work, but wasn't pouring in the long
hours.</p></li>

<li><p>While Michael's been gone, I've been living in the living room (of all places) instead of my
bedroom.  Looks like tonight and tomorrow night will be the last two nights of this
arrangement.</p></li>

<li><p>Lots of students seem to have been asking me &quot;do you have Japanese friends?&quot;  Not
sure why I'm noticing this more than before.  My answer has been, &quot;I don't really have *any*
friends in Tokyo.&quot;  Need I make some more (Japanese) friends?</p></li>
