<p>Work was super busy yesterday.  Welcome back!  Mostly all new students, and the students I had
seen before were of the type I generally don't like: just read the book for the first time while in
class.  I gave them homework; I made the one in SBS do the examples without reading the prompts.
That's what I made Mari and Chika do, and they're getting better, so.</p>
