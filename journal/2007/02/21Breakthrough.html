<p>Just had a good breakthrough in flash coding.  I was trying for some days, but not until this
morning, thanks to <a href="http://www.actionscriptblog.net/">Marlon Valenzuela aka Sophistikat</a>,
was I able
to <a href="http://www.actionscript.org/forums/showpost.php3?p=440163&postcount=4">figure out when a
loaded movie ends</a>.  Now I can.</p>

<p>My code:</p>

<pre>
// these are the movies in the order we will load them.
swfArray = new Array("movie1.swf","movie2.swf","movie3.swf");

var next_movie:Number = 0;   // start with the first movie and roll on from there

this.createEmptyMovieClip("targ1_mc", 1);

targ1_mc.loadMovie(swfArray[next_movie]);
 
this.onEnterFrame = function(){
        <b>if (targ1_mc._totalframes == targ1_mc._currentframe) {  //  this is the key  </b>
	next_movie ++;
	targ1_mc.loadMovie(swfArray[next_movie]);
        trace("next movie please");
    }else{
        trace(targ1_mc._currentframe);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>There is an obvious issue with running over the end of the array, but that's outside the scope
of my original problem.</p>
