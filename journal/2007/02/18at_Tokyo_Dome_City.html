<p class="date">1:52am JST Monday 19 February 2007 (day 13480)</p>

<p>Fun day at Tokyo Dome City and LaQua Spa today.  We went with her coupons for LaQua, and I was like, "let's ride some rides and then go to the spa."  It was drizzly and the ticket girl was like "not all the rides are running, so it's prolly better to get individual tickets instead of a day pass."  She said it in Japanese, so I didn't understand her, and I'm glad we didn't take her advice because we rode like 22,000 yen worth of rides <em>each</em> for our 4000 yen passes.  Aw yeah.</p>

<p>In order by listing on the map, not in order of riding, we rode</p>

<p><ol>
<li>Big O:  1 * 800 yen</li>
<li>Thunder Dolphin 5 * 1000 yen</li>
<li>Wonder Drop 2 * 600 yen</li>
<li>The 13 Doors 1 * 800 yen</li>
<li>Spinning Coaster 2 * 600 yen</li>
<li>Little Tea Cups 1 * 200 yen</li>
<li>Geo Panic 11 * 800 yen</li>
<li>Hyper Illusion 2 * 600 yen</li>
<li>Zombie Paradise 5 * 600 yen</li>
<li>Bikkri House 2 * 400 yen</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Wow.¡¡Smooth total of 23000 yen each.  Nearly 6 times what we paid for it.</p>

<p>LaQua features gender separated spa areas, with a few different saunas and indoor and outdoor onsens (hot springs (baths)).  I enjoy the saunas more than the onsens, and I enjoyed the 102 C sauna more than the 80 C sauna, though I enjoyed it for a shorter time (8 mins, versus 15).</p>

<p>We zonked out at separate times while in the mixed gender pajama area, "saving" our chairs that overlooked Tokyo Dome City's Thunder Dolphin while the other enjoyed the hot tub area.  The place got progressively less and less crowded as the night edged on.  I wondered how long it would take me to get tired of the little utopia.</p>

<p>What if, I thought, what if</p>

<p class="dream">I got stuck up on the top of the Big O, like happened in the news recently; I froze my butt off (actually I guarantee I would break out and climb down, though that might not let me get the remainder of the story:) and got to sue the pants off the amusement park company.  I'd be like, "give me 1 meeeellion dollars OR give me unlimited access to TDC and LaQua for me and a guest."</p>
 
<p class="dream">Then I could come whenever I wanted, with whomever I wanted, and it would be like a treat for a day, and really fun.  People would probably be happy to spend a day there, hey wait a minute... I could get dates this way... hey wait a minute, I would start a website like 100datesintokyodomecity.com and have 100 dates in 100 days in Tokyo Dome City, and make a blog out of it, or like a reality TV thing or Heidies.com or whatever.  I'd be an internet phenomenon.</p>
 
<p class="dream">Hmmm.  Actually, let's see; we spent 4000 yen each on TDC, what would have been 3000 yen each for the spa, and let's say 3000 yen for food..  Hmmm.  I could do 100 dates for just 20,000 yen per day, or 2,000,000 yen, ($20,000)...  Hmmmm.</p>
