<p>Just now, as I was writing, using my wireless keyboard on my lap, Michael was all, like,
&quot;hey man, I was thinking about getting a Mac, but I just don't know blah blah, but I see you've
got the wireless keyboard and you're writing while it <em>sitting on your lap</em>.  damn!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dawg, this thing can write from Michiko's <em>desk</em>&quot; And then I prefaced it, well,
it can from that far if there is a line of sight.  It can if there's not direct line of sight:</p>

This is working from her desk. no worries.
