<p>Fridays are hip hop day at work.  Victor and I are the only two teachers to start, so we always
ask Reiko to put the radio on hip hop.  It's awesome because they play uncensored versions of
everything, and none of it is Japanese hip hop.</p>

<p>My first several lessons were definitely easier than my most recent lesson.  He was just reading
and not understanding and reading and no real interest in the text.  Argh.  I keep thinking about
Hamdi (??) from Physics II at UH.  &quot;We will not read the text in this class.  If we only needed
the text, then we could just go home, have a glass of wine, and read the text.  If the text is
silver, then my notes are gold.&quot;</p>

<p>Or some such like that.</p>

<p>On the good side, I chatted with Rie, and she put two pieces on Marble Track II.  I wish Ono
were still here so he could see the completion of the switch; progress is moving along in a
spritely manner these days.</p>

<p>Also enjoyed chatting with Aki; today is her 9793rd day on earth.  29 August of this year will
be 10,000.  (If my calculations slash memory were slash are correct)</p>

<p>Akiko is giggling in the next room; her English is the best of all the students in this school.
Really delightful.</p>
