<p>Eeek.  I've got to be on the train in less than 4.5 hours, and I'm running out of energy to get
ready.  I've been cleaning my desk for the past few hours, and downloading some Japanese study
materials, and got an email from Emilio:</p>

Dear Robert,

How have you been my old friend? It has been four years since I talked with you. I pray that all is
well with you and the people in your life. The last time I heard your voice was on my answering
machine. I did not know you had called until much later. My mom thought she had saved the message
but mistakenly erased it. I did not have your home number so I called your job. It was too late they
said you had already left the country. I want to apologize for not attending your going away
party. It would have been nice to see you before you left. I believe true friends should always
impart a blessing upon one another as they part. I have missed our friendship these last few years
and prayed we would someday cross paths once more.

I am using my sister's computer and email address because I do not have my own. You heard me
correctly no computer, no cell phone, no email, no nada! I am a dinosaur when it comes to modern
technology. So remember I will try to respond to your email as soon as possible. So give me a call
here in Houston, or write me by email I guess.  I will be waiting to hear from you soon! 
God Bless You Robert!

Emilio!

I understand this is not your email address, so I give special thanks
to Arthur for relaying the message to you.

I am enjoying Tokyo, and plan to stay here for the foreseeable future.
 However I do plan to come back to Houston this summer, and surprise
my family (so don't tell them!)

I'm still single, still a bit crazy, still wondering what I will do
this lifetime.

I've been teaching English as my basic work in Japan.  Fortunately,
that has taken me around the world (twice!) and even funded some
wonderful(?) vacation time in Jerusalem to boot.

I broke my shoulder near the end of a 1400km bicycle ride (solo)
around the center of Japan.  (I was 100km from home).  I didn't have
insurance, so I've been working hard to pay for the surgery.  US$4500.
 With blessings from God, I've got 100% mobility and strength in my
shoulder, and no pain.

Thank you for getting in touch with me!  I've thought about you more
than once during my adventures here.  I have many

many

many

many stories.  And I always love answering your questions.

I send love and blessings for your sister.  I'm glad you were able to
speak with her just before her transition to God's house.

   With Love Love Love
    - Rob!
