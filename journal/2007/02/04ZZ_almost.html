<p>Fun times here; I could definitely get in to this.  Unless it's just terrible to have nurses
fussing over us all day tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to seeing Jeff's documentary of travelin'
across India; he has a copy and may show us tomorrow.  He's actually a reserve candidate, so will
probably have to go home shortly.</p>

<p>Something is causing brutal slowness on my machine.  I think it has to do with FireFox, but
there are two large variables: 1 is flaky internet access, and 2 is the GTDGmail extension that I
installed earlier.  I have a guess it's the latter, but I'm not yet sure.</p>

<p>Also weird: even <em>emacs</em> is slow (perhaps just at disk-access time), which basically has
never happened before.  My CPU is chillin' with 80% free time and the HD is quiet.  The system seems
to be running at a low intensity.  Not sure what's the dealio.</p>

<p>I've enjoyed being silly here.  Just not really caring what people think of me or whatever.
Acting sorta clowny wearing PJs all old-man-wedgie style, or all low ridin' hip hop style.  Maybe
it's cause there are no girls to impress.  We're just guys and I don't care what they think.</p>

<p>Also of note:  Ryan, whose name I have learned and forgotten af few times over the first two
years I was in Japan, and then he just quit telling me anymore.... and I thought I had seen the
last of him at Carla and Maria's byebye party in Shibuya  (I only see him at parties Carla
attends).. well, he's here at the trial.  Amazing.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;well, the good thing is, I'll never forget your name again.&quot;</p>

<p>He said he was also bad at names, but that he remembered mine because I was famous.
&quot;what???&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, with your dancing, and your reputation at NOVA..&quot;</p>

<p>What???</p>

<p>Hmmmmm.</p>
