<p>Just had three lessons, with a woman named Akiko being the star of the second.  She speaks French
a bit, and the first time I met her (at Shibuya), she was like, &quot;I speak French well, but now I
want to speak English, but I'm afraid of losing my French,&quot; or some such like that.  I remember
being really excited about this, and I wanted to speak French with her, save for the detail that I
know so little French that I can't say &quot;my French sucks&quot; as much as I can say &quot;I
don't speak French,&quot; which is about the only thing I can say in French.</p>

<p>Anywayssssss, she's wonderfully attractive in her looks and mannerisms and humor.  I'd love to go
out with her, but somehow, there seems to be a block of sorts; maybe it's simply a few difficulties
in communication; maybe it's a ЗњСА shell that would be challenging to overcome.</p>

<p>So, I simply enjoyed chatting with her, and encouraged her to begin planning her new life in
France, because that's where she wants to go.</p>

<p>I gave her the advice Joe McMoneagle gave to me:  &quot;Just begin planning.&quot;</p>
