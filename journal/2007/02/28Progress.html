<p>Last month I officially finished paying Hitomi back for the money she loaned me when I broke my
shoulder.  Today I officially finished paying Michael back for the money he loaned me when I broke
my shoulder.  And I am headed to the ward office now to get my gaijin card, so I won't have to carry
my passport around Tokyo any more.</p>

<p>Woah.</p>

<p>I gave them my passport, and then sat down to work on flash until they gave me my card.  Got the
card and continued working on flash.</p>

<p>Very lucky because I hadn't noticed he hadn't given me my passport at the same time.</p>

<p>He noticed a bit later and gave it to me with an apology.</p>

<p>Holy cripes.  That woulda been bummy had I had to return for my passport!  I imagine I woulda
felt like an idiot and really angry at myself.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Did I feel inspired to stay due to some unconscious guidance not wanting me to forget?</p>
