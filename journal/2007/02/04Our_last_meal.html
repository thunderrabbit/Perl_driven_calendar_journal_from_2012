<p class="date">2:19pm JST Sunday  4 February 2007 (day 13465)</p>

<p>Just finished our &quot;last meal&quot; before going into a fast for tonight and then apparently
limited chowing in the hospital during the next week.  I actually have a bit of breakfast that I
cooked this morning: roboyaki in a plastic container.</p>

<p>Now taxi-time to the clinic</p>

<p>Conversation included Borat, penguins blowing seals, food, life in Japan, stories from past drug
trials, Mike's stories from working in a host bar, and as a juggler.</p>
