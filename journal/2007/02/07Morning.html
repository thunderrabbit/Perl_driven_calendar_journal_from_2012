<p>Sitting on the train headed for work and feeling rather like I've had a productive morning.
After working for over an hour on flash, I uploaded several more vids to youtube, including: the
roller coasters Fujiyama and Orichi; me, Jesse, and Takako playing around a park in Kawasaki; brief
snippet of climbing Mt Fuji back in July 2004; riding my bicycle down some stairs, and others.  Oh,
and I uploaded a video of The Heidies in the ball bath.</p>

<p>Uploaded some images, including in-progress construction of track in Shibuya, and escalators in
Sakurashinmachi.  Plus the ring I made last night for Marble Track 2.</p>

<p>Basically just getting a lot of shizzle of my compizzle.</p>

<p>I replied / archived 15 emails, reducing my inbox load from 219 to 204 messages.</p>

<p>Headed early to work so I can chow a bit and work on the marble track.  Hopefully the ring will
fit perfectly.</p>

<p>Now in Shibuya station. ¤è¤·¡ª</p>
