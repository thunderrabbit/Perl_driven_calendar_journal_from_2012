<p>So then we headed home and in Yoyogi I was like, "oh shit, I'm cutting it reallllly close to get my train in Shibuya."  Basically I was counting on the train being late, which it often is.</p>

<p>I got myself on the right end of the train, in Shibuya bolted down the stairs from Yamanote to Hachiko Plaza, bolted down the stairs into the shopping area, bolted down the stairs to Denentoshi, where I was greeted by a security guard who told me gently I had missed the train.</p>

<p>"Really?" I was afraid of that.  I peered around at the sign to confirm his story, and then</p>

<p>and then</p>

<p>and then I heard the bell ring for the doors to close.</p>

<p>WHAT?</p>

<p>I bolted down to the line but had missed the doors by about 8 seconds.</p>

<p>That fucking mother fucker!!  If he hadn't stopped me I would have fucking made the train!</p>

<p>Fuck me, if *I* hadn't believed him I would have made the train!</p>

<p>Pissed off, I went back upstairs and yelled at the guy, basically screamed at him THE TRAIN WAS THERE YOU FUCKING IDIOT WHY DID YOU STOP ME???  YOU WASTED THOSE TEN SECONDS AND I MISSED THE TRAIN!!</p>

<p>He noted I was angry, but basically ignored me and I just went away.</p>

<p>My mom says I have a problem with getting angry very quickly.  She's probably right.</p>

<p>So now I'm in the cyber cafe for the night 1300 yen for internet and free drinks (including banana milk!  mmmmm), which is something I've "wanted" to do, but I would like to have *my* computer so I can check my email.  No way I'm logging on to my account on some public M$ box.</p>

<p>I created a yahoo email address I intend to never use again to send this and the previous journal entry.  (and any others I send toniight before I leave in about 4 or 5 hours)</p>
