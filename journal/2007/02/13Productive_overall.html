<p>Though I missed an online meeting with Tariq (d'oh!), I've been working on the game today...  I
basically retooled the back end to save user data in a different way so that it will be easier to
save to the network once we get to that stage.  He called me at 10:15 (an hour after we were
supposed to meet) and wasn't upset at all; Tariq's a good boss, it seems.  &quot;I thought we had a
meeting at 9:15,&quot; ¤À¤±¡£</p>

<p>Anyway blah blah</p>

<p>I'm headed to work now, where I may have to talk to *that* boss, who is <em>not</em> as good of
a manager as Tariq.</p>

<p>Oh, also I called Lloyd's to ressurect my old money-transfer account.  They have my information,
but said I'll need to start from scratch since I haven't used it in so long.  That means sending 2
forms of ID, which means I'll need to get a gaijin card.  I haven't had one since I went through
immigration in Kobe on PB 49 (april 2005 ish)</p>

<p>Wrote to Kaoru (lives in my area, speaks English like a pro.  (ah wait, she is a professional
translator.. hmm)) to find out where our local ward office is.</p>
