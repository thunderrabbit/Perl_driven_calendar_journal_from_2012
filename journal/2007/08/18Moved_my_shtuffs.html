<p>Supa special thanks to Ami for shtoring my shtuff while I was in the US, and today for helping
me move it to my new apartment.  I'm all moved in, though not all unpacked.</p>

<p>So far just a few articles of clothing are unpacked, plus the green bouncy ball-chair, plus my
NIN album cover art things.</p>

<p>Now it's nap time, and then we're going to go to Kawasaki and perhaps watch a movie, and
then bunk out at a love hotel for the night.  Our first one.</p>
