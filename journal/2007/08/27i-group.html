<p>Just got back from I-group; it was my first meeting since I staffed the MKP weekend in Houston.
David said he could see in my eyes that I had staffed; he said I looked more grounded.  I told him
that I could understand the difference as he was saying that.  I was more able to look him in the
eye as a man among men.  Plus, I led the overall process tonight, which I hadn't done in quite a
while.</p>
