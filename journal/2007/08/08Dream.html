<p class="dream">Talking with YA and UH friends about a grave situation, and the aliens behind the
glass were watching and listening intently.  Then I thought to ask the aliens what they thought of
the situation.  The one began to speak like, &quot;there are great questions of the universe,&quot;
and such, and then a beautiful alien (same as the blue eyed blonde I-see-dead-people character from
the most recent Harry Potter film) was going to speak, but then we were wanting a way to record it,
so we unlocked a different thing and all these little green balls came floating down over to where
she was, and she basically beautifully swam in them, and they were recording all her thoughts as I
was wondering about an extra-terrestrial relationship with this beautiful alien.  She was off the
hook sexy.</p>
