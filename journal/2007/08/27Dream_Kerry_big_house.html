<p class="dream">About to go chill in the hot tub of a big house, I had been given the keys and the
alarm code, because the owners were going out somewhere.  I poured water into the hot tub and was
getting my other stuff together, when I wanted to go check the rest of the house.  I thought about
punching in the alarm code for security, but chose not to and just looked through the eyepiece
instead.  I saw a woman dressed in red coming up to the door.  I didn't want to interact with
anyone, so I backed up and went around into the kitchen, and by the time I had gone around, she was
in the house!  I hadn't heard her come in, but I confronted her, &quot;hey; what are you doing in
here?&quot; and she calmly explained that she was the representative from the utility companies and
was checking the usage.</p>

<p class="dream">I appraised how cooly she had said that, and I was like, &quot;okay, you seem like
a really detailed person; give me one more bit of proof that you are who you say,&quot; and I
noticed she was drawing in a cool way on the poster in front of her.  The poster looked all gray,
but where she drew, an image was shown underneath the gray.  She had written &quot;Kerry&quot; in
lovely script, and she said something about a drum which turned out to imply she was going to throw
a drum onto my toe to stop me from confronting her / chasing her.  I was like, &quot;wha??&quot;
when I realized what she had meant.</p>
