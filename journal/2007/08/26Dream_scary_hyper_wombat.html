<p class="dream">At a friend's house during a trip somewhere, I was collecting my stuff for packing
purposes, when her small son came to me after a late night trip to the toilet.  He was like,
&quot;can, you, tuck, me, into, bed, because, it's, dark?&quot; and I was like, &quot;what?  speak
faster?&quot; (grow some balls, you four-year-old!) and he spoke properly, &quot;can you tuck me
into bed because it's dark?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Sure, no problem&quot; and I followed him to his bunk bed, and was a bit
intrigued that it was sunlit when we arrived.  Ah well.  I made sure he was all covered up, and
then I went back out into the main room and reported my activity to his mother.  &quot;The small
one is all tucked in,&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">She asked if he had seemed scared, and I was like, &quot;a little bit.&quot; and
she said it was because of a wombat outside that was attacking and killing small animals and
occasionally people.  I had just been outside with no problem, but when I went back to the window,
she showed me the wombat in a tree.  She told me I should be careful when going outside, and that
it was fortunate that my car was packed, and on the other side of the house.</p>

<p class="dream">Into the car, with all my stuff and as I drove away, I could see the wombat's
movement through the trees, chasing a squirrel.  The wombat moved so quickly it left black blurs or
vanished from sight before reappearing elsewhere.  It wasn't so much chasing the squirrel as the
squirrel had zero chance of escape / survival as it the wombat vanished from where it had been,
appeared at and ate the squirrel, then vanished and reappeared where it had been.</p>

<p class="dream">I drove over to that side of the house, and to the other side of the street so as
to attract the wombat away from the house, if I attracted it at all.  I threw a tennis ball out the
window of the car and suddenly felt bad as a dog ran over to chase the tennis ball.  &quot;Oh
shit,&quot; I thought as the wombat ran down the tree, across the lawn, at the dog, and up another
tree all in about one-twentieth of a second.</p>

<p class="dream">I looked around for the owner of the dog, to tell him what had happened, but
didn't see anyone except for an abandoned car lodged between a properly parked car and a
curb/wall.  It was all too spooky for me,</p>

<p>so I woke up.</p>
