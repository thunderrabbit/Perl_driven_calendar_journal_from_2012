<p>Well, I guess his name is Jason, not Ryan.  Anyway, we said by to Anna and family, then walked
across to Amy's for some good ol' Amy's Ice Cream.  I inquired about the bag I had made as my job
application, but it appears not to have survived 5 years, plus me not getting the job in the first
place (no use training me for less than a month of work)</p>

<p>Rie's English has definitely gotten better (of course!) and she happily bounced between the
languages, alternately leaving Ami or us guys in the dust.</p>

<p>I realized I had been foolish to not get Rie and Ami connected sooner: Rie says she could have
taken Ami shopping at all the good places.  Ah well; next time.</p>

<p>Ice cream was great; conversation was fun and genki.  Good news is Rie will be visiting Japan in
December, so we'll get to see her again sooooon!</p>
