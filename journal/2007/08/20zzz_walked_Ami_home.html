<p>Watched Die Hard 4 tonight.  It was an all English version, so we paused it often to make sure
Ami was catching all the good parts.  She fell asleep about halfway through the movie, though.</p>

<p>After the movie, I was in a hanky panky mood, but she requested waiting until tomorrow so it
won't be so late.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>Walked arm in arm to her bicycle and I figured out why I didn't recognize the street to Satoko's
house from the station.  It's a different station.  (I had thought we were on the opposite end of
the same station, but.)</p>

<p>Ami waved b-bye as I walked to the other end of the station, and then she chased me down on her
bicycle for one more kiss.</p>

<p>Finally left her, but with lots of waves as the distance grew, until out of line-of-sight.</p>

<p>Noted a train engine labeled RIC, with small letters RAIL INSPECTION CAR below the logo.  Hmmm.
There was a guy inside, but the train wasn't moving.  Not sure how long it inspects a given part of
the track.  I thought it would be cool if the train was slowly slowly rolling along the track in an
inspective type way.</p>

<p>Transcribed some of Book 2 of my diary, and now it's time for sleeeeeeeping</p>
