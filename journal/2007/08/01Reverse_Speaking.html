<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>I just watched an interview of Peggy Kane done by Rick Keefe.  Peggy seems to have a more dreary
view of the world than I.  I thought my angels are all 100% loving, but she is saying that reptiles
have infiltrated everywhere, including after death experiences.  Interesting.</p>

<p>I'm not prepared to give up my belief system as yet, but I am willing to watch the second part
of the interview, though I fell asleep during a significant part of the part one.</p>
