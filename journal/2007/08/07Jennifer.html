HI Jennifer

<a href="http://robnugen.com/images/travel/US/Texas/2007/summer/rob_and_spot_reunion/">http://robnugen.com/images/travel/US/Texas/2007/summer/rob_and_spot_reunion/</a>

Just want to thank you again for taking care of Spot, taking us *to*
Spot, and putting up with two of me at the same time in your living
room.

It was great to see you; I hope you're doing wonderfully.

   Love Love
     - Rob!

You are so funny.

I am glad that I got to see you while you were here.  I can't believe that
it had been so long.  It seems like everything has changed and yet nothing
has.  I am glad that you made it back safely and I hope that everything
works out for the very best in your new career choice.

Jen
