<p>I asked Ami to help me carry the spanish moss we had removed from the tree yesterday.  She was
squeamed out by walking through the semi-tall grass with mushy muddy standing water, but on her
second trip I coaxed her like coaxing a child by walking backwards, and then on subsequent trips she
was basically no problem carrying wads of spanish moss and sticks and grass and shizzle to the burn
pizzle.</p>

<p>I pushed her to help me with a pile that was already there, and then she helped on her own
accord when I continued to two other piles, one of which I didn't want to carry because it had rose
bush branches in it.</p>

<p>But after that one, I was like, &quot;aight showertime [for you] and hapily gave her kisses as a
mutual reward for getting it all done.  I think dad will be pretty glad about it too.</p>
