<p>On the way home, Ami tried some more beat boxing.</p>

<p>I led her along some tricky walkways, like on the curb between signs and the street, and between
walls and lamp posts, and over some boxes and a metal mesh cylinder (empty trash can)</p>

<p>She enjoyed the video game and played it until she won.</p>
