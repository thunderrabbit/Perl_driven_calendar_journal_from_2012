<p class="dream">Riding our bicycles with a big group of bicyclists, we came face to face at an
intersection with the Hell's Angels, all big guys with their motorcycles all Rarr Rarr.  One person
in our group was like, &quot;if you check on the Hell's Angels' website, you can find a code that
changes every day.  If you tell them the right code when you see them, they will escort you where
you want to go.</p>

<p class="dream">As the light turned, someone was like, &quot;tell them the code,&quot; and someone
else was like, &quot;eight seven five six&quot; and we all started chanting 8, 7, 5, 6, and sure
enough the entire pod of motorcycles turned our way and were setting up to open a corridor for us
to travel through as I woke up.</p>
