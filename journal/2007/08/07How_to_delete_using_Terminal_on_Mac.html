<p>I just spent several minutes writing how to use rm to delete a file or directory on OS X with
Terminal.  These directions are freeware, and come with no warranty.</p>

<pre>
Open Finder --&gt; Applications --&gt; Utilities --&gt; Terminal

Hit return a few times.

Each time you hit return, you should see a new line appearing on the screen, with a little box or line at the right hand end.

Hitting return a few times is not necessary to delete anything, but it will show you what I mean by "the command line prompt."
That's the name of the line that appears each time you hit Return.  The computer is waiting for you to tell it what to do.  
When you hit return, the computer does whatever is on the line.

In this case, that's nothing, so the computer quickly does nothing and then waits for the next command.

Each time you want to talk to the computer through Terminal, you do it by typing things on the command line and hitting return.

In this email, I'm representing the command line with $ 

There are some hundred commands that can be done on the command line, but we're going to focus on the semi-dangerous command rm.

I say it's dangerous because anything that is removed with rm DOES NOT COME BACK.  No recycle bin, no "oops" command, nothing.  
It's gone gone gone.

(1) HOW TO DELETE A FILE

If you want to delete a file (not a directory), simply type 

$ rm 

with a space after it.  Then drag from Finder to the Terminal window the file you want to delete.  This will write the full 
path of the file to terminal so you don't have to.

The result will look something like

$ rm /Users/Sue/Movies/dumb_and_dumber/dumb.mov

If you are sure you dragged the correct icon to the terminal, then hit return and the file should be deleted.  If you get no 
response, then it's gone.  If you get a Y/N prompt, then hit Y and return and it should be deleted.  If you get an error, then 
the problem is out of the scope of this email.

(look for the command chmod online for likely ways to solve it)

(2) HOW TO DELETE A DIRECTORY (folder)

If you want to delete a directory, add an -r after rm:

$ rm -r /Users/Sue/Documents/I_want_to_delete_this_directory/



Then to close the terminal, type

$ exit

and hit return.

Alt-Q to remove the window if it doesn't go away.


Happy deleting!

Just remember, like in The Matrix, there is no undo.
