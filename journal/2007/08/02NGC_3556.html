<p>Hahaha</p>

<p>Yesterday on <a href="http://galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a>, I came across an image that was way
too zoomed in to make sense of it:</p>

<a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/explore/obj.asp?id=587731890038308882"><img src="/images/science/physics/astronomy/galaxyzoo.org/beautiful/NGC+3556/unnecessary_closeup.jpeg"
/></a>

<p>I zoomed out and got a better sense of it:</p>

<a href="http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/index.php?topic=1494.msg8574#msg8574"><img src="/images/science/physics/astronomy/galaxyzoo.org/beautiful/NGC+3556/912x512_pixels.jpeg"
/></a>

<p>I wrote on the Galaxy Zoo Forum (linked to the image above)</p>

subject: surprisingly close?

There are still five zoom-levels to available...  I know *I'm* surprised!

<p>15 minutes later, a man named altymczuk replied back:</p>

That is NGC 3556.  I think the Hubble Heritage site has an even clearer picture.

<p>Wow.  I'm pleased to imagine that some people know galaxies by name.</p>
