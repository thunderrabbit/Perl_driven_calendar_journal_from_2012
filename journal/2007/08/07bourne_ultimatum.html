<p>Fred and I watched Bourne Ultimatum for $7.50 *total* at the hella cheap theater in Tomball.
Only about eight people in the audience besides us.  Good movie.  Fred thought some of the
fight/chase sequences were too long, but I liked them fine.  I'm glad about Julia Stiles'
character's smile in the end.  I like her (character, don't know about the actress).</p>
