<p>Colleen came up with a great acronym for F.R.E.D.: Fine Real Estate Developments.</p>

<p>Supa thanks to Colleen for driving us around!</p>

arrival, having been required in the bathroom with her kids, but we explained that Fred was
like,</p>

<p>&quot;what?&quot; with a big smile, and &quot;what are you doin' here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm meetin' you for dinner!&quot;</p>

<p>Hugged and greetz all around with Colleen and Ami having never met Fred (oops; Colleen had),
Bill, Dude, Dr Cutie.</p>

<p>The place was pretty packed, but we chowed plenty, including salad and ice cream, and it was
just like old times, all comfortable and fun.</p>

<p>Funny: Fred got up to offer Ami a drink, so I tried to get them to get me some, but they were
both like, &quot;pshhh [as if]&quot;</p>

<p>After dinner, I showed Veronica my toe, which she declared to be just an ingrown toenail.  Slop
some Neosporin on it and stop picking at it.</p>

<p>On the way to the parking lot, Dude found a rectangular column that might as well have been a
ladder, which we both climbed high enough to make a fall rather dangerous.  Francois wasn't scared,
though.</p>

<p>Now chillin' at Fred's with my computer playing music (stored on Amazon S3) through his wireless
something-something thing to his stereo.  Ami is zonked, and Colleen is reading over my left wrist.</p>

<p>.... next we need to finish Operation j.a.n.e.t.t.e.</p>
