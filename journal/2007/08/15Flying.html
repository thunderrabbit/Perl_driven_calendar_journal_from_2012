<p>On the plane now next to a woman from The Philippines who is going back to visit her family
after two years in Florida wih her husband.  She's from Cebu island , which is &quot;like a
comma&quot; among the 70000 islands of Te Pilippines.</p>

<p>There are four hours to go on this flight.  I slept pretty darn well between our first two meals,
and I think there's another meal to come..</p>

<p>Currently I'm not able to see really well because my contacts are out, and I never found my
glasses after coming back to my dad's after MKP weekend.</p>

<p>Holy cats.  My hard drive is completely freaking out and I'm not impressed.  Is it software?
WTF is making it so messed up?</p>

<p>I'm going to put my computer away now.   Sleepy-time for you, computer.  (not me)</p>
