<p>My dumb disk drive is making a ton of noise, but I can't figure out why.  There's basically no
activity in either CPU, disk IO, ethernet IO, and the only applications I have running are Emacs,
Terminal, and now the Activity Monitor.

<p>I had had Firefox open, but even after closing it, my disk was going nuts.</p>
