<p>I got a job!</p>

<p>I'm semi-shocked at how "easy" it was.</p>

<p>I emailed my resume to a few people I know.</p>

<p>Separately, on Friday I set up an interview with one of my ex-students (Akira).</p>

<p>I didn't remember who he was, but his card clearly said IT Recruiting.</p>

<p>He remembered me and set up an interview for today.</p>

<p>I thought I would just be meeting him, but he came in with another guy.</p>

<p>I remembered who Akira was..  He buys and sells companies for fun and profit.</p>

<p>I started talking to the one guy he brought in, and then three more guys came in.</p>

<p>My previous introduction was recounted in Japanese.</p>

<p>They asked a couple questions, talked for a while, and I caught almost nothing besides what I'll
translate as , &quot;do you have anything you can leave with us?&quot;</p>

<p>ちょっとはずかしいんだけど、プリンタがないので、USBキーでresumeがある。</p>

<p>They were like, no problem, and produced a laptop onto which I copied my resume from my USB stick.</p>

<p>They all had a gander, talked some more, then, &quot;do you want to work part time or full time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um.. part time, because there are other projects I'd like to work on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, can you start September 1st?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.</p>

<p>Wait that's a Saturday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, September 3rd.&quot;</p>

<p>And that's how I got my first IT job in Japan.</p>
