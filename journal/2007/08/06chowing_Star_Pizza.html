<p>Chowed Star Pizza at Star Pizza with Molly + Will + Anna + Rachel, plus Fred and Ami and me.  I
think invited Jason, and I know I invited Rie and her boyfriend to come.  They came as it was time
for Rachel et. al. to head home.</p>

<p>We were seated in the upstairs area, with two pizzas ordered and Anna across from me talking,
flirting, eating.</p>

<p>Ami was well-astonished by the size of the &quot;medium&quot; pizzas, which would definitely
whip any &quot;large&quot; pizza in Japan.  (note this is an unverified claim)</p>

<p>I remember being a bit anxious about meeting Rie and her boyfriend (Ryan?), so I went outside
looking for them when they were about 20 minutes later than she said they would likely be there.</p>

<p>I came back up, and then they showed up a couple minutes later.  So great to see Rie again!</p>

<p>I hadn't really mentioned the plans I had built up in my head.  This seems related to 
difficulty in asking people for help.  So when Rie and he arrived, I was like, &quot;I thought we
might all go to Amy's across the street..&quot; and as I was speaking realized I should maybe not
mention ice cream in front of the girls who needed to go to bed.</p>

<p>It worked out well.  As I'm writing this, I realize now I should definitely write a thank you
note or 4.</p>
