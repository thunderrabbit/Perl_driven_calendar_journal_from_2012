<p>Nice.  Ami and I are at the zoo, with first stop being the aquarium.  There were some docents
with various aquatic animal body parts for touching purposes, and then two docents at a tank with
two sea turtles.</p>

<p>One of them was all, &quot;these are green sea turtles, about five years old.  They will reach
full size when they are fifteen years old.  They will live to be eighty years old, but actually we
will let them go in September; the Houston Zoo is helping rehabilitate them.  The Houston Zoo is the
only facility in the area certified to rehabilitate sea turtles,..&quot;</p>

<p>And I tried to collect all the deets in my mind and translated for Ami.</p>

<p>Then the other docent was like, &quot;your Japanese is really good,..&quot;</p>

<p>A bit shocked, I asked how she knew Japanese, and as her friend was like, &quot;she's completely
crazy about Japan,&quot; Sabina answered, &quot;well, I've just had a fascination for the culture
and everything..&quot; etc etc and she asked if I am in the JET Program.  No, but I do recommend
it, except for the long preparation time required (after 1/4 of the first year they are like,
&quot;you wanna sign up for year 2??&quot;)</p>

<p>Anyway, as it was time to leave, I thought it appropriate to give some way to give her more
information.  Gave her my email address, plus &quot;日本語がんばってね！&quot; from Ami, and we'll
see what happens.</p>

<p>Now we're close to the monkey exhibit and Ami is drinking a cup of Sprite as I'm thinking of what
to write.</p>
