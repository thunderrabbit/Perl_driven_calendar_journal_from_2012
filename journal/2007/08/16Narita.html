<p>Met a law student named Amanda on our way through customs.  It was her first time to arrive in
Japan; I happily offered support where it seemed useful.  She's headed to Nagoya now to meet some
peeps and go up into the mountains.  Should be nice.</p>

<p>I'm headed to Nippori and then Shinjuku to get my rent situated, and then play with Ami!</p>

<p>I just corrected the time on my computer.</p>

<p>Never figured out why the days old thing was wack, but I ain't gonna worry about it now.</p>
