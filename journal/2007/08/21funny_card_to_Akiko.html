<p>I forgot to take a picture of it before sending, but I remember being pretty pleased with the
card I wrote for Akiko.  It went something like this:</p>

<pre>
Since you asked me for my address, I thought it would make more sense to send it to you my snail
mail than by email since you are an analog girl in a digital world.  Since my absence, I've gotten
you no presents, not even incense.  Don't be incesed, I've had very few cents.  Since I can't clean
your residence, nor mend my neighbor's fence, I'm pleased to report we don't live in tents.  This is
the address where I pay my rents:

¢©211-0016¿Ó∫Íª‘√Ê∏∂∂Ëª‘•Œƒ⁄510#203
                              ^
                            no offense!
</pre>

<p>The prevalence of &quot;sense&quot; variants was precipitated by the card I sent, which featured
the words &quot;Perfect Sence&quot; with 'sense' misspelled.  I thought it was pretty funny, and
hoped Akiko would like it, especially because her English is darn good.</p>

<p>I met Ami at Motosumiysohi station and she read while I finished Akiko's card.  I had her read
it, and then I read it and she commented that it sounded like a rap.  I was like, &quot;aight; then
you beatbox, and I'll rap it.&quot;</p>

<p>At first she was like, &quot;impossible&quot; but after some encouragement slash chiding, gave
it a good go, and I realized that's why I love this girl.</p>
