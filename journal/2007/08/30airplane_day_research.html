<p>&quot;... and then 20 minutes after, I just saw another plane coming on the back side, making a huge turn and
then hitting the other tower.&quot;</p>

<p>Not until today have I even <em>considered</em> the possibility that the planes were faked.  I
saw the plane hit the tower on live TV, so I knew a plane hit the tower.</p>

<p>But, I've just been watching some vids that present some interesting points.</p>

<p>The one I've linked above has an interesting quote from a kid.  What &quot;huge turn&quot; could
he have seen?</p>

<p>When airliners do huge turns, it takes a couple minutes.  Had it taken a couple of minutes, he
wouldn't have been able to see it, such would have been the radius of the turn.  Plus, there was
plenty to see all around him with people scrambling and screaming.</p>

<p>Just watch the first 60 seconds of this
video: <a href="http://www.livevideo.com/video/genghis6199/5980BE5B76064C188E97897EA718CF16/nootpads-nbt-video.aspx">video
of second tower explosion</a></p>

<p>I'm pretty tired; haven't slept, but have been checking out a bunch of videos, and made
a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=E591F4D0248A5BA9">playlist for Airplane
Day</a>.</p>

announced WTC 7 collapsed... before it collapsed</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a more professionally done video proving the demolition was an intentional demolition.
I think the proof is in what *other* fires have been sustained by steel structures that didn't
bring them down.</p>

<p>From the video, some screenshots of fires that did *not* cause their respective buildings to
collapse:</p>
