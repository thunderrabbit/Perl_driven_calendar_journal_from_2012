<p>I just met Kare, or maybe Karen, from Brazil.  She lives across the hall from me, and has been
in that room for about a year.  She's going to show me around he neighborhood soon.</p>

<p class="date">12:46pm JST</p>

<p>It's Karen.</p>

<p>I just got back after shopping in Motosumiyoshi on Ye Olde Bremen Dori.  Bought some bananas,
laundry detergent, a soap dish, and glasses.</p>

<p>Total price: 61,000 yen.</p>

<p>Upon arrival home, I met Q (short for Qian Chow Chen, perhaps), a researcher / assistant
professor at Keio University in Hiyoshi.</p>
