<p>At Fred's suggestion / taking over the audio-visual, we watched about half of two episodes of
SPYS.  I didn't really like it, but I guess it was sorta interesting.  Hard to know what was fake
and what was real, especially given that there were camera people running around...  how did they
not alert the whole community as to what was up??</p>
