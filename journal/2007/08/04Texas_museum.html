<p>Ami enjoyed the Texas Museum.  Actually we didn't go into the museum proper, but we were in the
rather large entrance and the gift shop, where she bought a couple of gifts, and Fred enlivened a
stuffed elephant puppet.</p>

<p>Outside, after the movie, I climbed and jumped around on the benches near the big star in front
of the place.  I was able to jump from bench to bench on the outside of a lamp:</p>

<pre>
    
      =========
      !*/
      !/
      !
     /!
======!
</pre>

<p>The = and ! are benches, and the * is the lamp post (top view).  The / are my jumping path, from
bottom left to top center.  I made it the first time by &quot;catching&quot; the lamp, but then the
second time after almost giving up the attempt, I thought, <em>what if I flat <b>had</b> to do
this?</em> and I did it relatively easily.</p>
