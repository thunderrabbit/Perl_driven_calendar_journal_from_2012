<p class="dream">Crouched over a smattering of gears and axles, my dad and I were working together
to build a clock, using no plans, and no experience.  We both believed we had the best ideas on how
to do it, and we ended up sorta fighting over techniques and resources.  One of the axles
was actually an ink cartridge from a ball point pen, and it had little flared points to hold the
spring in place.  We needed to add a gear between two gears on it, so my dad used pliers to pull it
out, but upon extraction, it got bent at the flared points.</p>

<p class="dream">I was grumbling, &quot;dammit, it fucking got bent,&quot; as if the project had
been ruined  by that one point.  I realized in fact, that axle would need not just to have a gear
in between two gears, but to allow one of the gears to spin freely.  I decided we needed to take
this even more slowly, so I suggested we just get the three gears that needed to go on this axle
and see if we could get them aligned and spinning</p>

<p class="dream">My dad's response was along the lines of, &quot;do you think you can put your cup
on a coaster for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I shook my head like, &quot;wtf?&quot; and then just tossed the cup outside, but
spilling cola on the clock project in the process.  &quot;Why do you care about the drink?  &quot; I
demanded.  &quot;It means nothing compared to this project, and working with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Now,&quot; my dad soothingly replied, &quot;we just need to be careful about
this surface and not get stains or marks on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">That pissed me off even more.  &quot;Dad, working with you is more important than
any cup or table; I didn't even think about the cup being there.&quot; Then I wondered why we were
fighting.  I cooled down a little bit and was like, &quot;I'm sorry we've turned to fighting,
especially considering I don't even know why we started, though my best guess is because 
I got pissy when that axle got bent.</p>

<p class="dream">Dad disagreed it was that point, but didn't offer any further suggestions.</p>
