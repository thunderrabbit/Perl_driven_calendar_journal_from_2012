<p>I'm tard.</p>

<p>That's the pronunciation of &quot;I'm tired&quot; that Fred (and I?) sometimes use.  I'm too
tired to remember who does it more.</p>

<p>Today was a good day.  Quite productive in the burning branches and eating free pizza
departments, plus I got three photo albums uploaded.  And have read nearly to the climax of the
Louis L'amour book I'm reading.</p>

<p>Nighty night.</p>
