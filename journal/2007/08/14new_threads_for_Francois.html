<p>Ate at Applebee's with Dad and Karen, and after getting a pic of Francois and my salad, Karen
determined that Francois needed some pants.  I was like, &quot;his name is Francois, not
pantswa..&quot; She laughed and assured me we could get something across the street at Hobby
Lobby.</p>

<p>Then I assured her that if Francois could carry it, I would let him get it.  So, now he's
getting a backpack to carry his changes of clothes.  Hilarious!</p>
