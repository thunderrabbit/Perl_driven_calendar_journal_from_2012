<p>Not all that big, but big enough to be a bit worrisome with the surroundings.  Fred and I had
big fun burning a bunch of dry branches and spanish moss today.</p>

<p>All showered now.  I read some of <em>Silver Canyon</em> by Louis L'amour while waiting for dark
and letting the fire burn down.  Utterly soaked it in water until I could stand barefootedly on the
coals in 3 inches of water.  Amazingly, the ground felt like a mid-summer day's heat.  The fire had
cooked it well enough that I was like, &quot;yeow!&quot;  but it actually wasn't *all* that bad.
Just pleasantly surprising.</p>
