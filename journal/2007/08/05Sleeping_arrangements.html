<p>Karen is not here, but her rules still are.  Dad was like, &quot;Karen has asked that you and
Ami sleep separately.&quot;  I was like, &quot;okay,&quot; but inside completely astonished that
such a request would be made.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I told Dad that I thought the rule was designed to punish me or to punish
him.  I don't feel welcome here, so I won't likely stay here, which is a punishment for my dad, and
if I stay, I won't get to snuggle with Ami, nor more importantly in this case, won't get to monitor
her closely as she is having difficulty breathing due to her allergies to cats.</p>

<p>Dad was like, &quot;you are welcome here; but those are just some rules.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, feeling uncomfortable around Karen kept me from coming last week while I stayed at
Maggie's.  It's only by chance that Karen is out of town now when we came, but I sure am glad she's
not here.&quot;</p>

<p>Dad was like, &quot;I'm afraid she's going to drive you boys away from me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I agreed. &quot;Me too, and I would really hate for that to happen.&quot;</p>
