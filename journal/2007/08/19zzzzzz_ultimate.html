<p>Too tired (*) to get my computer out and write about what a wonderful day I had playing ultimate.
Super low turnout, though: Yoshio, Kerry, Doug, Carl, Jeremy, Jason B, me, and a guy named Mike, who
came out for his first time today.</p>

<p>Most fun: the random *game* we played after our game devolved into terrible throws ust for the
funny of it.</p>

<p>I was continuously counting stall counts, even if i was no where near the disc, and even if I
was throwing the disc.  We threw in random directions to random people, including successful throws
to Yoshio's self, 3 of 4 attempts.</p>

<p>Then Draft King for a total of six people (Kerry went home early to bake a chocolate cake (yeah,
right))</p>

<p>(*) I just now almost fell asleep again.  Good night.</p>

<p>I just wrote

of the game</a> on the <a href="http://outdoorjapanforums.com/eve/forums/a/frm/f/9511072951">Tokyo
Ultimate forum</a>.</p>

<pre>
Cited as the lowest turnout since "that time it snowed three years ago," game play featured three
skins on three shirts plus one sub, and then once Jason B arrived by bicycle from Shinagawa, 4 on
4. A decent breeze and consistent cloud cover kept the day just cool enough for everyone to play
several points in a row.

Near the end, we played a game to 5, during which Mike Ellis (our third Mike, if I understand
correctly) tried to retire, but we peer pressured him into finishing out the game, saying "just one
more point," a couple of times after the subsequent points continued to not finish the game.

Back to three on three, the game devolved into silliness, with all the right words being shouted,
but the disc going all the wrong directions to anyone who happened to be willing to run.

In attendance: Yoshio, Kerry, Wonderboy, Carl, Doug, Jeremy, American Mike, jei, and quietly cheerleading: Ami.

Notably missing: the rest of you
