<p>Special thanks to Ma for driving to Austin!  We happened by UnCommon Objects, so I took a
picture of Francois on/near janette's stuff.</p>

<p>Colleenie Beanie is on her way here now to hang out and then drive us to
janette's <em>house</em> where I hope to surprise her (janette), and then to Mandola's to meet Dude
&amp; Dr Cutie, and, complete Operation F.R.E.D. by surprising Fred.</p>

<p>On the way here, we stopped in Buc-ee's (sp) to get some beverages, and I saw some cool cutting
boards and some serving thingies that Suzanne might have liked, if I had bought one and not just
taken a picture.</p>

<p>Ami says アメリカに住みたい。</p>

<p>Wow.  I've sorta been thinking the same thing.</p>
