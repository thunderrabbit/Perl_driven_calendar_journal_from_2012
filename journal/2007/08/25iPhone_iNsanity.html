<p>Fred sent me this:</p>

<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230164884672">World's Second Unlocked iPhone</a>.

<p>The price was at $19,000,000 when I saw it.  Now as I write this 10 minutes later, it's at
$38,000,000.</p>

<p>And now as I post this, it's at $59,000,000</p>

<p>Somehow, I don't think it's going to go for that much.</p>

<p class="date">8:49am JST Saturday 25 August 2007 (day 13667)</p>

<p>Now it's at $79,000,000</p>

<p class="date">8:55am JST</p>

<p>For the past several seconds, bidding has been stuck at $99,999,999.00</p>
