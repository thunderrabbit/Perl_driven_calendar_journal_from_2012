<p>Met Ami after her work and went shopping on Bremen Dori (again), though this time she was much
more purchasy than I had been.  Two bowls, a pan for cooking (ramen), an egg-fryin' skillet, on my
suggestion, plus a bamboo spatual for it, chop sticks, and some portable chop sticks so I can help
save the planet two sticks at a time..  A toothbrush holder and tissues rounded out the order.</p>

<p>Draggingly tired on the way home, with one small miss,  was able to lead us in through the back
way.  I took a shower while Ami cooked ramen, and then <em>I fell asleep while eating</em> at least
twice, but I think three times.  She watched and laughed; it was certainly way funny, but not
endorphinic enough to keep me awake through the next bite.</p>

<p>We snoozed for a bit and she just headed home.  Wonderfully, that entails just 15 minutes
walking, and 6 minutes of bicycling.  No more hurrying before last train, nor taxis if she misses
last train.  Lovely!</p>

<p>Just now I was sidetracked watching videos
of <a href="http://www.google.co.jp/search?q=Cyclone%20Gonu%20lashed%20Muscat">Cyclone Gonu</a>,
the <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/photogalleries/extreme-weather/photo7.html">first
documented cyclone in the Arabian Sea</a>, according to National Geographic.</p>
