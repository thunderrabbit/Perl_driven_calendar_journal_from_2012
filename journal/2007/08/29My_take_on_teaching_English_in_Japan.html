    <br/>
    First, I want to say a bit about the schools in Tokyo.&nbsp; There are about
    4 ways to teach in Tokyo.&nbsp; One is with a conversation school.&nbsp; The
    four big schools are NOVA, Geos, Aeon, and Berlitz.&nbsp; They are like
    chain restaurants with locations in various places around the
    city/country.&nbsp; In these schools, you'd generally be teaching smaller
    classes, like 1 to 4 students, or a bit more if you teach kids. Some
    students come quite frequently, so you'll get to know them, and some come
    just once a month or so.&nbsp; Classes are about 40 minutes to an hour long.<br/>
    <br/>
    Another way to teach is with a public school.&nbsp; I have heard of cases
    where teachers work directly with the school as far as salary, etc, but have
    never done this myself.&nbsp; I have substitute taught (and been a guest
    teacher) a couple of times (and I was Santa Claus once, but that's a
    different story) at public schools.&nbsp; There were about 40 or 50 students
    in the class, and I saw it as pretty chaotic and difficult environment to do
    very much but give a Conversation Of The Day, practice a couple times,&nbsp;
    hand out and collect homework.&nbsp; Classes are about 40 minutes long.<br/>
    <br/>
    (I believe JET helps people get started teaching in public schools.&nbsp;
    The few people I've met / known in JET say they really like it.&nbsp; The
    trick is their long setup time, like 9 months.&nbsp; So, 3 months into your
    first year, they ask if you're ready to sign up for year number 2.)<br/>
    <br/>
    A third way to teach is to find your own students and meet in cafes.&nbsp;
    <a href="http://findateacher.net/" target="_blank">http://findateacher.net/</a>
    is the most popular way I know to get started in this.&nbsp; The good thing
    about this is you totally control your own schedule and your own
    price.&nbsp; But the hard thing is balancing numbers of students / free
    time.. I would have students for a while, then they would quit for some
    reason or another.&nbsp; And then it was hard to find another student to
    fill in that timeslot.&nbsp; Also, a problem is I'm lazy and don't want to
    make a big effort to find students and work.<br/>
    <br/>
    A fourth way is with a company that sends teachers to businesses, and
    classes are taught to groups of co-workers all in the same company.&nbsp; I
    know a guy who's doing this, but I don't know any details.<br/>
    <br/>
    Okay.<br/>
    <br/>
    I have done options 1 and 3 above (conversation schools and
    <a href="http://findateacher.net" target="_blank">findateacher.net</a>).<br/>
    <br/>
    I came over with NOVA and worked for 1 year.
    <a href="http://teachinjapan.com/" target="_blank">
    http://teachinjapan.com/</a> The good thing about NOVA (and there are very
    few good things about NOVA) is you can quit easily once you get here and
    they won't be phased by it.&nbsp; The average duration of a NOVA teacher is
    like 3 months, or something really short like that.&nbsp; The school only
    cares about making wads of cash; they don't care about teaching the
    students.&nbsp; However, some NOVA teachers do stay for a really really long
    time.&nbsp; If one can submit to the rules of NOVA and not actually care
    about teaching, it's an easy squeezy braindead job.&nbsp; I encourage you
    *not* to go with NOVA.<br/>
    <br/>
    I have also worked for 1 year at a school called Gaba.&nbsp;
    <a href="http://careers.gaba.co.jp/" target="_blank">http://careers.gaba.co.jp/</a>&nbsp;
    I don't know if they hire people who are not currently in Japan, but you can
    contact them.&nbsp; Gaba's good point (for me) is teaching 1-to-1
    lessons.&nbsp; I believe I can help more easily if I can talk to one person,
    figure out what they need to work on, and tailor a lesson exactly for them.
    &nbsp; Gaba's other good point is also its bad point: numbers of students to
    teach per week is not guaranteed.&nbsp; If we have a student, we get paid,
    if there's no student scheduled, no pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally speaking, if
    you work during the busy times (nights and weekends), then you will have
    plenty of students and make enough money.&nbsp; And as students get to know
    you (and like you), they will choose your lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Schedules are
    made a month in advance, so I can schedule time off for myself next month,
    just by telling the school manager.<br/>
    <br/>
    I have also worked for a year with English Village.&nbsp;
    <a href="http://english-village.net/" target="_blank">http://english-village.net/</a>&nbsp;
    This school is similar to Gaba in that the scheduling is done on an ongoing
    basis.&nbsp; In the same way, pay is not guaranteed, but if you work in the
    busy times, you'll have plenty of students at it will be fine.&nbsp; I know
    teachers who have worked for *years* at English Village.&nbsp; Like 4 years,
    5 years, 8 years, 10 years.&nbsp; I recommend English Village if you want to
    work at a conversation school in Tokyo.&nbsp; (I don't know if they will
    take teachers with no experience, though)<br/>

    <br/>
    I've been based in Tokyo for four years now.&nbsp; I've taught solidly for 3
    years, and spent 1 year semi-teaching and traveling (very long story
    involving a cruise ship).&nbsp; I've gotten a good start on year five, now,
    and will be doing IT work instead of just teaching.&nbsp; Maybe some of
    both.&nbsp;

    <br/>
    In the conversation schools, about 8 or 10 classes, 40 minutes each, with a
    few breaks sprinkled in.&nbsp; Schedule details depend on the school.<br/>

    Yes yes.&nbsp; It will likely cost about US$2000 to US$3000 to get started
    in the first couple of months in Japan, but after that point, you should be
    in a positive cash flow from your job.<br/>

    There are enough English speakers in Tokyo that there are some magazines
    that cater to that population, but it's still semi-rare for me to see a
    foreigner here.&nbsp; I almost always acknowledge foreigners with a
    nod/smile or even talking to them when I see one.<br/>

  </blockquote>
  <div>
    <br/>
    Um, yes, but there is some racism.&nbsp; For example, Japanese people would
    generally rather sit next to another Japanese instead of next to me.&nbsp; I
    don't see this every day, but it's often enough that I notice.<br/>

    <br/>
    There are demonstrations, but they are peaceful and hypocritical.&nbsp;
    Generally speaking they are just a guy yelling through a microphone about
    how Japan should be kept pure.&nbsp; But generally he is ignored by everyone
    but a tiny crowd around him.&nbsp; I've heard of cases where the guy will
    have McDonald's for lunch and then be back on the microphone yelling about
    the greatness of Japan.&nbsp; I've also heard they are complaining more
    about non-Japanese Asians than Westerners... &nbsp; Except that they are
    loud and annoying, these are easily ignored.<br/>

For me, the biggest difference is in the amount of physical contact /
person-to-person connections in Japan vs US.&nbsp; In the US, I hug my friends
all the time, and in Japan they just don't hug.&nbsp; That took a long time for
me to get accustomed.&nbsp; In Tokyo that may be different than in different
cities.&nbsp; It's been rather difficult for me to make real friends with
Japanese here in Japan.&nbsp; I can say I have 2 Japanese friends.&nbsp; One is
my girlfriend, and another is a guy who has lived in China and Canada.&nbsp;
He's Japanese, but has a good infusion of life outside Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason I have so few Japanese friends here is that I don't go out
and drink, which is the number one official Thing To Do for Japanese.&nbsp; Or
so it seems to me.<br/>
<br/>
You said you've been fascinated with Japan for a while.&nbsp; Why don't you come
visit?&nbsp;
<a href="http://couchsurfing.com" target="_blank">http://couchsurfing.com</a>
can be a viable option for finding places to stay for a night or a few at a time
(depends on the couch).<br/>
<br/>

Any other questions are welcome.&nbsp; :-)<br/>
