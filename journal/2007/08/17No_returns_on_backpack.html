<p>I'm in Shibuya, on the Tokyu Toyoko line (my favorite), about to meet Ami in Nakameguro before
heading to my apartment.</p>

<p>Just finished visiting Eagle Creek's Japanese distributor A&amp;E near Shinjuku in an attempt to
replace my lifetime guaranteed backpack.</p>

<p>Good things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I was able to use English (with a guy named Shin)</p></li>

<li><p>He said I can use his name when I call Eagle Creek</p></li>

<li><p>The backpacks from which I will likely choose will be here within a week</p></li>

<li><p>I maintained composure even though I didn't get a replacement bag</p></li>

<li><p>He will pass my name along to A&amp;E IT department</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bad things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apparently, I'll have to buy the bag and work out reimbursement on my own with Eagle Creek</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not really happy about this last point.  In my fantasy, I should just be able to rock in to a
well-stocked shop, hand over my shredded backpack, walk out with a comparably-sized new backpack.</p>

<p>I told Shin I'd call Eagle Creek in the US, and that's when he said I could drop his name.
We'll get this sorted.</p>
