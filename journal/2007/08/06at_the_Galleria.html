<p>Though feeling a bit pressed for time, I was smart enough to realize we'd have to go to The
Galleria *now* (then) or else it would be closed *later* (now).  Thanks to Fred for driving us, and
handling the traffic better than I might have.  I'm so glad I don't have to drive!</p>

<p>Ami ended up with only an hour to shop, even though it was her one requested thing to do while in
town.  egad.  The day in the zoo and museum was her agreement on my suggestion..  Anyway, she was
astonished by the skating rink in the shopping mall, she got to shop for an hour and I got to be her
shopping cart, and Fred got to chill in the car.</p>

<p>And now she has some really cute short shorts (that she says she'll only wear at my apartment).</p>
