<p class="dream">In a house with my dad, girlfriend and someone else, my dad was headed to sleep,
and me and my girlfriend were headed to shower and relax in the bath tub.  I was getting water into
the tub, when she asked why don't we just use/flood the whole bathroom.  I thought, &quot;in the
United States, we don't do that,&quot; but I looked at the floor, and it certainly appeared that it
could hold about 3 inches of water without gushing out into the main house.</p>

<p class="dream">We started to clear out the stuff, and then my dad was hollering to come outside
and look at the sky.  It was all lighted up as if with aurora, but brighter, and more active.  It
turned out to be something to do with large houses on the water.  (They looked like suburban homes
in the US, except they were each without yards, and just floating on this lake/river.)  They started
to float/fly vertically upward, and fly silently away.</p>

<p class="dream">All the neighbors outside were rather dumbstruck with wonder, but I alone was
simply happy to see it.  No fear, no confusion about what was happening..  I went over to a guy and
was like, &quot;do you know how they're able to do that?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He gave an answer like, &quot;yeah; they're UFOs,&quot; and I was like, &quot;no
no no; I mean they're able to do that because they are more spiritually advanced than we
are.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He laughed in my face, and I continued.  &quot;They don't have the problems that
we have; they are past them.  (they have different problems); whereas I was afraid to tell you
because I have no idea who you are, and what your reaction will be, they wouldn't be afraid because
they all have telepathy and can read each other's minds.  The man laughed some more and walked
away.</p>

<p class="dream">I walked over to where a bridge was over the water, actually over a set of locks,
into which I large ship was accelerating too quickly.  It hit one of the locks just as it swung
open (not like a lock, but quickly open like a plank of wood falling down) and the boat zipped into
the next lock, and a jet ski jumped off the boat and over the lock wall as it was about to close,
and zipped over past the final lock.</p>

<p class="dream">I turned around because I knew the locks on which I was standing would be raising
soon for the next ship, and I was prepared for it, so when they started to close (by lifting
closed; the hinge was at the base), I stood on the upper edge balancingly and it lifted me up and I
stepped simply to the next ones that were already closed, and then climbed my way to the top of
this structure back to the pedestrian bridge where I woke up.</p>
