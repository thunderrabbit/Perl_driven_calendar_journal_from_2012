<p>Ami has just arrived in Detroit.  She was able to call me on her phone!  I wonder what number
she used to call; I can't call her from the US using her in-Japan number, but her caller ID still
identified her as the Ami I know and love.</p>

<p>She doesn't think she'll be able to get to her next flight on time, but I'm still hopeful.</p>

<p>Amazing: I felt my phone ringing in my pocket even though I was busy vacuuming!</p>

<p class="date">3:40pm CDT</p>

<p>She'll be on the flight that arrives at 9pm.</p>

<p class="date">4:27pm CDT</p>

<p>Ma arrived, and we're chillin' until time to leave to get Ami.</p>
