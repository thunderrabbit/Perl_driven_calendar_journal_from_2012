<p></p>We ate ramen after that, and my eye started to itch like really badly (it had already itched
while I was playing the video game, and Ami commented that it was red)..  I went to the nearby drug
store and bought a thing of contact cleaner that featured a contact case.  They didn't have the same
contact juice as the one I've been jsing, but I figured it was better to get the contact out than to
worry about mixing juices.

<p>My eye felt much better after that, but even now as I write this, it's still red (I took my
contact out around 7:35pm).</p>
