HI Chris

Your analysis of what I did is correct: it allows me to use my personal SGP from any computer.  I'm
not so much concerned about your site being down (it's always been up when I need it), but I like to
have my SGP settings already set: length, mIxEd cAsE, and my master password embedded.

The reason for my comment is simply that it took me about half an hour to figure out exactly how to
post SGP on my site.  The bookmark is automagic, but as part of an html page.. I didn't know if it
needed to be inside &lt;script /&gt; tags, or what.

The answer is easy enough, but I wanted to save people the time to figure out how to post their SGP to their site.

As per your comment below, I *can* now run SGP directly from my website, though I have to click [+]
and enter the URL of the site for which I want my password.

Regarding KTRU, I wasn't a Rice student, but a community DJ at KTRU for a couple of years (some 5
years ago now).  Great great fun.

Did you go to Rice?  How do you know KTRU?  You don't happen to live in Houston, do you?  (I did for
25+ years, but I'm in Tokyo now).

    Rob,

    Thanks for your comment. I'm not sure I understand what is being
    accomplished, though. The only reason I can think to put SGP on your Web
    site is to have a quick, easily accessible way to add the SGP bookmarklet
    to a new browser -- or as insurance for the possibility of my Web site
    being down. But you seem to be implying that you are modifying SGP to run
    directly from this link on your Web site. Is that correct, or am I missing
    something? I guess I'm asking: what does this allow you to do? I may be
    missing a good idea here.

    I also noticed on your site a reference to KTRU. Did you go to Rice?

    &gt; I love SGP!  Thanks so much for it.
    &gt;
    &gt; I note above that [I can safely post my SGP
    &gt; bookmarklet](http://labs.zarate.org/passwd_new/#Comment24) to my website
    &gt; as long as I don't hardcode the master password into the script.
    &gt;
    &gt; What I don't see above is exactly *how* to do that.  I figured it out
    &gt; though.  This is for anyone who wants to post their version of SGP
    online.
    &gt;  It works for me on Firefox and OS X; not sure about IE.
    &gt;
    &gt; 1. After [creating your
    &gt; bookmarklet](http://labs.zarate.org/passwd_new/builder.html), somehow
    copy
    &gt; the resulting bookmarklet and paste it in the html markup below (replace
    &gt; square brackets with angle brackets):
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt;    `[a href="`**javascript:(function(){ *[-- ~30K SNIPPED --]*
    &gt; ,true);})();**`"]SGP[/a]`
    &gt;
    &gt; 2. Upload this to your website.  (It will not work on your local
    computer,
    &gt; I imagine because SGP won't parse the URI for a local filename.  (As
    Chris
    &gt; says, it's not designed for local use.))
    &gt;
    &gt; --
    &gt;
    &gt; Another option: After creating your bookmarklet, cut-n-paste the
    &gt; bookmarklet with its surrounding html code, and then remove
    &gt; **onclick="return false;"** from just after the bookmarklet.  (This code
    &gt; is designed to keep the bookmarklet from being run on the bookmarklet
    &gt; creation page, and would keep it from working on your site.)
    &gt;
    &gt; The resulting html should work on your website.
    &gt;
    &gt; I hope this helps!
    &gt;
