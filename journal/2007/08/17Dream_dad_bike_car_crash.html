<p class="dream">With my dad walking through an area with some magic tricks, including some kids
floating upside down in water, some on the bottom of the tank, which was made of two-by-fours
enclosed with plastic sheeting.  He lifted the tank up inside its column and then dropped it down
semi-hard, and the people inside were like, &quot;ow&quot; and he said, &quot;only one time,&quot;
like it was a joke drop and he wouldn't do it again.</p>

<p class="dream">Then he did it again, and I was like, &quot;dad; you said you wouldn't do it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Well son, I'm sorry; I was like that when I was younger.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess we were looking at a younger version of my dad.</p>

<p class="dream">Back over to where a game was being played with little plastic army guys on
individual keys of a typewriter, and certain rules could be used to knock the guys off the keys.</p>

<p class="dream">I inquired about it, and a woman started to tell me what had happened in a certain
move using the vocabulary intrinsic to the game, and I was like, &quot;actually I've never seen the
game before; can you start with telling me about the game itself?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">She apologized and we walked out as she was telling about the game and then we were
in a small mini-van type car, with me in the back seat, and a woman in front of me in the driver's
seat, though she was quite distracted while we were driving.  My dad was on his ten-speed bicycle in
front of us, and he was driving unsafely in the traffic, and I was like, &quot;dad; stop that,&quot;
as he was weaving between oncoming (through stopped) traffic.</p>

<p class="dream">We were driving on 249, leaving Decker Prairie, and the woman who was driving
didn't notice my dad fall in front of us.  Fortunately, he recovered as his bicycle turned into a
car.</p>

<p class="dream">I calmly (given that a bicyclist had crashed in front of us) said, &quot; he just
crashed; do you mind looking forward while you drive?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">And she was like, &quot;what?&quot; and was only semi looking forward, and then we
were going through a curve, but going straight as the road curved to the right away from us, so I
tried to grab the steering wheel and I could barely see past her, and was looking at the road
through a slice of visibility under her left arm as it was ever-changing as she also tried to steer,
and then suddenly we oversteered to the left, tilting off the road sideways and sliding to a stop.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;fuck; did I cause an accident on my vacation?  dammit dammit dammit dammit&quot;
But then woke up, happy to not have been involved in such an accident.</p>

<p>This is the version as I typed it with my eyes closed:</p>

With my dad walking through an area with some magic tricks, including some kids
floating upside down in water, some on the bottom of the tank, which was made of two-by-fours
enclosed with plastic sheeting.  He lifted the tank up inside its column and then dropped it down
semi-hard, and the peole inside were like, &quot;ow&quot; and he said, &quot;only one time,&quot;
like it was a joke drop and he wouldn't do it again.

Then he did it again, and I was like, &quot;dad; you said you wouldn't do it again.&quot;

Well

&quot;Wel son, I'm sory; I was like that when I was younger.&quot;

I guess we were looking at a youner version of my dad.

Back over to where a game was being played with little plastic army guys on individual keys of a
typewriter, and certain rules could be used to knock the guys off the keys.

I inquired about it, and a woman started to tell e what had happened in a certain move using the
vocabulary intrinsic to the game, and I was like, &quot;actually I've never seen the game before;
can you start there

start with teling me about the game itself?&quot;

She apologized and we walked out as she was telling about the game and then we were in a small
mini-van type car, with me in the back seat, and a woman in frot of me in the driver's seat, though
she was qite distracted while we were dri
driving.  My dad was on his ten-speed bicycle in front of us, and he was driving unsafely in the
trafficc, and I was like, &quot;dad; stop tathat,&quot; as he was weaving betwee oncoming (through
stopeed) trafic)

We were driving on 249, leaving Dec
Decker Prairie, and the woman who was driving didn't notice my dad fall in front of us.
Fortunately, he recovered as his bicycle turned into a car.  

I calmly (give that a bicyclst had cASHED IN FRONT OF US) SAID, &quot; HE JUST CRASHED; DO YOU MIND
LOOKING FORWARD WHILE YOU DRIVING?&quot;

&quot;AND 

AND SHE WAS LIKE, &quot;WHAT? AND WAS ONLY SEMI LOOKING FORWARD, AND THEN WE WERE GOING THROUGH A
CURVER, BUT GOING STRAIGHT AS THE ROAD CURVED TO THE RIGHT AWAY FROM US, ASO I TRIED TO GRAB THE
STEERING WHEEL AND I COULD BARELY SEE BPAST HER, AND WAS LOOKING AT THE ROAD THRGO
THROUGH A SMALL SLIVER
SLICE OF VISIBILITY UNDER HER LEFT ARM AS IT WAS EVER-CHANGING AS SHE ALSO TRIED TO STEER, AND THEN
SUDDENLY WE TILTED SIDWAYS AND SLID TO A STOP 

WE TILTED SIDWA

WE TILTED LEFT SIDEWAYS

WE OVERSTEERED TO THE LEFT, , TILTING  OFF THE ROAD SIDWAYS AND SLIDING TO A STOP.

I WAS LIKE, &quot;FUCK; DID I CASH AN ACCIDENT ON MY CVACATION?  DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT&quot;
BUT THEN WOKE UP, HAPPY TO NOT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SUCH AN ACCIDENT.
