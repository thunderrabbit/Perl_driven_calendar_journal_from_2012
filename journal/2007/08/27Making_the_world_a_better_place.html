<p>Very interesting point I just heard
on <a href="http://projectcamelot.net/david_wilcock_4.wmv">part 4 of an interview of David
Wilcock</a> by <a href="http://projectcamelot.net/">Project Camelot</a>.  Talking about people who
&quot;are out to save the world&quot; (that's me) &quot;you can't be into it one week and not the
next week.  It's a spiritual path.&quot;  (These are not perzact quotes, but generally the ideas as
I understand them.)</p>

<p>Then he was saying if one intends to raise the level of consciousness, but doesn't follow their
own teachings, the &quot;negative greeting&quot; (I think that's the word he's using for what I
might call bad karma) is quite strong.</p>

<p>Earlier in the video, he was saying the path to enlightenment is deep meditation.  That's where
we can face the shadows that guard the gate to enlightenment.  He specifically said the Monroe
Institute tapes are a short circuit method, LSD is a short circuit method.  The true way is through
meditation.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Oh, he was saying that &quot;good&quot; is being supportive of people's free will, and
&quot;bad&quot; is trying to affect others' free will.</p>

<p>And for those people (me) who bash on Bush and Friends, we are just bringing that negative
energy into our lives; there's a part of me who wants to dominate and control people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you're sending hate to them, you're perpetuating the cycle of hate.  Hate only leads to
hate.  So you see the negative entity as being a person like you, part of the oneness that's
confused because it believes in separation; it believes in pain and control and manipulating
people.</p>

<p>&quot;So you send love to the entity because you recognize that there's a part of yourself that's
like that; there's a part of yourself that's manipulative and controlling and dominant.</p>

<p>&quot;BUT, you also draw boundaries.  Boundaries is the key.  Boundaries is where you say I love
you, but there are conditions, I'm not going to let you do this.  I'm not gonna let you infringe on
my space.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the interview he says, &quot;all that's required to be able to go through this
ascension is slightly 50% more service to others than service to self.  You can still have a lot of
flaws; you don't have to be perfect.  Everybody gets to win in this game; it's very simple.  Just
try to help others as much as you can and that's it.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm taking the first line to mean, &quot;slightly more service to others than service to self.&quot;</p>
