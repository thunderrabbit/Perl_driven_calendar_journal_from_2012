<p>Today playing with Anna and Rachel has been pretty fun.  They're 5 and 3 years old (or so), and
we've been active all day.  AquaDoodle, chess (I destroyed Anna three times), freeze tag, chase,
hide and seek, tea party, house, hungry hippos, etc etc.</p>

<p>Anna tends to get pissy if she doesn't get her way.  I've not tolerated it, and she seems to get
the message quickly.</p>

<p>Right about now we're sorta waiting for Marcel to come over, and then we'll head over to
Suzanne's for a bit.</p>
