<p>Great to see janette so happy at her house.  We got a brief tour of the house (we = Ami, Colleen,
Fred, Ma, me), and then sat in the living room to chill a bit as janette showed me how to repair the
seams in the quilt she made for me.  I worked on a couple of them, but couldn't quite finish the
second one..  I was stuck balancing between doing it well and quickly, plus learning how, not
bugging janette, and getting out early as Colleen was getting tired.</p>

<p>Finally I was like, &quot;will you just zip this last little bit please?&quot;</p>

<p>And she was happy to do it.</p>

<p>I really loved getting to see janette again.  I'm a little jealous over her boyfriend, but
that's how things go.</p>

o rob
yes yes yes.  you surprised me.
funny(HAHAHA) just that morning i thought i should check rob's journal to
see whutzup.  i'm so glad i didn't!!!!
it is sooooooo good to see you again.  
ami seems very nice and emotionally secure. good.  and good for you!
thank you thank you for spending precious time with me on your whirlwind
tour of the united snakes.
i'm honored that you still value the quilt and are taking good care of it.
seemenly, the seams seem to be a problem with inadeqate seam allowance. good
lesson for me.  it seems.
take care sweet sweet
love
janette
