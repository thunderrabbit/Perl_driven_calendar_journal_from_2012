<p>I'm not sure if bananas are considered lethal fruits when getting on airplanes these days, but my
pure rubber shoes certainly are.  I acted like a dick and left them on the floor when the woman was
like, &quot;take off your shoes before you go through the machine,&quot; as my little bit of
protest, and then I put each shoe in a watch/wallet/change dish to put them through the X-ray
machine.</p>

<p>Another woman had been hollering about how all liquids had to be in bottles of less than 3.5
ounces, and all in plastic bags.  That makes no fuckin' sense whatsoever, so I'm happy my saline
solution made it through while <em>not inside a plastic bag!!</em></p>

<p>I left my shoes off after stepping through the magically secure portal, and while shopping for
something (anything) less than 5 dollars at the souvenir shop.  Got Ami a bottle of supa-hot sauce,
which I hope she'll really like.</p>

<p>Didn't get anything for the kids at Family Mart, but I did think about them.</p>

<p>I'm super tired right about now.</p>

<p>The banana made it through by simply chillin' in my pocket.</p>
