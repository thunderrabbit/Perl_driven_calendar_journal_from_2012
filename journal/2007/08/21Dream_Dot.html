<p class="dream">At some sort of renaming ceremony for UFOs that all looked the same to me; they
had no serial numbers, no identifying markings that I ocould see.  It was part of a weekend
experiential training and we had some new guys there as well, and as part of a silly hazing, we
changed their names as well.  The last guy was a tall man from Germany or Denmark, and he was asked
what name he'd like.</p>

<p class="dream">He chose to be named after an aspect of another guy in the group.  The man had on
a white shirt except that it was splattered with colorful tie dye (*)  He was like, &quot;what
color is this shirt?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">We were silent for a bit, and then he was all, &quot;is it white?  Certainly not.
Is it a single color?  Certainly not.&quot;  Someone suggested it was spotted, and from that the guy
decided it was dotted, and that his new name might be Dot.  He was like, &quot;wait a second; let me
see if I like it.&quot; and then proceeded to make mock telephone calls. &quot;Hey, this is Dot
calling from France!  This is Dot calling from Ukraine!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">We helped him out by calling him Dot a few times, and I said, &quot;Americans will
say it like &quot;DAHT&quot; and British will say it like &quot;DOTE&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He was like, &quot;ah; that's a good consideration..&quot; and continued to taste the
name in his ears and tongue.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Okay, I like it! I'm Dot!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">We all cheered and I woke up.</p>

<p>(*) I could see red, orange and yellow on that shirt in this dream</p>
