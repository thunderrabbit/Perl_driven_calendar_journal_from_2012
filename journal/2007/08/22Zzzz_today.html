<p>Hello, tomorrow.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&quot; I got some more stuff cleaned up and organized in my room, plus sorted out a
new coaching session with Kim after I notably missed the one from yesterday.  Wrote some emails,
played around on faceboook, uploaded some pics to my website, and played Bloons TD enough to win
the game with all 40 lives intact.</p>

<p>Met Ami in Roppongi where we copied my house keys for her, then went to Nakameguro where we ate
at a restaurant she used to frequent, featuring a bartender named Haru, and a cute customer whose
face reminded me happily of Ikumi's (from Millenium House, 2+ years ago)</p>

<p>Came home and showed Ami the pics I uploaded, and then a video of Pussycat Dolls performing in
London.  The video was kinda messed up / messing up my computer, but I burned a copy for her,
though it didn't pass the verification stage.  I may try again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Then a hot session of kissing, etc., and then walked her to her bicycle at Hirama station.</p>
