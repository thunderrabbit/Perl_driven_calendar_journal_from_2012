<p>Overall, today has been a lazy day for me and Ami.  I went to pick up my glasses.  They seemed
fine enough in the store, but after a bit of use, I can tell they need to be adjusted.  I may do
that tomorrow.</p>

<p>We watched a video by Nina Hartley, but didn't actually try any of her suggestions.  Naptime,
and then headed to a festival near Hirama Station, where the crowds of people and the unsustainable waste
of resources made me a bit crazy.  I tried to keep myself genki, but tired of doing so pretty
quickly.</p>

<p>On the way out of the area, I spied a poster
featuring <a href="http://ep-bko.com/#*model*gallery">Gemma Ward</a>, and told Ami if she could get
it, I would be willing to walk back and forth twice through the crowd with her.</p>

<p>I expected Ami to be like, &quot;whateva,&quot; and just walk away, but, she got the poster.</p>

<p>And by &quot;she got the poster,&quot; I mean, &quot;I got the poster.&quot;</p>

<p>Too tired to put a picture up now, but basically it's an old poster of a fine looking model.</p>

<p>Stopped by Tsutaya on the way home.  Even though I knew they would make me do it, I was pissy
about having to fill out another registration form because my old card (which I gave to the clerk)
was expired.</p>

<p>Sometime Japanese customer service isn't excellent.  In this case, it sucks balls.  They should
just be like, &quot;your card expired; is this still your contact information?&quot; and change
what has changed and be done with it.</p>

<p>I wrote only Ï©Éð for my name, and when the girl tried to explain that the name didn't match my
ID card, I was like, &quot;write whatever you want.&quot;</p>

<p>I was surprised she did; usually &quot;they&quot; want me to write everything, including stupid
shit like, &quot;okay, now check this box,&quot; when it takes longer for them to tell me than for
them to just do it.</p>

<p>My new card is signed &quot;Rob fucking Nugen bitches!&quot;</p>

<p>We got home with our new movies.  Two comedies.  The first one turned out to be</p>

<ol>
<li>in Italian</li>
<li>not a comedy</li>
</ol>

<p>Being in Italian is fair enough, but I'm pretty pissed that they had a non comedy in the comedy
section.  But given that I consider Pulp Fiction a comedy, who am I to complain?</p>

<p>Speaking of Tarantino, the other comedy we got is Four Rooms, which I have wanted to see for a
while.</p>

<p>But not tonight.  It's now bedtime in this room.</p>
