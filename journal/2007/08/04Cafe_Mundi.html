<p>Chowed at Cafe Mundi with Ami, Fred, Bill, Colleen, and Ma came a bit before our food arrived.
Colleen traded her sandwich for Fred's waffle and eggs cause she's a spicy wuss.  Ami and I had
sandwiches as well, though, as a spicy wuss myself, I just got the Easy Cheesey sandwich.</p>

<p>Conversation was varied between RSS feeds, the four kingdoms of life on earth, and Finding Nemo
(and the family of Jacques the lobster)</p>

<p>Ami was pretty quiet the whole time, but Ma asked her some questions about her family, etc.  I
translated a bit of the Japanese we used.</p>

<p>When we got pictures taken, Colleen was out of the pic at first and I was like, 「オッパイ見せて」</p>
