there even though it's somewhat of a chain (apparently).  I'm sure he also goes because the staff
are all friendly and funny.  Briana (pictured) was quite chattery with Fred as they did a three-way
handshake and tried to sway my opinion about which bread to get.  Briana posed for a couple of
shots with Francois; I think she's the first to specifically do sideways poses.  I went back and
asked for permission to post her pics, and she immediately was like, &quot;yeah!&quot; and asked
for my URL.</p>

<p>I wrote it down with a little note, plus told her it would take a couple of days to get it
posted.</p>
