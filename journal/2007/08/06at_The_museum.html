alt="Rob and Francois on the ball at Houston Museum of Natural Science" /></a> I was really happy to
see this 5000lb ball spinning lazily on its base.  I've climbed it more than once before, but this
was the first chance I've had to do it with Francois.  I wondered if anyone would care that I was on
it; back in college days I had usually climbed on it at night.  But this was my one shot so I handed
Ami my camera and clambored on up.</p>
