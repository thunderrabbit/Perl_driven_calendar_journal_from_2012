<p>I've realized something: I am hesitant to wake Fred up because I don't want to hear him complain
about whatever, but I don't want him to make us late leaving for the airport.  I informed him of
the leaving time last night, I woke him up slightly at 7:23, then again at 7:40.</p>

<p>It's like fuckin' hell, what's the optimal time?  He never asked, &quot;wake me up at
__:__,&quot; which I'd be glad to do.</p>

<p>Fred is growing up to be a grouchy pissy old fart, and I don't like it.</p>

<p>But: on time departure.  Fred got up and it's all good.  He's still not talkative, though.</p>

<p class="date">12:23pm CDT</p>

<p>For the record, Fred's all good now that he woked up.</p>
