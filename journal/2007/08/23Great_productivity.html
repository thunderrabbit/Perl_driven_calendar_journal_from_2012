<p>Have been quite productive so far today... basically enough to just chill the rest of the day
and I won't mind.</p>

<p>Got my toe fixed.  I had had an ingrown toenail that was all infected and shit, and had been
that way for about a month.  It didn't seem to be getting better, and in fact it hurt worse when I
put triple-antibiotic ointment on it.  (Though to be clear, the ointment had expired in 1998..)</p>

<p>Anyway, to the only clinic in Motosumiyoshi that's open on Thursdays (most clinics in Japan are
closed on Thursdays...  Why not every clinic have a *different* day off each week; why pick on
people on Thursday?) and the doctor laughed / agreed that one month was plenty of time to let it
heal itself.</p>

<p>I asked how much it would cost, and after the first price of 35,000 yen was out of my budget (I
have it in the bank, but I gots to make my money last until I get paid, which will presumably be in
mid October) so the price was shifted down to a total of 27,??? yen including tax, so I'm guessing
I got a 10,000 yen discount.  The doctor was like, &quot;it's good for you eat...&quot; implying
that my food intake was more important than his cash intake.</p>

<p>To be sure, the procedure took about 10 minutes max, including injecting local antesthetic.  It
appeared that the introduction of that volume of antesthetic caused blood to pour out of the
swollen infected area.  Not sure how accurate was my analysis.</p>

<p>I took pictures for as long as I could stay upright before passing out.  I never actually passed
out, but I was definitely losing the ability to see / sit up right.  I was like &quot;okay,
bye-bye...&quot; and the nurses laughed.  I had assured them I wanted to sit up to take pictures and
not just sleep through such a rare experience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of the pictures are blurry.  And then ones I took while lying down are not
of my toe.  Dammit.</p>

<p>Bought band-aids, went back to the clinic to get my umbrella, took pics of train line
construction under Motosumiyoshi, and then got my address officially changed with Ãæ¸¶¶èÌò½ê, so
I'm all officially moved and shit.</p>

<p>Now it's chow time.</p>
