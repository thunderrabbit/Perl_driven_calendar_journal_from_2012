<p>I just watched / heard an <a href="http://projectcamelot.net/dan_burisch.html">interview of Dan
Burisch on Project Camelot</a>.  I found it interesting that he was saying some of the same things
as Alex Collier as interviewed by Rick Keefe, except Collier was using &quot;Reptilians&quot; where
Burisch was using &quot;P-45s&quot;  (I think.  He was also referring to P-52s at times.)</p>

<p>Burisch specifically discounted the possibility that there were &quot;reptilians&quot; living
among us, however, the Burisch interview was done in 2007 (or maybe 2006), whereas the Collier
interview was done in 1994, and Collier said in the future the aliens would be required to leave the
planet.</p>

<p>So, in my mind, their stories do corroborate.  Interesting.</p>
