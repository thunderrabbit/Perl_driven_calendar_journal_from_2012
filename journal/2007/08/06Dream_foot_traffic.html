<p class="dream">Sleeping on the couch and people coming through, wondering where other people
were.  Dad not waking up for his early appointment; then Fred was complaining about something and
Dad started arguing with Fred.  He even tried to seek support from me, but I was like <em>fuck off;
don't you think Fred has a brilliant mind?</em></p>

<p class="dream">Later, Fred went to the front door when it was obviously a knock on the gameroom
door we had heard.  I wondered what time everyone was supposed to wake up.  Then I heard Ami call me
from the other room.</p>

<p>I woke up to go check, but I could hear her still sleep breathing.  Her allergies to cats have
got her a bit stopped up.</p>
