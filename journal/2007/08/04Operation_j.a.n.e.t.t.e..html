<p>Operation j.a.n.e.t.t.e. is complete!  At uncommonOBJECTS we walked through and I walked up as
she was hugging Colleen after hugging Fred.  I couldn't bear to wait much longer than that.  She
saw Ami and was like, &quot;are you Ami?&quot; and later asked some stuff in Japanese.</p>

<p>英語は話せますか？</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>テキサスは好きですか？</p>

<p>Ami said janette's accent is better than mine.  あれ？</p>

<p>Really great to catch up with janette.  She seems really happy and smiley and great great great.
She loves her job, loves living in Austin; loves having her friend Reenie over, and JoJoBean.</p>

<p>Fred says:</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="note">Type me some Japanese, yo,</a>

<p>to which I reply:</p>

<p>これは日本語です、よ。</p>

<p>We're going to hang out with janette at her crib tonight.</p>
