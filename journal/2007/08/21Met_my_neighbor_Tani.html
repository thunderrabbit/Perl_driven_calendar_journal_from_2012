<p>I just took some boxes (and shirts) out to the trash.  On the way to the collection spot, I saw a
woman who I had seen yesterday.  We traded &quot;good mornings,&quot; and I thought <em>I bet she's
my neighbor; I should introduce myself</em> but I didn't want to do it while carrying trash.</p>

<p>On my way back, she was still there, and we ignored each other as is the custom in Japan, and I
could have done as expected and just walked right past her and inside and gone.</p>

<p>I was like, <em>fuckit; and turned around and went up to her</em></p>

 me: My name is Rob             My name is Rob          desperation
she: あたし、English..           I, English ...          (*)
 me: ロブとおもします　　　　　　　 my name is Rob          different pronunciation; perhaps the first way had been wrong
she: Tom?                       Tom?                    (**)
 me: ロブともします　　　　　  　　 my name is Rob          first pronunciation; perhaps the second way had been wrong
she: Tom?                       Tom?                    (**)
 me: ろ　ぶ                      RO BU                   the pronunciation of my name in Japanese is Robu

she: た　に　　　　　　　　　　　　　TA NI
 me: たに                        Tani
she: [finger spelling her name in the air as I was repeating her name]              Yes, I fucking got it.
 me: よろしくおねがします          nice to meet you        I'm so glad this is over

<p>She started talking to her neighbor as I went inside, flushed with astonishment and success.</p>

<p>(*) &quot;I, English ...&quot; I'll describe this as an example of not wanting to say NO, just
leaving the unspoken NO hovering in the back of her mind.  Unspoken in the back of my mind, &quot;I
wasn't speaking English until it seemed apparent you couldn't understand Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p>(**) とおもします [to-omoshimas] or perhaps ともします [tomoshimas] is the polite verb that I
only know to use in self introductions in polite situations.  The first sound is basically the same
as the name Tom, in English.  I'm not sure if my (mis)pronunciation of と（お）もします is where
she got &quot;Tom&quot; (in which case I would have been saying &quot;do Tom&quot; which an extra
&quot;Rob&quot; in there for good measure) or if she was confusing the second sound &quot;tom&quot;
for the first sound &quot;rob&quot; (in which case, &quot;hello, wtf?&quot;)</p>

<p>(***) Strictly speaking, during the preceding &quot;conversation,&quot; another neighbor had
stepped out.</p>

<p>Can someone who knows what I did wrong tell me what I did wrong?</p>
