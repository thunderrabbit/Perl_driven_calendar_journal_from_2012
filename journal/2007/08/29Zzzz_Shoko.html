<p>Met Ami tonight at Hiroo station and walked to her friend Yoko's house.  Watched TV for a couple
hours (ugh) while eating KFC (yum) and listening to them talk (あれ？) Mark came home after a while
and I got to chat a bit in English with him about his car and helping his friend Rob build a house
in Brisbane.</p>

<p>I ate the second to last piece of chicken just before time to leave.  I would have saved it
though, had I known I'd be joining them for the next part of the evening: yakiniku with their
crazy-girl friend Shoko!  Shoko is super-hyper and pretty much the star of the table tonight.  She
helped me get into the conversation by teaching a bunch of Japanese tongue twisters.  The one I
semi-remember is something like すももももものすももももものすものもも, or
sumomomomomonosumomomomomonosomonomomo.</p>

<p>Shoko asked how old I thought she was, and I was like, 32.  Actually she's 22.</p>

<p>But the age I chose is neat because Ami <em>also</em> thought Shoko was 32.  But that was 4
years ago!</p>

<p>Thanks to Shoko and Yoko for buying.  Thanks to Yoko for paying taxi fare.  We just made it back
on last train.</p>

<p>Ami dropped me off at my apartment, I dropped off my stuff then hopped on TJ Bike and
successfully caught her and gave her a lift the rest of the way to her bicycle, which included
crossing a construction area just beside Hirama station, at which I entertainingly made an
aggressive challenge grrrr face at the steam roller.  &quot;I'll take ya on anyday, ya big heavy
fatty!&quot;</p>

<p>The steam roller driver just laughed.</p>
