<p>Ami's got to go today.  I'm sad to see her go, but definitely want to be on time to the airport.</p>

<p class="note">written 10:47am JST Saturday  8 September 2007 (day 13681)</p>

<p>I remember being really (really) anxious about the time, and hollering at Fred to get up and
such.  He was right; we ended up being there way ahead of time.  Got Ami checked in, and even had
time to go for breakfast after that.  We drove out of the airport and skipped many fast food
places, but then both agreed The Kettle would be just about perfect.</p>

<p>Ami and I were set on getting salad bar, but Fred was torn between that and french toast.  He
ended up getting salad bar, and <em>lo, french toast was available on the bar.</em>  I imagine the
waitress would have mentioned this detail had he tried to order both, but.</p>

<p>All the salad items were under plates, giving me the sense that the pickins were slim, but turns
out they were just a bit tricky to scoop.  One hand for tray, one hand to uncover the food, one
hand to scoop.  Zaphod, go get me a salad.</p>

<p>We ate nearly our fill, and joked about telling the waitress, &quot;we'll be right back, we've
just gotta go drop her off at the airport.&quot;</p>

<p>Fred made a comment that she would probably let us, but I have my doubts.</p>

<p>We got to the airport and found her flight had been delayed (her Northwest Airlines flight was
delayed both directions (one international flight, and one domestic)), so we chilled in the main
airport area until she needed to cross that waterproof zone for ticketed passengers.  I wished we
had been able to know this while at breakfast!  The wait would have been happier and more delicious
there, I imagine.</p>
