<p>To get synchronized with Japan's clocks, I have stayed up all night, watching Loose Change 2nd
Edition, emailing with Ami, downloading videos, and uploading pics from my adventure in the US.</p>

<p>I'm still wearing my contacts because I don't know where my glasses are.  It's good overall,
though; the glasses (though of a cool style) were quite fragile, plus all-but-broken, so it will be
good to get some new ones.</p>

<p>These contacts are due for replacement in 5 days.  Actually 4-ish because of the International
Date Line.</p>
