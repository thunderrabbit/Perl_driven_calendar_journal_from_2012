<p>Okay, I've been awake for 3 hours, and gotten a bit done: wrote an email to Kristen (*), ate a
bowl of cereal, started laundry, put in my contacts, wrote a dream, a summary of yesterday's game,
and now I'm practically dying for an excuse to not get started job searching.</p>

<p>Gotta gotta gotta just sit and chillfully plan.</p>

<p>(*) email to Kristen:</p>

Hey Kristen!!

I hope your birthday brings all sorts of good to your life and the
world around you!!

I am still based in Tokyo, right now in the job searching department.
I was just in the US for a month and didn't get my ducks aligned
quickly enough to find *you*, but I'll just blame it on Catherine for
not giving me your contact info before I left.  :-)

What's up with you?  Kickin' it law-style, I assume.

Oh, I was in the US for a month, so I had to give up my job here to do
it, so now I'm headed for an IT job, but just don't know with which
company.

I have a girlfriend: a Japanese woman named Ami (Spanish / French
pronunciation) who was one of my students at my previous job.  She
actually came to the US for a week during my trip.  Fun times.

If you have no free time, click here to see Ami and me

world twice via Peace Boat: http://peaceboat.org

In the unlikely event you have nothing but free time, here are some of
my pics from my (first) Peace Boat voyage(s):
