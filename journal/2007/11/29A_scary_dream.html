<p class="dream">I went up to one of my old acquaintences and was asking him something when he
caught me between his legs like in a wrestling grip.  I didn't know wtf he was trying to do, so I
flew upwards to get away from him, but my flying ability wasn't good enough to really get anywhere;
I was stuck near the surface of the earth, and at very low speeds.  He caught up to me and like went
through me or bumped past me and I woke up with chilllzes all over and through my body.</p>
