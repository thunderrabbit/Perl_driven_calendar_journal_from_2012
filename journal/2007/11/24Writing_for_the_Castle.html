<p>I spent a lot of time writing room descriptions for the Castle of Dreams today.  Also came upon
the idea of having a wiki inside the castle...  Basically I made a namespace called castlepedia and
used it to describe some fruits I had written into the royal garden:
<a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/index.php?title=castlepedia:Banectarine" title="castlepedia:Banectarine">Banectarine</a>,
<a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/index.php?title=castlepedia:Grapineapple" title="castlepedia:Grapineapple">Grapineapple</a>, and
<a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle/index.php?title=castlepedia:Rhubarberry" title="castlepedia:Rhubarberry">Rhubarberry</a></p>

<p>If you wanna add your bit of creativity, create a username, yeah?  I'm hoping anonymous edits
won't be common, and I hope there won't be any vandalism.  I'll be quick to turn on registration and
email verification requirements if anything annoys me.</p>
