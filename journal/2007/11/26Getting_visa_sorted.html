<p>Headed now to get my visa so I can work in IT instead of teaching.  Part of the deal is creating
a job description that would be hard for a Japanese worker to do.  I wrote &quot;bilingual
programming; translating Japanese documentation to English; writing English documentation.&quot;</p>

<p>I need five (5) more documents for this little adventure.</p>
