<p>Based on the ease and enjoyment of my robnugen.com/wiki/, I created thunderrabbit.com/castle/, a
wiki that I'd like to recapture the essence of Castle of Dreams, the lovely FidoNet BBS I enjoyed
before the internet fad.</p>

<p>Before I write much there, I'm going to tap out some Rob Update.</p>

<p>I sent a link to Laura; I wonder if she'll be interested in writing a bit.  =:)</p>
