<p>Nice to see ゆりか still working hard in her studies.  She had done her best to transcribe a
three.25 minute conversation from some podcast.  I checked her work and then we went over it to
make sure she knew all the grammar and most of the vocab.  I couldn't really explain a couple of
the words: &quot;boost&quot; as a noun, and &quot;considerate&quot; was a bit difficult, but I
think she got it.  There may have been one more.</p>

<p>We're going to meet again in 2 weeks.  Before then, she may type up another podcast and email her
text plus a link so I can correct her transcription and send it back.  That way she can have a
better chance and more time to really grok it before coming in to the lesson.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Since they are podcasts, I wonder if they are already transcribed somewhere..  and if
not; I wonder if the publishers would like a copy of the transcription....</p>

<p>あっ、I forgot to tell her about the Castle of Dreams.  She might enjoy that as an English
resource.</p>
