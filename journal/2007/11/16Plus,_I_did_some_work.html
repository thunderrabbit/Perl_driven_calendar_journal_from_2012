<p>Despite the slew of comics I posted, I did get some work done today.</p>

<p>i basically finished a project, although it was nothing more than a week's worth of playing with
mySQL DBs an tweaking some PHP while trying to spend at least as much time on the Castle.</p>

<p>I sent to °æ¾å¤µ¤ó the list of files that I edited so he can upload them to the test server.  I
basically refused to hang out at work for an hour and wait for him to arrive at 7pm when I had a
meeting scheduled with Ami at 6:30.</p>

<p class="date">6:24pm JST</p>

<p>Hi, Ami!</p>

<p>Make that 6:24.</p>
