<p>Before watching the rest of Bourne Supremacy, Ami and I were like, &quot;I gotta pee!&quot; at
the same time.  Actually I was first, but she had said it a while ago, and then we both jumped up
and ran to the toilet. (single room; no room for two people) and both went inside.</p>

<p>She peed while I was standing there and then we switched places carefully (the door doesn't
always lock very well and can come open with a bump) and just as I was about to sit down, we heard
someone out at the sink!  hahahahhahaa   shhhhhhhhhh</p>

<p>So we desperately withheld our laughter while I peed, and then waited until the coast seemed
clear.  I peeked out through the wavy glass window..  All clear, so we ran out gigglishly back to
my room.</p>
