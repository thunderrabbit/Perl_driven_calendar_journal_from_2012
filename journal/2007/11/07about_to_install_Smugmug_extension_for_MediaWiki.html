G'day Rob,

Sorry about the late reply.

For this type of 3rd party extension, I would typically recommend that
the user's request their own api key. In regard to options, I would
think "Plugin", "All" and "Non-Commercial".

Cheers,

David

<p>Excellent!</p>

<p>I got the answers I needed from David regarding API Keys for my Smugmug extension.  I'm now
going to install it as a new user, starting with
my <a href="http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Smugmug_extension_for_MediaWiki">Smugmug
extension for MediaWiki</a> page.</p>
