HI Ross

I just read your article on Kindle
(<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/27/switched-on-rainforest-fire-part-1/">http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/27/switched-on-rainforest-fire-part-1/</a>),
which featured the following teaser at the end:

"Next week's column will delve into how Kindle changes the book-buying process, and it's impact on
the wireless and consumer electronics industries in light of Verizon Wireless's announcement that it
will allow consumers to use their own devices on its wireless network.."

I can only assume that extra apostrophe was added by some non-grammar-knowin' monkey who wanted to
ruin your lovely article with a misspelling of its.  Please tell them "it's" always means "it is."
However, the impact of Kindle is its impact.

I will freely admit that the other grammar errors / typos don't rile me as much as "it's" for "its,"
and honestly I don't know the rule for writing the possessive form of "Verizon Wireless," nor if two
periods at the end are acceptable..

I see now that the second "its" in the sentence below is fine, so perhaps it's just a typo on the
first one.

Congratulations on being a professional writer.  Many people read what you write, so please use this
power with care.

  - Rob

Hi Rob,
 
Thanks for pointing out the error. My rule of thumb for remembering which spelling to use failed me. I've corrected the text.
