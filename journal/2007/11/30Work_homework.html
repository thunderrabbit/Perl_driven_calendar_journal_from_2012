<p>Funny: just today after (finally) getting my contract, which says we don't work on weekends, I'm
voluntarily taking some work home for the weekend.  Ami and I are going to Atami to meet CDF, and I
think I'll have some free time on the train to try and grok this code...  It's a fun challenge, in
a way.</p>
