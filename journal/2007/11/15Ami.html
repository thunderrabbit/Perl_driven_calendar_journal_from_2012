<p>I had a bit of a brain freakout with Ami today.  Last night we had a deep conversation (I wrote
about it, right?), and this morning Ami texted me to see if she could call me.  I texted her back
and told her what time my train would arrive and she called me soon thereafter.</p>

<p>First mistake: the train was a bit late, so when she called, I answered the phone though I was
still on the train, and I mucked up my chance to count the chirps that signal THE END OF THE LINE.
Minimum I've counted is 15.  Maximum is 21.  I think today broke the max, but I can't be sure
because I answered the phone as they were beeping, and lost count.</p>

<p>Second mistake: Ami is not Hitomi.  But when Ami was like, &quot; [ silence ], so uh, [ silence
], are you okay?&quot; My brain totally flipped back to the <em>agonizing</em> conversations with
Hitomi that were something like, &quot;yes, I was fine until you started asking me,&quot; etc until
it devolved to &quot;please god, can we not talk about this on the phone?&quot; and spiraled and
burned to &quot;I hate you; never call me again!&quot;</p>

<p>First good point:</p>

<p>I knew what was happening in my brain, but I couldn't control it past, &quot;I need to let you
go.&quot;  Fortunately, Ami let me go.</p>

<p>Second good point:</p>

<p>When I called Ami back a few minutes later to attempt an apology, even though my brain broke
again, I was able to firmly say, &quot;let's not talk about this on the phone,&quot; and even
though she was crying, &quot;not talk about it tonight (planned already not to see her tonight (we
got shizzle to do!)), but we'll talk about it Friday.&quot;</p>

<p>And that seems to be perfect.  No contact today, but I'm about to call her and thank her.</p>

<p>Zipping off to meet Yurika for our first English lesson in a long time.</p>
