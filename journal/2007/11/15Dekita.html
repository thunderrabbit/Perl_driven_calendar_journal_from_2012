<p>Aight, I've added the N, SUM, and AVG values to a different page, and shrunk down the template
of the page to a more digestable size (makes better use of screen real estate).</p>

<p>Oh, and I moved the code from the wrong file to the correct file, with appropriate links across
the files.</p>

<p>Now I wonder if I can remember what the next step was in this little project.</p>
