<p>Last night I did not get onto my computer after arriving home.  I basically ate, flossed,
brushed, meditated, went straight to bed, all the while (except during brushing and meditation)
reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_in_the_Woods">A Walk in the Woods</a>.  I
laughed at &quot;Yew boys wunna rod?&quot; and something else, but I don't recall what.</p>

<p>Woke up without my alarm this morning at 6:50; went down to shower, took out the trash (we had a
bit of an accumulation (since we would sometimes get lazy and not take out the one bag, ÎëÌÚ¤µ¤ó got
us another trash bin, and so we're able to be that much lazier) as both bins were full on Saturday
night, so Juergen tied them off and set them by the kitchen door where they waited until now)
because we can only take it out on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings (between 7am and
8:30).</p>

<p>I seem to be stuck on my computer as I write this; I've got to get up to get down to some food
and work.</p>
