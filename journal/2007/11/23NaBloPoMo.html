<p>I can see how this would be hard for most people.  Having an entry every day for a month is easy
if I fill in the blanks after the fact.</p>

<p>But, genuinely, this entry is being written thirty minutes before the day is up, so I'm still in
competition for winning all the fabulous prizes
of <a href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/">NaBloPoMo</a>.</p>

<p>But, to be honest, I probably wouldn't have written today if not for the invitation Sean gave me
at the beginning of the month.  I wonder how he's done.</p>

<p>I also wonder why I didn't get a cheerleading email from the organizer at the two week or even
three week mark.  Perhaps we'll get one soon as the one-week-to-go mark arrives in the US.</p>

<p>I'm going to post this and then check Sean's blog.</p>
