Thanks, David!

Markham, I have just finished testing my wiki page installation...  I
was able to install the extension following the directions as if I
were a new user.

So, here's the official URL
<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Smugmug_extension_for_MediaWiki">http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Smugmug_extension_for_MediaWiki</a>

And my official sentence:
This extension allows embedding images from Smugmug into a MediaWiki wiki.

Thanks for adding it to the list of Smugmug Applications using the API!
