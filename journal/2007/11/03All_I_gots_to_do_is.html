<li><p>ask a couple questions of smugmug [*] (11:58pm JST)</p>

<pre>
1) Regarding my Smugmug extension for MediaWiki, should I let individuals use my API key when they
are installing copies of the code on their servers?

Because it's a "key" I thought it should be hidden from public view.  But if they should get their
own, but are not really writing code, that brings up the corollary question.

1.b) If they need their own key, what values should they use on the hack/apikeys page?

<a href="http://www.smugmug.com/hack/apikeys">http://www.smugmug.com/hack/apikeys</a>

2) speaking of that page, the first "contact us" link on the page is borked.  It goes to
http://inside.smugmug.net/help/emailreal which requires a password

Shortly after I get the answers for 1 and 1.b above, I should have a public version of my extension
ready, and I'll let you know!

    Thanks!
    - Rob

Hi Rob,

Thanks for emailing.  Markham is, indeed, out enjoying his weekend.  :)

Unfortunately, he's the person to ask about 1 and 1.b, so I can't help
you there. Thanks for letting us know about #2, though.  I will make
sure to change that!   The correct link should be to:
<a href="http://smugmug.com/help/emailreal">http://smugmug.com/help/emailreal</a>.

<li><p>Piddle around on my wiki, seeing what things do what. [*] (2:23am JST)</p></li>

<li><p>Move the items I won't finish today to tomorrow [*] (2:27am JST)</p></li>

<li><p>Chat with Ed a bit, asking him if he'd like to be the first to install Smugmug extension for
MediaWiki from my wiki [*] (2:39am JST)</p></li>

<li><p>Receive a note from Markham saying he'd need to ask David about the API keys.  Wow!  What a
good question asker I am! [*] (2:41am JST)</p>

<pre>
Hey Rob,

These are good questions.  I actually need David's help in answering them.

David, can you help here?

<li><p>Take a shower [*] (3:06am JST)</p>

<p>I took the shower (and flossed and brushed my teeth) in 44 degrees C water with all the lights
off in the entire house.  Completely pitch black inside the shower, though it's a very small room,
so no big deal (pun not intended).  Once I got back upstairs, I realized I had forgotten my glasses
down on the shelf in the shower area.  Went nakedly back down because everyone else is sleepin' and
I'm still boiled after 44 degree shower.</p></li>

it's the first one: <a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/799890.html">http://jwz.livejournal.com/799890.html</a>
the other two aren't as good.

Hahah!

I actually liked the Star Wars one better than the Fuckin' short version.

Minesweeper movie at the bottom is pretty creative.

<p>I'm going to chow on this list today, and put the time finished by each item until I run out of today/energy/desire.</p>

<p>Just went shopping with Ami.  In the store there were breaded crabs.  One of them was noticably
alive.  My heart was broken, and I halfway became vegetarian.  In the end, ironically, I decided no
more beef nor pork, but fish and chicken are okay.  We'll see how long it lasts.  Ami said she
would rather die than stop eating beef.  Hmmm.</p>
