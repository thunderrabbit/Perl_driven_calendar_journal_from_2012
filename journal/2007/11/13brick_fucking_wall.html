<p>Completely lost in the details and crap of this stupid project.  I should probably walk away
from the keyboard, but I at least need to do a brain dump to write down the deets of the chaos in
my head.</p>

<p class="date">8:02pm JST</p>

<p>Okay.  Writing that all out helped.  I was actually able to get 2 more steps done on the path to
completion city.</p>

<p>(the city isn't very many steps away; the steps are just sometimes big, and sometimes I'd rather skate.)</p>
