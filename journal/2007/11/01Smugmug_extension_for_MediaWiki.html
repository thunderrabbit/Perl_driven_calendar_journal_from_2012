<p>I basically spent all day on this.  12 hours.  1/2 the time was getting the parameter reading
code to work, and the other half was spent mimicking Linker.php, cause I couldn't seem to call that
code directly.</p>

HI Smuggies!

Though the code is not quite perfect yet, I wanted to report my
progress on my extension for embedding Smugmug pics into mediawikis.

The code is here:
<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Smugmug_extension">http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Smugmug_extension</a>

And here it is in action:
<a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Smugmug_test_page">http://robnugen.com/wiki/index.php?title=Smugmug_test_page</a>

It's not yet fit for mass consumption; not all the features work yet,
but soon, oh, so soon.

   Thanks!

<p>Definitely time to go home now.</p>
