<p>Silly Rob.</p>

<p>I had &quot;plenty of time&quot; as I arrived at the station, so I took pictures of the old being-refurbished lower
tracks, took the stairs up instead of the escalator, took pictures of the new upper Meguro Line tracks, and
took too much time composing the perfect shot and missed my train.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Tokyu Toyoko Line rules, and trains arrive/leave about once every 3 minutes during
rush hour and once every 7 minutes during the day.  Anyway, I took a few more pictures of the Meguro
Line, especially the construction of the walls (I'm lost for terminology here (*)), though at this
point the walls are simply holes in the platform where the wall supports will be placed.</p>

<p>(*) The Meguro Line trains are attended by only the driver.  There's no one at the rear of the
train to monitor the doors at each station.  The driver has 4 little TV monitors on the dashboard
that must be wirelessly fed by cameras placed along the platform.</p>

<p>To help support the driver's job, there is a barrier along the platform with doors on it.  It's
sorta like elevators or unstaffed trams in big airports: the elevators/trams have doors and there
are doors in the lobby to keep people out of the elevator shaft/tracks.</p>

<p>It's these lobby-side doors that I'm not sure what to call.  &quot;Platform doors&quot; ?</p>

<p>Anyways, I photographed the holes where the platforms' doors' walls' posts will go.</p>
