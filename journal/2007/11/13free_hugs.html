<p>Free hugs from 8:32 to 9:32pm tonight.  British Mike stopped by for a bit, though he didn't hold
the sign this time.  We chatted for a bit and shared news of our most recent injuries.  He may have
cracked something in his foot while kick boxing, and I bruised my right achilles tendon by stubbing
my left big toe into it.</p>

<p>While he was there, I gave two hugs, one to a girl who just seemed like life had given her a
beating today.  She just looked super sad, but she didn't lock on for a big hug.  Just the softest
of pressure.</p>

<p>Mike asked if I ever &quot;feel creepy&quot; giving hugs, and I assured him that &quot;I never
go to them; they gotta come get the hug if they want it,&quot; and I'm quite careful to let go as
soon as appropriate.  I told him about the super long hug I got a couple weeks ago. My memory says
it was about 30 seconds, but I'm not totally sure.</p>

<p>Though he hung out for a while, Mike must have been all full in the hug department cause he
didn't get one.</p>

<p>A couple came by, then stopped and looked really happy as they went into their bag and pulled
out a FREE HUGS sign!  They asked to take pictures with me, and the guy gave me a FREE HUGS button
for my shirt.  Sweet!</p>

<p>Eli came by a bit later and though he *didn't* stop to chat, he gave an awesome hug.
&quot;You're number 30,&quot; I said.  &quot;I feel so dirty now,&quot; he replied.  &quot;haha
yeah, dirty thirty!&quot;</p>

<p>One girl who seemed to speak both English and Japanese pretty well was like, &quot;どうして？Why
are you doing this?&quot; and I told her just to spread joy through Shibuya.  She explained this in
Japanese to her friend after she was all, &quot;wow!  すごい！ that's awesome!&quot; and then I
asked if she wanted to try for a bit.  She thanked me, but said she had to get home.</p>

<p>Several people took photos with me, and I always wonder if they're going to end up online
somewhere, and how I could find them.  [images shibuya free.hugs guy] perhaps.</p>

<p>I was getting a bit tired as 1 hour approached.  I had logged 37 hugs and had 4 more minutes
before the hour was up.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;aight; I'm gonna wait for one more crossing cycle and if I don't get 3 hugs;
I'm outta here.&quot;</p>

<p>A girl with long bleached gray hair, dark eye makeup, a white fur coat, and short skirt pushed
her lion-looking boyfriend over to me.</p>

<p>Now, this is a first for my FREE HUGS history.  I have not yet had *any* girls of that fashion
come up and hug me, much less pressure someone else into doing it.</p>

<p>He hugged me,</p>

<p>38</p>

<p>and then I offered one open arm to her; it looked like she was going to leave without hugging me.
She asked him if it was okay, and then she hugged me.</p>

<p>I noticed myself wanting to hold the hug longer than I normally would; it was my first from
someone of her fashion!  But I noted my desire before I locked in, and let her go appropriately.
Her jacket was quite soft.</p>

<p>39</p>

<p>Then a tall Japanese guy like ran up from several meters away and gave me a big quick monster hug.</p>

<p>40!</p>

<p>I let the rest of the group pass by and one guy with an English accent was all, &quot;I'm in the
mood for a free hug,&quot; and gave a nice one to top off my night.</p>

<p>41 free hugs in 60 minutes, <em>just</em> above 2 hugs per 3 minutes.</p>
