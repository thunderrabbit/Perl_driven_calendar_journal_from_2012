<p>After dinner, I encouraged us to watch Bourne Supremacy, because I've been wanting to for a
while.  We got to the point where Jason arrives at the only other remaining spy from Treadstone,
and Ami was like, &quot;I'm falling asleep; let's do it.&quot;</p>

<p>So we did it and fell asleep.  Just now woke up and she went home.</p>
