<p>Tonight on the train, on the way home with Ami, I wasn't really in a great mood.  Sorta sad,
shamed feeling; I didn't want to look her in the eyes.  Part of me wanted to break up.  I couldn't
really tag a reason for the feeling.  The closest I can come is that I chatted with Catherine
yesterday and really enjoyed high speed English catch-up chatter, and one of the things Catherine
said was basically I should speak English more with Ami to help support her (Ami's) dream of going
to school in the US.</p>

<p>We got home and Ami cooked (bless her) while I zonked out sleepin' after my meditation.  She
called me when she was done and I came down and enjoyed chowing, but didn't enjoy the TV being on.
I had talked to her before about hating TV, especially inane Japanese TV, and after a bit she
turned it off.</p>

<p>After dinner, I went to the 99 Shop to get a tupperware container (after leaving mine at Enio's
apartment).  Rode TJ Bike super fast (dangerously fast for how dark it was) but made it there and
back intact and in record time.</p>

<p>The TV was back on, though at this point the show was not insipid, but Japanese World Cup
Women's Volleyball.</p>

<p>We watched for a bit, and then I went upstairs to work on Castle of Dreams.  I added a dragon
parking area and dragon run-way, plus beefed up the entry with text from the original Castle of
Dreams.</p>

<p>Ami came up and we finally talked about how I had been feeling.  I told her my first paragraph
above, and she explained that &quot;going to school in the US&quot; is not her number 1 dream;
right now her number one thing is get out of debt (long story into which I will not go), and
anyway, why wasn't I studying Japanese and following <em>my</em> dream?</p>

<p>I assured her (and myself?) that my dream is not the learn Japanese.  Right now I'm not sure
what is my dream, but I know what are the things I like to do: paint, write, give free hugs, play frisbee,
program.  So those are the things I'm doing.  Painting my four pictures (this week I plan to find /
search for a space to show them), writing Castle of Dreams, writing my daily journal, writing
R.O.B.O.T., programming Smugmug extension, programming chatforest.com...</p>

<p>And I have no idea which / if any of these will turn into anything, but this is my understanding
of what Steve Jobs suggested to do, and so I'm doing it.  Doing what I want to do: using my
creativity to create things and give them to the world.</p>

<p>If I watch TV, it's the antithesis of creativity.  &quot;Kill yer TV,&quot; I say, and I want
Ami to do the same.</p>

<p>In the end of the conversation, Ami was all, &quot;well, if we get a house together,&quot; etc
etc and I have my computer and she has a TV, would it be okay?  I was like, &quot;yes, if you pay
cash for the TV.&quot;</p>

<p>やった！</p>
