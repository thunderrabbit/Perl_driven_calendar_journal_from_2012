<p>After 4 hours work, I think I've finished the array that will direct the
navigation for the Castle of Dreams.</p>

<p>Wow.  All that for just 38 &quot;rooms&quot; and 83 connections (some are one-way).</p>

<p>I'm going to go ahead and install the array and start creating the rooms.  Because I couldn't
figure out how to automagically write &lt;navigation/&gt; at the bottom of the appropriate rooms,
it will take a bit longer, but shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<p>especially if I didn't make any mistakes in the array.</p>

<p class="dream">Cool!  All 38 rooms are there, and no logic errors in the array.  I did change a
bit of the text, but not much.</p>

<p>Okay, I added a READ ME to the table of ancient scrolls.  During that process, I
realized I had misspelled corridor as cooridor (and created three rooms and links to those rooms
with the misspelling!)  Shocked at my silliness, I corrected the map, moved the rooms, then logged
in as the sysop and deleted the old rooms.</p>

<p>Note to self: next time you spend 4 hours writing something, you might wanna add 20 seconds to
do a spell check.</p>

<p>Okay, bedtime!</p>
