<p class="dream">In a shop looking at the bicycles, which were disassembled in plastic cases with
wooded frames, thousands of little tiny gears and pins and spindles all loose inside the case; I
was sure there must be a better way to keep them; wouldn't some get lost?</p>

<p class="dream">I selected a bicycle that said $215 on one side of the box and $225 on the other,
but I didn't notice this to be indicative of a dream.</p>

<p class="dream">I told the guy which one I wanted, and as he got it down I could see all the parts
tumbling around like a brass and rubber Lego set.</p>

<p>My wake up alarm went off as I was looking at the parts.</p>
