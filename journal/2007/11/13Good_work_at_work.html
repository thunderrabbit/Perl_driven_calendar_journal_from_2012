<p>Sweet.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thunderrabbit/1993105328/"><img

chunk of code to a new location, but now with this data being written properly, I can check off
another box on the imaginary task list for this project.</p>

<p>Yes.  I figured out where the chunk of code should go, moved the main part of it (proved the
concept will work (i.e. I can send the data it creates to where I need to display it)) and now just
need to move the rest.</p>
