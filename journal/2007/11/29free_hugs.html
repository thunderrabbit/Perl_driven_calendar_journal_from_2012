<p>Minyaco on mixi gave me free coffee and two free hugs!</p>

<p>Grouchy guy came by twice, once while two guys from the US were chatting.  One works in Nakano
on some environmental stuff so I gave him a PB card.</p>

<p>Pretty low turnout tonight.  About 18 hugs total in an hour.  Had one burst of hugs, like 8 in 4
minutes.  So the median was 1 every 6 minutes, though the average was one every 3 (almost)</p>

<p>One woman has a super nice fur coat; she gave a decent length hug and asked how it was out
here.  I was like &quot;cold!&quot; but I wish I had said &quot;fun!&quot;  or at least &quot;cold,
but fun!&quot;  Ah well.</p>
