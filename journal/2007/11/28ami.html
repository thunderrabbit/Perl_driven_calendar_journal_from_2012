<p>Got a funny email from Ami a couple hours ago.  Basically she said she was tired and asked if
she could go to my house.  I have a sneaking suspicion that she's planning something cute.  Not
sure what it could be, though... Hmmmm.</p>

<p>Welp, looks like I was wrong.  I did &quot;sneak up on her&quot; by implying I was still at
work, though I was about 3 minutes away from the apartment, and then I knocked on my own door so
she wouldn't think it was me.</p>

<p>She opened it and I was like, &quot;¤ï¤Ã¡ª&quot; the Japanese equivalent of &quot;boo!&quot;</p>

<p>She pretended to be scared and shut the door on me at first.  Funny stuffs.</p>
