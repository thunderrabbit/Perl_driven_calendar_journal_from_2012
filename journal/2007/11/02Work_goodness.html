<p>Hells yeah.  Got some good shit done at work.  Added a private function to a class to make it
go.  I'm getting better at PHP.. basically same programming as any modern language; it's just
learning the functions they have available.  There are lots, and I like it.  Especially print_r().
That function is my new best friend.</p>

<p>Anywaysss, I added a person-count thing where previously the users had to go to a different
screen to get the pertinant data; I snag it for them at put it on the screen where they need the
data.  Aw yeah.</p>
