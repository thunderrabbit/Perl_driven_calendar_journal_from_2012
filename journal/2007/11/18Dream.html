<p>This morning I had an interesting dream, ...</p>

<p class="dream">In a big department store set of buildings, got into an elevator with Ami and she
deftly hit a sequence of buttons like a menuing system which described where she wanted the
elevator to take us:  Down to 5th floor, over to the next building, Down to 2nd floor, then over to
the next building, Up to 7th floor.  Her route was well beyond my knowledge of the elevator system;
I didn't even know they could go sideways, much less where we should go sideways, much much less
how to do it.</p>

<p class="dream">As the buttons flashed on the screen she pushed the correct ones faster than I
could really see what was going on.  I'd need to ask her how to do that sometime.</p>

<p class="dream">We arrived at our destination and the receptionist was like, &quot;Rob, why are you
late?&quot; and I was like, &quot;psshh you do *not* even know how much earlier I am than I woulda
been!&quot; but I remembered what had happened:</p>

<p class="dream">When I left before, it was because one of the teachers didn't understand
&quot;where I was going&quot; with the lesson; she thought (correctly) that I didn't have a plan
for my lesson.  She was like, &quot;can I talk to you a sec?&quot; and we stepped out and started
to tell each other our respective life histories; she had lived through the recent hurricane, but
it turns out she was a teenager at that time.  I was like, &quot;wait; you were in that hurricane
last month and you were a teenager at that time??&quot;  it just didn't make much sense to me.</p>

<p>then some stuff I forgot</p>

<p class="dream">and then had to hurry back, so Ami did the elevator secret code and when we arrived
the receptionist was all, &quot;why are you late?&quot; and all the YRUUers were there, but not
organized and certainly not ready to study.  I was like, &quot;aight everybody; listen up,&quot; but
my voice was barely audible, so I walked through the crowd confiscating everyone's frisbees to get
their attention.  I was like, &quot;aight; we're going to play a game ...&quot; and proceeded to
explain some game that would be both fun and educational as I woke up.</p>
