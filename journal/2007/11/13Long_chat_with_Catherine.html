  http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2007/11/13#Freestyle_yoga
1:41 PM Scott: hey rob - this is scott
 me: Hey Scott!
  nice to virtually meet you
 Scott: you too! hold on - catherine is signing in...
  this is catherine. what did scott say to you?
1:42 PM me: He said you're the most amazing woman he's ever met
 Scott: ok he was good
 me: Yes.
 Scott: what time is it there?
 me: Or perhaps that's just my projection of what he would have said had he actually said anything.
  It's 1:42pm here
  and there?
 Scott: you project well
 me: hahahahaah
  nice
1:43 PM Scott: it's 11:42 pm over here
  so have you tried the one-legged bakasana yet?
 me: of course!
 Scott: how was it!?!?!!?
 me: That's how I sleep at night
 Scott: awesome!
 me: wtf are you talking bout... the bakasana pose I did was hardly even yoga
1:44 PM much less one leg
  does that mean one arm for support?
 Scott: o come on man
 me: if so, there's no way I can do that pose at this time
 Scott: EVERYTHING is yoga
 me: you project well
1:45 PM Scott: thank you
  hmmm...do you know what one-legged bakasana looks like?
 me: nope
 Scott: I'm extremely sure you can do it
  with your gymnastics background
 me: did you see the link I posted?.. I put my reply to yer email in my journal
 Scott: just practice on grass and you should be fine
1:46 PM oh cool. haven't seen yet
 me: so "one leg" means "one arm" in this case, right? given that it's the crane pose
 Scott: ok....www.yogasublime.com
  click on gallery. it's the last picture
1:47 PM yeah, I just saw the post
1:48 PM me: I just saw the picture on your kick ass website!
  very nice
  yah; I can do the one leg bakasana, but with limited extension
 Scott: so what do you think? practicing on grass today?
  understandable
 me: if I find any grass, I will do it!
 Scott: but you were on grass in your bakasana!
  where was that?
1:49 PM me: Both weed and grass are illegal here in the main city
 Scott: shame
 me: that was 30 minutes away by train
 Scott: oh
  hmmm...maybe a pillow would do
 me: but yeah, I can find my bed or something
 Scott: Ami seems cooll
 me: are these B&W pics you?
 Scott: yes
 me: she's awesome
 Scott: when she coming back to US
 me: you're awesome
 Scott: I know I'm awesome
1:50 PM me: um... no plans as yet
 Scott: have we lost you to japan forever?
 me: sigh
  I don't think so
  but it sure has been a long time
 Scott: nah, time flies
1:51 PM me: I'm not really impressed with the USG right about now
 Scott: it was just yesterday that I bought your filing cabinet
 me: silly!
  that was the day before yesterday
 Scott: ah, my mistake
  aren't you supposed to be at work?
 me: shhhh
 Scott: oops
1:52 PM me: or are you trying to get rid of me?
 Scott: no, not at all
 me: After my year + traveling, plus breaking my shoulder, I was a bit low on funds
 Scott: yeah, I saw your surgery pics
 me: so now I'm just working to get back into positive net worth territory.
 Scott: they were grawesome
 me: they are awesome!
  gruesomely awesome!
1:53 PM Scott: yes!
 me: and 100% recovery in the shoulder department
 Scott: excellent
 me: I actually have more flexibility in that shoulder than the other for some reason
  fully strength and everything so it's a nice blessing
  nice way to end a broken shoulder story
1:54 PM are you in NYC?
 Scott: nope. boston
 me: gah
 Scott: nyc is depressing
  close enough man
 me: sorry I knew you were in NEwEngland
 Scott: it's all the same
  cold
 me: ah, you're so generous with geography
 Scott: dreary
 me: and so picky with yoga!
 Scott: what do you mean?
 me: Why are you there?
1:55 PM I'm just fuckin' with you.
 Scott: because of Scott, my beloved
 me: New York = Boston, but...
  in this pose, your left pinky should be just like this
 Scott: oh hush
  that's the art of yoga
  anal retentiveness
 me: Any pics of Scott?
 Scott: ___________________
1:56 PM me: good lord with the domains!
 Scott: wedding website
  yeah man!
  we're both website designing hobbyists!
 me: I thought you were more... I dunno natural life than e-life
 Scott: e-life and yoga and food
 me: were you when I knew you?
 Scott: I don't remember
  ah, I was just starting off
1:57 PM you should be teaching me!!!
 me: That would be my pleasure
  Is he Puerto Rican?
 Scott: OK, how do you embed flickr slideshows AND be standards compliant
  No, he's not
 me: that's the first idea that comes to mind when I see him, but
 Scott: although I've asked that often
 me: You've asked him??
1:58 PM Scott: typo
  I've been asked that often
  LOL, uh, honey, are you puerto rican?
 me: to which standard do you want to comply?
 Scott: he's so tired of me asking him
 me: Are you sure you're not Puerto Rican?
 Scott: Im not sure about myselof
 me: Scott, honey, we need some honesty in our relationship.
1:59 PM Scott: ok, I'm puerto rican
  he's cool with it
 me: So where's he from?
 Scott: half african american and half caucasian
  we grew up on the same street!
 me: reallly????
  that's fuckin' tight!
 Scott: he used to walk me to the bus stop in middle school!
 me: what street was that?
2:00 PM Scott: ______
 me: aaawwwwww
 Scott: I know
  I didn't like him back then
 me: Man he was planning ahead!
 Scott: my mom made me walk with him for my safety
 me: espeically for being so young
 Scott: yeah. that's why he's a lawyer!
2:01 PM compliant with www consortium or something rather
 me: w3c, I imagine
  but which standard?
 Scott: yes yes that's it
  strict xhtml
 me: there's XHTML st
2:02 PM I didn't even have time to type it
 Scott: I beat you to it
 me: okay, that answer is easy!
 Scott: gimme answer please
 me: I have no idea how to do it.
  that's my easy answer
 Scott: you're awesome
 me: I imagine the cats at flickr have to change it
  BUT
 Scott: I wanna be a good coder
2:03 PM no iframes!!!!
 me: There's an API for flickr so you can write a thing that gets the pics you want in any standard
you want
 Scott: uh, what's API
  ama google it
 me: good
  that's what I did for rockabahkasana
 Scott: application programming interface
 me: yes
2:04 PM Scott: whoa. cool. api for bakasana?
  you teach me yoga!
 me: basically it's a set of "hooks" that let you call Flickr's database
 Scott: ok, I get that
 me: excellent!
  I'll teach you how to make a pose called API
2:05 PM Scott: will it change the interface of my pose?
  because I don't want my pinky toe being all over the place
 me: ah man, those pinky toes are always the trick
  the toes pose
2:06 PM Scott: are you still running?
 me: skating?
 Scott: (I haven't forgotten api and flickr)
 me: I never liked running
 Scott: can't skate up here
 me: why?
 Scott: man o man I miss it though
  well, I did last summer
  you still skating?
  weather's crappy throughout most the year
2:07 PM me: The problem with coming back to the US is all my bestestest friends are scattered all
over the place, so even if I came *back*, it would be like moving to a whole new world
 Scott: sux
 me: dude. Tell that Scott kid to move to where it's lovely and warm!
 Scott: we move back to Houston next year!
 me: woot!
 Scott: I skate more!
 me: woot!
 Scott: I know, isn't that so cool!!!!
  I can't wait to get back in my skates
2:08 PM me: So, when I arrived in Japan, I had skates
 Scott: and then?
 me: the first time I put them on, the strap fucking BROKE
 Scott: ack!
 me: and I was pissed, but used duct tape to fix it
 Scott: that stuff is magical
 me: and skated successfully one (1) time
 Scott: goodness
 me: and haven't skated again with my skates since then
 Scott: aw man!
 me: I have rented skates, but not done any urban adventures
2:09 PM it was just in a rinky dinky rink
 Scott: is japan a skating friendly city?
 me: no way
 Scott: you urban skaters are crazy
 me: not even bicycle friendly
  ah, but it's hella fun
  I do where a helmet now
 Scott: YOU move to a skate and bike friendly city
  as well you should
 me: after my lovely head broke the concrete
 Scott: yeah, I remember that story
  you're one lucky bastard
2:10 PM me: so.. yah I should get some skates
  and a helmet again
  I do miss ripping up the pavement and parts of my skin
 Scott: you heal well because you have good spirit
  the glory
 me: I appreciate you noting that
 Scott: it's true
 me: I have always told people to focus on being well
  not focus on "aw I broke my blahblahblabh"
2:11 PM Scott: that's so yoga of you
  yoga and api of you
 me: when I broke my shoulder I was like, "cool! I finally broke my shoulder"
 Scott: the api links your spirit to your yoga
 me: I rememeber the trees, the sky; the day was beautiful, and I successfully lived through hitting
 a car. it was awesome
 Scott: wow
2:12 PM me: okay, so
  if
 Scott: I can see that being a spiritual experience
 me: you really want some help with flickr API stuff
  we should talk; I may be able to help
 Scott: I'm trying to incorporate one in my yoga website
2:13 PM me: it was especially so after having just done a 10 day Vipassana meditation
 Scott: in japan?
 me: is yer website straight flat html?
  yes
 Scott: html/css
 me: it was weird because everything was being translated, so my brain was caught up in telling them
 to shut up so I could meditate
  kinda funny, but not at the time
2:14 PM we basically need to write a page or two in PHP on your site
 Scott: one of my students from japan says that there isn't a lot of yoga there
 me: that will allow you to call the API
 Scott: the best thing for me to do is study some php and api and then we collaborate
 me: there's a lot of .... hobby yoga
 Scott: I want to know what the frak is happening to my website
 me: some housewives go to yoga studios
 Scott: that and it's cool
2:15 PM housewives?
 me: yah
 Scott: is this something you heard or have you experienced?
 me: pretty clear cut distinction between male and females here in terms of duties
2:16 PM Well, it was like a survey
 Scott: is Ami a traditional japanese female?
 me: the only people I heard "yoga" from were my female students in English school
2:17 PM she's a bit traditional in that she can cook, but she's also working in a law firm as a
clerk of some variety
  she'd like to study whatsit... to be a paralegal in the US
 Scott: oh cool, so she aspires to move to the US
2:18 PM me: so I've been encouraging her to pump up her English skillz to do that
 Scott: you best be better about speaking english with her
 me: yah; she'd like to "move to America" but I don't know that she knows why
  yah, I certainly don't force her to speak English
2:19 PM Scott: but if she's really interested in moving to US, she needs to practice, no?
 me: yes yes fo sho
 Scott: um, I hope you don't speak like that to her
 me: hahahahahahah
 Scott: she won't get a parlegal job that way
 me: my Japanese is probably that messy, but I speak correct English with her
2:20 PM Scott: so what's youre speaking level now?
 me: ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
 Scott: can you converse with any Japanese person
 me: no way
 Scott: but you're able to speak with Ami?
  that's impressive
 me: basically yes
  thanks
2:21 PM I sound fluent to most Americans, but I have a long ways to go before I can just chat with
peeps on the street
  or even people I know
 Scott: k, I gotta go. It's past midnight over here.
 me: aight peace out!
 Scott: and I gots to teach in the morning!
2:22 PM me: have funnnnnn!
 Scott: thanks for chatting man
 me: I miss our lessons, btw
 Scott: you too!!! and work!!!!
  I do too. those were so fun
 me: seriously don't let the API thing vanish if you wanna do it
 Scott: you were my guinea pig

 Scott: I'm not going to let it vanish
  I'm very interested
 me: good.
