<p>Waking up this morning, I found a message from Marcel:</p>

<pre>
Rob,

Thanks for keeping me up-to-date on happenings of Rob's epp.  A
comment and a question.

First the comment: you should be able to renew your driver's license
online.  Check out
<a href="http://www.texasonline.state.tx.us/NASApp/rap/apps/dpsdl/jsp/eng/welcome.jsp">http://www.texasonline.state.tx.us/NASApp/rap/apps/dpsdl/jsp/eng/welcome.jsp</a>,
so long as a) your license hasn't been expired for more than 2 years
and b) "You currently have a Texas residential or mailing address and
will retain a Texas residence or mailing address."  See the FAQ
(<a href="http://www.texasonline.state.tx.us/NASApp/rap/BaseRap">http://www.texasonline.state.tx.us/NASApp/rap/BaseRap</a>) for details.

Now, the question.  Regarding R.O.B.O.T. ... I know you are a sincere
person.  I hope you know of my immense respect for you, as well as my
brotherly love and concern for your well being.  So I am asking this
question as seriously as I can (through email), so please consider it
thoughtfully and perhaps even during your meditations.  Also, I'm not
asking that you necessarily share the answer with me--I leave that as
an option to you--although I hope you will feel safe enough to do
that.  Here's the question: if you follow ROBOT and its tenets
faithfully and with a pure conscious, dedicating your life to it and
holding it in earnest above all other relationships, having done these
things what will you do if you still feel something missing?

Much love and thanks again,
Marcel

<p>I always like messages from Marcel; he's always thoughtful, thorough, and usually funny.  And in
his epp, there are several kids running around, so for him to take time to write to me is like
wow!</p>

me: Hey Marcel!
 Marcel: Waaassuuuuuup?!?!
 me: I am (supposed to be) busy at work!
 Marcel: Bwahahahahaha!
 me: I got your email, comment and question
thank you!
 Marcel: Engage MR Labs obfuscation chat device.
 me: asdf9234 ,mas,dfl;iu the first person to have actually read the text in R.O.B.O.T., so thank you for that.
 Marcel: emoclew era uoY
 me: I definitely don't have time to chatfully answer your question now, but just the above thanks for now.
 Marcel: You bet.
I do have an interesting comment about the epp, but didn't want to bog down the email I sent.
 me: I liked your use of my new word epp.
I'm ready!
 Marcel: (Well, I think it's interesting)
Oh, ok.
 me: Well, I think I'm ready
 Sent at 10:27 AM on Friday
 Marcel: So, it's interesting to me that the God of the Old Testament (in Exodus) identifies Himself as "I AM."
 Sent at 10:28 AM on Friday
 me: sounds like epp, except for "referring" to anything, but yes
 Marcel: Well, I'm still new to the whole ROBOT thing... ;&rpar;
 me: hahaha
 Marcel: Hehehe
 me: please continue
or is that it?
 Marcel: Oh, that was basically it.
 me: nice
 Marcel: Simple and sweet.
 me: so, yeah, that's a big part of my belief system: stuff is
 Marcel: How's Ami?
(Sound of Marcel typing over Rob)
 me: Ami: "I am Ami"
Ami's fine and equally busy at work and shtuffs
 Marcel: That's almost a palindrome...
(thought it was at first sight)
 me: yah; I just noticed the same three letters could be used three times each...
She's good, thanks.  :-&rpar;

<p>I've just put together the stuff above from the email and chat with Marcel.  At some point I'd
like to answer his question here.  I think I'll do it today.</p>
