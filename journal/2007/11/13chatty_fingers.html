<p>I just alt-s to save, and my finger also hit alt-w, which closes the window.</p>

<p>I didn't consciously notice what happened; I thought the screen had scrolled and that I had found
a new way to scroll the window on SubEthaEdit.  I hit alt-w a few more times to see how it works
and <em>of course; it closes the windows</em> (I've only used the key combination a million billion
times) and I just kept alt-w-ing until they were all closed.  (a million billion six)</p>

<p>Hmm.  I guess it's time for me to go, if I listen to my fingers.</p>

<p>Okay bye, work; see you tomorrow.</p>
