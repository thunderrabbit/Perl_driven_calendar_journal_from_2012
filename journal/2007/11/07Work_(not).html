<p>Left work to meet up with Ami soon.  Today I spent the first half finishing up my Rob Update, a
Kim Update, and trying to figure out jabber.</p>

<p>The second half of the day was spent playing with phpfreechat... at first I was trying to tweak
some code I found to create a Special:Chat page, but (after not being able to make it work) I found
someone had already done what I was trying to do (and more)...  but then I couldn't get *that* code
to work any better than the code I had already been tweaking.</p>

<p>I probably need to put it down for a bit, but I think I'm going to write to the author of the
second code and see if I can get some answers to a few pressing questions.</p>

<pre>
are your comments what the code does, or what it should do?
do you have an example of it running?
what is ajax.php supposed to do?
</pre>
