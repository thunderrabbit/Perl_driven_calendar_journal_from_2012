<p>After a lovely dinner of creamy vegetable stew and cucumber and corn salad with seasame seed
dressing, Ami and I romped like monkeys and then zonked out.</p>

<p>I couldn't go to sleep for a bit after she left, so I got up and have been working on Castle of
Dreams' 2nd floor (above the ground floor inner ward medieval castle level, (which is above the B1
gameroom and restaurant level,) and below my hallway and corridor floor).</p>

<p>There are now 66 rooms in the Castle, with plans for about 6 more.  Although at this
point, <em>most</em> of the rooms just have &lt;navigation/&gt; as their content.</p>
