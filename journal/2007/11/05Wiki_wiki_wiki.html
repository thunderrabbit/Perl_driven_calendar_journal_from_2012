<p>Big fun on my wiki today; I learned how to add categories and created Programming with PHP code
and Perl code as sub categories.  I added the Digg.php extension (which, like the Flickr extension
was also written by Ed Simpson), and I might add an extension called Categories as Tags, which
allows people with edit permission to easily add categories to documents.</p>

<p>For <em>work</em>, I wrote a PHP function that trims the middle of a string, which I used on a
page I worked on today (basically finished), and put the source code under PHP code on my wiki.
Actually I put it under PHP functions, thinking I'd have enough PHP code to require a second
category, but... for now at least, I don't need two PHP categories.</p>

<p>I dugg the Smugmug extension for MediaWiki using the Digg.php code, and was glad to see no other
Smugmug extensions for MediaWiki.  Is it a first?  Is it going to be enjoyed by at least a few
people?</p>

<p>I put the code for rob_updates.pl in the Perl category, and got a warning by MediaWiki: the page
is &quot;too big,&quot; and I should consider trimming it.  Hmmmm. I think if it's not too big for
me, it shouldn't be too big for my wiki.</p>

<p>Oh, and I finished &quot;importing&quot; email addresses into my Rob Updates list.  I should
check that off my todo list from yesterday</p>
