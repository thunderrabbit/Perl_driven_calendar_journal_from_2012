<p>Eeek.  Good thing I didn't upload last night; I discovered a pretty good reason for the old way
the code is working.  Basically there's an option on the front page that lets the users click
without specifying a missionID.  In that case, the drop down list is useful.</p>

<p>I've adjusted the code now to allow both specifying the ID and not.  Testing now.</p>

<p>tested, then while writing some Castle stuff and reading about Bender, I waited around for 中谷さん 
to show 今井さん and he was able to explain the full gist of all the changes.  Amazing how
lanugage fluency helps with these things.</p>

<p>Going to upload to live server now.</p>
