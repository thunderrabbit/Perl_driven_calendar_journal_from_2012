<p>From 8:45 to 9:50, an interesting number of free hugs.  I'll make a graph:</p>

<p>Where A = 8:45 - 9pm, B = 9pm to 9:15pm, C = 9:15 - 9:35pm, D = 9:35-9:50pm.</p>

<p>I don't really know what happened with the dropoff to B, but for C and D my theory is a bit of a
sprinkle and I was talking to two guys, although we were holding the sign up.  Not really sure if
that affected anything, but it's the only differences I could see.</p>

<p>They go to Keio and a different university (dang I forgot the name, but it's in Ichigaya),
respectively, and the one from Keio kept telling me about his cool Aussie teacher and interest in
social issues.  When the other guy said he was studying environmental issues, I gave them a single
PB postcard to share.  I only gave one because I have very few remaining, and I imagine
psychologically they will value it more.  The non-Keio student had heard of PB and was excited to
hear it's near his house when I promoted the samba thing by Francis Silva which will be next-next
Saturday (I think).</p>

<p>At the very end of our free hug adventure (as in I had been planning to leave 1 minute earlier),
three girls came up; one gave me a pretty long hug, and the others gave me 2 and 0 hugs
respectively.  They were standing around a bit as they chatted to see if they were going to go home
or go eat somewhere in Shibuya.  I thought they might invite us, and I was thinking &quot;no
nononono please don't,&quot; because I am pretty hungry (for food) and I don't want to get
&quot;close to&quot; any young smiley girl who gave me a long long hug.  I'm sure I'd be able to
handle the temptation, but I preferred to simply not have to handle it at all.</p>

<p>I bid my university friends adeiu and said &quot;bye!&quot; cheerfully to the girls, who didn't
seem to notice.  Hmmm; maybe it was all in my head.</p>

<p>I resisted the temptation to make sure they knew I was leaving, &quot;heyyyy, <em>I'm
leaving</em>&quot; [don't you want a last chance to ask me out?]</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was able to make my legs carry my silly brain into the train station and not look back.</p>
