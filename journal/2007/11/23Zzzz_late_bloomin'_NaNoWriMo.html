<p>So, I mentioned NaNoWriMo to Laura and we decided to do our own competition in December.  We're
going to follow the same rules as the November one, but just with different dates, and trade our
results in the new year.</p>

<p>As we were making these plans, I was chatting with Christine on gmail.</p>

<p>However, so as to be confusing, here is a snippet of the chat with <em>Laura</em>:</p>

<pre>
Laura: Ok, but I want anyone who joins our competition to follow the rules.
   me: I see
Laura: The first NaNoWriMo competition had only 21 people, with 6 people finishing their 50,000 words.
       So a small competition is realistic.
   me: Well, before you wrote that you want anyone who joins to follow the rules, I already invited her to join.
       So I can't take that back,
Laura: But you can point her to the FAQ and try to persuade her, like I tried to persuade you.
   me: and since there will be no real prizes in our competition, I don't think it matters
       BUT I will happily show her the link to the faq
       perhaps she also hasn't seen it.

November 1?</a></p>

<p>I personally don't mind who writes starting with what, but once the FB group is created, I'll
send that link and the FAQ link to Christine.</p>

<p>Okay, bedtime.</p>
