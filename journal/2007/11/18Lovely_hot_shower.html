<p>My knee felt sore but basically fine when I showered, showering it with love and kisses and hot
hot water.  Interesting that I noticed the difference between 40 degrees and 44 degrees.  I guess
it would be more interesting if I hadn't asked Ami if the water was less than 44 degrees, but
simply told her it was with a request to pump up the heat.</p>

<p>(( Everywhere that I've seen hot water in Japan, it's either been from a hot spring or from a
hot water on-demand type thing.  Press the button, gas turns on to heat the water as is flows
through the coils, hot water pours out with a delay of about 4 seconds.</p>

<p>This seems like a pretty good system.  No hot water tanks; no &quot;running out of hot
water&quot; during long showers, and, when bathtubs are involved, there's a thermometer built in.
Press the up arrow to bump the temperature up, down for down.  Yummy hot hot water..  Mmmmmm.
