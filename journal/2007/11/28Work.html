<p>Bah; this sucks; I'm leaving.</p>

<p>Basically I finished everything around 4:30pm and waited &quot;until 5pm&quot; when 今井さん
would come back and 中谷さん would explain everything and get the approval to upload it.</p>

<p>I guess *I* could talk to 今井さん, but I'm being a pansy and don't want to try to muddle through
the Japanese chaos.  Basically I'm intimidated by him and I'd rather go home and play with Ami.</p>

<p>Aight fuck that.  I'm going to show 今井さん now.</p>

<p class="date">6:45pm JST</p>

<p>There.  I showed him.  Didn't get approval to upload it to the main server, but I showed him.</p>

<p>And I showed myself I can do it!</p>

<p>Okay, now I'm going home to play with Ami.</p>
