<p>Feelin' much more awake after I-group than I was before, but I'm sure this will pas by the time
I get home.  On the train now in Shibuya and about to leave in a few minutes.</p>

<p>My work tonight was regarding </p>

<p>((We interrupt this normally scheduled babble to say holy shit a girl who I saw last night is
sitting across from me tonight!  Wow.  I recognize her fingernails, complexion and nose.  I think
she also got off in Motosumiyoshi..  wow.  (welp, she got off in Jiygaoka)))</p>

<p>Tonight on the way to I-group i got angry at a woman who was standing in front of me on the
moving sidewalk, while I was wanting to walk forward with great speed; she was blocking the way.  I
didn't understand why I felt angry at her, so I talked about that in I-group tonight.  D was saying
that he accepted me and my anger, and invited me to accept myself and my own anger.  M was more in
tune with what I was trying to do: somehoe arrange myself so that the anger doesn't even come
up.</p>

<p>After talking about the situation, I felt relaxed; I knew I could come up behind someone in my
way and not feel angry.  This morning I felt equally relaxed.  So what happened today that switched
my brain cells around such that I responded with anger when wanting to go past someone?</p>

<p>I came up with the sense that because I had pushed myself to stay awake when I was crazy sleepy
may have had something to do with it.  Perhaps next time I can take a power nap in the loo or go out
to a nearby outdoor &quot;quiet&quot; area that I found some weeks ago.</p>

<p>At one point I said basically, &quot;I don't want to be an old man getting mad at people who are
in my way.  I can't accept that version of me, so I wanna fix it now [before I grow up to be a
crotchety old man].&quot;</p>
