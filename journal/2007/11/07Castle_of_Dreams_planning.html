Laura Dear,

I'm not sure how I didn't think of this before, but I have just
created a wiki that I'd like to use to recapture the Castle of Dreams
experience.

I'm thinking I'll have to let go of getting it exactly right, but if
you'd like to create an account on there (all spellings of Guenniveer
are available), I'd be delighted.

I'll be thinking of how to make it feel like the old castle... we'll
see how it goes.

  Love Love
   - Rob!

&gt; Great idea!  I'm there!
Hooray!

&gt; I still have a lot of old Castle archives, many of them in Blue Wave,
&gt; which I don't even have currently installed.  This would be a great
&gt; way to archive them permanently, if that was your intention.

I would love to permanently archive as much as possible.

&gt; Perhaps
&gt; the archives should be separate though, because they will be so
&gt; overwhelming that they might stunt new growth.

I'm not too worried about stunting new growth; I think I'm more interested in recording the great thing we created.

HOWEVER, you have more of an idea of what you have in your archives.  I know a lot of it is just quotes of quotes of quoted messages, with little funny tidbits..   Should those get converted into "stories?"  How would such stories be appropriately put into a wiki?   Perhaps something like this:

------

You walk into the library and see row after row of books.  You see something glowing on the table.  It appears to be an electronic tablet.  When you pick it up, the screen comes on, saying simply  [[index of book titles]].  

You consider spending some time in the big comfy chair in the corner.

-------

&gt; I assume you have the original description pages?
Because I have moved so much, I have none of the old anything, except fond memories in my mind.

&gt; Is Nim really there already or did you just create it under his name
&gt; for "authenticity?"  :-)

Nim is not actually there, but yeah, I just created that username as the sysop for old time's sake.  
Then I worried about what username he would use if he did actually come!
and what username would be the sysop..  
anyway, these are all trivial matters of usernaming users.

&gt; You know, it just occurred to me, but we should look around to see if
&gt; anyone has written a web-based version of the original bbs software.
&gt; I know there are lots of "forum" designs out there, but it would be
&gt; cool to have the DOS screens with the colored text and the original
&gt; menus.

Oooh that would be cool!  I wonder if it could be set up to give different colors based on who's logged in and reading.  (my colors are blue, quotes are gray, etc)

It could simply be a skin on top of WikiMedia, but that wouldn't likely allow for colorization based on perspective.   Hmmm.

&gt; BTW I am a wiki goddess too.
Cool!

&gt; I have a private one installed on my computer that I use as a PIM.
Personal Information Manager?


I'm a bit curious on appropriate ways to make it interactive.   We can just lay out all the descriptive text as the "rooms" but how to handle conversations?

I'm going to work on putting a chat in some of the rooms, and eventually hope we can get them to automagically be logged, I guess by date / amount of content.   They should be logged in the library, of course.

Oooh this will be fun!
