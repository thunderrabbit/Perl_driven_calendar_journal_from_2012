<p>Ami had a lovely time meeting peeps from PB and getting a sense of what I love so much.  There
was a guest speaker today: Charles Mc something, the original organizer of what is
now <a href="http://www.2hj.org/index.php/eng_home">Second Harvest Japan</a>, basically a food bank
to redistribute some of the tons (literally) of food that are thrown away each day.</p>

<p>His entire lecture was in Japanese, but I had met him on 52nd voyage, so I had a basic
understanding of what he was saying.  Ami was a bit agast at the mass quantities of food that is
wasted.</p>

<p>After hearing about all the food, we went to get some food: me and Ami with Maruan and Kyoko
plus Kyoko's student Eri went to the Greek Gyro restaurant to chow and enjoy chatting about
language and cultural differences.  Interesting: Maruan and Ami love to eat me.  Kyoko and I prefer
to eat vegetarian.  Ami and Kyoko like to watch TV.  Maruan and I hate it.</p>

<p>Oh, and how can I forget: I bought a new Gundam for 100 yen at the flea market after Charles'
lecture.  It's new in the original package, though the package has been opened.  I'm gonna try to
sell it on ebay.</p>
