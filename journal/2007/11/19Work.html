<p>This morning 井上さん uploaded the code that I finished last week.  For some reason it wasn't
working, but I told 中谷さん that I couldn't research it without access to the production system.
So I got the root password.  Nice.</p>

<p>Turned out the problem was pretty simple: I hadn't specified to make a change to the DB so the
data could be stored.  I'm surprised actually that the system didn't crash when we tried to run the
code against a misshapen DB.</p>

<p>Anyways, I added the field and the code worked.</p>

<p>I requested a new project after that, which was really easy.  Basically it was a cosmetic change
to one of the reports.  For some reason, they basically wanted me to change</p>

<pre>
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1500
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1200
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 2300
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1000
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 2200
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1900
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 3200
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 2400
                       total 15700
</pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre>
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1500 - 100 =  1400
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1200 - 100 =  1100
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 2300 - 100 =  2200
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1000 - 100 =   900
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 2200 - 100 =  2100
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 1900 - 100 =  1800
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 3200 - 100 =  3100
stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 2400 - 100 =  2300
                      totals 15700 - 800 = 14900
</pre>

<p>, <em>hardcoding</em> the 100 into place.  I asked three times about the harcoding, just to make
sure I can get lots of time to make the real change if they ever want to make it variable.  I made
the change, tested the code a couple times, moved it to the production server with my new root
access.</p>

<p class="date">8:15pm JST Monday 19 November 2007 (day 13753)</p>

<p>Finished another little project today of getting some totals to show up on another page.  I'm
quite pleased I was able to do it with such a little change to the code I had just written a couple
of days ago.  I mean in two cases I had written the code so that it could be easily expanded.</p>

<pre>
foreach (array('already', 'added_today') as $var)
{
    print shtuffs
}
</pre>

<p>I had written it as a loop with an array even though there was one (1) element in the array.
Today I just made it two elements.  So beautiful.</p>

<p>The other part I had to change was to the mySQL code; this was a bit trickier</p>

<p>From this:</p>

<pre>
        SELECT
	    up.*,
        FROM
	    U_P as up
        {$where_sql}
        {$order_by}
        {$limit_sql}
</pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre>
        SELECT
            up.*,
            SUM(up2.ms) as total
        FROM
	    U_P as up
	    INNER JOIN U_P as up2
	    ON up.id = up2.id
        {$where_sql}
	GROUP BY up.id
        {$order_by}
        {$limit_sql}
</pre>

<p>ps: the variable names in the real code are nicely longer, but I'm being super cautious about
what code I give out.</p>
