<p>On the way back from lunch, I saw a trashcan that was overflowing, but had enough room for my
tiny little wad of paper.  I threw my paper away, but it bounced out and onto the ground.</p>

<p>I shrugged and started to go on, but then paused and thought I should pick it up. I considered
how small my piece of trash was compared to the others that were already scattered on the ground,
and how silly it would be to pick mine up, but not those.</p>

<p>But that's what I did, carefully got my little piece of trash, placed it into the trash can, and
moved on.</p>

<p>Just then some cops went by, and several seconds later they came back up to me from behind.</p>

<p>They basically asked me to empty my pockets, which I was happy to do because my pocket contents
feature Francois, so he got to sit in the cop's hat.  Sorry, no picture, though.</p>

<p>After a bit, I asked them why they stopped me, and they said something about me taking something
near the shop.  I was like, &quot;dawg, I was throwin' shit away,&quot; and thought <em>there's no
*shop* stuff near that trash can; I couldn't have stolen anything.</em></p>

<p>The one who inspected my ID card pointed out that it expires soon.  I was like, &quot;I totally
know,&quot; but couldn't explain in Japanese what had happened yesterday.  (We'll get it sorted
quite soon.)</p>

<p>They saluted and let me on my way.</p>

<p>Meh; silly world.</p>
