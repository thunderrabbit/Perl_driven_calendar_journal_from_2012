<p>The only bad thing about flopping around is losing contact with my dream memories</p>

<p class="dream">Taking a test, like some sort of essay exam with Colleen, and given by my mom.  I
don't remember the question, but my answer was in the form of a restaurant review by some famous
French restaurant critic:</p>

<p class="dream"><blockquote>I could taste the residual oil from the process used to extract the
seeds from the apples in the apple sauce, and the serated edge of the knife blade used to cut the
sliver of chocolate left burn marks on my palate, but I give it five stars because you
fast-food-masses won't be able to detect these finer details of the eating
experience.</blockquote></p>

<p class="dream">And I was just shocked that anyone could detect these things, and why the heck was
this an answer to my test?</p>

<p class="dream">Then I was climbing vertically down a flight of stairs by monkeying my way down the
banisters, with the goal being to never actually touch the steps.  I came to the bottom where the
steps turned the opposite direction from before so I had to climb across the staircase without
touching it, but as the staircase was more often used at the bottom than the top, it was *much*
wider at the bottom, and I realized it would be possible to do it if I climbed up to the top and
climbed easily across to start my way down on the other side, so I was about to do that when I
realized the only person who cared about it was me, and the only person who knew wtf I was doing was
me, so it wouldn't matter if I just got off the banister and walked down the steps like a normal
person.</p>

<p class="dream">Hmmf.</p>
