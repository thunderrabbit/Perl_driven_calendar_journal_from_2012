<p>Ami ended up not coming over tonight, so I joined Max and Juergen at CoCo's Curry place near
Motosumiyoshi station.  I hadn't been there before though I walk by it basically twice a day.  I
had always imagined it would reek of smoke, but actually it was fine.  And they have goma dressing
there; yummmmmmmeeeeeey!</p>

<p>They told me about the differences between German and Japanese school system, and the job
industry in Germany, which they indicated was harder to change jobs in Germany than the US,
including harder to be fired from a job.</p>

<p>We got some pics and trekked back, using the shortcut I take every day, though they had never
before used it.</p>
