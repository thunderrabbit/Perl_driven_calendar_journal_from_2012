<p>Aight.  I have something to do at work.  It should take me about... 20 minutes, including
writing this entry about it, updating my SVN code, and making a list of files that need to be
updated to the main server.</p>

<p>Ready,..  go!</p>

<p>Okay, stop!</p>

<p>Well, I got sidetracked because the test server moved to a new location, and for some reason
when I updated my bookmarks, *all* my bookmarks disappeared from my bookmark toolbar.  They were
still visible via menu, but not on the toolbar.  I copied them all from the menu to the toolbar and
they came back.</p>

<p>Only one problem with stopping now:  the code doesn't seem to be working!</p>

<p>Oh wait.  It's working.  I thought he was looking at the test DB, but it was the live one.</p>
