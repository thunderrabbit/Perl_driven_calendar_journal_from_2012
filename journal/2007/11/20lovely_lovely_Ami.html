<p>Best time ever with Ami tonight.  She came over and we just cuddled in bed and somehow
restrained ourselves from monkey business.</p>

<p>Hilarious things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>her technique of giving me medicine, as I was resisting it like a dog.  She gave me kisses
and then jammed the capsules down into my mouth, poured soy milk down to make it all go.</p></li>

<li><p>blowing games and giving her booty tickle-induced goosebumps.</p></li>

<li><p>While I was trying to undress her, Ami: &quot;I gotta go; wait until tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;it's already tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Her: &quot;no it's not..&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;oh, then we have time!&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Me chasing after her like a puppy after she started home on her bicycle.  Ami, &quot;[go]
home!&quot; so I went back, and then chased after her as soon as she started away.</p></li>
</ol>
