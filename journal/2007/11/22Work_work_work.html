<p class="date">9:40pm JST Thursday 22 November 2007 (day 13756)</p>

<p>Tomorrow is a holiday, and Monday I've got to go do visa stuff, so I've been dilligently
workworkworking and hardly playing online at all.  I've started doing a brain dump onto paper so I
can pick up easily next week.</p>

<p class="date">10:20pm JST</p>

<p>Okay.  I've layed out all my braincells so I should have no problems figuring out wtf is going
on when I come back in.</p>

<p>Best news about today is nearly getting my visa hooked up.  All the deets are written (basically)
and I just need to go to the immigration place on Monday and turn it all in.  I dunno how long it
will take / how much it will cost.  I think like 4000 yen or some such.  Gah.</p>
