<p>At the end of work today, I did a brain dump detailing that I had been working on the mission
reporting portion; making the interface a bit more strict so that it will not let them choose which
mission they want to report, but only allow the mission they most recently clicked.  I think it was
done the first way because it made the SQL queries easier; didn't have to distinguish the reasons
they weren't allowed to select the mission.</p>

<p>I'm making the error reporting a bit more useful..  actually it isn't there at all now.  If they
click http://.......&amp;mission=50, but they can't do 50 either because it doesn't exist, they've
already done it, or the mission is closed, it simply won't show up in the drop down list.</p>

<p>Now instead of giving a drop down list that doesn't include what they wanted to do, it will give
an error, and explain why they can't do it.  Unfortunately it will only distinguish between
Already-Done, and Other-Problems, because the way the first page is set up, the only way they would
get Other-Problems is if they enter the wrong URL by hand.</p>

<p>Which reminds me we should be doing better (and by &quot;better&quot; I mean &quot;&quot;) error
checking on the user input on this URL.  It's the only place I know of where we don't error check,
and I'm not sure why.</p>
