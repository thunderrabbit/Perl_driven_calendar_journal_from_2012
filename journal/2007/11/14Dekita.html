<p>Dekita (できた) means &quot;finished&quot; or &quot;did it&quot; or &quot;done&quot; or some
such.  I finished the bulk of the project on which I've been banging for a week.  Now I just need
to replace my ample debug printing things to comments (*) and test a few more times...</p>

<p>(*) I don't mean &quot;comment them out,&quot; but to actually convert them into useful
comments; apparently these debug points are where I was having questions, so, I should give the
answers in comment form.</p>

<p>Cool.  Had a problem at first after my first pass of making comments.  Had to basically do it
twice, though the second time I had a copy of the first time available.  I'm not sure why the first
time didn't work; the second time works, and from what I can see, the source code is the same.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm going to show 中谷さん now.</p>

<p>Bleh.  That was a bit less than the kudos I wanted.  I'm like, &quot;holy shit this screen in
itself was so crazy hard!&quot; and he's like, &quot;okay, now we need the sum of these numbers to
show up over *here*.&quot;</p>

<p>Yah yah fine.  That's actually not gonna be too hard.</p>

<p>Cool; I was able to get the proof of concept of the next part done.  Just need to move the code
(same situation as before).</p>
