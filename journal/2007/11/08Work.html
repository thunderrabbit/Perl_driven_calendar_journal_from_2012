<p>Actually doing some work at work today.  Yesterday I was completely engrossed in my own
projects, and didn't do anything for the company except keep my seat warm.</p>

<p>The day before, I worked about an hour or so.</p>

<p>Anyways, today there has been some productivity flowing through these fingers and arms to this
keyboard and that mouse.  I squeezed out some unused data from a report page, in preparation for
adding some more useful data, buttons, etc.</p>

<p>That was the easy part.  Now we are designing the user interface for this.</p>

<p>I wish I could post examples..</p>

<p>But all this is for our behind the scenes admin stuff.</p>
