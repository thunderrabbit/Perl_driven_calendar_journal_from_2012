<p>Back in college, Marcel once told me that he didn't like to cut-n-paste code.  He always liked
to type it out fresh.  I never could understand why: &quot;if the code works, why introduce errors
by typing it again?&quot;</p>

<p>Today, I found a reason to type it again: the code works *over there*, but it doesn't work over
here.  Specifically, the creating of a mySQL query doesn't work when the query table abbreviations
have been changed.</p>

<p>That took about 7 hours to solve.</p>

<p>Now I've got to erase a shload of debug statements and get my brain back onto the track where I
was on Friday (when I started trying to figure out why this shizzle wasn' wizzle.</p>
