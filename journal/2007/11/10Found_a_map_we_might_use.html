HI Shawn

Back in the early 1990s, before this here internet fad kicked in, I was on a BBS called The Castle
of Dreams in Houston, Texas. We basically were creating overlapping intertwining stories upon
stories in this text message system to create an imaginary world: The Castle of Dreams, floating on
a cloud over the land of Destria.

I enjoyed writing those stories quite a lot, and would like to capture the essence of it and perhaps
create a new cool thing in the process.

SO, I set up a MediaWiki at <a href="http://thunderrabbit.com/castle">http://thunderrabbit.com/castle</a>. In order to give some structure to the
"world," I wrote an extension that takes the name of the wiki page, does a lookup in a hash, and
spits out a list of directions one can travel from the particular room.

(the code is at <a href="http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2007/11/09#Sweet_sweet_navigation">http://robnugen.com/journal.pl?type=all&date=2007/11/09#Sweet_sweet_navigation</a>)

Currently, we have two floors in our castle. A friend of mine pointed out that it's actually nothing
like a medieval castle, so I'm going to add a floor (in between the current two floors) and I'd like
to base that floor (loosely?) on your Harlech Castle plan.

This requires *zero* additional work on your part, but I'd just like your approval. I will give
credit for the layout in whatever way you'd like.

Again, it will all be pure text; I'm not going to actually post your images on my site.

Thanks!
- Rob

<p>Ah, cool.  I just found a copyright notice on the bottom left corner of the map I wanted to use.  Basically free for non-commercial use.</p>
