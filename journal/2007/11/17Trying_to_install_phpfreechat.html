<p>I've spent all morning trying to get phpfreechat installed on mediawiki.  I just came across
wikichat.org which does the installation, so I may try their code.  I was hoping to have chats
embedded in the pages, but perhaps that would be too small to really work.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Not sure why my code wasn't </p>

<p>Right now about to go to PB in 高田馬場 with 亜美 to see my peeps and stuff.</p>
