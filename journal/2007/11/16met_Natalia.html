<p>Tonight, upon entering the kitchen, a new face was there: Natalia.  She's from northwest Spain
(I didn't hear the city name clearly) and was a Spanish teacher with NOVA until it went belly up a
few weeks ago. (*)</p>

<p>(*) this is the first example of me &quot;noticing&quot; that NOVA went bankrupt.</p>

No prob for NOVA updates.  Honestly, I haven't *noticed* much
different.   No rioting in the streets, not a hot topic at work.  The
only difference I've seen (and only because I was looking for it): the
lights are off and the pink bunnies are not in the window of the NOVA
at Nakameguro.

<p>Anyway, Natalia said she'd be happy to help my Spanish, although her Spanish is not what I
studied in HS, (Latin American version,) but, strangely enough, Spain's version.</p>
