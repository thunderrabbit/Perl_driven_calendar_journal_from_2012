<p>Hideo hadn't contacted me because he thought I didn't want to do the upcoming trial in
Kagoshima.  For 360,000 yen, I certainly do want to do it!</p>

<p>But when he replied,</p>

Hello Rob,
I actually forgot and thought that you did not want to go for the trial.
However, if you can still make it I will send you the details for the
flight.
There is another trial next Jan, longer and more compensation that I was
hoping that you would screen for. Screening for the first two groups will
take place mid-December.
Let me know what you would like to do.
Cheers,
hideo

<p>More compensation?  Hmmm.</p>

<p>I called him; the trial is 10 days and 570,000 yen.  Sweet.</p>
