<p class="dream">Looking over the rail yard, I could hear the train coming up quickly from the
right where the cliff hid it from view.  It made a tight left turn and parked like an 18 wheeler
parking in a truck stop.  The engineer got out and walked up to me.  I looked down at the tracks
again and couldn't tell how he had gotten to where the train was now.  The track that came from the
right *only* went off to the left; there was no turnout for it to park.</p>

<p class="dream">He looked down at his fingers and started counting track turnouts.  He was like,
&quot;yeah, there are 6 tracks total; I came in from the leftmost of three tracks and rolled in to
track number 1 in the parking lot.</p>

<p class="dream">He had a frisbee attached upside down to a frisbee launcher and pointed it out
over the cliff.  Though the frisbee was a light little promotional disk, it flew quite far and hit
the outer fence of the lot, just barely not making it out of the park.</p>

<p class="dream">I ran down the Up Stairs because people were all clogging the Down Stairs.  I beat
them handily and went to look for the frisbee.  I found Natalie who was organizing a dinner, but
didn't have any control over where it would be held.  She could only hope the people would choose
one particular restaurant which would be convenient for her.  &quot;I hope they choose the sandwich
shop just over there so I can walk to it in just twenty-five steps.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">It was well over 25 steps away, but not more than 200 meters away.  I wondered if
it could possibly be reached in, say, 25 steps on the pavement, and the rest on various obstacles
along the way.  I started to look for the optimal path and woke up.</p>
