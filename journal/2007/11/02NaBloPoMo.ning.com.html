<p>On a whim inspired by <a href="http://seanlb.blogspot.com/">Mister The Bibbster</a>, I just joined
the <a href="http://nablopomo.ning.com/profile/17axzxag36eus">National Blog Posting Month</a> hosted
on ning.com.</p>

<p>Not sure if I can <em>not</em> make the challenge of writing an entry every day, but I know it
will be difficult for me to use the word &quot;blog&quot; in relation to what I do here.  I don't
write in <a href="/blog/">my blog</a> every day, but I do write in <a href="/journal/">my
journal</a> every day.  And I have been since before blog was a word.</p>

<p>You kids, get off my lawn!</p>

<p>haha just kidding.  You can stay as long as you want.</p>
