HI Christine!

You don't know me, but I'm a friend of Sean's and I found your site through his.

I see the little tag on yer site: <img src="/images/i_made/cursors/blue_emacs_cursor.gif" />

<p>That's as far as I got before I did a bit more research.  The icon
on <a href="http://christinehennessey.blogspot.com/">Chrissy's site</a> was not clickable, which is
what prompted me to start writing the email.  I wanted to know what it was, what she was measuring,
and how I could get one.</p>

<p>Something, apparently, had reached 30041 words.</p>

<p>I was hoping it was her blog, and that I could somehow set up an ongoing check of the word count
for my journal.  I've got to have a shload of words in this journal by now.</p>

<p>Turns out, it's for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a>, and I
decided to join (only 77% late for the party!)</p>

<p>For the record (and I hope she doesn't mind) I've linked it to her NaNoWriMo page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/user/56755"><img src="http://www.nanowrimo.org/NanowrimoUtils/NanowrimoMiniGraph/56755.png" alt="Chrissy's wordcount" /></a></p>

<p>Anyways, I started writing to her, and was going to ask, &quot;wot's dat yur counting?&quot;</p>

<p>But I figured that out, so I was going to be like, &quot;will you be my novel writing
buddy?  I've only not written in my novel for <b>ten years</b>!!&quot;</p>

<p>(actually nine years)</p>

<p>And then I decided to figure out *my* novel word count:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/user/260012"><img src="http://www.nanowrimo.org/NanowrimoUtils/NanowrimoMiniGraph/260012.png" alt="Rob's wordcount" /></a></p>

<p>(8190 words as I write this) Gah.  I had hoped it would be more, but...  what I've written so far ain't so much.</p>

<p>So then I was going to be like, &quot;um, could you hold my hand and teach me character
development techniques and basically cheerlead me to fame and fortune?&quot;</p>

<p>And then I was like, &quot;fuckit&quot; and cancelled the message.  I'm not going to bother some
girl I don't know to help me with a project for which I haven't helped myself in 9 years.</p>

<p class="date">1:24am JST</p>

<p>But I will spend an hour creating an animated gif icon to indicate where I had stopped typing.  I
wanted to clarify that the tagline at the bottom is my tagline and not what I had written
specifically to her.</p>

<p class="date">1:42am JST</p>

<p>And I'll write her to let her know she has a cheerleader/stalker who has linked her icon.</p>

Hey Christine

I saw your site linked from Sean's.  I was curious about the evil_olive icon, figured out its
meaning, and ended up linking it to my site, for which I am hereby asking your <del>belated
permission</del><ins>forgiveness :-)</ins>.

  Thanks!
