<p>Did free hugs for about 40 minutes tonight.  Pretty low turnout, and a foreshortened period
because I have a chance to get a much higher ratio of free hugs per minute with Ami tonight than
with random people in Shibuya.</p>

<p>The first woman to give me a hug tonight came back a few minutes later and said she would like to
join.  I gave her the sign and she held it for a while, but during that period we got an even lower
turnout; perhaps because she was holding the sing lower than I usually do, and she was often engaged
talking to her friend Mikan.</p>

<p>Mikan told me something about Korea in that he knows someone from Hana-Korea and he knew I had
gone there a year ago and happened to meet them.  Not sure who / how he knows, but that's what he
said.</p>

<p>I can remember Abebe's name, but not yet remember the other girl..  dangit.  Hers is a super
common name and I know more than one with her name.</p>

<p>Naho gave the sign back to me and I held it for perhaps another 30 minutes.  They stood next to
me the whole time and kept me company while chatting together.</p>

<p>We got perhaps 10 free hugs in that period.</p>
