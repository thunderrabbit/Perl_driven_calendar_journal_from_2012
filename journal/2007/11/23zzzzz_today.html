<p>Ah cripes; I never wrote about today.</p>

<p>I worked on the Castle of Dreams wiki..  I'm basically ready to open it up to the public (not
that it's not open, but to start advertising it more), but I still wanna get the chat thing sorted
out.  For some reason, each time I've tried to get phpFreeChat embedded in the site, it doesn't
work.  It actually worked one time, but I don't remember how and haven't been able to replicate
it.  Something was wonky with the way it worked, so I changed it, and it hasn't worked since.</p>

<p>Blah.  But so I worked out how
to <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Using_custom_namespaces">make a namespace</a>
&quot;historical_scroll:&quot; and then how
to <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:%24wgNamespaceProtection">protect a
namespace</a>.</p>

<p>Ami came over and we romped like monkeys, went shopping (during which I felt a little light
headed, presumably from not having eaten properly), then she cooked nabe (boiled vegetables) while
I worked on sewing the pocket of my snow pants (which I've been wearing to work, despite the fact
that they have holes in the leg (from scraping a wall during my TJ Bike adventure) and that they
are snow pants), which was a bit of a trick because the pocket is in the lining of the pants, and
not visible if I turn them inside out.  BUT, I was able to slide the pocket between the layers to
the (parenthetically) aforementioned hole to access the pocket.  Sweet.</p>
