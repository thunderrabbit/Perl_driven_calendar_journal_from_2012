<p>I've been chatting with Marcel and working on getting phpfreechat embedded in my wiki.  One great
step forward: using setTransparentTagHook instead of setHook.  That keeps the parser from parsing
the output (basically it had been tossing a bunch of &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags where I didn't
want them).</p>

<p>But now I am still stuck on why the parameter I'm sending for server_script_url is not being
passed all the way through.</p>

<p>But first, sleepy time.</p>
