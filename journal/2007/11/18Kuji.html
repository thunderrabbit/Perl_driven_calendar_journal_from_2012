<p>just arrived in Kuji for ultimate.</p>

<p class="date">10:56am JST Monday 19 November 2007 (day 13753)</p>

<p>I'm writing now about ultimate yesterday.</p>

<p>Best parts of the day:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>on the way to the field, Ami and I passed a little (!) lot of persimon trees.  The farmer
was there and he gave us about 10, which I loaded into my pockets and headed to the field.</p></li>

<li><p>Genny with a G brought cookies!!  Chocolate chip with dried raspberries, I think!  They were
delicious, I know!  Too bad for Jason C; he got none cause I snarfed like 100.  They were soooo
good.  When she talked about starting a cookie sales company, I told her I want a standing order of
five dozen per week.  She asked &quot;is that 12 or a baker's dozen?&quot;  I was like, &quot;a
Genny dozen.&quot;  She goes, &quot;okay, three.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Rob threw a really long pass that I *bolted* over to catch and barely maintained my balance
as it slammed into my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thenar_eminence">thenar eminence</a> (*) as
I caught it.  Jason C and Wendi both said it was a good catch; Jason doesn't give out compliments
very often so my sore hand felt vindicated.</p></li>

<li><p>Ami played!  She ran around on the field for some points, and seemed as interested and
confused as a new player should be.  Great job!</p></li>

<li><p>the sky was beautiful and clear.  I think I noticed
an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aako5siSTgM">undular bore wave</a> as we were walking
back.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(*) five minutes ago, I did not know the term &quot;thenar eminence&quot;</p>

<p>Thing that were not as pleasant as the good things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was so cold!</p></li>

<li><p>I glonked the fuck out of my knee in the endzone when I fell while squirming around Geoff for
an attempted point in the endzone.  I almost caught it, but then was pretty much in pain and not
able to run well.  Some of the others encouraged me off the field to take care of it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I got another cookie and watched Ami play as I sat on the water faucet thing letting a little
stream of cold water run on my now purple spotted knee.</p>

<p>After about five minutes of water dribblage, I figured it had been long enough so joined the
group as they were packing up to leave.</p>

<p>I enjoyed holding Ami's hand on the way back.</p>

<p>Things are chicken soup with us.</p>
