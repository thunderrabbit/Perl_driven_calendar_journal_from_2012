Hey Rob,

This sounds great.  Can you give me a 1 sentence description of what
this is?  I will link that on our wiki.

Also, do you have a free account?  We like to give all our API
developers free accounts.

Thanks,
Markham

HI Markham

I'm glad you like it!

I will write the one sentence description a little later...  I don't
want it to be linked yet, it's not quite user-friendly enough for mass
consumption.   I'm hoping I can get it finished up in a couple days.

I don't have a free account, but I have 20 more days on my (recently
extended) trial.

   Thanks!
    - Rob
