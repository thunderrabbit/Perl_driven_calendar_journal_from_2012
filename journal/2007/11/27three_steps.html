<p>Juergen and I had a brief contest to see in how few steps we could get up the steps because I
told him I had done it in four steps before.  He easily tied (and actually bested) my record.</p>

<p>But.... he used his hands; I had not.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;aww, well, using *hands* I can probably get up in three.&quot;</p>

<p>We need to get this silliness on video: in three steps (plus copius arm/hand support), I got from
the bottom floor to the second floor and <em>in to his room</em>.  Three steps total.</p>
