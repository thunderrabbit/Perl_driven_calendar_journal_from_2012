<p>Could not get out of bed today; I despise cold weather.  Even though the heater is on, and the
room is, strictly speaking, warmer than without the heater, it's also breezy, and basically feels
cold.  I have it set on 23 degrees C; I guess I could bump it up a few more degrees, but I can't
bear to use that much electricity.  All bills are paid in this room, which is nice, but ultimately
earth is paying for it out of her flesh and oil.  I don't want to take more than I really need.</p>

<p>I realized that I could do my morning meditation without getting out of my sleeping bag, so I did
that and then flopped around like a lump half sleeping and half not getting up.  I rationalized that
I don't need a shower because I took one after ultimate last night, so I flopped around during when
I normally take a shower, and finally when I was like, &quot;hmmmm; I'm also hungry,&quot; and
remembered I have granola available!  Whoohooo! I got up to get down to grab and chow a bowl of
granola.</p>
