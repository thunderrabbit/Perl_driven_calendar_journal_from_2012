HI Aaron

Thanks for your hard work on the <a href="http://aarone.org/smugmugexport/">smugmug exporter</a>!

I looked for a FAQ on your site, but couldn't find one.

If you don't mind, I've got a few questions that I've listed in order
of importance to me.  ;-)

1) can I upload pics such that the image title ends up on Smugmug?
The comments map to Smugmug's Description, but I don't see the iPhoto
titles anywhere.

2) How can I tell what version I've got installed?  I just downloaded
your October release, and in iPhoto, it works as suggested (shortcut
keys, etc), but I wonder if there's a way to check the actual version
to be sure.

3) In what language is Smugmug Exporter written?  I can probably
search online to figure it out, but I could easily come up with the
wrong answer, so I'm asking you.

4) do you think a code change to make #1 work above would be very
difficult?  I checked out the code from SVN, scanned through it a bit,
and was like, "I should probably email him first," before I try to
learn a new language figure out how to compile and install it.

If you're interested, I wrote an extension to embed Smugmug pics to
MedaiWiki wikis.

Hi Rob,
  I'll post a FAQ on my site soon to answer these questions for others.

For now, see my responses below:

&gt; 1) can I upload pics such that the image title ends up on Smugmug?
&gt; The comments map to Smugmug's Description, but I don't see the iPhoto
&gt; titles anywhere.

 my understanding is that the smugmug api for uploading pictures does
not support titles for pictures.  Pictures can have file names and
descriptions.  I *could* set the filename of an image to the iPhoto
title for that image.  I may add an option for this in the next release.

&gt; 2) How can I tell what version I've got installed?  I just downloaded
&gt; your October release, and in iPhoto, it works as suggested (shortcut
&gt; keys, etc), but I wonder if there's a way to check the actual version
&gt; to be sure.

 This is more painful than it should be.  I'll make the version of
the plugin displayed in the user interface for the next release.

&gt; 3) In what language is Smugmug Exporter written?  I can probably
&gt; search online to figure it out, but I could easily come up with the
&gt; wrong answer, so I'm asking you.

 Objective-C

&gt; 4) do you think a code change to make #1 work above would be very
&gt; difficult?  I checked out the code from SVN, scanned through it a bit,
&gt; and was like, "I should probably email him first," before I try to
&gt; learn a new language figure out how to compile and install it.

 it should be as simple as changing the following line in SMRequest.m
(uploadImageData:) from:
 CFHTTPMessageSetHeaderFieldValue(myRequest, CFSTR("X-Smug-
FileName"), (CFStringRef)[self cleanNewlines:filename]);
to
 CFHTTPMessageSetHeaderFieldValue(myRequest, CFSTR("X-Smug-
FileName"), (CFStringRef)[self cleanNewlines:title]);

hope this helps.

thanks!
