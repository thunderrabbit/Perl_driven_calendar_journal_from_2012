<p>After our lesson, ゆりか and I walked to where I give free hugs.  She asked me about it and
giggled a bit before becoming my first hugger of the evening.</p>

<p>Pretty average turnout tonight.  Right at 30 hugs in 1 hour.  One of the hugs was of top notch
excellence.  It lasted about 15 or 20 seconds and included awareness of breathing, chest to chest
and ear to ear connection.</p>

<p>At the end, two guys from Dublin (who have been hanging out in Tokyo for 2.5 weeks) continued
their hanging out by hanging out with me.  They each held the sign for a bit and each logged about 3
or 4 hugs.  They seemed to have a higher rate of huggage than I, since they were all, &quot;free
hugs?&quot; &quot;how about a free hug?&quot; and engaging the crowd a bit.</p>

<p>They had arrived just as I was at 28 hugs and 4 minutes to go.  They were my last two hugs and I
got one more when the first guy was holding the sign.  They hung out for a bit and then headed out
drinking...  which I guess explains why they said they've been here for 2 weeks, but not really
seen much.</p>

<p>Right now (9:46pm) I'm headed home on the train; we just stopped in 代官山。</p>
