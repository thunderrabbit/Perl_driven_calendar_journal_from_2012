<p>The most beautiful moments of my life so far were while on TSS The Topaz, sailing around the
world with PB.</p>

<p>I chatted with Kristen in Calgary today.  I had(?) a big crush on her, and am especially
impressed now with her creating a new company called Grass Routes Travel, which will lead bicycle
tours around different cool places.</p>

<p>I sent a comment to Eri in Toyama.  She's and I meditated many mornings on the ship; I'm still
not over my crush on her and her lovely smile.  I still wonder if my reaction to Hitomi's
impersonation of Eri broke the chances of seeing Eri again.  Damn.</p>

<p>I've got two videos to watch:

(perhaps you have to be her friend to see it), and

I'm not sure who made the second one.  But they're both from the my 2nd PB voyage.  My god was that awesome.</p>
