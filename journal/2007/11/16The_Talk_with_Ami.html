<p>Talking with Ami tonight went very well.  I basically told her all the stuff that I've layed out
here in the past couple of days, that my brain had been triggered a few times in a row due to
various issues in my history, and that I needed to learn to set boundaries.  Like on Wednesday, I
needed the option to tell Ami &quot;I can't meet you tonight,&quot; and know she would be okay with
that.</p>

<p>I couldn't bear to say it given that we have just recently shifted our hang out days to
Wednesday, Friday night, and Saturday afternoon - Sunday, whereas we used to meet nearly every
night.</p>

<p>Ami understood everything, had all the right reactions; we're getting back into the chicken soup.</p>
