<p>Hmmm..</p>

<p>(( there's a funny story from Marcel...  I'll let him tell it:</p>

<pre>
 Rob: Can you, for publishment in my journal, tell the story of one of your first programs?

 Marcel: HAHAHAHAHAHA!
         I remember that!  I'm amazed you remember it.

         Oh, man.  The assignment was (duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh &lt;waveylines/&gt;
         duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh)...  

         ...to write a program like Candy Land, where each player drew a
         card with a random color on it.  The player would then proceed to the next tile of the same
         color.  The first player to reach the end of the "maze" won.

         The program was written for a programming contest for a group called ACLS (or some such
         acronym) so I called my program ACLS-Land.

         The program was written in Pascal (probably on a Commodore 64) 80x24 text screen (in my
         day, we had 16 colors and we liked it that way).

         My game featured an S-shaped board complete with borders (using the extended ASCII
         character set; you remember the single and double lines?).  Anyway, it was decked out
         pretty nice.  I might have been overachieving.

         So to top off my work, I added opening credits to the game.  The credits started with dark
         gray text, then light gray text, then white text for several seconds... you know, so it had
         that nice fade-in/fade-out touch.

         So proud of my success, I invited my teacher, Mr. Halbert, to play my game.  He was rather
         impressed.  He wanted to see the code.

         He laughed hard.

         Despite the fact that we weren't going to be getting to procedures for a bit, he introduced
         me to the concept of reusable code.  (dun-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, dun-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh
         &lt;waveylinesthingagain/&gt; dun-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh)

        Honestly, I don't recall how I did it, and I wish I had the code.  And, come to think of it,
        I might not have had the entire program finished when he taught me procedures, but that's
        how I remember it.
</pre>

<p>))</p>

<p>So, that story comes to mind as I'm just realizing I've got to move a block of
code, and little blocks of supporting code..  eeeek.</p>

<p>The code is *working*, but I've got it in the wrong file, so it's slowly making modifications
more and more difficult.</p>

<p>There may be a name for this paradigm, but I never learned it in school.</p>

<p>* Action.php is a file that grabs the data sent, does some benihana chef on it, and throws it to
some objects that write the data to a DB.</p>

<p>* View.php is a file that grabs the results of the data mashing and decides with which template to
display it, then includes that template.</p>

<p>* Template.php simply displays the data, and has *very minimal* logic built in.</p>

<p>So, the assignment here is to change the number of columns and add this and that and other
stuff...  so I put the new number of columns into Template.php.  The number depends on the length
of an array that will be display, so the top of the column has a colspan tag that = the length, so
the top will span all the elements of the array.</p>

<p>Now I realize all that should not be in the template.  I <em>think</em> it should be in the
view.  That's where I'm likely to put it.  I think.</p>

<p>Dang.  It's really tempting to just blow through the assignment in the template, because then
I'd finish it probably today or Monday.  Yesterday I told them it would take a week, and then this
morning I was like, &quot;oh wait, this is easy!&quot; and started to make changes, but then I see
to make it work nicely I've got to move the code.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a bit of a break (and by break I mean work on my website; I've semi-sorta got
a workable way to put navigation in pages of the castle wiki) and then come back to the work on job
related code.</p>

<p>Ironically, I'm probably writing the PHP code in an almost identically problematic way, but I
have even less of a grasp on the way the MediaWiki files are set up, so I'm just going to plow
through and learn as I go.</p>
