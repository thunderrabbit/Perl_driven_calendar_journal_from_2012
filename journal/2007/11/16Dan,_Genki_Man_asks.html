Why do you want to break up mate? I thought it was all chicken soup with you guys??
Its a tough situation... its like you are both in a restaurant and you *have to share* the starter
platter, she wants the vegetarian option- you like meat.
I'm younger than you... I can't offer you advice, I don't feel I should BUT, can I be so bold as to
ask you this-

Do you love Ami?
 
Speak soon.
 
One love x

Did I say I wanted to break up?

Wow.

Ah.. I just checked.  I said, "part of me wants to break up."

I like your chicken soup concept.

So, to answer your question about why I want to break up with Ami:

I don't want to break up with Ami.

BUT I think it's important to be able to express myself to Ami.  When
we hit a language barrier, that can be difficult, so I think "man,
fuck this; I could be talking to __English-speaking-babe-of-the-week__
and not have this problem."

We are going to Talk tonight, and I feel confident that we'll be genki
chicken soup after that.

(We talked briefly on the phone last night and everything was fine.)

So, I have a question for your question:

"Do you love Ami?"

What do you mean when you say, "love"  ??

Thanks, mate!
 - Rob!
