<p>Just got out of the shower after coming back from ultimate frisbee today.  Ami didn't play, but
she tossed the disc with me and some of the other guys a few different times.</p>

<p>While watching us play, she looked so cute wearing my G hoodie and arms and legs tucked inside.</p>

<p>Today I did a better defensive play than I would have done a few weeks ago.  I just knew where
the disc was headed and ran to the spot and blocked the point.  Subsequently threw it away, but I
was happy about the D.</p>

<p>Also some better than previous offense playing as well.  I think I have an idea of what British
Mike has been yelling about for some months.  It worked, and I got a couple of long distance
catches, one for a point.</p>

<p>Genny w/ A G was there; after asking about her Japan story, I realized I've met her before; she
just rarely comes out.  Wendi was there as well, and again this week more chatty and stuff than I
remember from last year.</p>

<p>A lot of the guys started playing around 11am for IKU practice before the tournament in a couple
of weeks.  Ami asked why I don't join them.  Basically I don't want to practice as much as they
do.  Perhaps I'm afraid of not being as good as they are.  Perhaps I don't want to spend Sunday
mornings away from my computer.</p>

<p>Anyways, good fun and good playing.</p>

<p>On the way back, the sky turned dark (as it's prone to do at night) and Ami drew my attention to
a rather large glow on the clouds well ahead of us.  Watching the glow from afar, I thought I might
be watching the glow from a fire; it didn't seem to be *blinking*, but it was definitely
oscillating in intensity.  However I decided after a while it had to be just lights, because as the
old saying goes, &quot;where there's no smoke, there's no fire.&quot;</p>
