<p class="dream">I was at the pre-meeting place on time, and then about 13 minutes before I-group
started, someone was like, &quot;well, we should probably head over to Enio's house,&quot; where the
meeting was to be held.  I was like, &quot;ah shit I have to get copies of my medical
records,&quot; so I <b>ran</b>, using both arms and legs to help propel me more quickly; I made it
across the street before the light turned yellow, and I boundingly flew over two school buses and
into the hospital.</p>

<p class="dream">I asked about my medical records, and got a negative answer at first, but then I
asked a slightly different question, &quot;do the records exist?&quot; and they were like,
&quot;yeah,&quot; so I asked if I could photo copy them.</p>

<p class="dream">They gave me the records, and I thought about just walking out with them, and
making the copy later, but I decided to make the copies right then.</p>

<p class="dream">Had trouble figuring out the copy machine, plus how to optimize copying all the
little bits of paper in the record.  A nurse showed me how to use a little card reader type thing;
it was like a mimeograph, and required placing ink on a wheel to print on the paper.  She was like,
&quot;at the end, put a big slob of ink on the wheel; don't clean it off,&quot; and I was like,
&quot;okay,&quot; and I looked at my cellphone for the time, and I had about 10 minutes before the
meeting started.</p>

<p class="dream">I called Kevin and he answered, &quot;well, hello,&quot; in a way that said he
knew my situation.  I asked if he could wait just one more minute, and at the same time I asked the
nurse, &quot;can I come back at 10pm?  will you still be here?&quot; and she was like, &quot;sure;
I'm up for anything,&quot; but Kevin was like, &quot;I'm [already] in my car about 2 minutes from
the location,&quot; and I was like, &quot;ok...</p>

<p>and I barely heard my alarm, as if my phone was under a blanket, but I woke up, happy to not
actually be late.  I checked my alarm, and it was 1 minute from going off.</p>

<p>I lay with my eyes closed for a bit, but my alarm didn't go off.  I checked it (that seemed like
a really long minute) and it had been two minutes.  Oh, I reset my wakeup alarm last Friday when I
didn't want to wake up at 7:10am.</p>
