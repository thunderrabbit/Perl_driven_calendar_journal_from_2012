<li><p>Wake up [*] (11:14am JST)</p>

<p>I actually woke up around 8:30am, did some email reading, and scoped the interesting articles on the front page of slashdot.</p>

<p>Meditated 20 minutes (and my hands were super cold!) and the slept again.</p>

<p>Woke up around 10:30am, worried that blood might not be getting to my feet or hands because they
were *still* super cold!  Upon closer inspection of the situation, it was determined they were cold
because they weren't under blankets like they should be.  You boys get inside this blanket right
now!</p>

<p>One email I'm eagerly anticipating: the answer to my questions 1 and 1.b from yesterday.  Should
users use my API key or get their own?  There are good reasons for both answers.</p>

<p>Until I get that answer, I can't do the final install of my extension from my wiki, so I've
moved that to the bottom of this list.</p>

<p>And Ami and I plan to visit Yokohama today and 大さんばし; the weather is nice and we're not
going to ultimate. (there's a hat tournament way out west or something)</p></li>

<li><p>Eat breakfast (thanks to Ami!) [*] (12:05pm JST)</p>

<p>Breakfast was the rest of the pumpkin soup she made a couple days ago, plus some toasted ごま
(look like black sesame seeds) bread and me doing dishes while she played her Nintendo DS.</p></li>

<li><p>Correct the password of my Rob Update program [*] (12:31pm JST)</p></li>

<li><p>Go to 大さんばし with 亜美 [*] (4:12pm JST)</p>

<p>Good relaxing time at O-sanbashi, the port in Yokohama where TSS The Topaz begins its journeys
around the world.  Mostly filled with voices of little kids rolling down the hill, the air was
lovely and clean, with occasional birds, clouds, airplanes.</p>

<p>Ami and I rested, cuddled, laughed, and rolled around a bit, but didn't get too crazy, though we
did laugh a lot while trying to get the optimal picture without asking someone else to take it for
us.</p>

<p>I must admit, chillaxing with her renewed my spirits after I got pissy at people stopping for
stopped cars even though the people had the right of way.  I'm thinking &quot;wake up you sleep
walking people; pay attention to the world around you,&quot; which I know means that's the message
I have for myself.  Wake up, Rob.  You're missing the world around you.</p>

<p>Really?  Well here we go:</p>

<p>I'm willing to see the world around me.</p></li>

<li><p>Add recently befriended emails to Rob Updates list [*] (5 November 2007)</p></li>

<p>regarding the last two, I still haven't heard back from Smugmug on my two questions.</p>

<p class="date">3:02am JST Thursday  8 November 2007 (day 13742)</p>

<p>done and done</p>

<p>and zzzzzzzzz</p>
