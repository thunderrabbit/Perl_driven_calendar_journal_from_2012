<p>Today, free hugs for an hour, like from 9:30pm to 10:30.  Several amazing / cool things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saw the two almost-yamamba girls again.  They acknowledged me, but didn't stop to
chat.</p></li>

<li><p>A woman recorded me on video, asking my name, where I was from, why I was doing this.  Then
she asked me to say HI to her husband (via video) as it's his birthday soon/today!  I turned the
FREE HUGS sign around so FREE HAPPY BIRTHDAY could be seen on the camera.</p></li>

<li><p>The same woman gave me 650 yen!</p></li>

<li><p>A different woman gave me a hot canned coffee!  I don't drink coffee, but my hands sure enjoyed the
heat!</p></li>

<li><p>Billy Peach said HI for a bit.  He has a beard now!</p></li>
</ol>
