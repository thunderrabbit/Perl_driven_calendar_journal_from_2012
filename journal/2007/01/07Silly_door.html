<p>Nice.  I went out to Kichijoji to record a crazily-placed door near my work.  I went today in
case they reinforce the insecurity of the door during the week.  I'd like to think of some silly
videos we can do with such a door.  I already thought of some lines I could have used in the video
I just took.  Basically, &quot;Jesse!....  Jesse, where are you?????&quot; and then open the door,
&quot;Jesse!  You're invisible!!&quot;</p>
