<p>Meeting with Tariq featured a cameo appearance by Dan from PB 52!!  I heard his voice saying
&quot;Rob!&quot; and I immediately knew who was speaking.  Dan!!  Practically before I even
identified him visually.  He was hanging with his friend Natalia from Kamakura; we didn't talk
long, but definitely a riot to see him!</p>

<p>The meeting also featured lunch at Hard Rock Cafe, so it was half hard to rock through all the
games we've put together.  I gave him copies of the stuff I've done, and he gave me screwdrivers to
try and take apart my camera (and fix it).</p>

<p>And he bought me lunch.</p>

<p>There's a game that I thought of that could be a pretty good one, but I can't think of it now.
It was a pretty old idea that I'm sure therefore could not be copyrighted.  Like an old word
game..  Not a crossword, but a puzzle of sorts, かな。。</p>

<p>あっ!  &quot;who lives in the green house?&quot;</p>

<p>One of those games that has various clues...  I wonder if I could put together an engine that
will generate a game with some carefully designed variables to make a different game each time, and
one with only one correct solution.</p>
