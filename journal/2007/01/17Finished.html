<p>That was great fun!  Well, not <em>fun</em> so much as profitable.  We got 30,000 yen and travel
expenses paid.  Actually I had to fund 500 yen each way from Shibuya to Haneda airport, but, ¤Þ, no
worries.</p>

<p>BUT, the very best part was getting paid to give a fecal sample!  3000 yen for a bit of poo.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Soon enough we'll be rockin' outta here for our respective domiciles.</p>
