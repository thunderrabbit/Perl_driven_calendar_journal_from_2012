<p>I just sent this message on the contact page of <a href="http://serpo.org">serpo.org</a></p>

Definitely thank you for taking the time to post this information.  I've downloaded the pdf
<a href="http://serpo.org/Serpo_releases_with_commentary.pdf">http://serpo.org/Serpo_releases_with_commentary.pdf</a> and have been reading it.

I was excited to read "Don't distribute the photographs through your huge UFO thread list. Just
leave it on the Serpo.org Web site for Web site Administrator Bill Ryan to post. "

and went straight to the site looking for pictures.....

Then looking for a FAQ for the answer to "where are the pictures?"

   Thanks
   - Rob!
