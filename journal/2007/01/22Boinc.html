<p>Starting some years ago, I downloaded seti@home and even got Wende, Marcel, my brother, and
later, Hitomi in on the fun.  At one point I even set up all the computers at Gaba to process work
units.  20 machines can do a lot of units pretty quickly!</p>

<p>When seti switched to Boinc, I tried downloading the command line client, but couldn't get it
configured for some reason.  Just recently I downloaded the GUI version, and have set it to work on both
SETI and Einstein@home.  And, as soon as work units are available, it will work on LHC@home, too.</p>
