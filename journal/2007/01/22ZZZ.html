<p>Good progress in flash today; got the same technology merged in with the next set of objects,
but now have to figure out how to add one more bit of technology to them.  Hopefully just as simple
as changing a value, but for now I'm not really sure how to do it.</p>

<p>The girl is over tonight; we talked some and she chastised me a bit for not remembering the name
of the city from which she hails, and explained that it is &quot;near Kagoshima&quot; in the same
way Mercury is near the sun.  Well..  you know.</p>

<p>だから、 she won't be coming to visit if I get the CPC guinea pig &quot;job.&quot;</p>

<p>I may come back so I can get more air miles, and perhaps see Hanakorea perform here in Tokyo.</p>
