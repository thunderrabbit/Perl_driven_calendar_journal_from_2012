<h1>state OF my LIFE address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I always wonder how to capitalize the above line.  Today I've chosen a way to *not*
capitalize it.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Sakurashinmachi in a pretty big apartment for Tokyo standards.  Michael is
officially my roommate, but he's been gone for over a month, and will continue to be gone for 2
more weeks.</p></li>

<li><p>For money, I'm teaching English at English Village in Shibuya 5.5 days per week.  Actually
Saturday is in Kichijoji.</p></li>

<li><p>For hopefully big future profit, I'm working on a video game with Tariq and Hitoshi.
Actually two different games.</p></li>

<li><p>Soon (Sunday), I'll head out to Kagoshima for 10 days to make $3800 as a lab rat.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really talked with Dad, Ma, Fred recently.  In order of increasing contact.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really talked with anyone from back in the states recently, except I've been in
touch with Dude and Fred (and Jesse) on our little nerdy email list.  Just very few messages recently.</p></li>

<li><p>Still dating the girl who prefers not to be mentioned (save that she will watch my apartment
while I'm gone)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.secondlife.com/join/?u=a09673ace3ca2c135241509344dbdfa3">Second
Life</a> has continued to get increasing amounts of press, so I've dusted off my old avatar,
Blinking Signals, downloaded the game play engine and started to wander around, wondering about
paying more than $0 per month for this crazy thing.</p></li>

<li><p>I've played ultimate frisbee the last 3 or 4 Sundays.  Fun stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>Have not done any Hemisync things recently.  Not in months.</p></li>

<li><p>Have been working on Marble Track 2.  The switch is finished, and I've moved on to higher
things.</p></li>

<li><p>My debt is very close to being paid off; this $3800 should finsh off the bulk of it, though
I haven't looked at exact numbers yet, in the spirit of not counting unhatched chickens.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer (white MacBook, my second Mac) has been running Boinc! software to help the
Einstein@home and SETI@home projects.  It's also set up to help LHC@home (Large Hadron Collider)
once that starts producing data.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access is fast here with fiber connection.</p></li>

<li><p>I-group will have an open meeting next month; we are looking to opening a center in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently quit studying with my Wednesday teacher, partially because I'm too busy, and
partiall because she talked more than I wanted.  *I'm* the one who needs practice speaking, yo.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't done a lot with my website recently (robnugen.com); I've continued to make journal
entries, but I haven't finished mapping my TJ Bike adventure, and work on P.H.O.T.O. has completely stagnated.</p></li>

<li><p>No pets, but I've sorta-kinda considered getting one, but I quickly toss the idea as it
feels like an anchor I don't want to carry.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been listening to hip hop and Tori Amos on iTunes a lot-ish recently.  I like Nas'
album Hip Hop Is Dead, especially &quot;Black Republican,&quot; (featuring Jay-Z), and I recently found his old song
&quot;Ether&quot;  (slaughtering Jay-Z) That song is <em>tight</em></p></li>
