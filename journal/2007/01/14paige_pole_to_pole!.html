<b> small steps to massive change  </b>
		
It appears that procrastination is a key point where my warrior does not show up.  This happens when it's time to

1) meditate
2) work on anything without a deadline, or with a far-away deadline
3) get ready for bed
4) write updates to you

#1 and #3 above just fell out of my fingers now; I hadn't thought of them before.


I have just gotten a huge trigger of desire for something that has nearly disabled my ability to think.

The woman pictured had already been around the world 3 times with Peace Boat when I met her.  She's tall and beautiful, and super friendly.
She's been working for the UN in Amman, Jordan, and *now* I just got an email that she's involved with this thing called Pole To Pole, which looks amazing

and the maximum age is 28!

Fuck!

This means a couple of things:
1) she's basically younger than my minimum age for dating (this may give an indication of how well I know her)
2) I'm too old to join Pole To Pole
3) I should have already been doing this kinda stuff 10 years ago!  15 years ago!

argh

The subject of this email is a tagline on the PTP site  "Small steps to massive change"

That tagline helped bring me back to reality to the point I was able to write this email to you.

but seriously, I'm nearly mentally disabled to the point of I don't know what.

I'm going to sit meditatively for a few minutes and then go to bed.  (it's 2:55am as I write this)
