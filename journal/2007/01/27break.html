<p>Had a pretty long break today due to consecutive cancellations, plus a 40 minute break before
them.  1pm to 4:20 was enough time to work on flash, go buy real bread from the German bakery, read
about Swamp Dogg (from whom Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and The Dogg Pound ultimately got their double
G's), and studied some Japanese.</p>

<p><em>I studied some Japanese!!</em></p>

<p>I haven't done that in months.</p>

<p>Dang.  My next lesson from 4:20 to 5:40 is a no-show!  (1/2 of the lesson has passed with no
contact from the student)</p>
