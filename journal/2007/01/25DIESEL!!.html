<p>Live from a hacked hotel room and hacked website</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, I don't know that the website is hacked, but the hotel manager almost
certainly won't be impressed to see the walls painted.  On the other hand, perhaps it's just a set
made to look like a hotel room.  I haven't read the FAQ, and I'm on the train now without internet
access for the next 12 hours.</p>

<p>But it was most amazing to get realtime response from them by typing &quot;watching in
Tokyo&quot; and the girl (Heidi?) was like, &quot;oh my gosh 'watching in Tokyo,' thank you so much;
we're international, and now we're in Asia.&quot;</p>

<p>I found them via the slashdot firehose (the flood of stories from which stories are chosen for
publication), and immediately recommended it for publication.  I woulda posted it again had I had
more time before work.</p>

<p>I changed my chat name from &quot;Rob!&quot; to &quot;Rob in Tokyo!&quot; and (had) posted
basically</p>

<p>As a result, I missed the train I was supposed to catch to meet Tariq on time, so I'll be a bit
late.  D'oh!</p>
