<p>Though the weather was actually a bit colder yesterday than last week, more people came out to
play ultimate this week!  Joanne (sp) from Singapore even braved the near-frigid air and played
quite well, like she had never skipped.  Jolian was out; his knee is no longer swollen, but he
reports that it still hurts.  That didn't keep him from laying out several times for the disk.
Perhaps I should bring my camera out soooooon</p>

<p>There's another Rob, who's quite tall, and similar sense of humor as me.  I usually covered him
or Jason while on defense.  Rob and I both like to run way out for supa-long passes.  Jason yells,
&quot;go to the house!&quot; which he said is a variant of a phrase used in the NFL, whether he's
intending to throw far or catch a far-thrown disk.</p>

<p>We played until dusk and I joined the group who went to chow.  We chose Draft King; I wanted to
go there because it's local, and wouldn't mean going past my apartment on the train, just to come
back again.  I sat with Rob on my left, Naomi on my right, and Sarah across from Naomi, and a
Japanese guy who I didn't talk to very much.  Not Koichi, but another guy.</p>

<p>Naomi and Koichi both commented about silent football; they had been at the Pink Cow when we
played last week, but playing again this week did not make it past a fwap to Naomi and a reversed
fwap back to me.</p>

<p>At Shibuya now; maybe write more, but probably not.</p>

<p>Ah yes, while sitting next to Rob, we compared Japanese language knowledge.  We both agreed we
knew about 100 kanji, so I was like, &quot;sounds like we're about at the same level,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unless you started with the 100 most difficult kanji...&quot;</p>
