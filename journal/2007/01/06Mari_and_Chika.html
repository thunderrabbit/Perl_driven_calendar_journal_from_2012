<p>Mari and Chika are a riot of silliness.  When I first met them, I let it go, but on the second
time I met them, I &quot;barked at them for having no idea what they are doing,&quot; according to
their lesson record.  They kept coming back to my lessons, and just recently they have each bought
a copy of the book!  I am pretty impressed; they are definitely getting better. </p>
