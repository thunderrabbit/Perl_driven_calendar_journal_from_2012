<p>Got a foot massage during my second to last lesson today!  I had accidentally kicked her leg and
then not-accidentally kicked it again as a joke; she grabbed my foot and gave me a massage!  I was
like, &quot;you're my new favorite student; you were tied for first place with two others, but now
you are definitely number one.&quot;</p>
