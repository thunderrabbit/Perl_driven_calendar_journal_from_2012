<p><a href="http://www.diesel.com/">The two Heidie's, and the Juan</a> broadcasting live from their
hotel room via diesel.com were obnoxiously loud a bit earlier, and got a call from the hotel
manager.</p>

<p>Heidie answered at first all like, &quot;well, our neighbors have been really loud; they're
really annoying,&quot; and &quot;well it's not our problem if they want to have a romantic newlywed
evening,&quot; or some such.</p>

<p>They went back to grinding signs (was it an industrial shredder?  totally loud as shit!) and
then the manager called <em>back</em></p>

<p>&quot;I'm really sorry; yes; thank you; have a good night; okay; thank you&quot;</p>

<p>totally shmoozing..  but after that they seemed to be a bit quieter.</p>
