<p>Not sure how it happened; the screen was off at the time and I didn't notice, but as I was
typing about train cards, somehow the font face in emacs jumped to huge size.  Like the whole
window just magnified by 4x.</p>

<p>I checked view-lossage, but the magic command had escaped.  I don't have a dribble file running,
so I couldn't check that.  I figured out I can adjust it with the mouse:  Shift-leftclick Courier->24</p>

<p>But how to invoke by keypress?  And how to keep the screen size the same, but enlarge the font?</p>
