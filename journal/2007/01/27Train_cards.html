<p>If it were worth the effort, I would (have to) revise the  numbers for my free cash via train
cards campaign.  Today a card showing 50 yen on it actually came up as 0 yen according to the
machine.  Must be that the magnetic data doesn't match the printed information.</p>

<p>I found out the &quot;real&quot; value by asking the guys at the window, and then when I tried
using *another* card, it too responded with the loud dingdongproblematic behavior happening at the
gate.</p>

<p>I just busted through, though; it's not so hard to do.</p>
