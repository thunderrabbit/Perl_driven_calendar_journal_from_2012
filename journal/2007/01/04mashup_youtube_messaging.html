<p>Tonight was the night I came up with the genius idea of doing a mashup with youtube and talking
to my friends.  My first one was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnu1P5tRvuU">to my brother</a>, though he seems not to have seen it yet.  I don't
think he's been online since I uploaded it.  Aiko saw it, and I sorta made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98nbj1htTg4">one for her</a>.  Then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxbeSPQpgB0">one
for Jesse</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe later I'll link them from here.  But they're all on youtube and my username there is thunderrabbit.</p>
