<p>If one visits Tokyo, one should not miss the opportunity to experience the trains at rush hour.
I'm about to go do that now.  Checking the schedule, I find that there's a period during which the
trains come at 3 minute intervals.  (Usually 7 or 8 minutes for my line)  I'm going to go on one of
those trains.  Sardine city, here we come!</p>
