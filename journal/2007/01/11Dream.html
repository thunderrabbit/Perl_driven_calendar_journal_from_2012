<p class="dream">In a car driving in a new area, we saw the guy with a green face again, though the
girl sitting to my left had been too shy to talk to him previously, he seemed to come up as if to
talk to us, but he walked past to talk to his friend.  I needed to continue driving so I couldn't
hold on to the drink anymore, but none of my passengers would hold it, though they were all
covering the locations where I would normally put it while driving when I drove alone.</p>
