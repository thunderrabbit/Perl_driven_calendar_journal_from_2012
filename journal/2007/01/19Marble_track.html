<p>Yesterday I finished the little swerve for the small marbles right around the top of the
switch.  The track is super crammed in.</p>

<p>Today I have tweaked two places where the small balls were getting stuck; they have no chance of
getting stuck in those spots anymore.</p>

<p>Further plans include a full-side-span track from the toothpick pair that leads into the
Ami-inspired big-marble zig-zags and then sneaking up through the ice-cream-spoon &quot;2&quot; that
was installed on the 15th.</p>
