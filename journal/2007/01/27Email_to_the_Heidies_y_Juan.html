Heidie and Heidie y Juan

Congratulations on creating a defining point in internet history!  I'm sure there will be many
imitators, but you three were simply amazing.  I'm really glad I'll get to tell my grandkids that I
was there!  Not in the pool, but at least on the screen!

You've captured the hearts of millions; congratulations for pulling off the lifelong dream of many.
I hope you enjoy the Diesel campaign and set your sights higher for the next adventure!

I got some video captures that I'm trying to put on youtube, but there's no audio...  That will
teach me to get some real video capture software!  I hope Arturo posts the vids he's got.  With
sound, no less!

I've got to zoom to work;

Virtual hugs and real love

    - Rob in Tokyo!
