<p>Dang.  I didn't write about ultimate today, nor even vlog about it or nothing.  AND I forgot to
record video of us while we played.  Fun times; I covered Jason most of the time because he's often
funny in his varied commentary during the game.  It was a bit chilly, but I still played
barefootedly.  Until the sun went down, the weather was quite acceptable for me in shorts and
t-shirt, but once it went below a cloud that reached the horizon, I was like, &quot;the sun's gone
so I gotta go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, are you a vampire?&quot;</p>

<p>A <em>reverse</em> vampire, but yes, maybe so.</p>
