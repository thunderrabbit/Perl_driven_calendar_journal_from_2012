<p>Shimpei thought I had said I could *not* come tonight, but, whatever I actually said, I meant
that I <em>could</em> come tonight.  I called him around 7:07pm; he had been in Shibuya, but had
gone home, so I bid him a good night and wondered what to do.  I had already committed myself to
the drink bar, thought I had only gotten two orange juices, and one cup of hot cocoa,,
&quot;ice&quot; version, meaning it's twice as rich.  (I got a double)</p>

<p>I decided to cut my losses and just go home, but after one more read of the paragraph from which
I had scooped those words earlier today.</p>
