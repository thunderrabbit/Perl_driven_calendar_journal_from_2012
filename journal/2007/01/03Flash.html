<p>Have a pretty good flowchart for the new version of the game.  Tariq has agreed we've actually
got two games here.  My version (interpretation) of his game is cool, so we're going to keep it as
well as make the version he meant to explain.</p>

<p>Ah... this is interesting.</p>

<p>It appears I've &quot;developed&quot; a technique to more usefully flesh out a flash game.  Not
*that* amazing, but I'm just seeing how to take into consideration the frames when going from flowchart
to pseudo code.</p>

<p>Fucking hell if I can't find what's causing the problem with this.  I'm slow-motioning through
the debugger, and I just don't see what's going on.  ARgh argh argh.</p>
