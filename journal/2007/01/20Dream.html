<p class="dream">Pouring down rain as Jesse and I were with another friend in an underground
restaurnat and needed to get to another restarant across the way, but he didn't want to get wet,
but then when we went outside, he and his friend decided to rll down the hill and got soppingly
soaked, while I walked across to the other restaurant nd stayed clean.</p>

<p class="dream">On our way out the exit, there were some salarymen all stopped, frozen with
indecision on whether to go outside or not; they were blocking the exit and really annoying.</p>
