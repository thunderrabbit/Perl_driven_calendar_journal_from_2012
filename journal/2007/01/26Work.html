<p>Some days ago (Tuesday) Ami cancelled her lesson, so I called her to bug her a bit and say HI.
Her voice sounded pretty terrible; she was definitely sick.  I had bought some chocolate at the
conveni to share with her, as a joke after she asked me to get something in Kagoshima for her.  I
was going to ball all, &quot;ta-da!&quot; and give her chocolate which had the label of the
conveni, and I'd claim it was from Kagoshima.</p>

<p>Anyway, she called in, and I called back, and Reiko (receptionist) was not impressed.  &quot;wah
wah wah wah wah wah&quot; <em>don't call students while at work; this is a professional job; you can
call after hours; image of the school is at stake</em>, etc.  Hmmm.  I hadn't thought about
that.</p>

<p>Anyway, Ami is scheduled for a lesson with me today; perhaps I'll remember to buy some chocolate
to try the fake Kagoshima gift gag.</p>
