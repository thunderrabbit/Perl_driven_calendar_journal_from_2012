<p>Got it!</p>

<p>It was a scope problem.  Flash creates variables when they are given values; for some reason an
object referring to variables on the root timeline created its own copy of *one* of the variable
names, but not of any of the others.  I added _root. to all of them to cut that noise out real
quick.</p>

<p>This game (repeat_click) is super hard.  I have gotten as far as level 9, but usually only make
it to like level 3.</p>
