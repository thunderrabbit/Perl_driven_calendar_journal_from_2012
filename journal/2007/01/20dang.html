<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>I've been basically rotting in front of my computer being endlessly distracted from my planned
task of working on the flash game.  On the good side, my spending plan is up to date, I've
installed Boic software which is busily doing SETI@home and Einstein@home, and waiting for LHC@home
to have some data.</p>

<p>Also chatted with Dave who I met in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And that's about it.</p>
