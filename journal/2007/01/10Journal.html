<p>Haven't written in a while, it seems; basically I've been working working working on the flash
program, though some time has been spent organizing food for my stomach and going to work.  Today
Tariq is meeting with the president of Nintendo to show him what we've made so far.  Basically an
introduction and three games.  I hope they like it, though we pretty much won't be given an answer
at this time.  Business slash everything in Japan requires an impressive amount of decision making
and paper work.  Perhaps in a month we will know something.</p>

<p>On the train headed to work now.</p>
