<p>Just got some good code working in flash.  Really beginning to get a sense of how to use movies
within movie in order to encapsulate things in logical ways.</p>

<p>Have also just begun to keep track of my time on the project.  I've wanted to do this since
Stephen was living here, but just never did.  I guess it was hearing the same sorta thing from Aiko
that finally got me to do it.</p>

<p>Showertime now, and the more flash.  Try to use the same technique on the next part.</p>
