<p>Nice little synchronicity with my first student, Tami: she brought me a bar of moisturizing soap
and some lip balm from her work.  I've noted that I should buy some soap soon, and in the past I've
wondered if some moisturizing soap would be better for my face.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>Holy cow; just had a level check with a student whose skirt was so short that I could see her
panties when she was sitting down as I was walking past her.  (i.e., not at a low viewing angle)</p>

<p>Ah jeez</p>

<p>I can't really explain that I would be that *tired* (or maybe just that *bored*) but tiredness is
often a factor in me acting, or in this case considering acting in foolish ways.  I nearly thought
about kissing Ami in our class today; that could only lead to disaster.</p>

<p>In the last lesson, I met a woman named Masako for the second time.  She's the Java instructor
that I luckily found out was married when we first met.  No Java instruction today, but we talked
about PB and Francois.  Masako's sister was on PB when it got stuck in Kenya for a month.  Wow!</p>

<p>Zoom home and wake up tomorrow early for men's group.</p>
