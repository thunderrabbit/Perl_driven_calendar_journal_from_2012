<p>I just read this letter to the American people, ostensibly from Saddam Hussein while he was in
captivity.  I'm posting it for posterity, and there's definitely some truths in it.</p>

 from Saddam Hussein to the American people</a>

<p>Two of my favorites:</p>

<pre>
	America is a big country on the other side of the Atlantic. It has developed a unique unparalleled
	power such that I think some people there imagine that it is on its way to attaining the crown of
	the world all for itself as a world empire. Have they not learned a lesson from their war in Viet
	Nam? The west used to promote the idea that world Communism and the Soviet bloc threatened their
	interests and also the security of the entire west. But despite that promotion, this was nothing but
	a flimsy cover. Nevertheless, America used it and wrapped itself in it until the heroic Vietnamese
	people expelled them by force.
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre>
	On this basis I said to some Americans when I was in my prison, why don't you come to an agreement
	with the Resistance to designate a country with a charter and power to which the Resistance can hand
	over those American soldiers whom they capture, rather than executing them as currently is said to
	be taking place. In fact the extent to which the Resistance is responsible for this is unknown, but
	people who are equitable know that America has not abided by international law in any of its
	activities in Iraq, including the Geneva Conventions regarding prisoners and detainees. The
	Resistance has no secure place in Iraq where prisoners can be kept. So whether the Resistance is at
	all responsible, or whether the responsibility lies with some other parties that have no connection
	to the Resistance, the justification for it is that there is no secure place for prisoners to be
	kept.
	
	Therefore in order to fulfill humanitarian needs and to eliminate the justification [for killing
	prisoners] I make this proposal to you and to the national Resistance and to anyone concerned, and I
	make this with the best of intentions. If you accept it and respect the Geneva Conventions then the
	argument of those who kill rather than detain prisoners will have vanished. But if your government
	does not accept it, then it will bear the responsibility for refusing and for whatever befalls our
	people and the heroic Resistance as a result of your government's violation of international
	law. This will be particularly true if the number of American prisoners increases in the future, and
	we think that it will increase. Or is it that your government can't see anything until it feels it?
