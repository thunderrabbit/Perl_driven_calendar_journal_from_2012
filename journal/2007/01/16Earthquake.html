<p>We had an awesome earthquake last night!  It was actually during the short period that I was
sleeping.  <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/ous/STORE/X2007xpa9/ciim_display.html">It was
a magnitude 5.9 quake</a> according the the USGS.  3:17am my time.  Nice that they keep track of
this sorta thing.  The quake totally woke me up and totally kept shaking for about 10 seconds before
subsiding.  Awesome.</p>
