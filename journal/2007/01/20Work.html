<p>Hour break starting 2 minutes ago.  Just had 60 min, then 40 min, then 20 min lesson.  First was
with The Super Computer Guy, who can understand things better if we write them down.  He told me
his concerns about using the word &quot;pi&quot; to mean anything but pie, and the sound
&quot;e&quot; to mean anything other than e or E.  I assured him that the context would clearly
explain the meaning.</p>

<p>I calculated pi.</p>

<p>I counted pies.</p>

<p>I ate pie.</p>

<p>Pi is not 8.</p>

<p>I ate 3.14 pies.</p>

<p>The next two students were new to me.  Talked about PB wih the first, and my shoulder with each
of them.  The second is an orthopedic nurse; she said I was lucky to have had such minimal damage,
plus full recovery.</p>
