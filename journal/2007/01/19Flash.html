<p>Looking at Michael's game; I've got to add to it, but I can't figure out what he was trying to do
unless he was planning to add a jillion new mini MovieClips to the movie; I'm definitely not going
to extend it that way.  He won't be in town to work on it until mid February; I'm basically thinking
of doing the whole thing over, though using a few key built-in functions that he's using.</p>

<p>I'm got 45 more minutes left in this break; I've just got a flash of an idea on how to flowchart
this thing.</p>
