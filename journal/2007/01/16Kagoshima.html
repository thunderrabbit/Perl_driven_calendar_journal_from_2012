<p>Headed out to Kagoshima for the night in exchange for 20,000 yen and the possibility of going
back in February for 380,000 yen.</p>

<p>I like traveling.  I like seeing new and weird things.  I like feeling comfortable pretty much
anywhere I am in the world.</p>

<p>At Haneda Airport now, super duper plenty early for my flight.  I like being on time.  I like
being early even more.  Not <em>crazy</em> early of course; that would be crazy.  But I like being
relaxed.  Maybe that's it.</p>

<p>For the record, the ticket was 54,300 yen.  Paid for by CPC.</p>

<p>On the plane, at cruising altitude and have put down the paper (first actual newspaper I have
read in <em>years</em> to find random people eating in various areas.  Did food service come
through without my noticing?  Will I get a second chance?  The drink cart approacheth; maybe I'll
know soon.</p>

<p>Have arrived in Kagoshima with about 8 other trial candidates.  We're on a bus bound for
somewhere, and most of us are sitting in little middle-seats in the aisle, and the backs lean way
back, encouraging sloppy posture.  Just thinking about what easy cash this is.  I'm laid back, with
my mind on my money and my money on my mind.</p>
