<h1> Goodbye (for now) </h1>
<pre>

We did it!!! We had our 15MB of fame, and it was more fun than we've ever had in our lives. But we
did not work (and chat, and party, and dance, and take jelly baths...and stay up all night...and
wear panda suits) like dogs to get famous if you are just going to forget us tomorrow. 15MB of fame
is not enough for us Heidies...we want 15GIGS!!!!!

Spread the word. Tell your friends. Put our images and videos on your blogs (tell us about them and
we'll link to you too!). Become our friends on Myspace. Cos we'll be back, and we want you to be
there with us when it happens! (send a message to seen@heidies - and we promise to keep in touch!).

We made some great friends in the process, and to be honest, if it was not for you we would not have
been able to do it (or have had half the fun!).

Remember. These days it doesn't take much to get famous. Look, we did it in five days! All that
matters how you do it. All it took was some underwear, a little hostage taking and a blindingly fast
connection to the internet. Oh, and a little help from our friend Marc (and a few of his
friends). Thanks Marc, you're the best!

Kisses
