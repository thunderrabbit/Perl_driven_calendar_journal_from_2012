<p>Wow wow wow; I am definitely nerdy.</p>

<p>Today my last student spoke English really well, and introduced herself as having used to work at
Sun, not just as a programmer, but as a Java <em>instructor</em>.</p>

<p>[blink]</p>

<p>I basically fell in love with her right there and decided I wanted to have her babies, but
instead settled for having her explain what threads were, and how to write Hello World in Java.</p>

<p>She did both quite readily, and, I just...</p>

<p>loved it.</p>

<p>I mean, I literally wanted to just kiss her as the syntactically perfect code poured from her
pen.</p>

<p>Just like, &quot;wow.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, I kept my wits about me and continued to correct her almost-perfect English,
which <em>she</em> really appreciated: &quot;I like you because you correct my mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mistakes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like you because you correct my mistakes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perfect.  I like <em>you</em> because you just wrote Hello World in Java like it was
nothin'&quot;</p>

<p>Fortunately for all involved, during the remainder of our lesson, she mentioned that she's married.</p>
