<p>Just had a programmer named 美須々（みすず） who wrote a BBS for her portfolio, and then 理乃　
（あやの）, whose second kanji I'd never seen before.</p>

<p>Next are まり and ちか, the two girls I barked at the second time I met them for having no idea
what they were doing.  They still seem to have no idea, but actually, they're getting better.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Mari and Chika were great; they're definitely getting better.  I &quot;kept score&quot; on their
correct vs incorrect answers.  Mari got an early lead, but in the end Chika won, 53 to 50.</p>
