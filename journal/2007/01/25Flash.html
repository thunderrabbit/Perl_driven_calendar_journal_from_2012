<p>Pretty decent progress on the flash game; I figured out how to solve the color-changing thing
(as in I found some code online that could do it.  woulda taken me a hella long time to figure it
out.  (I wrote to the author, basically, &quot;is this your code?&quot; and plan to send paypal
cash if s/he replies in the affirmative.  No reply yet, even though this person seems to post
every day on usenet..))</p>

<p>Going to met Tariq and Koreda today.</p>
