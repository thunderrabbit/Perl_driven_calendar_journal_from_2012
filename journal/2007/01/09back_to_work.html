<p>Had a day off yesterday, which helped the transition from chillin' to workin'.  Today is back to
workin', but I don't start until 3:20, which also helps.</p>

<p>Reiko is back from London; she said it's 5:30am in her brain.</p>

<p>Juno has been trying to invite me out to chill with him and Victor; they'd like to see if they
can get me drunk, but I'm basically anti-interested in such shenanigans.  I <em>am</em> interested
in hanging out with them, especially if we can find a non-smoking environment, which might be hard
because Juno smokes, despite his &quot;plan&quot; to quit.</p>

<p>Today my schedule features my favorite Yuki to start, and (my favorite) Akiko to finish.</p>
