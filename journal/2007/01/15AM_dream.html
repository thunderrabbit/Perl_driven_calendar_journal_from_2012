<p>I vlogged my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU3rgiIXP70">dream this morning on youtube</a>.</p>

<p class="dream">there was a guy collecting water from a large river with huge turtles in it; he was
connecting his truck to the river and slurping up the water; I was a bit worried about the
turtles, but there was nothing but pure clean water in the water, so I guessed they were okay.</p>

<p class="dream">Some kids next door were playing  and after a bit I recognized them as being in a
video on youtube.  I was like, &quot;were you in that video, and they were like, I was, but he was
not; in the video was his brother or something.</p>
