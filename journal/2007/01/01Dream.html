<p class="dream">Guys throwing knives to each other as a secret handshake so they could identify
themselves after they broke out of prison.  The prison break started when a kid drove his truck
crashingly into a fence and pretended to have his hair on fire running around and everyone climbed
out and I could fly so I told them how much further they had to go, and through what they had to go
in order to get past the fences.  Some guys were asking about the leadership of the group and one
guy was like, &quot;look, 6 months ago you weren't even friends, and now you have a secret
handshake and have escaped prison.  I did all that, so I'm the leader.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">We got nearly out of the prison, but had to go through a final wall.  It was not
well-secured, but secure enough that we couldn't get through for a while, until one guy went into
the restroom and realized there was a fan vent out through which we could climb.  Climbed onto the
roof of the place and then heard commotion below so we had to zoom away.  I flew to the next thing
and some girls tried to climb up onto the roof to meet me.  A guy climbed out onto the roof through
a window, and I flew away, all like, &quot;I just want some time alone,&quot; and went out through a
wall somewhere.</p>
