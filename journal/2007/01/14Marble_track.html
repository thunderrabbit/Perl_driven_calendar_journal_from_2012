Track 2.  I'm working on another zig zag for big marbles that will basically mirror the one that has
been installed for a while.  I've been stuck in the detail of getting the switch to work.  It's been
far more finicky than I'd like, but it <em>seems</em> that it's come to a point that will work.
There is a stabilizer on each end of its rotation, and, most importantly, the bottom actually switch
part seems to work.</p>

<p>If I can knock out the rest of the switch soon (need to make one more gate (on the top) to toggle
the switch and allow the ball to go through, then there will just be one more super-difficult part
to do.</p>

<p>I've got to gently lower the large marbles about 3 or 4cm and 3 or 4cm horizontally onto a track
with basically no side rails, and no room to build any.  So I've got a scoop-thing under
construction that will rotate down (and a counterweight on back to make it &quot;slow&quot; (I
wonder how slow it can realistically go)), release the big marble on its track, and then lift back
out of the way so the small marbles can go by on the adjacent track.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of what to use as the counterweight.  Perhaps I can lift an entire section of
track, and allow small marbles to be triggered into action from a stopping point, perhaps a couple
at a time, that will go down different tracks.</p>

<p>Students' most common question is on the lines of &quot;do you have some sort of blueprints for
this?&quot; and most of them cannot fathom creating something 'freestyle' like this.  I basically
say there is no blueprint as in a master plan, but I do have these varied  short term visions of
what it could do, but they're quite vague, and change on a whim.</p>

<p>I just &quot;decide where I want the marble to go, and then figure out how to make it go
there.&quot;  Bonus points for cramming tracks in small places, and for gentle descents.</p>
