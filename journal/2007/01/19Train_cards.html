<p class="date">12:26am JST Saturday 20 January 2007 (day 13450)</p>

<p>When Dan lived in Tokyo, he collected train cards.  I helped his endeavor, and enjoyed his
reactions when we would go through a pile of cards, especially on the day he was making up myriad
games with just cards, and also the day I gave him a card with a picture of him on it.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I still collect cards.  Kellie has a huge collection, and plans to make a mosaic with them.</p>

<p>Randomly today, I discovered that one of the cards I collected had 70 yen remaining!</p>

<p>Now these are cards that have been discarded (no pun intended) by other passengers, and I often
grab the discarded cards when I walk through the station.</p>

<p>I put the uniqe cards in a pile for Dan, and the non-unique cards in a much bigger pile for
Kellie.</p>

<p>Oh, so anyway, I found one card with 70 yen remaining!  Wow!</p>

<p>I spent about an hour looking through all the rest and came up with 1140 yen worth of train
rides on about 20 cards.  Basically (rough estimates), more than 1% of the discarded cards have
money on them, and it probably averages to 40 yen per card.</p>

<p>I plan to use some of the cards tomorrow on my way to Kichijoji (total cost 380 yen for round
trip), so before I use-em up, I'll jot down the actual amounts:</p>
