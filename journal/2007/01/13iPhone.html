<p>Holy shite the iPhone looks money.  I like the quote on slashdot: &quot;seriously, guys, they
are going to print money with this thing.&quot;</p>

<p>I'd find the quote now if I were online.  Perhaps if I had an iPhone.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>The iPhone looks great; I can hardly sit straight.  Why must we wait for 2008?</p>
