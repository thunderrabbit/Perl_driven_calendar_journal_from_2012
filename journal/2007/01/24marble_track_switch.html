<p>I'm glad to say the marble track switch works pretty darn consistently on the top toggle part,
and one of the directions below, but the other direction is problematic.  I need to adjust some
angles, but they are pretty well blockaded by the surrounding track.</p>

<p>Even so, I added a flag to the switch last night, declaring it finished on 23 JAN 2007.  But
after writing this, I'm thinking I may change that after making corrections to the stuff at the
bottom.</p>
