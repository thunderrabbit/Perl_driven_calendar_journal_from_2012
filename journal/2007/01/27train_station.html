<p>On the way home, I saw some station attendants removing an advertisement which had apparently
passed its prime.  This reminded me that I've wanted a copy of the &quot;おとな but カワイ&quot;
poster, featuring the girl with the face of an angel.</p>

<p>Walked down stairs and found a poster rolled up, in its plastic wrapper.  I simply snagged it and
continued walking.  I felt a bit guilty, so I carried the poster home inside the sleeve of my G
hoodie.  I haven't unrolled it yet, but can see that though it's *not* the holy grail, it does
feature cute smiling Japanese girls; I'm going to have a shower and then see what I've got.</p>

<p>Oh, and, in my station, I got a pic of the construction notice for the new escalators.  I
*<em>might</em>* update the entry in Wikipedia for the station.</p>
