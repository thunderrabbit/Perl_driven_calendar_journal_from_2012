<p>I'm in Shibuya at Royal Host, basically 30 minutes early for my 7pm language exchange with
Shinpei.  We didn't meet last Saturday cause he went surfing in Bali.  Perhaps I will go surfing
with him sometime when the weather gets a bit warmer.  I don't know that Japan has particularly
nice waves anywwhere, but they can't be weak <em>everywhere</em> (?)..  I've never surfed, so maybe
small waves would be easier to start.</p>

<p>I discovered an interesting thing here at Royal Host, a place I enjoy slurping down drink after
drink (mostly hot cocoa and orange juice (two great drinks that should never be mixed)).</p>

<p>The cocoa machine has two settings: hot cocoa, and ice cocoa.  The primary difference is the not
the temperature, but the volume of drink.  Ice cocoa dispenses much less than hot cocoa.</p>

<p>However, the volume difference seems to only be in the amount of <em>water</em> mixed with a
constant amount of cocoa.  It's super super super super chocolately sweet!!  Like, &quot;woah!&quot;
super squishy sweet, an all syrup squishy..</p>

<p>Shinpei says, &quot;I think that is like poison.  I can't believe you drink it.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes.  poison.  But oh so sweet.</p>
