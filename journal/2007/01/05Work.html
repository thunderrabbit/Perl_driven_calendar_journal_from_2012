<p>Madoka was our receptionist today at work.  I had 1 cancellation to finish off my day, and two
students showed up 15 minutes late each, giving me a bit more of a break during the day.</p>

<p>Ami (was one of the 15-minute-late students, and) brought chocolate for me with her newfound cash
influx due to Japanese New Year's tradition of receiving cash from aunts and uncles.</p>

<p>I tried staying genki (and awake) during all of the lessons, though a couple of times it was
trying.  I've determined what I mostly don't like is students pretending to understand, cause when I
tell a story, I don't want to waste my breath.  They fake comprehension so I can't help them learn
anything new, and it's just a waste.  Rarely do I say, &quot;you don't understand, do you?&quot;
cause they usually won't understand that either.</p>

<p>Carl was asked by a student what sperm was (their topic was surogate mothers).  He didn't know
how to say it in Japanese, so after the lesson he asked Madoka.  She spent a lot of energy claiming
not to know.  How silly!  Finally I got her to write it down: seishi</p>
