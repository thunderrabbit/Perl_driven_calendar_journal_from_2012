<p>Had a two hour meeting with Tariq this morning, showing him my ideas for the next game, and
getting a bullet list of several changes, and a whole clip of changes on one of the movies.</p>

<p>At work now, I have a two hour break; I hope to get a decent number of changes done.</p>

<p>Nice!</p>

<pre>
button.onRelease = function () {
	loadMovieNum("movie.swf", 1);
	_root.play();
	this._visible = false;
}
stop();
</pre>

<p>This allowed me to embed movies in my games.</p>
