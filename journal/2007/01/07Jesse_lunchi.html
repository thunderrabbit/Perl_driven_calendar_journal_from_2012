<p>Met Jesse et. al. (Anna, Mari, Daisuke, and a girl whose name I forgot); we ate lunch at Monsoon
cafe in Shibuya.  The waiter was pretty funny; he's been in Japan for four months, with the
intention of learning Japanese so he can give tours in Japanese of his home city, Istanbul.</p>

<p>Jesse and I pretty much entertained each other with our electronic gagets and amazing senses of
humor (whatever!).  I was happily surprised to hear the girl to my right is on youtube a lot; she
showed me some vids on her iPod: FREE HUGS video in Australia, and a baby that was cracking up
laughing.</p>

<p>The purpose of meeting besides hanging out with Jesse: getting his extra camera so I can start
taking pictures of Marble Track 2 again.  Woohoo!</p>
