<p>It took me long enough to figure out, but</p>

<p>I took my plate down to Lawson's (the convenience store) on the first floor of our building.
They got a bakery out of which flows pizza, muffins, pigs in blankets, etc, all of which are pretty
delicious, if a bit(!) high priced.  (200 yen for slice of pizza)</p>

<p>Most people who buy food from that bakery get everything individually wrapped in plastic, and
then all of those bags put into a bag.  That amount of waste seems unecessary to me, so I refused
the outer bag.</p>

<p>Then, I realized that the paper-board trays would be even better for the environment.  Paper is
more easily recyclable, doesn't produce carcinogens if burned, and is easier to produce than
plastic.</p>

<p><em>Then</em>, I realized I can *re-use* the paperboard tray the next day, so I just left it
here next to my computer, and headed down with it a few days in a row.  Perhaps 2 or 3 trays saved
that way.</p>

<p>But today: I took my own plate down.  It's reusable, washable, dishwasher safe, and uses *no*
extra resources.</p>
