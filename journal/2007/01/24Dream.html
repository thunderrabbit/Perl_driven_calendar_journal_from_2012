<p class="dream">At a university where a wide-open field just had the concrete poured for two new
science buildings.  I walked out onto the site and found the sarcophagus of Aldus Huxley which was
labeled HUXLEY, and I was like, &quot;Aldus Huxley!&quot; but it turned out it was his dad's,
Clarence Huxley.</p>

<p class="dream">My professor came up and was like, &quot; ya know, after the rebuilding, the back
room of the science wing is in a complete disarray,&quot; and since I had helped organize it last
time, he was wondering if I would be interested in helping this time.  I was like,
&quot;yeah!&quot; and we started looking through stuff, and he was writing down the items that he
found, and I realized I wasn't doing anything, and he was actually just making up the names as he
went, so I started to do the writing as he did the searching.</p>

<p class="dream">He wanted his notebook and pen back, so I gave them those and began a new sheet.
I miswrote something, and wondered if I should start a new sheet (and waste a piece of paper), but
I decided to just go with the flow, and wrote along the top, &quot;WELCOME TO GLOBAL ADVENTURES
HOSTED BY CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES: PEACE BOA&quot; and I didn't get the whole thing finished before
he was like, &quot;you know, those kids shouldn't be watching TV over there, and he was debating
whether he should go kick them out, because it was actually their father's rule about the TV, and
it wasn't just for them, but for anyone, because the TV was near his bedroom, and it was late at
night, so he was perhaps sleeping, or perhaps they had gotten special permission.</p>
