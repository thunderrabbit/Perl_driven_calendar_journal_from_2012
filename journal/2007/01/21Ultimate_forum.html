Big fun today; thanks to all who came out!!

It wasn't really too cold once we got running, and the sun stayed awake for us until well after 5pm!

For Jason, who's asked me to post my site: http://robnugen.com

For everyone who wants to play with Jason's Wii at Pink Cow: keep harassing him until he sets it up! (*) 
Tonight Traci said it sounded good; we'll prolly hook it up in March.

Oh, and great fun playing Silent Football at Pink Cow! Thanks, guys!!

(*) I'll start. Hey Jason, have you emailed Traci yet????
