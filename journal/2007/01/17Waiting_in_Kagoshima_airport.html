<p>Chillin' in the Kagoshimas airport with several of the trial participants.  We just saw a
Pokemon plane take off and were watching the two round crew who walked the plane back as they waved
and bowed to the plane as it powered away.</p>

<p>We're scheduled for the 12:20 flight, and our plane's windshield was just cleaned.  Not the side
windshield's thought, but Raffi pointed out &quot;planes don't have to change lanes in the
air.&quot;  True enough.</p>
