<p>Just got a call from Hideo at CPC; basically I've been accepted for the trial to chill out in
Kagoshima for the drug test thing in February.  Whew!  Now still have to decide if I'll come back
here: not see Kagoshima, not make extra 10,000 per day, get frequent flyer miles, perhaps a chance
to meet with Tariq.  OR, stay in Kagoshima for 4 more days: chance to see Kagoshima, get 10,000 yen
those days, no frequent flyer miles, no chance to meet Tariq.</p>
