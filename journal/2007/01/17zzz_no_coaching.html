HI

I don't know what is the problem this time, but I hope you, your family, home, neighbors, and belongings are all safe.

I am tired of wasting time waiting for connection each time we try to connect.  It seems that
overall, I'm less energized and less enthusiastic around coaching sessions with you.  I spend a lot
of time listening to your problems and I'm not willing to do that anymore.  At least not tonight.

I appreciate the overall lesson that I need to accept leadership opportunities as they come.

Right now I'm taking the opportunity to lead myself to bed; I have to be up and alert in the morning.


  Blessings
  Namaste
