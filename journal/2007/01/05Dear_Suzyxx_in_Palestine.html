<p>I've just added to my blog <a href="/blog/2007/01/05/reality-strikes-my-day-off/">Suzyxx email
from Palestine</a>, and changed the permalink structure (for nicer URLs; thank you WordPress!), and
then posted <a href="/blog/2007/01/05/lt-watada/">Lt Watada justly refuses an unjust war</a>, which
is far bigger, but no less important than Suzy xx's entry.  In fact, I prefer to tell people about
Suzy xx, because she's a friend of mine.</p>
