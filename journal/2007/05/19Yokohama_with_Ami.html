<p>Lovely day in Yokohama with Ami.  We started at a shop that sells kimono fabric for making little
cloth things.  I bought several swatches for janette, with which she can ostensibly make a quilt.</p>

<p>Headed over to Osanbashi by way of Cosmoworld, but first a stop for lunch at a convenience store
next to the Toho (?) Cinema.  We ate outside while chatting and watching people and the video
marquee featuring all the latest shows.  We were facing a store called Humpty Dumpty, which sold
tons of plastic household goods.  When it was time to go, we needed a trash can, and I pointed to
those for sale inside the store.  I like when Ami laughs at my jokes.</p>

<p>Also noticed some Crocs, a type of soft sandal that has become popular lately.  I want some black
ones, but they didn't have any in my size.  Black Crocs are very popular this year.  (( this is an
inside joke with myself and other peeps who use Side By Side.</p>

<pre>
I'm looking for a jacket.
Here's a nice jacket.
But that's a <em>purple</em> jacket.
That's okay.  Purple jackets are very <em>popular</em> this year.

<p>_Blood Diamond_ was being advertised on the marquee as we left.  I told Ami I had downloaded it
but was unable to watch all of it.  Further explained that it was really fucked up because it's
real, (so I should be able to watch it??)</p>

alt="Duck at fish sidewalk" /></a>Instead of doing anything to directly support children being
&quot;trained&quot; as soldiers (the part I couldn't watch), we walked along the promenade with a
sidewalk for fish in the middle (except it's got no fish) that I claimed I would be able to jump if
I were wearing skates (and if there weren't any people around who might complain).  Walked past
shops, water fountains (currently featuring matching bamboo &quot;funnel-sieves&quot;, and the
awesome spiral chrome structure which I would happily climb if not for all the people.</p>

<p>Down the steps and across the street to Cosmoworld, where we rode a spinning loopy thing, watched
some people riding Banana Coaster, went through the -30 C ice house, and got our picture painted.
Although Francois is in Singapore with Shimpei, he's featured in the pic thanks to a photo on Ami's
camera.</p>

<p>After Cosmoworld, we had lunch at the Hawaiian burger place in あかれんぐ (sp), the brick
warehouses turned shopping &quot;mall&quot;</p>

<p>Headed over to おおさんばし from where PB's ship sets sail for its trips around the world.  Very なつかしい to be there.</p>

<p>Nice barefootedness in the beautiful sun.  I could have stayed there for hours talking with Ami.
Hours and hours.  Until it got cold, but still.  Fantasyland worth of niceness.</p>

<p>But, I had to go to a previously arranged engagement (starring Trent Reznor).</p>

<p>We headed out well ahead of time; I appreciate Ami's consideration of my time constraints.</p>

<p>Together as far as Yohohama station.  Hug, kiss, see you!</p>
