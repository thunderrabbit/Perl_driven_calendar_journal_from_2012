<p>Oops.  Supposed to meet in Shinjuku, not Suitengumae.  They're pretty far apart, but I can
alllllllmost make it on time cause the meeting is at 11:30.</p>

<p>I had been meditatively chillin' in the hotel where we often meet until the phone rang.</p>

<p>Also oops: I ate chicken this morning; I forgot to be vegetarian.</p>
