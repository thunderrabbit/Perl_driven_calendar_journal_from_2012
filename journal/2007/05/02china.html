<p>The idea of going to China is crossing my mind a bit.  After the supa-funness with Chinese girls
last night (one from Mongolia, actually), Natty pointed out how she (Natty) can't really relax with
her Japanese coworkers, even though she's known them for years and worked with them on some amazing
projects... there's still some invisible barrier keeping Japanese from opening up.</p>

<p>But with the girls from China, there was no such barrier.</p>

<p>Now, I'm sure that if I go to China (I should do a bit of pre-preparation first), it will be
another hella culture shock; possibly even bigger than coming to Japan because I imagine having
gotten used to quietly shy Japanese will make loud unruly Chinese seem like heathens.</p>

<p>(( this is all wild guesswork at this point; I have little basis for these claims ))</p>

<p>And part of me really wants to be &quot;where it's at&quot; with the revolution that's going to
take the world.  China seems sure to overtake the US in power, if not militarily, then businessily,
(which are arguably the same thing).</p>

<p>And part of me wants to be noticed, to be unique: &quot;China now is like Japan was 20 years
ago, some people have never seen a foreigner before, and the girls are crazy for
foreigners&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmmm; this last part is interesting.</p>

<p>But is it the right reason to run off to China?  Where am I going?  From what am I running?  To
what am I headed???</p>

<p>Plus, I've <em>just</em> gotten Yurika in the picture, and have asked Natsuki out for dinner.</p>

<p>Eeeks; what am I doing?</p>
