<p class="note">10:47am JST Monday 21 May 2007 (day 13571)</p>

<p>I had taken the entire day off work to make sure I had no problems seeing the show.  Preston
didn't take the whole day off, and we didn't specify the show start time when we first started
talking about it, so for a while I was all thinking I would get there early, and realize しょがない
Preston isn't there, and there's nothing I can do, etc etc, so I realized I should relax and get
there around 5:30, *after* the doors open, but before the show started.</p>

<p>Well, the train I chose gave me a chance to meditate for an extra ten grueling minutes as we
stopped *super* close to Osaki station, but not *at* Osaki station.  No one got particularly upset,
but a couple of phone calls were made from the train.</p>

<p>Preston arrived at the venue one sandwich ahead of me, so it wasn't too bad.  Still ahead of
showtime, but pretty darn close.</p>

<p>After buying a SIN-era T-shirt for 2000 yen, a better price than I figured I'd be had to pay to
get a shirt (and plus, in T-shirt years, it's nearly antique!), a bit of confusion on where to go
for tickets vs paraphernalia,</p>

<p class="note">9:18am JST Tuesday 22 May 2007 (day 13572)</p>

<p>but we made a couple educated guesses and quickly ended up in the
right place, which included bypassing the line because I'm in The Spiral (fan club).</p>

<p>Preston compared it to first class service, which I thought was an exaggeration, but accepted the
compliment anyway.</p>

<p>Got our tickets, tossed our bags into two lockers, headed in to the show.</p>

<p>It was some loud crunchy band I had thankfully never heard of, but I was pleased they had a
violin on stage.</p>

<p>Endless endless waiting behind a sea of people, not knowing how much it would(n't) clear out when
this band ended.  Preston headed up first (though I thought he had said he was going to the restroom
(he thought I had said &quot;the stairs are over there&quot; (I had said, &quot;the restroom is
actually over there; I'll wait for you&quot;) and &quot;I'll be right behind you&quot;) so I waited
a while for him to get back), but finally when the band ended, I headed up as well.  Funny (?) thing
is I went over the railing (much to the consternation of those using the railing as a harbour)
because I semi-panicked when I saw the mosh area was definitively *<em>not</em>* clearing out, but
smushing in, and I didn't want to miss my chance to get smushed.</p>

<p>Wormed my way up toward front and center as the roadies were moving stuff around and stuff.  It
took longer to get going than I would have expected, and some people were like, &quot;get fuckin'
going!&quot; but I couldn't bear to toss that kind of energy at them.</p>

<p>I could bear to shove my way through the crowd as the rush started.  Pretty neat experience to
go from not touching to abject squishingly jammed together.</p>

<p>I was like on the front edge of the pit, which was swaying gently yet firmly.  A couple of times
I nearly fell, but I was able to maintain verticality by hanging on to people more toward the stage.
A couple of times the girl in front of me really almost fell, but I lifted her back up again.  After
the second time, she talked briefly with her guy, and they split for safer waters.</p>

<p>I liked seeing Trent up close and beardy.  He's basically got short hair on top and short beard
and moustache on the rest.</p>

<p>I wish I could give a list of the songs they played, esp in order, but I simply can't remember
them all, nor can I actually name them all.  But most, I could.</p>

<p>I couldn't sing as many of the lyrics as others in the crowd, but I could sing more lyrics than
some.  They played songs from the whole gamut of albums, though noticeably missing was
&quot;Closer&quot; though they did &quot;Reptile&quot; &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and &quot;All
the Piggies, all lined up&quot; Tragically missing was &quot;Wretched&quot; esp after he played the
slow song that comes before it on the album.  Man, &quot;Wretched&quot; is definitely one of my
favorite favorite songs. </p>

<p>&quot;Capital G&quot; &quot;Survivalism&quot; &quot;This is the Beginning&quot; and at least one
more from _Year Zero_ were met with fewer sung lyrics, at which point I realized it would have been
prudent to learn *those* songs just before going to the show.</p>

<p>One cat with whom I had been jockeying for position bailed with his girl about 3/4ths of the way
through the show, which was great for me; it gave me a clear shot nearly to the front bar, and got
me out of the edge of the pit, which had been wearing me down with pushing against the flesh waves.
At that point I was only 3 people from the very front.</p>

<p class="note">6:55pm JST Saturday 26 May 2007 (day 13576)</p>

<p>A few times water bottles were passed to the audience, like twenty bottles total during the
entire show.  I made sure I got a swig each time one came near me, and made sure the girl in front
of me got a chance for a swig.  She accepted 2 of 3 times.  Trent would take a swig of water
between some songs and then toss the bottle into the crowd.  His guitarist did the same a couple
times, and one time he kicked a bottle into the crowd, but it basically spun and splashed the shit
out of the security guard from behind, who kinda just tensed for a second, then relaxed and
shrugged it off with a smile when he realized what it must have been.</p>

<p>At one point, as I was sorta-vaguely thinking of bailing the pit, I put my arm in the air
and... holy cow felt such cool refreshing air!!  With my hands at my sides / pushing for balance,
they were cooking in the hot mush of people.  But in the air..  wow.  I felt quite refreshed for
that little radiator effect.</p>
