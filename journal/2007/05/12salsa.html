<p>Keiko invited me to salsa last night for Pat's final huzzah in Tokyo.  We chowed at Outback
Steakhouse where we were joined by Ami after she hung out with her friends.  So great to see Keiko
and Eri again.  So great to have such a lovely 49th PB reunion!</p>

<p>We headed to a salsa club which was hella crowded compared to other salsa clubs that we went
past.  Natalie had headed out first to meet one of her mates (one = three girls from China)</p>

<p>Downstairs where I was uneasy at first until Natalie reminded my feet how to salsa.  She did a
lot of classes on 49th, many of which I attended, but wasn't confident enough to just start without
a reminder.  But then she was like, &quot;oh this is Merengue, &quot; and &quot;this is
chimichanga&quot; (or something) and &quot;this is 何とか&quot; The songs ended and she put me
together with Faye..</p>

<p>(oops gotta go hiking; more later perhaps)</p>

<p class="date">7:55am JST Sunday 13 May 2007 (day 13563)</p>

<p>(On the train now with Natalie)</p>

<p>The club was pretty crowded</p>

<p class="date">8:36am JST Sunday 13 May 2007 (day 13563)</p>

<p>(On the (third) train now with Natalie (and Kazzah!))</p>

<p>At first I was answering Faye in Japanese because that's usually the most effective, but then
she was like, &quot;日本語わかりません&quot; and I was like, &quot;where are you from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shanghai&quot;</p>

<p>I suddenly fell in love with her upon hearing this.  <em>Hmmm; perhaps she can teach me Mandarin;
perhaps we can do a language exchange; hmmmmm</em> ..  but it turns out she lives all the way up in
Chiba (which to me seems miles away) and works in Ueno (though closer, still on the other side of
Yamanote line from me)... so I gave up on the idea a bit, but still highly enjoyed her smile.</p>

<p>Her English was pretty good for not being fluent, but the club was hella noisy so still a bit
difficult to communicate.</p>

<p>Song ended, and I moved over to Ami, who was decorating the corner of the room as a wallflower.
She refused to dance at first, but I persisted and she ended up being dancier than I guessed after
all the initial hesitation.</p>

<p>Natalie pointed out that Sachiko, one of the members of our little party, 60+ years old, was
sittig directly facing us as smiles and locked eyes turned to smiles and smooches.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>So we shifted and then disengaged and I was dancin' with myself for a bit, and then with Yuuka,
and then with Rose (who will be on 58th as guest care), and then with both of them, and Rose pulled
both of us over somewhere, but I disengaged because I wanted to dance with Faye again.  I went over
to where she was sitting and was like <em>wait a minute; she's not Faye!</em> and I confirmed with
Natalie, &quot;THE GIRL BEHIND YOU ISN'T FAYE, IS SHE?&quot; and she was like, &quot;NO&quot; and I
wondered where she had gone, and if Rose had been (inadvertantly) leading us to where Faye was.</p>

<p>Danced again with Ami, and then later Faye returned and I was a bit shy at first (she was talking
to her friends, dancing with whom I wasn't interested), but then just sorta went over and took her
hand and she got up.  She was all tense at first, but then soon relaxed and then was completely
relaxed and groovin' wonderfully with her lovely smile.  Found out she works for a small company in
Ueno, and has been there 7 years.  Don't remember why she doesn't know Japanese.</p>

<p>Song ended; kiss on cheek.  Didn't (haven't) dance(d) with her again.</p>

<p>Ami had been grabbed by Keiko, who's an extreme salsa professionaly compared to me.  Went over
and Ami was much dancier than she had been before; it was fun fun.</p>

<p>I felt a bit conspicuous being so affectionate in (a Japanese) club, but we definitely had a
good time dancing.</p>

<p>She asked to see my Crazy Dance, but I was unable to do it with such slow music.  Then the next
song was much bumpier and I switched to about 6 or 8 steps per second for the entire song (7
minutes), which wasn't *strenuous* per se, but was a bit hard to keep my brain relaxed so I could
maintain that level of energy.  Each time my legs or brain began to cramp up, I reconnected with
Self and observed from an objective observer position, monitored my breathing, and sorta went into
a meditation.</p>

<p>At one point she was like, 「なに考えるの?」「瞑想する」and she laughed 「なんで？」「暗記する」
「なにを？」「この時、今の事」She smiled.</p>

<p>(( &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;  &quot;I'm meditating.&quot;  &quot;Why?&quot;  &quot;I'm
memorizing.&quot;  &quot;memorizing what?&quot;  &quot;this time; this moment.&quot; ))</p>

<p>Time to leave so we headed upstairs and outside.  Keiko and Eri came out a bit later and we took
pictures.</p>

<p>Natalie came out a bit late-r and we zoomed to the station, leaving behind Keiko and Eri, who
intended to make a night of it.  (their last train would have been at like 11pm)</p>

<p>Unfortunately Ami missed her train by just a bit; she took a taxi home.</p>

<p>Natalie and I went to her house where we quickly crashed out so we could wake up early this morning.</p>
