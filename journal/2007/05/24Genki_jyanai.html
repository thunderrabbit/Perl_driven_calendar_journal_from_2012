<p>I genkily called back and she was like, &quot;why are you so genki?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh shit.</p>

<p>I won't take any more time off for pleasure.  Work work work work work work.</p>

<p>Basically I think the actual problem is that the school is poorly managed.  There are no
substituted teachers to substitute for others.  I was working under the two rules as I
understand:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>give three weeks' notice for days off.</p></li>

<li><p>outside of class, do what you like.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I gave three+ week's notice.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the rules are applied in the opposite order, then I wouldn't take time off to do what
I like.  Too late now, though.</p>

<p>I'm going to give notice and quit.</p>
