<p>I just sat in a meditative type manner for about 28 minutes.  My goal was at least 5 minutes.
My goal is at least 5 minutes in the morning for 10 of the next 14 days.</p>

<p>I practiced Anapana for some minutes, Vipassana for some minutes (2 circuits around the body),
fell toward dreaming a couple times near the end, continually had to keep bringing my busy brain
off the topic of women.</p>

<p>At one point, I seemed to be able to see light, even though my eyes were closed.  I realized it
was my eyes seeing light through my eyelids.</p>
