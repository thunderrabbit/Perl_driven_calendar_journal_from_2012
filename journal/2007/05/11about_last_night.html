<p>Basically Kim had suggested that by my trying to &quot;protect&quot; her feelings, I was not
respecting her, not respecting myself, not allowing to work the work I had done to make a clean
disconnect possible.</p>

<p>Subsequently suggested to gently not bring up the topic out of the blue, but if she asks, then
tell.</p>

<p>She asked; I told; she cried; I cried.  In the end, I also told her the thought process by which
I wasn't going to tell her, and the one by which I did tell her.  That seemed to help, ¤«¤Ê¡£</p>
