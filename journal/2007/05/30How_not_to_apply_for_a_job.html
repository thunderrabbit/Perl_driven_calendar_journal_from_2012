Howdy!

My name is Rob Nugen; I'm a friend of Rob Wakulat via ultimate pick-up games on Sundays.  I
understand you are in the process of interviewing candidates for a position as a legal document
proofreader.

Though I have limited experience with reading legal documents, my years as a professional programmer
have given me an eye for detail, and I've been correcting various English compositions for students
in Japan for the last four years.

I can commit to a minimum of a year working full time, though I hate to say I cannot actually start
until August 20th.  I have recently purchased tickets for my first trip back home since I came to
Japan.  The trip will be July 18th - August 16th, so I could do ad-hoc work before that time, if
appropriate.

My resume, though geared toward computer programming, can be found online at http://robnugen.com/resume/

If you would like any further information, please feel free to ask.

     Regards
     - Rob

Rob!

Dude, you know what I just realized?  Because I had replied to your message in order to keep your
email address available in the To: field, I kept the same subject line.  I wonder how he'll respond
to that!

"Other Rob reporting in"  &lt;---- winner for the most grammatical mistakes in the fewest words.

That's hilarious.  Please send him my regards, and perhaps a new subject line: "Please, sir, may I have a job?"

   - Rob!

Hey Rob,

Nice - I like that first impression:  "I'm from Texas where we kick ass
and so I'm not even going to open with a subject line that is on topic
or grammatically correct, but you're going to hire me and like it,
dammit!" Heh heh.

I've already sent a note to Yoav, asking him to keep an eye out for you.
I can also swing an apology for the missed subject line in as well.  I
have to say though, I seem to be bad luck for anyone interested in
working here because they didn't even interview the last two guys I
tried recommending.  I'll be sure to put on deoderant next time I see
Yoav!

Good luck,
Rob
