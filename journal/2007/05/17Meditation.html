<p>I nearly skipped it, but I just sat my ass down and focused on my breathing for about 20
minutes (18 minutes).  Interesting to watch my brain begin to dream slash fall asleep.  I &quot;hear&quot;
voices before seeing any dream images.  Conflict occurs when I'm trying to stop the voices and keep
focusing on my breathing.  I can just give in to sleep with no conflict, or just get up with no
conflict, but staying centered on breathing... .... that's tough.</p>
