<p>Met Natsuki 大好き in Shibuya, and headed to El Torito for dinner.</p>

<p>El Torito is closed!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>While we were there as I knocked on the door (the interior was lighted and gutted), 2 other
couples and a triple came down and were like, &quot;wha???&quot;</p>

<p>ショック。</p>

<p>So we headed to The Pink Cow, where it turned out to be a lovely night.</p>

<p>Most every night at The Pink Cow features a different performance of some sort.  Usually there's
no cover charge, and usually the performances are interesting.</p>

<p>That night happened to be Flow Union (sp), which features a smattering of 'performances' focusing
on video or otherwise audio-visual.  First up were some photos by a woman named Coralie from France;
she had taken some pics in Hakone and mixed with with pics she took at a goth club.  Some of the
shapes were similar and she put them in adjacent positions for an effect that she was glad I
noticed; she didn't know if it would work or not.</p>

<p>Her pics inspired me to show a slide show featuring pics of Francois from around the world.
Hmmm.</p>

<p>Met a guy named David, who apparently has been (one of) the Flow Union coordinator(s) for some
time now.  He overheard my conversation with a guy who showed a 4 minute 3D animated video that I
thought was certainly professional quality work.  David showed me his flash animations that he made
some years ago.  He has somehow combined 3D rendering engine with flash to make some awesome
effects, though I don't know if they will work for our ideas for chatforest.com.</p>

<p>Traded contact deets with Coralie and David; it would be cool to start making my own contacts in
the artistically inclined world.</p>

<p>Natsuki remained pretty quiet, and I felt a bit bad for nearly ignoring her sitting right beside
me, but she basically didn't speak up, citing inability to add to the conversation.  ま、I can
understand if she was a bit nervous with us all &quot;blah blah blabbing&quot; in english,
but... just gotta try.</p>

<p>In the end, though, Natsuki was glad to have come; she may come back to The Cow for a visit or
two.</p>
