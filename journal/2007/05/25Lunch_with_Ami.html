<p>Found myself in Nakameguro at 12:20, during which time Ami would likely be at lunch, so I called
her to confirm connectability and headed to Roppongi to meet her.</p>

<p>I'm getting a bit better at navigating the Roppongi area; it's big.</p>

<p>She led me to an AM/PM (convenience store) amidst high dollar women's shopping area (clothes,
essential oils, stockings, watches, all in small sparkling shops) at which I bought some foodage
which I munched as she answered hypothetical questions &quot;what would you do if (you had [1
year / 1 hour] to live (hang out with friends) (hang out with you)) (you could live anywhere (she
didn't answer, but I said Costa Rica, Australia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Easter Island))...&quot;</p>

<p>The time was short, just about 30 minutes, so I wanted to talk a lot longer than we were
able.</p>

<p>Heading back to the station, I asked if she had ever practiced meditation.  She had not, but
expressed interest.  We'll practice next time we meet.</p>
