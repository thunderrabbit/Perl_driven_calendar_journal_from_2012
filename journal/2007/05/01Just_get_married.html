<p>An interesting phenomenon on my mind/spirit (it feels bigger than just me and my emotions running
around) after watching several vids that further prove to me that alien contact with earth is
plentiful, the US government is hiding <em>a lot</em>, and our petty bickerings are ridiculous:</p>

<p>I should just get married and get on with my life.</p>

<p>Why not Yurika?</p>

<p>&quot;You should get married; it's fun!&quot; smiled Amy, way back in the day at Mission
Burritos.  At that time I was like, <em>I would, if I could get married to <b>you</b>.</em></p>

<p>Then Sally, janette, Abbey, Aiko..</p>

<p>When will I just get on and do it?</p>
