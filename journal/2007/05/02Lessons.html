<p>Second lesson was nice today; Aya was chatty and funny.  She's a programmer as well, and praised
Flash 9 and AS 3 with Flex.</p>

<p>Third lesson was cancelled.  I like to arm wrestle her, but not today.</p>

<p>Tomomi was next, with a few emails to check and then I told her the continuing story of ¤æ¤ê¤«,
which Tomomi enjoyed thinking of being in that first stage of a relationship.</p>

<p>Current student is no-show, but is 10 minutes late for a 20 minute level check.</p>

<p>Next is Chiemi, who has not much to say each lesson, and uses &quot;much&quot; way too much.</p>

<p>Then Masahiro, who likes my marble track, though I haven't gotten it out today, given that the
president (who received a 2 page email about the horrible lesson a student had with me; I was too
proud of my marble track, and when I sat in a sloppy laid back manner and read her textbook upside
down instead of getting my own copy out, and when I heard her difficult story and tried to bless her
with a hand to hand contact, she claimed was scary and sexual harassment) is here instead of Reiko.
If Masahiro specifically asks about it, I'll get it down.</p>

<p class="date">10:09pm JST</p>

<p>He didn't ask about it.</p>

<p>After our lesson (listed as &quot;9:00 - 10:00 = 40 (minutes)&quot; (10pm was wrong)), I was
hungry.</p>
