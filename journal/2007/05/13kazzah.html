<p>Went with Kazzah to Bic Camera for headphones so she can skype.  She spent a pretty decent time
finding the perfect headphones (of which there were many).  The number of headphones that said
&quot;SKYPE CERTIFIED&quot; was hilarious to me.  We were like, &quot;holy shit!  These headphones
[say they] will work with Yahoo Chat, Yahoo Messenger, MSN messenger, AIM, <em>and</em>
Skype!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;AND Windows Vista!  OH MY GOD!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I spent about 2 minutes wandering, lured by the colorful LAN cables and found a flat cable that
I decided I needed to run from the router into my room.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the 7 meter cable that I got was about 1 meter too short.</p>

<p>Kazzah is doing well; much better since a year ago when she was mired in grad school and moving
and breaking up.  Eeek.  And she's going to be on 58(?)th voyage of PB, so that's pretty great.  She's
rooming with Rose, who will be Guest Care Coordinator for the next voyage or maybe the 58th.  Good
kids, both of them.</p>
