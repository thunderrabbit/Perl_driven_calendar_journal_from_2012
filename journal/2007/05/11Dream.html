<p class="dream">&quot;Are we so stuck in this negative system that we don't even know that we're
stuck?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He paused for a long time before speaking.  &quot;Your question isn't even the
right question to ask.... [so how can I answer it¤«¤Ê]&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Okay, are we in a system that keeps us in third density ...&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He interrupted before I even finished my question.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;hey!  don't fuckin' interrupt my question after you were the one
who wanted me to repose it,&quot; and I started to sprint ahead of him on the trail, hopping over
missing bridges and stuff over little gullies.  Then he put on real speed and ran past me with ease,
and tapped me on the shoulder like, &quot;boop!&quot; and didn't even react to my anger, but just
played my own game and beat me soundly.</p>

<p class="dream">I was on the right track for questioning.</p>
