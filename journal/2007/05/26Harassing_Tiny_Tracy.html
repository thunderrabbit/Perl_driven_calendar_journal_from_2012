<p>Tracy hasn't worked at the school for a few months; during this time (on Saturdays), I took over
her room with a window (and electricity) (but today no internet signal).  Today is her first
Saturday back at work, and I'm still in her room.  Jamie and I knew she'd be upset, but my lesson
started at 10am (until 11:20am); hers started at 11am.</p>

<p>I've got a huge break of 80 minutes after this first lesson, during which her lesson will end
and wittle bitty tiny Tracy can have her room back.  (She calls herself Tiny and pretends to be
really young)</p>

<p>She seems to have gotten over it, but she was all, &quot;no..  why are you doing this to
me?&quot; in a way that got me a tiny bit riled up slash apologetic, but I'm sure it will all be
okay in the end.</p>

<p>And on the other side, if things go all to crap, I don't really care; I've been planning to stop
working here on Saturdays.  I've been working 6 days a week (okay, 5.5) for a year; I'm about ready
to scale back to 4.5.  And I'm about ready to switch jobs altogether.  I guess I should start
looking.</p>
