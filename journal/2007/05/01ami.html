<p class="date">7:33pm JST Tuesday  1 May 2007 (day 13551)</p>

<p>Ami is my last student scheduled for today.  80 minutes from 8:40 to 10pm.</p>

<p>I considered calling her and asking her to cancel, and I would meet her outside of work, chat
outside for 80 minutes instead of inside.</p>

<p>But I couldn't really sell the point that she should go up toward Nakano with me; that's the
opposite direction than she needs to go.  Oh, and I don't have her phone number anymore after
losing my phone last time.</p>

<p>Then, the receptionist (the president of the company, as Reiko is gone for the week) told me Ami
cancelled.</p>

<p>Whoohoo!</p>

<p>I mean, D'oh!  I like Ami!</p>

<p>Right now I'm 4 minutes from a no-show on my current student, which just leaves Natsuki Âç¹¥¤­as
my last student.  She's loud and a little crazy (like me), but sometimes I think it would be fun to
go out with her.</p>
