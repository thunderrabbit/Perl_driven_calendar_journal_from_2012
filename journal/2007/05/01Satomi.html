<p>Interesting lesson with Satomi.  She's pretty low, and didn't do homework, but she's pretty genki
and funny..  I had her read a section, and then covered part of it up so she could produce some
language on her own, and cracked out some pudding for a snack and she was like, 「あっ」in a way
that seemed like she wanted some, so each time she improved her performance, I gave her a bite of
pudding.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a turn on for me, and therefore I'm sure <em>super</em> inappropriate, but meh,
I was going to be bored in the lesson otherwise.  The way she learned some English, got some
pudding, and I stayed awake.</p>
