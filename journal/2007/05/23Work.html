<p>Work has been pretty good today.  I started at 5pm, before which I worked on Marble Track 2,
which is close to being finished.  Still a bit of a question mark on how to finish out the big
marble tracks, but the small marble tracks are designed in my brain, though they will be a bit of a
pain to make (using only toothpicks), but they should look pretty cool.</p>

<p>My current student called and cancelled, and earlier I got a no show.  I hadn't had any
cancellations nor no shows in quite a while.</p>

<p>Next student is Ami; I was tempted to call her to have her cancel, but I thought it would be
better to work on my marble track than to run around Shibuya with her.</p>
