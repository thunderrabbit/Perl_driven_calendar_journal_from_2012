<p>For some reason my computer isn't acting quite the way I'd like.  I am pretty sure it's something
to do with FF that is causing the problem.  Not sure if it's an extension or what.  I though I had
disabled all the extensions that had been added recently, but there's still a problem.  Basically
the machine doesn't always go to sleep when I close the screen/lid.  Why??</p>

<p>It's getting pretty hella annoying; I'm going to strip FF down to nothing and see if that fixes it.</p>

<p>It took those two minutes for FF to load.</p>

<p>These are the extensions I have on it now.</p>

<p>(*****) Actually, I think this is the culprit.  I'm *not* going to uninstall (nor even disable the rest that are enabled), but I'll just disable this one and see if FF works better</p>

<p>Crapola.  I disabled Google Desktop Search and opened and closed FF a few times.  Open took 1
bounce and then maybe 4 seconds.  Closing was immediate.  Then I enabled Google Desktop Search, and
... still just as fast to start and stop.  WTF is the problem???</p>
