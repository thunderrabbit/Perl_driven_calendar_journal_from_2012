<p>Slept beautifully wrapped until lazy 11:30am.  Nature called and as we three were enjoying
chattering and chowing fruit and nabe, Yurika called after I had left a message.</p>

<p>Showed Natalie how to let my computer soak up her internet access via airport cards, and I
augmented my profile on facebook.com with deets and a picture of Nick and I hanging out on the
balcony in Kenya.</p>

<p>Headed to Harajuku and to Meijingu (I thought it was Meiji Jingu, but I'm sure the guy was
announcing Meijingu) where there happened to be a performance in the center of the place.  I took
about a 5 minute vid.</p>

<p>At Shibuya station now; gotta go!</p>

<p>(last night was crazy fun)</p>
