<p class="dream">Audrey was retelling a story she had recently experienced; I was filling in some
of the blanks before she said them, as I had heard the same story the night before.  She set up one
part of the story, and to prove I knew the other part, I asked a question about the part after then
next part which I had not understood.  She explained it and I got it better this time, and then she
and I sorta connected hands under the blanket in a friendship type way.  She noticed that Wende had
her hand on my unmentionables, and I was like, &quot;but there's a history there; we were all ready
to sign papers and stuff.&quot;  Audrey was like, &quot;ah; I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Amazingly, the source HTML for the paragraph above is right justified, and I honestly didn't plan
it that way.  I was writing with my eyes closed.  (Ah, crap; there <strike>are</strike> were some
typos in the first line.  Nevamind)</p>

<p class="dream">We went to our next meeting place, and I tried a shortcut that I hadn't tried
before, and suggested they go the normal way, and I'll follow along if I got lost.</p>

<p class="dream">I got super lost; I hadn't deviated *that* far, but I couldn't reconcile anything;
I had just stepped through to the other side of a building, and once I walked along it to the next
building, I couldn't even tell if the road I was seeing was the parallel road or the perpindicular
road, not by geometry nor by traffic flow.</p>
