Hey Rob,
 
A very interesting opportunity just came up today and there is a good chance I will be moving to
Macau in a couple of months if I so desire.  This is VERY exciting to me and my mind is racing at
the chance to live over there, learn chinese, experience the culture, etc.  Oh my!!!

Hey Mark!

> good chance I will be moving to Macau in a couple of months if I so desire.

Macau is sooper famous for gambling, eh?  Is that the basis of the opportunity?

I'm thinking about moving to China, but it may be just a passing fantasy.

Blessings on your new opportunities

   - Rob!

Yes, it would be with the same company, so they would pay for my relocation costs, etc.  Hey
maybe we could share an apartment in Macau!  How great would that be!  We could learn Chinese
together and play Ultimate in Hong Kong.  It would be a blast.
 
Basically, there was a "soft" blockage in the main line that backed up into the house and the
different contractors to replace the walls, carpet, tile, fixtures, etc just took a long to time to
get it all done.  Then after it was done the home builders weren't happy with it, so it had to be
redone.
 
Ok, seriously I've been dreaming all my life about moving overseas and now it looks very likely to
happen.  Tell me real quick how I absolutely must take advantage of this opportunity and how great
the difference has been in your life.

The difference in my life has been huge, and has opened my eyes to far
more than I imagined..

You've absolutely got to take advantage of this; even if you don't
like it, you'll *know* you don't like it....  Otherwise, you'll never
know,

and you'll never know Chinese!

I'm thinking of going to China as well.

And, let's see.... what's the fastest growing economy in the world?
Hmmmm.  Japan?  nope.  US?  nope.

Hmmmmm

Exactly brother, given the combination of both our entrepreneurial spirits and the fact I will have
a western salary to pay the bills, I think we could definitely find some way to start a business,
etc that would create a nice life for us in China.  Quite a lot to say in one sentence.  It looks
like Macau has no Internet restrictions either which means I can still make another 30K a year
playing poker.  WOOHOO!
 
Internet Freedom: There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the
government monitored e-mail or Internet chatrooms. Individuals and groups could engage in the
peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by electronic mail.

Wowzas...

I've got half a mind to do it...  The thing is I want to chase my own
dreams, and I seem to be closing in on what they may be, but at the
same time I want to learn Chinese and escape Japan and its difficult
to pierce culture

I've been working with a guy here on starting a business (video game /
internet based) so I can likely work on it over the web; we do a lot
of online meetings due to our nutty schedules

I've been in touch with my personal coach from Houston, helping to
design the optimal life for myself, which I want to include helping
people on a 1-to-1 basis via psychology, coaching, energy healing.

AND I've been thinking that the most important thing in the world
*actually* would be to uncover the lies surrounding alien
visitation/contact with outer space... this could lift humanity to a
higher level of consciousness.

And now a chance to go play in Macau with an old friend whose
eccentricity (perception of life) quite intrigues me.   Hmmmmm.

I need at least a couple weeks to think about it.

(secret news: I'm going to Texas for a month starting in late July)

So a new life starting in late August would be well-timed.... Hmmmmm.

Sounds like a possibility man.  They still have to get the position approved and determine the pay,
etc.  However, they talk like it is 99% sure creating the position will happen.  My skill set is
perfect for what they need for the position also.  They seemed as excited at the possibility of
having someone like me willing to move to Macau as I was about moving.  They want someone over there
yesterday, but it likely wouldn't happen until the earliest July.  My lease here is over August 1st.
Obviously, learning Chinese and the culture would be much easier with two of us.  Rent for a two
bedroom in Macau is between $600-1500.
 
Plenty of time to think about it.  I have another interview this Friday and my current department is 
in the process of promoting me, so anything could still happen.
 
Just a blast to think about right now.  I will keep you updated as things progress.
 
Now time to go through all my stuff and figure out what to give away and what I would move to
Macau....what a trip!!!!
