<p>Rie, one of my favorite students, and &quot;my little sister&quot; at work, cancelled her 60
minute lesson with me today.  The lesson was nestled between two 20 minute breaks, so that gae me a
full 1.6 hours to run around, just as Yurika was getting off work.</p>

<p>I figured, if I'm in love, I might as well make the most of it.</p>

<p>So I headed to her work and emailed her a picture of a clock near her work, with the question
「忙しい？」 are you busy?</p>

<p>She called me back, and informed me that she was, in fact, busy, but happened to be within 20
meters of where I was standing.  We said HI for a bit before the rest of her coworkers came down
and they headed to dinner.</p>

<p>Once they all arrived, I bade them a good dinner and headed back to work.</p>
