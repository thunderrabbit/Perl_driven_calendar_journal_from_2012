<p>Nice.  I've set up an emacs macro that allows me to give it the name (URL) of an image thumbnail,
and have it expand that name into the code necessary to post that image in my journal as a link to
its full sized version.</p>

<p>I think that will mean I'll be putting a lot more images inline than previously.</p>

<p>Around 15 months ago (while on PB 52nd voyage (today I just happened across the code that I
posted on 26 January 2006 or so)) I made a program that I run locally to convert iPhoto's crummy
HTML output to my preferred output (using human-readable filenames).  That program/system isn't
perfecto because I still have to figure out a path for making the photos available in the
navigation at the top of my pages.  AND, I haven't been maintaining the backend to make that
possible, so perhaps I'll just drop that part, or be more lax in the path creation scheme.. </p>

<p>Anyway, that helped, so I can have nicely named photos in a nicely formatted album.  I've got a
bit of code that puts watermarks on the images using imageMagick on my site.  Now I can
put the albums online and get code to link them inline as well.</p>
