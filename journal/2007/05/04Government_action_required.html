Dear friend,

The world's leading authority on climate change has announced that we have the ability to prevent a
climate catastrophe -- but only if our leaders act NOW. The G8 is 5 weeks away. Click to tell your
leader to take immediate climate action!  Take Action Now

This Friday, the official body of the world's top climate scientists will release a historic
report. Their findings: humankind has the power to stop climate catastrophe. But to do it,
politicians need to act--and fast.

The science is now crystal clear that it's not enough for individuals and corporations to go
green. Government action is required. Our political leaders will be responding to this report over
the next few days. But politicians have shown time and again that they won't listen to science
unless their bosses--we, the people--tell them to. Click below to send a personalized message

Last month, we aimed for 150,000 signatures on our climate action petition -- and we did it! Now we
have just five weeks until the G8 summit, our best chance this year to get the world's most
polluting governments to change course. We need a massive outcry from millions of people around the
world to make sure this Friday's report leads to genuine commitments at the summit.

It will take a movement like no other in history to force the 188 governments to shift the world off
fossil fuels. And we have just a few weeks to build it. But the power of the internet puts this
movement within reach. You have the power to reach anyone on earth--so, please, forward this email
to everyone you know, post it on your blog, tell your friends and your family. And get started by
sending your own message to your leaders:

Years from now, once we've won this fight, our victory will seem like it was inevitable. But at this
moment, it is your work--joining with others around the world to turn scientific facts into
political action--that makes it possible.
