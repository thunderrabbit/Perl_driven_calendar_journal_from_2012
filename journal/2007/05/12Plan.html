<p>I have an 80 minute break scheduled before my lesson with Kumiko, so I emailed her, offering to
go hang out walking around Kichijoji.  Suggested that she call first to confirm, but.</p>

<p>Tonight, meeting Keiko, Natalie, Pat, et. al. in Roppongi for dinner and <strike>chowin'</strike>
dancin' (salsa).  I've invited Ami.  Then slumber at Natalie's and go with GET for a hike somewheres
in greater Tokyo.</p>
