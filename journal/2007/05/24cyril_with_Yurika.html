<p>Cyril's magic show ruled.  He did a coin through table top trick 3 times: once from his hand to
his other hand below the table, the next time he removed the top cloth so the table was glass, and
the next time the coin went through the glass into the hand of a woman from the audience (through
the glass).  Totally wild.</p>

<p>Then he magically put the coin into a full can of beverage.  There were six beverage cans lined
up; she rolled a die to choose a can; he gave the remaining 5 cans to audience members; he shook the
can gently to let us hear the (liquid only) sound amplified through his mic; he dramatically jammed
the coin into the can; the woman tilted it and we heard a resounding clunk of coin inside; poured it
out and the coin remained trapped inside.  Cut the can to remove the coin.</p>

<p>He hung up a sealed bag with a new wine bottle in it; he had a girl choose and sign a card, which
she placed back into the deck; she shuffled the deck; he &quot;grabbed&quot; the card from the deck
and it disappeared.  Looked through the deck to find no card; her card was inside the sealed bag,
inside the sealed bottle.</p>

<p>During intermission, some guys hung a yellow box from the ceiling.  Cyril told a kid from the
audience he could have the present; kid came up on stage and Cyril put the kid's shoe into a box
labeled &quot;shoe cleaner&quot;; the shoe cleaner malfunctioned and caught the shoe on fire; Cyril
sent the kid away; &quot;oh wait, one more thing: your present&quot; and got the box out, got a bag
out of the box, a box out of the bag, took the wrapping paper off the box, took the kid's shoe out
of the box.</p>

<p>*That* trick, I must say, is my favorite magic trick.  I've seen it performed live three (3)
times (twice as above, once up close and personal with Austin's watch and me and Mr The Bibbster
closely guarding the bag in which it appeared (in a baggy, in a box, in a box, wrapped with rubber
band)), and would love to see it again and again.</p>

<p>He had a dancing flying handkerchief of mischief, which looked a lot like it was on a string,
except we certainly couldn't see a string, and it went into and out of a bottle.  Pretty crazy.</p>
