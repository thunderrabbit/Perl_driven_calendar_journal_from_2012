<p>Some of the stuff he says is too far out there for me to believe (yet?), but the underlying
result I have already believed: we need to take responsibility for our own actions.  We need to
connect with our inner spirits.  Our inner spirits are our connection to God.  A book does not have
all the answers.  We have access to &quot;all the answers&quot; by asking within.  &quot;All the
answers&quot; doesn't have to mean all the answers, but everything we need to know at a given
moment.</p>
