<p>Re-met a woman named M____ during first lesson today. She had an R hanging from her necklace, and
I asked if it was for her daughter, R___.  No; it's for Momoka, who died three years ago.</p>

<p>She thought I had been referring to the locket with Momoka's picture in it.</p>

<p>I stayed with the topic.  How old was she?  She would be 10 years old if she were still
alive.</p>

<p>Brain cancer got her at age 5, was detected at age 6, killed at age 7.</p>

<p>I gently listened to her story, noted that she remained genkily good spirited the whole way
through.</p>

<p>Later, when she was like, &quot;English is difficult..&quot; I was like, <em>how do I say
this???</em></p>

<p>&quot;Compared to what you've done, English is not difficult.  You lost your daughter and remain
in good spirits.  <b>That</b> is difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>I hope/trust/pray she took it in the blessing way I meant it.  She cried a bit and said, &quot;I
cry every day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know.  And it's okay.  You should cry a little every day.&quot;</p>
