<p>Met Ami at Futakotamagawa for a picnic and snooze by the river, and then ultimate in the afternoon.</p>

<p>By the river, four boy (perhaps ages 8 - 10) came through on a Quest to chase fish and
redistribute the rocks along the bank of the river.  We were basically snoozing on their first pass
through, but the second time they came through, we were in the midst of a rock-stacking ¤Ð¤Ä game.
Whoever knocks down the stack loses a point, and the first person to lose 5 points had to do a
penance.  In this case, feeding a banana to the other.</p>

<p>On the kids' second time through, the constructed a dam which pretty effectively redirected a
portion of the flow on the side of the river.  I was a bit interested in helping their cause, but
thought it would be inappropriate to join a team of four whose combined age equaled mine.</p>

<p>Ami and I talked about my situation, and I realized it again came down to me not setting
boundaries, and I could see myself doing it *again* even during the conversation, so I made a call
to schedule a meeting so we could be 100% complete.</p>
