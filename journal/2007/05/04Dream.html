<p class="dream">19:15 on my phone clock.  &quot;Ah, crap!  I'm late meeting Ami!&quot; and I called
her and she was like, &quot;I'm sorry I'm not there yet,&quot; Oh, good; she is late, too.  We
finally met up and were leaving the store and as I was talking to her, I saw Phil and Nikky (sp) at
the front of the line, silently watching me speaking Japanese/English hybrid with Ami.  I waved to
them as we left, and then saw Phil outside, pretending not to be there.  I was like,
&quot;wazzzaaapp!!&quot; to him in an I C U kinda way.  He laughed and we said HI and Bye
briefly.</p>
