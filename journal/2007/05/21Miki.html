<p>Headed out to Mizonokuchi to see KG Miki for what will probably be the last time for a long
time.  She's headed out to NC soon; her visa came through so she'll be legally able to work and
stuff.  I'm really proud of her improvement in English, going from super basic to pretty darn high
in a four year period.</p>

<p>Lunch with Miki was nice.  She's just as genki and happy and slipperily elusive with some topics
and being featured in photographs.  But good to see her happy and fine.  A bit of a reality-check to
hear her new last name.  I truly just want for her to be happy; I hope her husband continues to
treat her as well as he seems to have been.</p>

<p>Asked her how she chose.  She was like, &quot;I didn't have many choices like you do.&quot;</p>
