<p>Yesterday, and the day before, I watched a series of twelve 10 minute videos on youtube,
featuring a <a href="http://alexcollier.notlong.com">video of Alex Collier</a> apparently recorded
in 1994, in which he nearly predicts Airplane Day (video 3, start around 7:00), and basically
convinced me that we need to do something about the state of our governments, and not wait for any
aliens to come down and eat us nor babysit us.</p>
