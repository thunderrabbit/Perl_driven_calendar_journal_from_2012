<p>At MAC's Carrot in Meijiro, met three men from I-group tonight: Kevin, David, Deitrich (sp), and
Jeff from out of town.  Good to connnect on a casual level, talking about some of Kevin's expertise:
out of body and shamanic work, plus general funny chatter about personal work.</p>

<p>I paid a deposit for a weekend experiential soul-retrieval workshop I'll do at the end of
June, led by Kevin.</p>

<p>We all went to Kevin's house for a bit to see Yuki and Kailash (3 weeks old) and watch snippets
of Emerald Forest, as they relate to transition from boyhood to manhood.</p>
