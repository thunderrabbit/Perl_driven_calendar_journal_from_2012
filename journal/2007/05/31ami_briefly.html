<p>Ami came to Shibuya to ride the train with me as far as Sakurashinmachi, and then she continued
on to her house (on Nanbu line).  We would have hung out longer, but I had a meeting with Kim
Sawyer, so.. しょがない。  But then he cancelled the meeting 5 minutes ahead of time.  Fuck fuck
fuck fuck.  I coulda been hanging out with Ami.  Argh.</p>
