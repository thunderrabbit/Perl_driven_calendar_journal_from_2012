<p>So so so so so glad I came on the GET Challenge here in Saitama.</p>

at janette's back in the day.  I made a postcard for her which I hope to send soon.  And one for my
mom for Mom's Day.  And one for 明子.  And one for someone to be disclosed later.</p>

<p>I totally want to come back!</p>


<p>Then lunch, which was quite filling, sitting between Shin and Keiko (Crazy Monkeys' fearless
leader), across from Yuske, and Gachapin (certainly not his real name).</p>

<p>Came to a sake brewery which was superficially interesting, but basically I'm too tired to
really care.  Didn't even ask a question on my brain about the construction of a building (pretty
much because the answer was apparent (but not 100% certain)).</p>

In the sake-brewery place, there's a room upstairs from where workers used to pour rice into
vats to make sake.  Yuske and Keiko had the good idea of lying down on the cool floor; I was happy
to join.  It made for a pretty funny picture.</p>


<p class="date">8:02pm JST</p>

<p>Not much after that; we went to an old tomb made like 400 years ago, and looked about like a pine
knoll with a dugout on the top and a gate over the entrance.  Had I had Francois (or known anything
about the hole), I would have taken a picture, but.</p>

<p>Headed back with Keiko making funny cute noises as we all played a game of naming words that
start with the last letter of the previous word.  I used Japanese words, and then the next word was
based on the English translation of my word.</p>

<p>Back to th starting point for おつかれs and picture and email exchange and by to my Crazy
Monkeys team.</p>

<p>The teachers did a quick review of the day's pros and cons, and all agreed that Sachie is the
supa best GET Challenge Coordinator --**EVER!!**--, and that the day was quite lovely.</p>

<p>I definitely want to go back soon.</p>
