<p>In Nakameguro now; about to meet Ami for lunch.</p>

<p>Lovely lunch; she cooked Amiyaki: eggs with crab meat, a salad of cucumber and crab, and some
sausages, broccoli, and chicken karage.  I chowed and fed her as she looked over the Ogawamachi
materials for our adventure next week.</p>

<p>I like playing with Ami.</p>
