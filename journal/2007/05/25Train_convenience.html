<p>Haha.  I've just arrived in Shibuya from Roppongi, without actually going up nor down any stairs
nor escalators or anything.  Normally the Hibiya lines stops in Nakameguro, which would necessitate
waiting for the next train on Toyoko line to come, or to take the stairs down, over, back up to the
other direction.</p>

<p>But, this Hibiya line train was headed all the way to Kikuna, which meant I could take it a bit
past Nakameguro (I think to Toritsudaigaku), simply walk across the platform to the Shibuya-bound
train.  Perfect!</p>
