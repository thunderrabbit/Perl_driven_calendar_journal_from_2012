<p>Headed to Roppongi now to meet Ami for lunch.</p>

<p class="date">1:19pm JST</p>

<p>Went to Roti something, and was less than impressed with the service considering the apparent
quality of the restaurant.  I got a single ice cube after asking for no ice, and I got a little
splatt worth of dressing after asking for no dressing.</p>

<p>And I got grilled chicken with avacado on the side after I asked for a chicken sandwich with
avacado.</p>

<p>But, was more than pleased to chat with Ami, though the language barrier may prove more than I
can bear for very long.  Either gotta learn some Japanese or vice versa or quit or get over it.</p>

<p>But I believe there is still a communication connection that isn't verbal.  Maybe it's just
lust.</p>
