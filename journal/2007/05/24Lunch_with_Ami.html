<p>Went to a park near Hiro- for lunch with Ami.  I was a bit distracted with the phone call I had
just received, but Ami was understanding.</p>

<p>Vegetarian Roboyaki featuring garlic, spinach, carrots and cheese turned out pretty yummy and
filling.</p>

<p>Gave Ami the Earth and space science book that I had bought with Hitomi some years ago.  Don't
necessarily expect to get it back, but either way is okay.</p>

<p>Wondering about appropriate actions.  For now, just living in the moment as best I can.</p>
