<p>On break for another minute.  Just went to Lawson's and was introduced to 愛, the new manager
there.  あかみ said 愛 is as crazy as she.  We'll see.</p>

<p>Had Noriko first today; she's working on preparation for an interview.  Vocab is pretty good;
intonation and pronunciation is a bit off.</p>

<p>Takuya told me about Nigata; it's apparently got huge snow each year but isn't too cold.  Maybe
I'll go check it out for the winter.</p>
