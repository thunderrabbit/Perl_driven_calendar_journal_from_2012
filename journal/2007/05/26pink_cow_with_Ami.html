<p>After meeting Shimpei, met Ami at Hachiko for a bit of a wander including our first time to 
プリクラ, our first time to マック, and our first time to The Pink Cow.</p>

<p>We got a bit sidetracked in the booth after the photo shoot at the プリクラ, so we missed the
first option of choosing four pictures of the 8 that were taken.  Most of those that were
automagically selected were fine, so no worries.  Plastered little hearts and stars and kanji etc on
the pictures and printed them out.  Chose not to wait for the single pair of scissors to become
available before leaving.</p>

<p>At マック、 we Talked, and I found out that she already <em>Knew</em>, and I was a bit shocked,
but it made me like her all the more.</p>

<p>Headed to The Pink Cow, where we found Brazilian night party in effect.  Got drinks and nachos
(the utterly delicious kind were not available) and chilled on the sofa munching as the place
slowly became more crowded.  Then time for us to dance dance dance dance, which we did with much
energy and many smiles and kisses.</p>

<p>Tired after a while, so helped each other finish her Long Island Ice Tea before leaving, where
upon the stairs I helped her finish the last of the drink.</p>

<p>A bit sidetracked in a semi dark part of the street, but ultimately made it to the station,
where we confirmed our plan to meet for ultimate in less than 9 hours from now.</p>
