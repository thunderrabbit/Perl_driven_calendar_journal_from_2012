<p>I painted for 30 minutes this morning.  Started the remaining 2 of 4 total canvases.  The idea
for them is that I'll color one and the use the dregs of the paintbrush to splot the other.</p>

<p>Today was a light blue.  There's a star-like shape about 15cm across on one side of the first
pic; I didn't take a picture.</p>
