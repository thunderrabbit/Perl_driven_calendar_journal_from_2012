<p>zonked out near the end of that, I'm pretty sure, though the messages I got were images,
dreams.  I felt one little earthquake type thing, which is common here.  The images I will
summarize as, &quot;do more exercise&quot; &quot;do more meditation&quot; and &quot;keep doing this
type of work.&quot;</p>
