<p>Didn't meet Ami for lunch &quot;today,&quot; but I did hang out with her after work (during which
we had an 80 minute lesson).  I really like her, and I'm a bit worried about going through my old
cycle of seek and destroy.  We've decided to keep it to just kisses until her birthday (12 August),
as a semi-arbitrary date.  If we're still kickin' it then, then we'll see about kickin' it up a
notch.</p>
