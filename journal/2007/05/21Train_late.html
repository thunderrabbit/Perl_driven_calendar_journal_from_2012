<p>I knew enough to hop on the express train at Mizonokuchi, which passes the local train.  But I
didn't know enough to know this train would get stuck in Sangenjaya, just one stop (two stations)
from Shibuya.  I'm in plenty of time for work, but this means I won't have much time to visit my
peeps at Lawson nor HIS.</p>

<p>I just asked the driver how long, and he said maybe 10 minutes.</p>

<p class="date">1:23pm JST</p>

<p>Make that 3 minutes.</p>
