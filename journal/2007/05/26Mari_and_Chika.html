<p>Mari and Chika did pretty well today, though they didn't do homework, and I could pretty easily
tell.  I sat between them at the corner of the table, with &quot;a flower in each hand,&quot; as the
Japanese saying goes.  They scored the same today; for the past several weeks, I've been keeping
score; usually Chika wins, but they were pretty evenly matched today.</p>

<p>The grammar was asking where various shops were</p>

<pre>
Where is the _______?

It's between the ___ and the ___.
It's next to the ___.
It's around the corner from the ___.
It's across from the ___.
</pre>

<p>I had them help me make 27 shops that we could shuffle around on the table into a map that we
could reference for some freestyle conversation.  I determined they have no idea the importance of
articles in English, so we'll look at A and THE next week.  Chika is in charge of bringing back the
shops.</p>
