<p>I meditated this morning for 20 minutes.  I seem to hit a point of angst at around 20 minutes,
though I tried to breathe through it and maintain awareness.  Keeping my mind alert as dream voices
come brings a great deal of consternation.</p>

<p>I still can't quite articulate the experience I seem to repeatedly have after a certain amount
of conscious breathing.</p>

<p>Since I've started doing this, sometimes I wonder if the &quot;dream voices&quot; are more than
just dreams.</p>
