<p>Lunch with Ami today was short and sweet.  Interesting how, while I was waiting for her, I got a
phone call from my recent ex, making sure I knew that she was different, and Ami is all wrong for
me, etc.  I felt a tinge of question in my choice, but mostly just was thinking, <em>oh my god; I
can't believe you would call to tell me this.</em>  The phone call certainly confirmed my decision
to break up.</p>

<p>Ami and I shared Roboyaki and then meandered around Roppongi Hills, chatting up and down
escalators and riding the elevator semi-randomly looking for a quiet nook where we can just chat
and kiss.</p>
