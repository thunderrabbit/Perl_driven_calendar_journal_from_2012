<p>Around 2:15, I noted it was 2:15 and we packed up and headed to ultimate.  S[h|e]aw+n caught up
with us along the way; he and I had tried jumping over the bushes near the field maybe 6 weeks ago.
The good memories of the bushes and wild bite-sized dogs were relayed to Ami.  I didn't practice throwing
much with Ami; we got about 8 throws and then I was invited onto the field.</p>

<p>My game play was heightened by her presence, and by a good breakfast.  I wanted to do well with
her watching.  One time in particular, I know I woulda missed a catch, but I guessed (correctly)
that she was watching, so I put on the afterburner for an extra bit of speed and caught the disc for
a point.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Ami!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://jasoncollin.org/">Jason</a> was not at the top of his game as his dislocated
shoulder just saw game play last week, and then he played beach volleyball, a effort which he
characterized as &quot;a mistake.&quot; It was fun to sky over him and totally dominate on
catches; I would call us equally matched on speed.</p>

<p>Unequally matched were me and Bruno, who came pretty late in the game and was destroying me on
speed for a while.  A couple of times I burned him, but most of the times, it was the other way
around.  And one time he totally Dd my pass.  &quot;Thank you, Bruno!&quot; &quot;You totally dialed
it in!&quot; &quot;I know; you're teaching me what not to do!&quot; </p>

<p>At one point I saw Ami practicing throws with Shaggy and Peta; I was well-impressed (and happy)
at how much she had improved!  (( oh, how I would love to have an ultimate-playin' girlfriend ))</p>

<p>Generally great to see everyone out (everyone except Jolian and British Mike and Adrien)</p>

<p>Ami seemed impressed with my level of game play; I told her that she definitely had a positive
effect on my performance.</p>
