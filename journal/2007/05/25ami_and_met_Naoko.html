<p>Headed home after hanging out with Ami (and Naoko) for a bit in their friend いさお's bar in
Nakameguro.  He fixed me a drink based on Ami's request for a &quot;sweet drink.&quot; It was
certainly in the right ballpark, but it had a little grapefruit juice.  Eeek.  I hadn't specified
clearly enough.  こんど。  But, the cool thing: the drink was served in a little bowl with saucer,
like a kid-sized bowl of ramen.  First time I had ever had a mixed drink in that manner.</p>

<p>Got some funny-ass pictures with Naoko.  She was pretty much drunk, and pretty much crazy.  Ami
and I kissed on each other a lot as Naoko was chatteringly repeating her words in some
incomprehensible story.</p>

<p>I think I'm really starting to like Ami.</p>
