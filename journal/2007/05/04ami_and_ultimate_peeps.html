<p>Nice time.  Just got back.  Starbucks with Ami lasted nearly 1 hour.</p>

<p>Dinner with Ami, Kumi, Tamau, Koki, Peta was 2.5 hours.  Karaoke was 5 hours.  Sang several songs
during the first 4 hours.  About 15 people there at max.</p>

<p>Bye to peeps; walked with Ami around my old hood after Jonathon's.  (My building of) Millenium House is
locked.</p>

<p>Down Bremen Dori to the new improved Motosumiyoshi station where we watched trains for a bit and
I pointed out the slight change in the switch that puts the train on one track or another (local vs
express).  Walked to Kosugi and dropped her off at Nanbu Line after a brief stop under Meguro Line
to show how the bridge sags a little bit when the trains go by.  She plans to come to ultimate
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Fell asleep standing up on the way to Shibuya.  Got a seat a Nakameguro and slept to Shibuya.
Slept on my line to Sakurashinmachi.  Nearly didn't wake up.</p>

<p>Happened to see Michael as we crossed 246 in opposite directions.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't slept yet!&quot;  Strictly speaking it's not true, but, pretty close.</p>
