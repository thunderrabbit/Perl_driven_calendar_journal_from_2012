<p>Cool lesson with Tatsuya today..  He's written a &quot;Lingr Flinger&quot; that allows
drag-n-drop from local machine through FF to Flickr and gives a URL for embedding in a forum.</p>

<p>I showed him my process for getting images online, including iPhoto_2_legible, and my recently
written img-insert emacs macro.</p>
