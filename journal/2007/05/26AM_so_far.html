<p>Didn't take a shower this morning, so my face is feeling a bit ooky. Did draw a few lines on my
first of four canvases; forgot to write down the time spent on the edge.  I'll call is .2 hours,
because so far there's been something like 4.3 hours, and .2 hours will make future calculations
easier.  Plus, I spent 12 minutes on it.</p>

<p>Plugged in my computer's battery to get a bit of charge so I could write on the train.  There
are no seats, so I'm squatted against one wall, and my knees are beginning to wonder if they will
have a chance to stand soon.  Haven't checked email since yesterday around 2pm, though I imagine
I'll be able to get a signal at work.</p>

<p>Forgot to import the pics from last night, so I won't be able to use my 80 minute break to do
anything with those.  But I plan to meditate some and work on chatforest.com</p>

<p>Sitting next to David on Inokashira line to Kichijoji.  He's zonked out, presumably after
working late at The Pink Cow (where he works).</p>

<p>I'd like to figure a way to write a little code or macro that I can use to calculate days old
during my lessons.  I'd like to enter a birthdate and have it pop out the current days old along
with days old starting from 10,000 or their age, whichever is more appropriate.</p>
