<p>Interesting to wake up as it's getting dark outside.  Especially when I know that means I've
slept too late and my dumb new phone alarm didn't wake up the phone to ring.  I didn't want any
messages or calls to wake me up until 6.  But at 6pm, wake up!</p>

<p>I'm late to meet Shimpei, for our first meeting in like a month.</p>

<p>Thank you, angels, for waking me up basically on time.</p>
