<p>Great day with Ami today.  First bought three canvases in Shinjuku, plus another paint brush and
some acrylic paints.  We were shocked to see a paint brush for 33,000 yen ($300).  Ho lee crap.</p>

<p>Also bought some waterproof black pens that I'll use to accent the painting I've started, and to
start the next painting that I haven't.</p>

<p>Bookstore to buy The Gods of Eden, but they didn't have it in stock (though it is in print), so
we ordered it (in Shibuya) after chowing sushi at a かいてんずし bar.</p>

<p>Headed to my house where we had a Big Talk, and have decided to not do it, unless we intend
serious long term committment.</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;right now, you are right here, so it's easy to say, 'Oh Ami, you're the one,'
but I'm going out with Yurika on Tuesday <em>and</em> Thursday.  I will let you know if my brain
changes at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>わかりました。</p>
