<p>going to lunch, etc, with Tiny Tracy, one of the teachers from EV.  She's got this weird
personality trait of speaking like a baby at times, demanding that she be acknowledged as a baby.
I find it strangely attractive and obviously frustrating.</p>

<p>Sometimes I quote her mom: &quot;can Tiny go away now?&quot;</p>

<p class="date">6:49pm JST</p>

<p>We went to a park in Shinjuku for 200 yen each.  I had never been there before, but it was
generally nice and I may go again with someone.  Tracy made sandwiches, peeled some oranges and
brought walnuts.  I brought drinks.</p>

<p>Walked around the park some after watching some kids play a version of Red Light Green Light.
There was an element of running from the light that I couldn't understand the point.  But I enjoyed
watching them have fun.</p>

<p>Karoke after that; I'm sad to report that Eminem's &quot;Business&quot; seems to have been
kicked off the karaoke lists; I haven't seen it in the past like 5 times I've done karaoke.  Did a
couple of Em songs and Nas and DMX and a couple of duets with Tracy.  We have pretty different
tastes in music.  She likes rock and I like rap.  But we still had fun.</p>

<p>Went to Takashimaya after that where I stood around watching people and thinking of Abbey Tennis
(not sure how she came up) while Tracy looked at bags, and chose not to buy one finally because it
was horse leather.</p>

<p>Then to a book store where I read through Al Gore's &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;</p>

<p>Good stuff; I'll watch the movie someday ¤«¤Ê¡£</p>
