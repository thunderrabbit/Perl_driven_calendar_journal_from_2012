<p>Seem to have survied work well intact.  Yuria, who cancelled the previous 6 lessons (one hour
(paid) each), didn't cancel today, but left her 1 hour lesson 36 minutes early (after arriving 4
minutes late).  I would just be leaving the school, but thanks to her early departure, I'm already
in Shibuya waiting for Shimpei for our sorta-weekly language exchange.</p>

<p>Second to last student was ペラペラ Satoko, who didn't really have a topic; we ended up talking
about Tomoko a bit and I can't remember what else.</p>

<p>Oh, <a href="http://www.carlrandall.com">Carl the artist</a>, who encouraged me to paint a few
more canvases and display them, gave me a URL for the <a href="http://designfesta.com">gallery where
people can show paintings in Harajuku</a>.  He said that was the URL, or else it was within a
couple clicks of the correct URL.</p>

<p>Jamie and Tiny Tracy were working hard when I rocked out.</p>

<p>Chatted with Michael a bit after he had the Japanese SDF (Self Defense Force) soldier (I can't
remember his name), the man in whose first lesson with me I had been falling asleep until he said he
was a soldier.  I was like, &quot;really?  so, you're strong, yeah?  let's arm wrestle.&quot;</p>

<p>(( I've beaten every other student with whom I've arm wrestled.  ))</p>

<p>When we locked hands, his was like iron.  I knew instantly he would win.  He won.</p>

<p>So Michael finished the lesson with him, and I was like, &quot;dude's tough, yo; you should arm
wrestle his ass,&quot; and Michael was game.</p>

<p>Student crushed him in a trice.</p>

<p>We joked about that for a while, and had our own little arm wrasslin' match after the guy left.
We declared it a draw; just like me an' Super Dave Osborne in high school, we couldn't get the
other past that critical not-yet-beaten point.  Funny how we were both rubbing our respective
(torn) muscles after that.</p>
