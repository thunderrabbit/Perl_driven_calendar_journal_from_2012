<p class="dream">747 returning to earth with a space shuttle on its back, and there was a problem,
forcing it to lose altitude dramatically as it should have been flying over a valley.  It dropped
right down to nearly skimming the marshy river in the valley, and then the right wing slightly
touched the water, the plane stayed stable for a bit, and then nose dove into the river and flipped
upside down, tearing the nose of the plane off (as it stayed upright) while the body of the plane
flipped over onto the shuttle on its back.</p>

<p class="dream">eeek</p>

<p class="dream">I was shocked to see the footage, and wondered how it possibly could be possible
that I hadn't seen it before.  Thought it must be some government cover-up</p>
