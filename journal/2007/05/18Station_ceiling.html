<p>Two things about writing my name in the dust on the ceiling of the station with my umbrella:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I planned to write the date today, but</p>

<p>it's not raining so I don't have my umbrella.</p>
</li>

<li><p>It appears that the ceiling is being either cleaned, or replaced.</p></li>
</ol>
