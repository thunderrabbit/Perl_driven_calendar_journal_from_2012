Hey Frank

4th of July in Japan isn't the same without you.  I hope you enjoy the day in NJ.

I imagine you'll be glad to know NOVA got slapped with a class action lawsuit for not letting
students get a refund within a "buyer's remorse" window.  NOVA is not allowed to sign up any
long-term students for the next 3 months or so.  I saw apology-ads from NOVA on the trains.  All
black with white lettering.  No nonsense, "we're sorry for being dicks, but rest assured we'll be
back to our old ways before you can finish reading this apology.."

I'm considering shifting my life so that I'm making money being a counselor...  how/when/where did
you do your training?

   Blessings
   - Rob
