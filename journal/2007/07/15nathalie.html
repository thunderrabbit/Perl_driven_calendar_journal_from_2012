<p>Just &quot;met&quot; (via Skype) Fred's girl Nathalie, whose voice sounds nice.  She's pretty
funny and nicely unshy.  Perhaps I'm too used to Japanese shyness.  She's getting a Masters in
Education, and was shocked to see the facilities available to the hard-science peeps like Fred.</p>

<p>&quot;They have wall-to-wall computers, and we have makeshift walls...&quot;</p>

<p>When we talked about her coming over here (as in, it's 0.00000001% likely that she will), Fred
was telling her about the crowds, and I found a video on youtube</p>

<p>I posted the link in Skype as Fred was laughing that we have 3 ways to chat, all open at the same
time: Skype, gmail, and it took me a second to figure out the third one.  Oh, a terminal in
screen.</p>

<p>So, for fun, I was like,</p>

<p>It was a bit against my morals, but I totally lied about how soon I could get there.  I wanted a
way I could word it so as to not actually lie, but I'm pretty sure Fred would have noticed.  I was
like, &quot;the soonest likely time is this Christmas, but that isn't actually very likely; it's
probably more like next year, but.&quot;</p>
