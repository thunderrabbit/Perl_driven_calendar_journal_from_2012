I was like, "okay guys, you ready to get in your kennel?  ready to get in your kennel?"  and they
were like, "no," as Ivan scampered around the house.

And then I was like, "aight; I don't have time to try to coerce you in.  I'll go get a treat."

When I closed the package and turned around, the dogs were gone.  What?  I thought they like treats!

You know where they went. (*)

When I found them, I was like, ahahahahahahahaaa!!!

<p>(*) Maggie knows where they went.  Both were obediently in their kennels!</p>
