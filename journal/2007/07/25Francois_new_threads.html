<p>Walked to the main cabin to find Jason and find food.  Then to my cabin to find contacts for
jet-skiing purposes.  Padre Donut said Tori is going to come kidnap some of us with jet skis.</p>

<p>Wes, Cassie and Chris were on the couchbed, and I tossed Francois into the mix.  We did a few
Francois-based jokes, and I left him with them while I contacted my eyes.  Upon return I was asked
by Cassie, &quot;can we make a shirt for Francois?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Francois would be honored to have a new shirt,&quot; I assured her.</p>

<p>One sock and a pair of scissors later, Francois has a new top <em>and</em> new underwear.  (his
first pair!)</p>
