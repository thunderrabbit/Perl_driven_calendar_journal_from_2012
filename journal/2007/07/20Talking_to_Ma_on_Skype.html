<p>Talking to my mom on Skype:</p>

<p>I have discovered a technique to determine if I am still jet lagged.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>secretly fly to a new timezone</p></li>

<li><p>call someone in the same timezone</p></li>

<li><p>pretend to still be in the old timezone</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If step three proves difficult, I could probably say I've gotten settled into the new timezone.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Talking to Ma was great!  I found step three above quite difficult; I very nearly described 12
hours from now as morning, when from my official point of view it's evening.</p>

<p>Jon took the picture of her while she was talking to me, so it's like a primitive (?) form of a web cam.</p>

<p>The best news: I know when she's leaving for SWUUSI.</p>

<p>I'll be able to show up at her house late tomorrow night, after playing with Dude and Veronica
(and Cristina and Gabi) all day, and still be in plenty of time for SWUUSI!</p>

<p>I just hope they have a seat for me... eeek!</p>

<p>Well, it will be fine.  Certainly a seat will be available from someone at her church; she's
giving the sermon on Sunday morning, so I'm sure it will be fine.</p>

<p>At one point, Ma was like, &quot;are you going to come visit anytime soon?&quot; and I was like,
&quot;well, the soonest would be summer, or *perhaps* this winter.&quot;</p>

<p>She wanted to verify: &quot;do you mean this summer, or next summer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Next summer; next summer.&quot;</p>

<p><em>this summer; this summer.</em></p>
