<p>Hahaha.  I was regaling Ami with the story of mucking up janette's travel *to* the airport,
though she (barely) made the flight, just as I announced &quot;Northwest&quot; when the Northwest
check-in bouncer asked me what airline.  He looked kinda confused when I said &quot;Dallas&quot,
then Houston&quot; and he was like, &quot;American Airlines&quot; when he looked at my docs.</p>

<p>Hafta go to the other terminal.  Ah crap.</p>

<p>Free bus to Terminal 1, and then &quot;well, at least we got to see both terminals!&quot;</p>

<p>Long-ass time in line while it appears the computers were down for a while as the woman in front
of the line didn't move for several minutes; I called Ami (haha: she just emailed me and I'm
calling her) while waiting in line, and now waiting in line again (actually sitting while the line
goes down) after having just gone through immigration (is it emmigration in this case?).</p>

<p>On Maggie's Marble Track's box's box, there is one FRAGILE sticker with &quot;No Liability&quot;
written under that, and handwritten FRAGILE a couple times, plus dad's phone number and address.</p>

<p>Oh dammit; I wrote *my* old phone number.  I *knew* it didn't sound right, but I couldn't think
of his.</p>

<p>Oh, wait.  No I didn't.  Nevamind.  I'm pretty sure I wrote the right number (but I was confused
at the time of writing).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm wondering when I'll release these entries for publication on my journal.</p>
