<p class="date">8:38am CDT Saturday 28 July 2007 (day 13640)</p>

<p>Anna and Rachel woke up before me.  I haven't even ventured downstairs yet, but I can smell
breakfast and hear their happy chatter, bookmarked by Molly's patient explanations.</p>

<p>I'm going to sit meditatively for a few minutes (8:41am now).</p>

<p class="date">8:47am CDT</p>

<p>Anna just came up and said gently, &quot;hi, Mr Rob,&quot; to see if/how I would react.  I was
like, &quot;HI Anna.&quot; and then she came in and gave me the book I was reading.</p>

<p>Now she's telling me who she wants to marry, but can't because he's her cousin.</p>

<p>Now Anna and Rachel are taking turns playing the piano.</p>
