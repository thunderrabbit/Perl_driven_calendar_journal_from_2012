<p>&quot;I greeted you so warmly because I'm so happy to find a non-drunk person.&quot;</p>

<p>Jackie told me about the craziness that's being forced upon the YRUUers.  So much of their
staffing opportunities are being ripped from their grip.</p>

<p>We walked to the main camp pavillion and she told me the story she knew about Chesleigh.  6 foot
tall wall (on top of 30 story building) very short running room, but very far landing from the
building..</p>

<p>&quot;She must have had a running start.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;well, that is her style...&quot;</p>

<p>I told her about Kevin, the soul-retrival workshop leader in my i-group, and about the movie
Zeitgeist and the DVD of that guy being interviewed about aliens contacting him.</p>

<p>Pretty crazy, but fantastically great.   Jackie is great.</p>
