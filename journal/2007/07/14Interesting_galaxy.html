<p>I just came across perhaps an interesting galaxy in <a href="http://galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a>.</p>

perhaps an interesting galaxy

<a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/explore/obj.asp?id=587741601484111890">http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/explore/obj.asp?id=587741601484111890</a>

I would say this is clearly not elliptical, probably not merging, and not clearly rotating.

Wonder if it's interesting to you, or just to my inexperienced eye.

   Thanks!

HI

I can't seem to pull myself away from Galaxy Zoo, even though I've got loads of stuff to do.

Can you add a little checkbox that says, "this is my last galaxy for now"  ??

That way, instead of seeing *another* galaxy begging for my classification, I would see a nice
"Thank you !!!" screen and could walk away knowing I had done my fair share of galaxies for the day.

As it is, I've got one little galaxy squeaking, "what about me????"

<p>In the end, I clicked the appropriate classification button, then closed the browser window
before the next HTTP request could fully load.</p>
