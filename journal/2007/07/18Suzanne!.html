<p>So great to see Suzanne; she picked me up at IAH and drove me to my dad's house.  No one was
home, so we sat in the back yard and chatted about her spiritual training, which includes some cool
outdoor camps and stuff, then I snoozed while she played with a persian cat until she woke me up,
&quot;someone's home.&quot;</p>

<p>It was Karen, looking lovely and smiling me home with a hug.  She showed us inside and showed me
the new version of my old room (huge bed), and then they chatted a bit on the couch until we made a
plan for Suzanne to drive me to see my dad at his work.</p>

<p>Headed out the way we had come, but then I realized we could have gone a faster way.  We went
that way, but it was a little out of the way.</p>
