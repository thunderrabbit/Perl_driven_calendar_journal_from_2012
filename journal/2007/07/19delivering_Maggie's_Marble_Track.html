<p>Success.  Maggie's Marble Track has been successfully delivered to Maggie!</p>

<p>I didn't think to get a video of her first playing with it; I was happy with its initial success
rate, though.</p>

<p>I looked at my *old* marble track, and ... my goodness does it look different.  Maggie's Marble
Track is so <em>dense</em> compared to Marble Track 1.</p>

<p>Perhaps tomorrow I'll get some 1-vs-2 video going on.</p>
