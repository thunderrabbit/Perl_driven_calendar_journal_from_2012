<p>I told Ami that another girl had hit on me and asked if I would snuggle with her, and I told her
&quot;it's too dangerous, sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Ami got upset that I didn't say, &quot;I have a girlfriend, sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>But</p>

<p>I had already told everyone that I have a girlfriend.  The girl had seen pictures of Ami earlier
that night.  The fucked up part is that I couldn't finish talking to Ami because I had to help
clean up.  We're nowhere close to finished, but copying DVDs for the mugbook now.</p>

<p>On the way home, I got to speak with Ami.  She's fine; it was all a simple misunderstanding.  I was quite relieved.</p>
