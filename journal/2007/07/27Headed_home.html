<p>In the car with Jason now; we're at the lodge seeing if we can get internet access.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, wait.  Yeee  not yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Headed home now.</p>

<p class="date">6:05pm CDT Friday 27 July 2007 (day 13639)</p>

<p>At home at Molly and Will's house now.  Supa special thanks to Jason for driving and dropping me
off.  Certainly so much nicer to have a good slash funny conversation on the way home than just
driving alone, trying to stay awake.</p>

<p>Really happy for Jason's success in sound engineering; he and his mate are starting their own
business: basically a sound studio.  And for steady income, he's doing the sound at a Presbyterian
church.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing him again soon (and Kate).</p>
