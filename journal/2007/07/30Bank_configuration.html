<p>I went to a new WaMu branch, and was a bit surprised to find little islands for each teller
instead of a big counter behind which they all stood.  Quickly enough I figured out where to go, so
I figured I was all good, but just to make sure I was like, &quot;I've been in Japan for four
years; I have a check I'd like to deposit, but I don't really remember how.&quot;</p>

<p>She filled out the deets for me on the deposit slip, told me where to sign and stuff, and then
asked in what denominations I wanted the withdrawl.  I didn't want a 100 dollar note, but I wanted
to *see* a new 100 dollar note, so I told her that.  She said it was no problem to break the 100
after I had seen it.</p>

<p>She put my check into an envelope, and tossed it through a brush-protected slot on her
counter.</p>

<p><em>wha??</em>  My surprise-face gave away my surprise; I had curiously poked my fingers through
to see what it was like, I thought it was for trash!</p>

<p>&quot;[I see you're surprised(, and I know what you're thinking);] did you put trash in
there?&quot; she asked me.</p>

<p>&quot;Nope, but I did think it was for trash,&quot; I said, confirming her hunch.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, as long as water doesn't get in there.&quot;</p>

<p>She explained how this system keeps their hands off the cash, saying there's a big safe down
there.</p>

<p><em>How deep?  How big?  A safe for each island?</em>  &quot;Wow.&quot;</p>

<p>And then, instead of giving me the cash, she gave me a recipt with a five digit number on the
bottom</p>

<p>Had she not explained wtf it was, I woulda been like, &quot;WTF?&quot;</p>

<p>But she saved me that bit of confusion and showed me the machine (which certainly did *not* look
like a cash dispenser to me; I wish I had photographed it.  It basically looked like a counter with
a keypad on it and a slot through the counter, below which was a paper shredder.</p>

<p>Except this paper shredder is the coolest in the world: it gives out money!</p>

<p>I got the $100 and $50 bills, both of which were old, so I immediately went back to her island,
though she had moved to the center of the room where she was taking a phone call in Spanish.</p>

<p>She finished, then asked if I was finished with the note.</p>

<p>&quot;Yep; it's an old style hundred.&quot;</p>

<p>I handed it to her, and then showed her a 5000 and 1000 yen note.  I shoulda showed her a 500
yen coin as well, but I didn't think of it.</p>

<p>She marveled at the Japanese notes a bit, and especially enjoyed the bufont hairdo of the man on
the 1000 yen note.</p>

<p>We talked a bit more as she was inserting the 100 dollar bill into an envelope and depositing it
into her counter slot.  Another five digit piece of paper later, I was the proud owner of five random
twenties.</p>
