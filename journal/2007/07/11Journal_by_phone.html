work

Nice blessing that a woman specifically chose me for her last lesson
at EV. She also specifically thanked me for my advice I had apparently
given her. That is especially nice because that is the kind of work I
want to do for reals.

This morning I got a bit pissed at the ineptness at the Sakura House office:

multiple phone calls both directions, with no CSR love
late meeting me at Motosumiyoshi

But, in the end, they won.

call, furikomi, fax,

lunch with Shimpei
Apple Store
J OS
d'oh!

shower
train

hello, Mac.

<p>I'm going to move to Sakura House much closer to Ami's house than I live now.  Also 18,000 yen
cheaper each month.  And hella smaller, but.</p>

<p>When I went to the Apple Store, the machine had gone back in to surgery; the guy had absent
mindedly installed the Japanese version of the OS, which required a re-installation.  I am a bit
curious about that; I thought the OS was the same, but just set to use whatever language.  Maybe
they install a buncha Japanese cruft that I don't want.</p>
