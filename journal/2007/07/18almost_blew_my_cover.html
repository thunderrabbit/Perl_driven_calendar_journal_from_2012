<p>Suzanne brought me to the university where my dad teaches, and I've located his class, though it
was a close call because the woman who led me there was like, &quot;you have a visitor,&quot; and I
was like, <em>NO!!!</em> in my head because I had told her it's a SECRET, and I don't want to
interrupt his class.  Thank you for listening.</p>

<p>Anyway, I politely (?) declined through clenched teeth, &quot;it's a secret,&quot; and she
shrugged/winced a bit and then walked away, and I waited until he had resumed talking and then
scurried past the door, though I don't think he could have seen me anyway.</p>
