<p>After nearly winning the scavenger hunt on a team with Jackie, Ashley, Meredith, Adrien (? I
can't even think now) got sunburned today after big fun swimming in the pool; taking pictures and
video of Jason, Tanner, Scottie, Adam playing tennis; then swimming in the watersports area which
features a water trampoline and some slides and stuff.</p>

<p>I wanted to jump jump jump on the trampoline, but it was hard for two basic reasons: (1) the mats
around the edge kept the air from escaping from under the tramp, effectively damping the jumpage.
(2) there were a bunch of little kids who wanted to play as well.  One of these kids seemed a bit
interested in Francois.  She was like, &quot;is your rabbit supposed to get wet?&quot;</p>

<p>She humored me a bit when I was like, &quot;he's not wet; he's Francois!&quot;</p>

<p>Except for Dane and I, all the YAs jetted early, citing unfunness.  We had plenty of fun sliding
down the slides repeatedly, but I was wanting more fun on the trampoline.</p>

<p>Rode around in kayak with Cassie and I-forget, and then traded one for Anthony and were doing
fake French pirate accents on Francois' behalf.</p>

<p>Later, after talking to a woman named Joana (?) from a church in Austin about my Peace Education
T-shirt from the german students from University of Tubingen who were on PB 49, I saw the
Francois-interested girl again.  I like her because she's young, but doesn't mind asking politely
for what she wants.  &quot;May I hold the rabbit?&quot; and &quot;what is his name again?&quot;</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  Turns out the girl's name is Colleen.</p>

<p>I played a bit of the putt-putt golf course with some discarded ball and shaft, and then
remembered to go get my computer from the office.</p>

<p>- -</p>

<p>Bummed around a bit after that, wondering where all the YAs went.  I knew of 10 who went to
Ardmore, including Lawren, who got me cookies and stuff.</p>

<p>Found Frank setting up for silk screening shirts; we did about 25 shirts including one of mine
on the What Up, G? shirt Fred got me.  I enjoyed helping him with the process of screening shirts.
He really likes to do it for a hobby, not just for a job.</p>
