<p>Tired.  Not many hours at work today, but worked on stuff for chatforest.com this morning.  XML
parser and stuff.  At EV, I only worked from 4:40 to 9:20, and tomorrow from like 5:00 to 10pm.
Not sure why I'm suddenly getting so few hours.  Maybe Reiko is weaning me off work cause I've
talked about getting a new job.  Maybe it's cause I'm dating Ami.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just paranoid.</p>
