<p>Just enjoyed breakfast with Ma; we had the buffet.  I told her I was happy that she's fit and
trim; I have somewhat of a predjudice against people who I see as overweight.  She said that she
recently lost weight, starting at GA last year, where she walked 14 blocks each way from her hotel
to the conference, thereby losing 5 pounds over the week.  She kept up her walks after returning to
Austin, and lost 25 pounds over the year.</p>

<p>Ma also said she found drinking plenty of water helps the digestive process.  She was like,
&quot;it actually does help,&quot; cause this is something I've certainly heard enough times that
I'd imagine everyone has heard it.  But to have such a testimonial, from someone who has actually
experienced the benefits of water...  wow.</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>This morning when I whizzed, I noticed my output was a bit darker than normal; I hadn't been
drinking enough water yesterday, so I plan to correct that today.</p>
