<p>In addition to my first marble track, Maggie has been keeping boxes and boxes of my stuff,
including all my handwritten diaries, my coin collection, my file cabinet (one box worth), several
books and CDs, high school and university yearbooks, papers from second grade, and scrapbooks,
including the skeleton of Rob's Roller coaster Roundup of the world's great coasters.</p>

<p>Most of these boxes say they were sealed in July 2002, so I surmise Maggie has basically had
them since then.</p>

<p>Dang.  Five years.</p>
