<p>Wow.  Just about to throw away my old phone, but decided to see what it would do if charged.</p>

<p>A bunch of old pictures from my first days in Japan, all the way up to peeps on PB.  I'll pay
several yen to get those moved to my website.</p>

<p>They'll be hella small, but they've got more memories than they'll take up memory.</p>
