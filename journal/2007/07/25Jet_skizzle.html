</ol>

<p>Really happy for the chance to ride on the jet ski on the trailer being pulled behind the car
to the boat ramp.  Someone had started me on Borat impersonations; I was repeatedly like,
&quot;very nice!&quot; in that おかしい way that he says it.  Tori kept turning back to check my
status; I gave thumbs up each time.</p>

<p>I rode behind Tori as Phat Pat/ty Digital rode behind me to the spot.  For fun, Pat and I hid on
the opposite side of the cove while Tori went back to get more people.</p>

<p>Then I rode behind Pat for a while as we jet skidded a bit.</p>

<p>Switched over to me, and I immediately did some crazy move that threw him from the jet ski.
After some zooming, I got the hang of it, and was doing a wide semi-hydroplaning curve, just barely
letting off as we lost traction.  I was like, &quot;aight; I got this,&quot; and then
just <em>whoomp!</em> and we both went *flying* and splashing laughing.  &quot;This is so great
because we can't get hurt!&quot; (*)</p>

<p>(*) yes, we can get hurt, but compared to concrete, we can't get hurt.</p>

<p>Then huge huge great fun as <em>Cherie</em> drove me on the jet ski.  She was whippin' it around
like zoom rar zoom rarararar zoom bbbbbararrr zooom etc etc and I was laughing laughing loving it!!
Just wanted to merge and melt into the moment of happy zoomy spirally zooming forever.</p>

<p>At one point early on, I was like, &quot;this is great!  You can try to throw me off, but I'm
not going!&quot;</p>

<p>During our adventure, she finally did throw me off <em>and didn't notice</em> for about 35
seconds or so of more wild spins.  She came back and we made a new rule of holding on to the life
jacket instead of onto the back handle.  During our subsequent runs, she threw me off again but I
was gripped on and wrenched her off.  Then I got to drive, and threw us both off twice, including
right near the group as we were coming back.  So so so sosososo much fun!!!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After that it wasn't so fun, but still mildly entertaining.  I got hit on harder than probably
ever before in my life after someone had been like, &quot;okay, if you (gender) take of your
shirts, we'll take off our shirts.&quot;  The offer was accepted and we were all topless, except I
kept my shoulders covered (because I didn't want them to get way way way more burned), so I took my
bottoms off for good measure.</p>

<p>I wasn't aroused whatsoever during the major effort to get a reaction from me, so I maintained a
sharp border between acceptable and not.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The group got progressively drunker and drunker, except for Phat Pat, who had had his beers and
then just floated chillfully in the water.  And me who didn't drink any.  I was basically ready to
go back at any time, especially because pizza was available (for a limited time) back at the main
camp.  I wanted to stay with the group a bit, though; my camera was back in Padre's car.</p>

<p>There was talk of a retreat, so I was quick to head back.  First I rode behind Mary behind Matt
Boy and dropped them off at the group camp.  Then I drove zoomingly back and wait-wait-waited while
Tori explained to Cherie that the latter couldn't drive, and the former used every proverbial
carrot she could imagine to get Cherie to relinquish her jet ski key and life jacket... and then
while Tori coaxed Adrien out of her slumber to ride back with me and Phat Pat and oh shit where are
Padre's keys???</p>

<p>It was guessed they must be in the white bag taken back by Matt Boy, so I drove a very sloshy
Adrien on the even sloshier jet ski that seemed so close to dumping over that I could barely get it
going to upright and flat with decent speed.</p>

<p>Finally got back, found Matt who found the car keys, gave them back to Phat Pat, and then headed
up and ran to Jackie, who was soberly sitting on a cooler talking on her cellie.</p>
