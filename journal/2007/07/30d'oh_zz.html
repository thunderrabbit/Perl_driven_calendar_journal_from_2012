<p>The internet connection here has been hella slow.</p>

<p>And the check I mailed to MKP this morning was left in the mailbox with a note: 41 cents, not 39
all highlighted and stuff.</p>

<p>Damn.  And I had seen the mail carrier as she came through; I should have asked her if it was
all okay.</p>
