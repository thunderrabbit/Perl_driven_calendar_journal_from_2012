<p>Yesterday I looked down and found the time had progressed to 10:15am, which would make me 30
minutes late for an hour movie presented by Craig Roshaven in his workshop.</p>

<p>This morning I told my mom, and she was like, &quot;the AM workshops start at 10:45..&quot;</p>

<p>Ah!  So I wasn't late after all.  Just silly and *thought* I was late, though my angels had
alerted me to the time in time for me to arrive.</p>

<p>Today I maintained more consious awareness of the passage of side time, and when the progession
reached 10:15, I said ちゅちゅバイバイ to Ami and headed to the workshop location.  I am here now,
and appear to be the first one present.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about making a makeup to Craig, but I will ask him if I can scope the DVD that he
had planned to show us yesterday.</p>

<p>Talked to Craig a bit about my  fear of settling down..  The group was talking about consumerism
and how we're all deluged with ads telling us to buy buy buy.  I've been intentionally *not* buying
things and *not* being tied down to anything, galavanting around the world on a shoestring budget,
insurance free, etc.  Just me an' my rabbit.</p>

<p>He was like, &quot;well, it may happen sooner or later; you'll find a place.  But that you're
thinking about it means it may be in the process of happening..&quot;</p>
