<p>First order of business today: fix Maggie's Marble Track.  There are a few places that seem to
have <em>shrunk</em> so the marbles won't go through anymore.</p>

<p>I used my pocket knife to shave the bottom of the toothpick that's right on the outer curve of
the first turn on the leftmost track from the start.</p>

<p>Tried the course and the big marble made it past that point, but soon go stuck at another point
of close tolerance.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  If I just had a dremel, I could just ...</p>

<p>Holy shizah, certainly my dad has a dremel!</p>

<p>One phone call and 90 seconds later, dremel in hand.</p>
