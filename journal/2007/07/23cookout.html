<p>The young adults sponsored a cookout out in the pavillion to which several non-YAs came,
including my mom and That Guy.  Just beforehand, I had scooped up the Japanese fashion magazines
that had become stacked on the floor after people scoped them in my cabin, and brought them over
to the YA cabins near the YA tent under which many folding chairs are gathered; basically I wanted to
hear how Jackie and Ashley would react to the pics.</p>

<p>No one really encouraged intergenerational mingling during the cookout, but I enjoyed sitting
across from Jackie and Ashley as they fiddled with each other's food and playfully bickered about
which condiments should(n't) go where.</p>

<p>They left in turns, and my mom came in for a landing.  I told her about the Xtreem Sportz we had
been doing in the pool.</p>

<p>The YAs upwind from us started smoking so we bounced to the table where That Guy was chatting
with Arlene and a couple others about how someone Arlene knows (I'm guessing Dane) would rescue baby
possums from the pouches of dead possums on the road.  Jon said it sounded a lot like looting.</p>

<p>The story was one-upped by a woman who bummed a cigarette of a guy who said it was a Dead Man
cigarette.  &quot;A what?&quot;</p>

<p>Turns out he regularly lifted cigarettes from corpses when he went to the scene of a death.</p>

<p>eek!  She stopped bumming cigarettes off him.</p>

<p>After basically everyone had left, Ma, Jon and I Walked up the hill and came across a family
from Ma's church.  They had a big dog who greeted me and accepted by half cob of fully eaten corn.
I was afraid he might choke (big dog), but the owner eventually recovered it.</p>

<p>&quot;I assume you don't want this any more.&quot;</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p>Came back to my cabin, nearly clogged the toilet (not with TP), met Sean Briscoe who used to
live on Guam, and now about to head to the other cabins.</p>
