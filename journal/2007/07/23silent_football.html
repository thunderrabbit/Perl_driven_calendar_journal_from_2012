<p>After a fun game of skipping the nerf football thing on the tarp, I gave the Japanese magazines
to Ashley and Jackie, and watched as they reacted to the images.  I'm glad that overall they agreed
there were definitely some differences.  I want the differences to be geographically based, not
chronologically based.</p>

<p>Cassie invited me to Mr Dictate a game of Silent Football.  What I'm realizing now: we should
have had a stenographer.</p>

<p>The game started off strong, spilled many bottles of beer, especially in two particular points
of the circle, then reformed with just five people, including one 2-way-wormhole and 1 black hole.</p>

<p>I was starting to fall asleep and a couple of them headed off to smoke, so I think we're done.</p>
