<p>Today I sent my SWUUSI registration again.  It seems that the first one I sent to Dr Cutie (with
X-rays as cover) has not made it yet.  So I asked Ami to print the forms *again*, and made
envelopes, and sent it again, with no cover this time.</p>

Francois and his trainer are coming to Texas in July!  We..., I mean
they, are going to surprise my dad, my mom, Maggie, and hopefully my
brother (but there have been some issues ... primarily, he'll be out
of town for a week starting the day I arrive.)

Marcel and Molly know, and they are setting up plans with Maggie that,
as far as Maggie knows, do not involve me.

If I am blessed with a way to get to Colorado, I'll let you know.  In
any case, I always keep you in my heart, and I am always thankful for
the open invitation.

Please keep this information in your heart, and off the public
internet.  I've told very few people.  :-)

  Love Love
   - Rob!
