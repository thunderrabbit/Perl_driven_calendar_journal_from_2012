<p class="date">10:00pm JST Monday 16 July 2007 (day 13627)</p>

<p>Wonderful day with Ami, featuring food and frisbee and various other outdoor activities with her
mates via work or something.  I spent a lot of time chatting with Mark from Melbourne.  He and Yoko
arrived a bit late, but overall most of my time was spent chatting with him. </p>

<p>It's actually 3:50am as I write this.  I can just barely think enough to get details.</p>

<p>Chatted with Misa a bit, and played the paddle ball game (semi-non-bouncy ball and heavy
raquets) in the big field.  Also played the ball game with Gemma, and chatted with her about work.
She's a recruiter, but not for my industry.</p>

<p>Really happy to get closer to Ami by chillin' with her peeps.</p>
