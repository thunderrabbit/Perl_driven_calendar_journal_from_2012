<p class="dream">In a coffee shop that was actually a tea cafe, where we were literally not allowed
to do anything for ourselves except lift the cups to our mouths and drink and swallow.  We were not
even allowed to put the cups down.  There were trained cup handlers who would gently lower the cups
to the trays after we had finished drinking.</p>
