Super long sleep last night - like 10 hours or so.

The apartment for which I applied has a loft with a folding ladder as
its entryway. I've always wanted a loft for climbing/sleeping
purposes, so that should be pretty cool.

I had a weird dream, but I don't remember it now.

Ami was invaluable yesterday in helping me get the apartment hookup,
but for a while, I felt fear like <em>holy shit what am I doing
here?!?</em> where here = Japan and a 2 year financial obligation when
I'm trying to change jobs??

Afterward I asked Ami,"what just happened?" and she said we've only
applied for the apartment; they will let us know if they accept, and
return the deposit if not.

I did a little meditative prayer to my angels to put the optimal spin
on that decision.

Later that (last) night, Ami was telling me that I just needed to have
any job for now, an I noticed a bit of an edge on her voice. Ah, cool-
the closest we've come to a fight.

After meditating and collecting ideas on how to move into my new apartment, I painted green for
about an hour, but forgot to record it on the edge of the painting.

Headed to work now.

At i-group I came to understand a likely reason I was having trouble wanting a two year apartment
lease: I don't really want to stay in Japan.

How about them apples?

Over ramen I told Ami, and she told me why she can't go now-- basically a contract with work.

I am pleased with her overall response. She cried, said she would like to go, but couldn't, and
explained why, even though not many people know the reason, and then was like, well if you go, it
will give me a chance to visit China.

No whining; no pleading; just solid with clean emotions.

Nice.
