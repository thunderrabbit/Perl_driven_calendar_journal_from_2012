<p>As the class was ending, I stood lurkingly outside in the hall until all (four) students filed
out.</p>

<p>I didn't make an effort to sneak up on him nor anything like that.  Just, &quot;HI Dad!&quot;</p>

<p>Big great smile; so great to hug and reconnect.</p>

<p>Listened to him and his fellow professor talk about the students they've got.  Basically it
sounds like they have a lot of students who don't want to work.  Hmmm; that's the same problem I
complain about at EV.</p>

<p>Anyway, random chatter about stuff and things on the way home, with some detailed questions about
Ami and my compatibility, until I was like, &quot;we've just been dating 2 months; it just happens
that she's coming to visit during my visit.&quot; Then a stop at the new huge Kroger in Tomball.  It
was the biggest in Kroger history until one with a few extra square feet took over in Dallas.</p>

<p>Briefly showed him Maggie's Marble Track, which I was happy to see has survived almost perfectly
intact, and then hit the internet a bit as he had to head to bed.  He's gotta be up at 4:30am,
basically to take care of all the animals.</p>
