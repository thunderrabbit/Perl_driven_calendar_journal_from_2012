<p>Super special thanks to Maggie for storing my journals for these 5 years.</p>

<p>Super d'oh! to me for one little situation: no Volume One.</p>

<p>At one point I had given it to Molly for transcription purposes, but I don't know where it is
now.  Molly looked on her shelves today and didn't find it.</p>

<p>Brandt, who I met on the 49th voyage of PB, has
started <a href="http://strayform.com/">strayform.com</a>, a way for artists to connect closely
with fans.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of doing an art project of photographing and hosting all the pages of my journals.
I'd optimally like to get Volume One in on the action, but しょがない、ね。</p>
