<p>Had a smaller game than I sortof expected, but I guess that's sortof to be expected, given that
we started to late..  like 1am or more.</p>

<p>Core players were The Bloody Ninja, (*), Hi Gene Are You Blue Gene, Padre Donut En Mis
Pantalones, (*), Mr Dobolina Mr Bob Dobolina, (*), and Mr Dictator.</p>

<p>The (*) represent Mental Floss, Mr Cellphone, and Yort The Fuckin' Terrorist, who played for not
the whole game.  Also, Miss Playa Hata made a brief appearance, but seemed to have forgotten all
the rules.</p>

<p>During the game, I was hella tired, which caused much slurring of words, forgetting of names and crimes,
and even misuse of words...  like I said something like, &quot;Mr Dobolina Mr Bob Dobolina has legs
and therefore must use his hat...&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Dobolina Mr Bob Dobolina said &quot;it&quot; when referring to a mental thread he pulled out
of his head, but then explained that It was the name of the mental thread, and stood for
Intellectual Thread.</p>

<p>In the end, The Bloody Ninja lost, and got to choose between not smoking, and streaking through
closing circle tomorrow (with no explanation (at least not tomorrow)).  He chose streaking, and said
&quot;maybe I'll quit smoking.&quot;</p>
