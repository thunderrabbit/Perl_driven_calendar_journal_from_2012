<p>Going to lunch with a friend of Ami's, after we visit a bookstore to look for some panda
magazines to send to Maggie, who I think will be interested in the fashion.</p>

<p>We got Maggie's Marble Track all boxed up last night, though I didn't take photos.  I came upon
the idea of using PET bottles to fill the space between the boxes, and I was even smart enough to
squish some of the air out of the bottles so when they expand during their journey PAR AVION, they
won't put too much pressure on the inner box.</p>

<p>I'm a genius!</p>
