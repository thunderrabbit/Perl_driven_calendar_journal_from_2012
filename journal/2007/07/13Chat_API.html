<p>This chat stuff is pretty far over my head.  Not sure if we'll need to bring in some other cat
to hook it up or what.</p>


<p>From <a href="http://wiki.lingr.com/dev/show/API+More+Tutorial">lingr API tutorial</a>:</p>

<pre>
This call blocks until some event occurs in the chatroom, or until the maximum observation wait time
passes.

Because this call blocks, we probably want to spin off a separate thread to do our observation, but
the details are up to you.

Also, because the call might block as long as the maximum observation wait time, it's important to
set your socket timeouts accordingly, so that your client doesn't close the socket prematurely.
</pre>

<p>Uh, yeah...  I basically know what sockets are, but... let's just say I know about as much about
them as Francois does.</p>
