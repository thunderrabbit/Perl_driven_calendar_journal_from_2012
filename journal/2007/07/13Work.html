<p>Work was basically agonizing today.  Not just because I was winding down my final hours, but
because I was winding down my final hours with many students I had never met before, and many
students who hadn't prepared anything before class.</p>

completely as I had asked her to, and we chatted about random stuff, and I got a picture of
Francois staring at her おパイ。</p>

<p>コラ！</p>
