<p>Met Ami, Yoko, and Naoko at Satoshi's bar (aka the bar with no name) for an orange juice and
several minutes of listening to them yammer in Japanese.</p>

<p>Dropped of Yoko into a taxi on 246, then Naoko at Yamanote Line, and then I played with Ami a
bit by not leaving her, even though I pretended to.  First I went down the stairs to my platform,
but then ran up the escalator, much to her entertainment.</p>

<p>I pretended to do it again, but she was watching, so I wondered for a bit how to go one step
better.  I ran to the other exit of my train line, and up to her line and waited for her to get
there.  I snuck up behind her and was like, &quot;¤ï¤Ã¡£&quot; when I got close.  She was happily
shocked and entertained.</p>

<p>Then when she went through the ticket gates to the Toyoko Line, I waited for her to get to the
train, and then came through the gates to give her some more kisses at the actual train.</p>

<p>Then, as the train was about to leave, I walked away, but then got onto the train at each door I
passed, but each time she was smilingly watching for any such Antics.</p>

<p>Then I called her as I was exiting through the ticket office, pretending to not know where my
correct line was.</p>

<p>Fun times; fun times.</p>
