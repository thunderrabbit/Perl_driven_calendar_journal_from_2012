<p>janette's house features Josephine, Reenie and her husband.  I know the first two.  josephine
noted, &quot;you're not in Japan!&quot;<p>

<p>janette is in Albuquerque, right about now and for the next 10 days.</p>

<p>Josephine was like, &quot;see you in ten days!&quot;</p>

<p>I was like, &quot;aight, I'll be back in 10 days.  or 12 or so.  Secret...  don't tell janette!&quot;</p>

<p>For <em>some</em> reason, I kept saying Suzanne.. ????</p>
