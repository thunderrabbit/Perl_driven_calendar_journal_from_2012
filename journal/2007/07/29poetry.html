<pre>
I acknowledge this check is late
I can tell by checking the date
in terms of a makeup
poetry I will takeup
and leave the rest to fate

The little boy in me
plays often joyfully
sometimes regretfully
he gets the best of me

I have an addiction I see
I am attached to my PC
I keep myself from thoughtfully
handling business with integrity

I thought I had all my shit straight
My excuse is &quot;I live out of state
in a far away land
known as Japan&quot;
but the data is clear: my check is late

My makeup, I hope you'll accept
At poetry, I'm not so adept
My choices affect me
and also affect thee
integrity means agreements kept
</pre>
