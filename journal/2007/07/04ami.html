<p>Ami came over again today, too sick to go to work, but not to sick to help me get sick, not that
I think I will actually get sick.</p>

<p class="date">1:08pm JST Wednesday 4 July 2007 (day 13615)</p>

<p>Because it's Wednesday, I don't work until 5pm.  But because I just got a call from Mai at work
saying my first student cancelled, I don't have to work until 6:20pm.  Nice.</p>

<p>Lots of talking, kissing, sleeping.  Headed to work now.</p>
