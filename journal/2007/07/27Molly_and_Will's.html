<p>Anna seemed quite pleased to see me again, and I am certainly glad for the chance to chillax
with Molly and Will.  Anna gave me a makeover and then wanted to play some sort of stuffed animal
collection game, but I was just too tired to get up.  I was like, &quot;after I sleep&quot; and
&quot;can I sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>She was generally bossy, but Molly pointed out that Anna is just mimicking how Molly speaks;
Anna doesn't realize there's a hierarchy.</p>
