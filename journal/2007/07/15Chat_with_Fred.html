<p>Talkin' with Mr Fred right about now.  He's workin' on his big ol' project (which requires ~
terabyte of RAM) for modeling some sort of fluid flow through a reinforced fiberous tubes (aka the
arteries in yo brain, boiyyyy).</p>

<p>He's going to do his presentation in Cali next week: heading out to work for a weekend (and
ignore his friends) then do presentation, then hang out with his friends for a weekend.</p>

<p>I told him about Maggie's Marble Track being packed, and briefly introduced Ami, though she was
being shy for some reason.</p>

<p>We mostly talked about random nonsense relating to computers, video, girlfriends, and
over-friendly girls.</p>

<p>After we hung up, I turned to Ami and quoted Fred.  &quot;Yeah; he has no idea.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm wondering if it's better to meet him before or after his trip to Cali.  I can definitely
wait until he gets back, but I hope he secret can be maintained that long, especially considering
I'm going to SWUUSI.</p>
