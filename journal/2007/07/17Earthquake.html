<p>This is just to say I'm fine after The Earthquake.  I literally didn't even notice it.</p>

<p>No one here has talked about it, but I've gotten two emails from the US.</p>

    did you get earthquaked?  i heard about it all day on the news and thought that i should check in......

    hope all is well

I heard about it too, but I slept through it.

Are you going to SWUUSI?  It's coming soon, right?

<p>Wow.  I just looked it up; that was a pretty decent earthquake!  It was on the other side of this
little island from Tokyo, but had it been *in* Tokyo, I wonder if it woulda been considered The Big
One for which we've been waiting years.</p>
