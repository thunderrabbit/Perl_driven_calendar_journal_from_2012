<p>I just tossed a lot of the crizzle that was in my fizzle bizzle.  Took some pizzles too.</p>

<p>And I want to transcribe some of the writings I did during freshman composition in college.
I found myself laughing at one of them, and the others seem equally interesting; my writing now
hasn't really improved since then!  (eek?)</p>
