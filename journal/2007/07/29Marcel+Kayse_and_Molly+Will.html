<p>Great fun seeing Marcel and Kayse plus Molly and Will and all the chillins of both pairs!</p>

<p>Marcel and I scoped some of my pics from Japan; we could easily have spent hours, but the six+two
youngins have a way of requiring attention.</p>

<p>Marcel, Adrien, and I enjoyed a lovely burping contest during lunch.</p>

<p>The kids enjoyed the stairs as a playground, and Maggie's Marble Track as a toy (not on the
stairs).  It sustained only minor damage (to both switches).  Repairing them will be a trick, but I
think I can do it.</p>

<p>Adrien got a bit of an allergic reaction after foodage.  Perhaps he's allergic to burping
contests..</p>

<p>I got to hold their littlest one: Rebekah, only a month old or so.  At first I was like, &quot;eeeek!&quot;</p>

<p>Marcel got to hold Francois.  He was less squeamish.</p>
