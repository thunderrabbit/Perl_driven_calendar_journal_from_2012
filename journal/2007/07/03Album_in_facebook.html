<p>I've grown to like /
trust <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=816205715">Facebook</a> enough to put some
pictures there, and put a bit of care into the content on the site. (*)</p>

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=31616&l=6a715&id=816205715">funny pics around town</a>

<p>(*) this is quite a feat; for 10+ years I've adamantly kept all my shizzle under my contrizzle.
Congrats to the facebook team for making a quality product.</p>
