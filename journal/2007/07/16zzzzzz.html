<p>Tonight the main thing I've done is sent Tariq's computer to him so I don't have to move it.
I'm going pretty hella slow in the packing department, but I'm basically done (it seems), so I'm
semi ignoring the details that still remain.</p>

<p>They may blossom into more than I expect, so I hope to get started soon.  But first: sleeping.</p>
