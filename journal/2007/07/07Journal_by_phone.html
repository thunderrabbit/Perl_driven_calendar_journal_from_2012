Fucking hell, people. Do some homework; stop wasting your time and my brain.

last 2 lessons are preceded by 40 minute breaks, so it feels like
wasted time;  I want to go to Apple store to get my machine fixed.

just went to bookstore with Mao, who "wanted to go to Italy," but had
no plan.  I got her a Metropolis magazine so she could get connected
with an Italian exchange student. "I'm gonna solve all her issues," I
imagined to myself.

Mari now; no Chika.

Chika came about 15 minutes late; Mari chose not to berate her.

snooze, then lesson with a guy named Taka who may end up taking
private lessons with me, then a bit of a break while my last student
Kanako was late.  I was quite happy to check the word problems she had
written for her class,though chose not to stay late so I could meet
Ami sooner.

Ironically, Ami can't meet yet, so I will go to Apple Store to get
them to look at my Mac, which had a heart attack.
