<p>After seeing the first few people who's names I shoulda known (Karen R-M, Laura Andrews), the names started flooding back
as I met people whose named I couldn't forget (Scottie, Fricke, Adam, Jackie, Phat Pat, Lilly,
Ashley.fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff</p>

<p>Several of us went swimmingffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffddd]</p>

<p>I'm so tired that my index fingers can't stay awake (lffffffffffffffffffffffff).  </p>

<p>Okay.  I've slept.</p>

<p>We went swimming in some water accessible by a non-lighted path.  The steep slop into the water
continues, giving a narrow band of rocks on which we can stand before having to tread water.
Cassie tried to dive gracefully from a tall rock, but only after some tried was she able to get her
entire body out of the water (those pesky feet always seemed to lag behind).</p>

<p>I'm impressed by Frank Rosler having been in charge of YA SWUUSI for the past 5 years.  That's
pretty tight.  This is the type of leadership opportunity that I need to begin making for myself, I
believe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Colleenie Beanie has not registered for SWUUSI, so she won't likely get to meet
Francois, unless she comes up from Corpus.</p>

<p>The community has warmly welcomed me in, even though officially I am too old for YA.  I wonder if
anyone will be like, &quot;blah blah blah&quot; and try to get me out of the YA group.</p>

<p>This campground seems cooler than the spread out campground at which SWUUSI has been held for
many years.  I'm sure it's smaller, though I'm not sure how much smaller.  It seems more pristine to
me.</p>

<p>As a group, YA members over age 21 are refusing to wear the red wristbands that associate us with
the adult program.  Basically, we are YA, not a segmented group.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.  I just realized that I signed up for some workshops in the adult program.  I wonder if
I'll attend them.</p>

<p>Good playing a quick game of silent football, especially seeing Aaron Ryan's hilarious facial
expressions as he joined a formerly 3 person game which featued a wormhole between Mr Anthony and
Mr Dobolina Mr Bob Dobolina.</p>
