<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm in the United States, specifically at Molly and Will's house, just after having gone to
SWUUSI, before which I surprised my Dad, Maggie, Dude, and Ma, in four separate events.</p></li>

<li><p>This is the first time I've been back to Texas in 4.25 years.</p></li>

<li><p>So far, I haven't seen Fred nor janette; I hope I can surprise each of them with my
appearance in Texas; this whole set of surprises was ultimately precipitated by his surprising me in
Narita with janette back in like February 2004, I think.</p></li>

<li><p>During SWUUSI, I was able to stay pretty in-touch with Ami each morning, as she was
finishing work late at night.  I'm quite looking forward to her visit and meeting all my peeps here
in Tejas.</p></li>

<li><p>Now we've got a girl band in here with Anna on keyboard and guitar, and Rachel on drum.
Such a creative cacauphony!</p></li>

<li><p>Today and tomorrow or so, I will be going to Maggie's to go through the boxes that she's
been holding for these 5 years.  (she had them before I went to janette's in Dallas for 6 months.)</p></li>

<li><p>I will be in Texas until 15 August, and when I go back to Tokyo, I'll be in a new small
apartment near Ami's house, and it will be job searchin' time.</p></li>

<li><p>My finances are happy, especially considering I haven't / won't have a job for a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Ami is my girlfriend, and I'm happily skyping with her now.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet access is currently &quot;sporadic,&quot; as I'm bouncing between houses and
friends, but most of my peeps have solid internet access.</p></li>

</ol>
