<p>On this  inflight map,  we are  in sight  of California.  Flying  at 37,000  feet (though  we had
started at the planned 35,000 feet (except for starting  at closer to 0 feet) where there was a lot of
turbulence for a  bit, so I imagine that's  why we headed 1/2 a  mile higher), we are 3  hours and 35
minutes from  Dallas.  Next time I think  I'll fly to Los  Angeles instead of Dallas,  see Sally and
then head  to Houston on  Southwest.  That would  probably be cheaper overall,  plus I'd get  to see
Sally!  *Plus*, the first leg of the flight would be nearly over.</p>

<p>Right now it's 5:32am in Dallas.  I'm gonna switch my computer clock now.  I've
been <strike>working</strike> sleeping on fixing my internal clock for most of the flight.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>Wait, what???  How did I get to be a day older, though the date still says 18th?</p>

<p>Okay, I just checked, and it should be 13629.  Hmmm.</p>
