<p>Well, howdy.  I'm in Texas.</p>

<p>I'm eatin' a burrito, drinkin' a Coors (*), and watchin' the football game on the TV (**).</p>

<p>(*) Coors = Dole orange juice</p>

<p>(**) not watching</p>

<p>But I *did* take a picture of Francois on a wrought iron rack with Texas shaped boxes and TEXAS
written at the top.</p>

<p>*AND* I'm quite intrigued with the concept of being able to understand what people are saying
around me.</p>

<p>But I'm not really listening to them.</p>

<p>I've noticed how much people don't do for me here.  I had to get my own tray thing when going
through security.  We all had to get our own luggage from our flight and re-check it to our
corresponding next flight.</p>

<p>(( During this process, I noticed a bit of crushing on the corners of Maggie's Marble Track's
box's box, but just took it gently to the next location and let it go. ))</p>

<p>I'm very happy that I've not come across a single smoking area since I've arrived.  But perhaps
that's true even in Narita airport.</p>

<p>Dang; this mild sauce is hot.</p>

<p>...and tipping.  Wow.  I sure have not missed having to tip.</p>
