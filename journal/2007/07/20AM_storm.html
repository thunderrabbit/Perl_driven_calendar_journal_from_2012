<p>Apparently, it's been raining every day for about a month, which actually is pretty unusual for
this time of year in Houston.  I just got woken up by a rather strikingly loud thunder strike,
and.. man, I wish Ami were here to see this.  It's not the hardest rain I've ever seen, but *this*
is rain.</p>

<p>This normal summer storm (only abnormal in the recent frequency, not intensity) is raining harder
and producing more lightning than *any* storm I've seen in 4.25 years in Tokyo.  This is why I have
no respect for what Japanese call &quot;rain&quot; in Tokyo as I walk around without my umbrella,
assuring them, &quot;no, actually, it's *not* raining.&quot;</p>
