<p>Been at Maggie's house for a while, half talking, half discovering what I archived, half on my
computer, and half snacking on bananas, cereal, and ice cream.</p>

<p>Things I've found include maps of Astroworld (which no longer exists) and lots of CDs, some of
which I'm importing to my Amazon S3 iTunes library.</p>

<p>This is after we scoped The Simpsons Movie, which we all found to be pretty funny.  Maggie
especially liked how they did stair stepped jokes, like the boob woman's boobs, then her using the
boobs to point, then the visual of their huge shadow for Homer to see.</p>
