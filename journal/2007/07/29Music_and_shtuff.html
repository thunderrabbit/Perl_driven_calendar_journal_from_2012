<p>Today I've been recreating my iTunes music library index; all the files are nice stored on Amazon
S3, but the index is stored locally, so it's having to go through all the songs to determine gapless
playback information.  That's 4 gigs it's downloading.  Ack.  But ah well..  It's just the small
cost of living in the future. (I guess)</p>
