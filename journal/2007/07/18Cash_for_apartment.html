<p>Just gave Ami 70,000 yen so she can pay for my apartment, after exchanging enough yen to get $400
US currency.</p>

<p>The bills are colorful and pretty now.  I rather like them.  Haven't taken time to look
carefully, but I'm *pretty* sure these 10s are different than tens when I was last here.  Yeah;
definitely.  I sure don't remember seeing &quot;We the People&quot; on them.</p>
