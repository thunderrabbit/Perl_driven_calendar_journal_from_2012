<p>Just watched <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">Zeitgeist</a> with Dude; it took 4 hours with
all the commentary and checking done on various facts cited in the movie.  I believe he called it
very right wing libertarian.  He agreed with lots of the statements, but not all of the subsequent
conclusions drawn from those.</p>
