<p>Determined last night that we can create chatforest.com using GPL licensed software (Joomla is
one) and not be required to release the source if we make any modifications to the code.  I don't
know if Tariq would be down with open sourcing our project.</p>

<p>The answer is in the <a href="http://dev.joomla.org/content/view/2336/102/">Joomla! licensing
FAQ</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>
