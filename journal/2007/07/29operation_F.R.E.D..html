yo main

do you think you can get in touch with Nathalie and have her in on the surprise of me shockin' Fred?

If you ain't sho, please don't be too risky about it.

Basically my mom is coming to IAH to pick up Ami on Thursday around 6pm.  Then we'll eat and then
zoom back to Austin, for about a 10pm arrival.

If it can be arranged that Nathalie goes to Fred's house at that time, perhaps I can surprizzle him
while he is distrazzled by Nathalie.
