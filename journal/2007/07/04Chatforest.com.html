<p>Been reading reading reading reading about different Content Management Services.  Mostly
looking at Joomla, and Drupal.  Had Plone on the list, but it got struck recently.  Theoretically I
would like to use the most powerful system (Plone), but the example websites I saw (linked from an
article comparing the three) the Plone sites were the worst.  Now, to be fair, I should visit
Plone's site to see what sites *they* feature as Powered by Plone.</p>

<p>Okay, so I did that, and I notice very few of the Web 2.0 interface things that I want to use.
Not going to use Plone.</p>
