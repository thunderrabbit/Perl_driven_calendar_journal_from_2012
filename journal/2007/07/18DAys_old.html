<p class="date">5:38am CDT Wednesday 18 July 2007 (day 13630)</p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to switch my timezone back and see what happens.</p>

<p class="date">5:41am CDT Wednesday 18 July 2007 (day 13630)</p>

<p class="date">7:41pm JST Wednesday 18 July 2007 (day 13629)</p>

<p>Okay, I think I've found the problem, but I have no idea how I came to write the code this
way.</p>

<pre>
  (concat " (day " (number-to-string (- (time-to-days (current-time)) (time-to-days '(109 0 0)))) ")")
</pre>

<p>I'm sure the problem is with the value '(109 0 0) given to the function time-to-days.</p>

<p>Emacs' documentation says:</p>

<pre>
time-to-days is a compiled Lisp function in `time-date.el'.
(time-to-days time)

The number of days between the Gregorian date 0001-12-31bce and time.
time should be a time value.
The Gregorian date Sunday, December 31, 1bce is imaginary.
</pre>

<p>I checked time-date.el and I think we're getting somewhere.</p>

<pre>
;;;###autoload
(defun time-to-days (time)
  "The number of days between the Gregorian date 0001-12-31bce and TIME.
TIME should be a time value.
The Gregorian date Sunday, December 31, 1bce is imaginary."
  (let* ((tim (decode-time time))
	 (day (nth 3 tim))
	 (year (nth 5 tim)))
    (+ (time-to-day-in-year time)	; 	Days this year
       (* 365 (1- year))		;	+ Days in prior years
       (/ (1- year) 4)			;	+ Julian leap years
       (- (/ (1- year) 100))		;	- century years
       (/ (1- year) 400))))		;	+ Gregorian leap years
</pre>

<p>decode-time should give the answer.</p>

<p>Holy crap.  How is the function working at all?</p>

<pre>
decode-time is a built-in function in `C source code'.
(decode-time &optional specified-time)

Decode a time value as (SEC MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR DOW DST ZONE).
The optional specified-time should be a list of (HIGH LOW . IGNORED),
as from `current-time' and `file-attributes', or nil to use the
current time.  The obsolete form (HIGH . LOW) is also still accepted.
The list has the following nine members: SEC is an integer between 0
and 60; SEC is 60 for a leap second, which only some operating systems
support.  MINUTE is an integer between 0 and 59.  HOUR is an integer
between 0 and 23.  DAY is an integer between 1 and 31.  MONTH is an
integer between 1 and 12.  YEAR is an integer indicating the
four-digit year.  DOW is the day of week, an integer between 0 and 6,
where 0 is Sunday.  DST is t if daylight saving time is in effect,
otherwise nil.  ZONE is an integer indicating the number of seconds
east of Greenwich.  (Note that Common Lisp has different meanings for
DOW and ZONE.)
</pre>

<p>I've only given it 3 parameters but it wants <em>nine</em>!</p>

<p>Oh......</p>

<pre>
current-time is a built-in function in `C source code'.
(current-time)

Return the current time, as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00.
The time is returned as a list of three integers.  The first has the
most significant 16 bits of the seconds, while the second has the
least significant 16 bits.  The third integer gives the microsecond
count.

The microsecond count is zero on systems that do not provide
resolution finer than a second.
</pre>

<p>I imagine 109 is the number of days from 1970-01-01 to my um.. ahem.</p>

<p>Nope.  Not even close.  Hmmmmm!</p>

<p>Okay, I'm just going to ignore the 109 for now and put in the values I think should be there.</p>

<p>OOOOhhhhhhh wait wait wait wait</p>

<pre>
Decode a time value as (SEC MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR DOW DST ZONE).
</pre>

<p>This means the *output* is as above.  What is a 'time value' of (109 0 0) ???</p>

<p>But first, check the usage of the output of the function above.</p>

<p>Well, I'm not even using the output; just feeding two such outputs to the function -.</p>

<p>Okay, *now* we're getting somewhere:</p>

<pre>
;; Time values come in three formats.  The oldest format is a cons
;; cell of the form (HIGH . LOW).  This format is obsolete, but still
;; supported.  The two other formats are the lists (HIGH LOW) and
;; (HIGH LOW MICRO).  The first two formats specify HIGH * 2^16 + LOW
;; seconds; the third format specifies HIGH * 2^16 + LOW + MICRO /
;; 1000000 seconds.  We should have 0 &lt;= MICRO &lt; 1000000 and 0 &lt;= LOW
;; &lt; 2^16.  If the time value represents a point in time, then HIGH is
;; nonnegative.  If the time value is a time difference, then HIGH can
;; be negative as well.  The macro `with-decoded-time-value' and the
;; function `encode-time-value' make it easier to deal with these
;; three formats.  See `time-subtract' for an example of how to use
;; them.
</pre>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p>Okay, 109 appears to be the number of multiples of 2^16 seconds from 1970 Jan 1 to my birthday,
+/- 1 day, which in this case is significant.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>bah; fuck; I'm tired of this.</p>

<p>I'm gonna watch the latter 2/3rds of Bourne Identity again.</p>

<p class="date">11:29am CDT Wednesday 18 July 2007 (day 13630)</p>

<p>I tried working on it for another hour, but still didn't make any headway.</p>
