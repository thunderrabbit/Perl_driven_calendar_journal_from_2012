<p>First lesson was with Yumiko the veterinarian.  Lessons with her have always been fun, and
usually educational; she often practices giving veterinary lectures during our lessons, so I've
learned about several surgical orthopedic procedures on various parts of various animals.  This time
she gave me Tim Tams, and described the whirlwind weekend in Brisbane she had with 20 other vets
from <strike>around the world</strike> Europe.</p>

<p>She seemed well-impressed with Marble Track 2; she said it was very well made.  Definitely happy
to hear that.</p>

<p>Just finished a sleep-inducing lesson with Miyoko.  She's happy to just read read read read
during our lessons, but basically I am relegated to meaningless listening.  She acknowledges only
about 1/2 the corrections I make (and remembers about 1/10th of them later), which has led me to
correct only about 1/3 of the mistakes she makes.</p>

Now I'm waiting for Nozomi to arrive.</p>

<p>She was 18 minutes late, and we went 3 minutes over.</p>

<p>Just told Akami, Tsunashima, and them that we should take pictures tomorrow, given that it will
likely be my last day there.</p>

<p>Tatsuya's wife has a lesson scheduled for right after mine, but she's just now leaving BIC
Camera (and will therefore be about 10 minutes late, minimum).</p>

<p>This is likely the last time I'll see Tatsuya in a while, but we will likely remain in contact
via internet.</p>

<p>After the lesson with Kazue, which consisted of random questions, I had my likely last lesson
with Tomomi, during which we played Truth or Dare.</p>

<p>I thought of a funny dare: &quot;give me 10,000 yen.&quot;</p>

<p>I dared her to tell me the worstest naughtiest words she knows in Japanese.  She claimed she
knew of none, but then after a while realized there are some, which basically amount to racist
slurs or slurs against people with physical disabilities.</p>

<p>I was surprised they have one against blind people.</p>

<p>Next and last lesson today is with Akiko, our bestest speaking student.  She's really funny
because she squirms if I challenge her to say rude words in Japanese.  She won't even write, much
less speak the equivalent for sperm.</p>

<p>Haha; was I ever right.  Akiko is so cute when she squirms!</p>
