<p>Okay; it seems I've hit the limits of what I can realistically do with Flash without reading some
sort of tutorial on the topic du jour.  Specifically, I've been hella stuck by this problem of
trying to create an object with movieClips in it; they seem to vanish, or otherwise not be
accessible after the actual constructor is finished.</p>

<p>I found a tutorial online that seems to cover this topic fully.</p>

<p>The tute was good, but it was for version 1.  I found
an <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/developer/oop2/AS2OOPindex.htm">Actionscript 2 OOP guide</a>,
which isn't as long, but still points out the necessary points.</p>
