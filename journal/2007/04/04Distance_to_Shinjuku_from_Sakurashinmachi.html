<p>Not having internet access means I don't have access to train schedules (my phone doesn't have a
way to check train schedules either).  So here is my estimate for how long it will take to get to
Shinjuku from here:</p>

<pre>
start: __:__  walk to the station, 7 minutes
train: __:__  Sakurashinmachi -&gt; Shibuya, 9 minutes
arrive __:__  walk to Yamanote Line, 3 minutes
train: __:__  Shibuya -&gt; Shinjuku, ___ minutes
arrive __:__  walk to Tower Records, 4 minutes or 6 minutes
arrive __:__  Tower Records
</pre>

<p>The main problem is not knowing how long it will take from Shibuya to Shinjuku.  The stations in
between are: Harajuku, Yoyogi, and that's it I think.</p>

<p>Wait!  I have a map!</p>

<p class="date">10:38am JST</p>

<p>Yes.  Just those two stations on Yamanote between Shibuya and Shinjuku.  At an average of 3
minutes per station that's just 9 minutes to Shinjuku.</p>

<pre>
start: 12:56  walk to the station, 7 minutes
train: 13:04  Sakurashinmachi -&gt; Shibuya, 9 minutes
arrive 13:13  walk to Yamanote Line, 3 minutes
train: 13:16  Shibuya -&gt; Shinjuku, 9 minutes
arrive 13:25  walk to Tower Records, 4 minutes or 6 minutes
arrive 13:30  Tower Records
</pre>

<p>However, I know there is *not* a train from Sakurashinmachi at 13:04.  There is one 5 minutes
before that at 12:59.</p>

<pre>
start: 12:52  walk to the station, 7 minutes
train: 12:59  Sakurashinmachi -&gt; Shibuya, 9 minutes
arrive 13:08  walk to Yamanote Line, 3 minutes
train: 13:11  Shibuya -&gt; Shinjuku, 9 minutes
arrive 13:20  walk to Tower Records, 4 minutes or 6 minutes
arrive 13:25  Tower Records
</pre>

<p>I *don't* know if there is a Yamanote train at 13:11 in Shibuya.  There's about a 20% chance
there is, as I believe there are trains on that line once every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>The only other detail is the distance from the Yamanote line platform to Tower Records.  I know
in my head where Tower Records is, only if I'm at the right end of the platform.  Otherwise, I'll
have to walk to the correct end of the platform.</p>

<p>But, I know it's at the New South Exit in Shinjuku, so I should be at the trailing end of the
train, as Shinjuku is north of Shibuya, so the last car headed that direction will arrive on the
south end of that platform.</p>

<p>So now I can trim one more minute off the end</p>

<pre>
start: 12:52  walk to the station, 7 minutes
train: 12:59  Sakurashinmachi -&gt; Shibuya, 9 minutes
arrive 13:08  walk to Yamanote Line, 3 minutes
train: 13:11  Shibuya -&gt; Shinjuku, 9 minutes
arrive 13:20  walk to Tower Records, 4 minutes
arrive 13:24  Tower Records
</pre>

<p>So if I leave at 12:52, I have a 20% chance of being 6 minutes early, 40% chance of being 5
minutes early, 60% chance of being 4 minutes early, 80% chance of being 3 minutes early, and 100%
chance of being 2 minutes early.</p>

<p>Unless I mucked up on an estimate.  But, I think it will be just fine.</p>

<p class="date">10:29pm JST Thursday  5 April 2007 (day 13525)</p>

<p>I was just fine.</p>
