<p>First lesson was with Chieko, a new student for me, though not a new student here.  She had just
had a bad experience at the Canadian embassy, at her interview to go back to Canadia and back to
school there.  I was thinking <em>yeah, government offices can suck</em>, but then I was utterly
shocked to hear that the interviewer was Japanese!!</p>

<p>うっっそう！</p>

<p>ほんっっとう！</p>

<p>That made the story unbelievable!</p>

<p>Random chat about internet past that, and I gave contact info; perhaps I should have kept to my
policy of not doing that on first meetings, but we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Now with Asakaze, who is doing homework, sorta.  He's 9, so I'm a bit unsure as to the best way
to teach him, but generally we do pretty well together, I think.</p>

<p>He likes to draw, and is rather creative in how he draws letters when he writes.  AsAkAzE, or
the like.</p>

<p>He's supposed to be writing a little introduction thing, and though I'm sure all the words are
there, I'm going to ask him to rewrite it in a non-artistic way.</p>
