<p class="date">11:35pm JST Sunday 15 April 2007 (day 13535)</p>

<p>Went to Tariq's house in Yokohama after ultimate tonight primarily to check out the character
creating of the Wii, and to have a nice chowing pizza dinner.</p>

<p>We also watched a bit of American Idol (gag), and some even dumber Japanese game show, where
guys dressed as Toy Story characters were being pummeled with volley balls at 70 km per hour, and
then later 100 km/hour and then 110, if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Basically the guy would be hit repeatedly with balls from various directions until he fell into
water.</p>

<p>Ice water.</p>

<p>He would invariably scramble out, in great pain from the balls and great shock from the ice
water, and then fortunately get to chill for a bit in a room temperature bath while being
interviewed about the experience as slow motions video of his face being knocked sideways were shown
picture in picture.</p>

<p>This is entertainment?</p>

<p>On first glance regarding the Wii, I thought I would enjoy using it, and some of the sports, but
I quickly (quickly) got bored and didn't even finish the warm up of any <em>any</em> of the games.
7 of 10 bowls, 20 of 50 hits in tennis, 3 or 4 hits in golf.</p>

<p>When we played a 3 person golf game, I did it from my seat; I couldn't be bothered to get up and
play.  Perhaps that's partially because I don't like real golf.  And that this wasn't real golf.  I
was like, &quot;what's the point?&quot;</p>
