<p class="dream">Doug had just arrived home, so everyone crowded around him to see how he was
doing.  I had been talking to Becky and Barbie, but everything was disrupted once Doug
came in on his motorcycle.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Rob, can you throw a disc one kilometer?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;I don't know.  How far is it to the other corner?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Which one?  The first one or the second one?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I was standing at one corner of a square bisected by a line.  &quot;The far
corner.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">No answer to my query, but I jumped way up to the ceilnig, hovered there like
Trinity, and tosses the idisc along the ceiling well pat the other corner, and onto aloft fromed by
the enclosure aroud the locker room.</p>

<p class="dream">I thought it was a decent rrepresentation of how far I could throw, given the
small room in which we were playing.</p>

<p class="dream">Finally estimated the length of the sides of the square at 10 meters, and with
squre root of two being 2.14 (*), I calculated I threw the disc the enttire 210 meters of the
diagonal, plus a bit past that, plus it was on top of the loft, so I guessed I could throw 300
meters.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;No, I can't throw one kilometer.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">There seemed to be a surprised murmur from the crowd.  &quot;Rob just said he
could't thwo it one kilometer.&quot;  &quot;wow, really?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">It was time to go, so I was getting ready, putting on new shoes over my bare
feet.</p>

<p class="dream">I was driving a scooter with Tomoyo on the back, and she asked if today was
Natalie's last day in Japan, and I was like, &quot;yeah, I think so,&quot; though I knew very well
it was not.  &quot;if you see her, tell her I want to fuck her like an animal&quot; I said,
referring to lyrics from 'closer,' which I assumed Tomoyo would not understand, and actually not
relay to Natalie, though if she did, I knew Natalie would just laugh it off.</p>

<p class="dream">I kept having to turn around for some reason, using a parking lot for space to
U-turn, and sometimes arcing into the street.</p>

<p class="dream">We saw some lights along the highway, all pointing up into the air, and some of
which were angling back and forth, which, after a bit, I saw was in a pattern that reflected off
the sky and back onto the ground, and actually made words.</p>

<p class="dream">was the first name I saw, with the h blinking on and off, and then I noticed some
arrows rolling in toward a landing pad, and a note, &quot;alien visitors, land here,&quot; all
written and drawn on a very large scale as to bee seen from 30,000 feet.  I noticed
&quot;nugen&quot; and commented to Fred, and he was like, &quot;yeah; that's mine.  I was the third
person to add a landing platform for space ships, and now everyone is doing it.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">3rd?  Hmmm.</p>
