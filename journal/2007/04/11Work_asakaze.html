<p>Asakaze was a bit wild today.  He's 9, so I pretty much don't expect him to stay focused the
entire time, so we goof around and play games and such on occassion.  Perhaps I should have been a
bit harder with him in the beginning, but in that case, he may have chosen not to come back to my
lessons, so it would be moot.  He's actually doing quite well.  He could spell words without
writing them down (raccoon, detective, grew, threw, spoon (etc)), though he sometimes had trouble
and had to retry several times.  (But when writing them, no worries.)</p>

<p>He refused to practice multiplication triangles</p>

<p>But he did ask for homework.  I gave him some vocab words to learn, but he was like, &quot;no
wayyyy&quot; and I was like, &quot;aight; don't learn to spell them, but just make sentences with
them,&quot; and he was like, &quot;no wayyyy&quot;  So it will be interesting to see with what he
comes back.</p>
