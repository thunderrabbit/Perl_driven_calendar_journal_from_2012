<p class="dream">Walked into the room, more like barged into the room and was like, &quot;when will
you guys be ready?&quot; and then realized they were all busy taking a test!  I knew them all well
enough to keep walking in even so; all the way up to the teacher administering the test (topic was
woodshop) and confirmed my hunch that they should be finished at 4:20, which happened to be in
exactly 2 minutes.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Why is the test so hard?&quot; I asked him  &quot;Our woodshop test was super
easy, like, &quot;should you wear safety goggles when using the chipper?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He laughed and was like, &quot;yeah; it's gotten harder.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Show me; show me,&quot; I reached for the test and flipped through it a
bit.  The questions were long like, &quot;Mr Flanson wants to build a carrot shaped roof over his
new shed.  The weather report suggests there will be a strong possibility of snow this year,
although normally the city receives only about 2 inches of snow per year.  Mr Flanson has a dog
named Rex who likes to dig up the neighbor's carrots.  The neighbor, Rudy Peale, has just installed
an electric fence around his carrot patch.  What is the optimal slope Mr Flanson should use for the
roof of his shed to allow the right amount of snow to slide off and entertain Rex enough that he
won't go get shocked on Peale's fence?  (Show your work)&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">The test was over by the time I finished reading the question, and the students
started handing in their papers and all giving me handshakes and thanking me for my help during the
year; some asked me if I would come to their party the next day or the next, and I was like,
&quot;I'd like to,&quot; and in all cases, I meant it.</p>

<p class="dream">I saw Miah (Cudhea), &quot;Brooke,&quot; the equivalent of Phat Pat, and countless others, all
very well known to me, but all without clear matches in waking life.</p>

<p class="dream">I stayed until the room was clearing out and then woke up</p>
