<p>In Japan, the equivalent of a checking account in the US gets about zilch for interest.  Like
0.0000000000005% interest. (Perhaps that's an exaggeration, but not by much)</p>

<p>Therefore, I find it useless to keep money in my account here, except that it's safe (?).</p>

<p>Therefore, instead of getting zero interest, I might as well get credit elsewhere, like with my
landlord.  So, while Michael was overseas for two months, I slowly shifted the payday from the
beginning of the month to the 10th of the previous month.  Cause the 10th is payday for me, and I'm
not going to get any more money (from EV) before rent is due, so I might as well pay it early.</p>

<p>Next month, however, I plan to just pay Michael early, and not pay the entire rent.  Or maybe he
can just not pay me this month, and I'll not pay next month at all.  That makes even more sense.
Whoohoo!</p>

<p>The goal is to send a shload of money back to my US account, so I can finish paying my credit
card ($600) and Ma and g ($3000).</p>
