<p>Except for Akiko and Mari and Chika, today has been a really long day at EV.</p>

<p>No one has been doing homework... just reading reading reading the book with little or no
comprehension, asking me the meaning of words instead of having looked them up for homework already.</p>

<p>I wanted to bite Akiko (in a good way), but I'm pretty sure that would be inappropriate.  She's
just so beautiful.</p>
