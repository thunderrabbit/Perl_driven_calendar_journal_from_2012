<p>Headed to a party for Pat's friends and students of 49th and 55th voyages.</p>

<p>(55th?  Maybe 56th; I've forgotten)</p>

<p class="date">2:00am JST</p>

<p>I was just about in bed, but I decided I have to write this.</p>

<p>At the party, I was a bit surprised to see Hitomi.  I hugged Natalie first for a bit of
emotional support, and then went over and hugged Hitomi and talked to her a bit.  It's the first
time we've communicated in months, much less actually seen each other.  She seemed fine and it was
all good.  I was glad to have a normal conversation with her.</p>

<p>Great to hug and chew on Natalie.  She danced salsa with Ippei, with whom she apparently hadn't
danced since PB 49th voyage (ended in summer 2005).  We determined that we need to hang out again
soon.  As if we will make the time.</p>

<p>Greatly enjoyed meeting Sanpo.  &quot;who???&quot;  &quot;いっぽ、にほ、さんぽ&quot;  Her wonderful
smile reminded me of home or something otherwise なつかしい.  I asked her to be my salsa partner
for the small salsa class Natalie led after her performance with いっぺい.  I just loved Sanpo's
smile.  I could easily melt into it.</p>

<p>I confirmed that Sanpo was going to the after party, and then wandered around a bit and talked
to Ippei and then Natalie a bit.  Ippei has a cool job of installing silicon chip manufacturing
machines.  Wow.  Definitely a sexy job.</p>

<p>Pictures with everyone from the 49th featured Francois of course.  I didn't get my camera out,
though, so I'll need to wait for copies to be emailed.</p>

<p>At the after party, I sat next to Sanpo, but mostly talked to Pat.  He told me that Kazzah may
be doing GU on the 58th (?) (congrats!) which will be her third voyage, if she does it.   Also got
a copy of 49th voyage CD from Pat.  Actually a DVD; I wonder if/when I'll get time to post it.  I
think for now I'll just throw it onto Amazon S3.  (next week when we get internet access here again)</p>

<p>Sanpo took the Tokyu Toyoko line home, so I went with her to Shibuya.  Gave her a hug at the
entrance to my old line.  Didn't exchange explicit contact deets with her, but I had given
her <a href="http://moonhares.robnugen.com">http://moonhares.robnugen.com</a> to find the vid
featuring Francois.  I think the link works.  I can't check it right now, and will probably forget
to check later.</p>

<p>What a great smile.  :-)</p>

<p>Okay, so there it is, in less that 15 mins.  Good night.</p>
