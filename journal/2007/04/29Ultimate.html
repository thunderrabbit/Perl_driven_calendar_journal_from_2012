<p>Great time with the ultimate kids today.  I wasn't at my Wonderboy best, but I did have a couple
of great catches.  One in particular was on a full run to catch a high throw going out the back and
just before I crossed the line, I like stopped up on tip toes and caught the disc.  People in the
sidelines cheered.  I reminded myself of Jolyon, who's basically the best player in our group.</p>

<p>I made a good block on one of Jolyon's discs; it was a high speedy throw.  Not sure how I did
it.</p>

<p>Three times I threw a difficult throw with the wind that I wanted to arc off the field and come
back for an endzone point.  It failed twice today, but worked on the third time.  (Or was it the
fourth?)</p>

<p>British Mike seemed to be in a bit of a bad mood as we were playing like crap at some points.  I
didn't always make the best throws in the world, nor get into the stack on offense, but hey, no
point in yelling.  I felt bad enough on myself after throwing crappily.  I really noticed the impact
of his words on my little brain.  Had to take note of what was happening and shrug it off.</p>

<p>During chill time on the sidelines, Brady told a farm animal joke, so I told Ed The Tree Planter
joke and Moe and Joe.  Brady tried to tell the well-known bear and rabbit joke, but we all knew it.
Then he told a ridiculous joke about a polite sex-crazed deer.  It didn't go over well, but I could
imagine, well told, it would be a riot.</p>

<p>Tamau asked me about Francois (Why do you carry a rabbit? and Are you serious?), and I told her
the story, including Kim Sawyer pointing out that honoring all parts of myself makes me a more
complete human.  And that Francois is in San Francisco now.</p>

<p>As the sun considered setting, someone was like, &quot;game to five?!?&quot; and someone else
like, &quot;game to seven?!?&quot; and I was like, &quot;five games to seven?&quot; as a complete
joke, but that's what we did!</p>

<p>(Un)fortunately, they went quickly, cause the other team totally destroyed us, getting 9 (nine)
points in a row and basically shut us down.  We just kept throwing the disc away and they kept
getting point after point.  It was tough, but fun.</p>
