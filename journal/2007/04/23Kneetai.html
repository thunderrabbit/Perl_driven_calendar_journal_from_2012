<p>My right knee hurts in certain configurations today as an apparent result of ultimate yesterday.
Interestingly, my left knee, which hurt before ultimate yesterday, did not hurt after ultimate, does
not hurt now.</p>

<p>Using a technique I learned from Catherine (yoga instructor / homegirl in Houston) seems to
help: identifying and tightening all the muscles associated with the pain, and then gently
releasing them.  She's pretty smart for a girl.</p>
