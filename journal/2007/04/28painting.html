<p>I've officially started my first painting for 2007.</p>

<p>So far, I've unwrapped the canvas and taken a picture of it.</p>

<p>Next, the paints.</p>

<p class="date">1:50am JST Sunday 29 April 2007 (day 13549)</p>

<p>I worked for about 1.75 hours.  Interestingly, I wrote 2007 April 28 for the date on the edge of
the canvas instead of 29 for the date.  Ah well.</p>

<p>So far I have used yellow, burnt yellow, a pink-red color, and white.</p>

<p>After I took a picture of my work so far, Michael asked why I didn't take a pic of each stroke,
and then compile them into a video.  Good question.</p>
