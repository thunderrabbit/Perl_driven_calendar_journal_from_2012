<p>Today work started with Asakaze, the 9 year old.  He's 9, so he prefers to draw than read; I try
to enforce a balance of activities.  Today I solved a maze he made, and I made a maze that he
solved, and we read about Central America, including the Panama Canal.  I've been making him
memorize continents and country names.</p>

 <p>He can now pretty much do the continents, Japan, China, US, Australia, Russia, Great Barrier
Reef, and now, perhaps, Panama (Canal).</p>

<p>Then a guy who could not keep me awake,</p>

<p>And then my beloved Yurika, who studies her ass off, doing near-perfect homework, including
memorizing the stories and her answers.  She likes/needs to work on listening, so I read small
sections or tell stories, sometimes at higher than normal speed, and quiz her on it.</p>

<p>Someone else, I forgot, and then Tomomi, who brings selections of emails from her work, where
she's in constant contact with a US supplier for some type of chemistry supply wareshouse, talking
about cylinders, frits, and chemicals with names like Polyethylpropyline and Tetrahydrasulphate in
various molarities, etc.</p>

<p>Then someone else, and then Ami, with whom I often enjoy relaxed lessons that are about 1/2
Japanese and 1/2 English, mostly catching up on a bit of gossip, personifying Francois, and me
trying to keep from ogling her breasts.</p>
