<p>I don't remember details from the beginning..</p>

<p class="dream">At the top of the building, some of my friends wanted to play a joke on Chiemi, by
putting her dog in some sort of jello (ballistics gel from Mythbusters).  We put the dog in a
bucket, and put water in it.  At first, the water stayed on top of the dog, and kept him from
breathing, but I adjusted him a bit so the water sloshed to the bottom and the dog could
breathe.  The gel powder was sifted in, and the dog began to slip onto its butt/back, and I kept
lifting it back up to its feet.</p>
