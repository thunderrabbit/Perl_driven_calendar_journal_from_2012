<p>Some success with flash; I figured out the problem that had vexed me for a day.  Basically a
button cannot be made up of other buttons.  I can certainly understand this.  I didn't think about
was that creating a new symbol out of buttons would keep those buttons intact inside the symbol.  I
had to &quot;break apart&quot; those symbols inside the button for the new button to work.</p>

<p>I continued past that point for a bit until I'm at another difficult part..  I'm going to have
to undo a lot of work, but first I should get some input from T and H about the best way to do the
new work, plus I want to show them how much work I've done.</p>

<p>But, we don't have a meeting scheduled; I don't have internet access; it's cold, and I want to
sleep.</p>

<p>I was going to wank myself to sleep with some porn, but decided to do a Gateway voyage thing
instead.</p>
