<p>Realized on the train that I had forgotten my necktie.  Had time to go back perhaps, but it was
just beyond the limit of what I would be willing to do.  Plus it was about 50% likely I'd find a
tie at work.</p>

<p>Neither Victor nor Alex('s room) had a tie, so I asked Reiko if she knew a place around here to
get one.  She didn't, and suggested I duck back into my booth because the boss/president of EV was
about to come.  He came, and I didn't hide, but was like, &quot;I forgot my tie; do you know where
I can get one around here?&quot;  He didn't think very long before he said, &quot;no; why don't you
keep an extra tie in your room?&quot;</p>

<p>I headed out, and decided to try my friends at the conveni next door.  I asked Tsunashima if
he knew where I could get a tie, and he showed me their selection of three ties for 1050 yen each.
Excellent.  I got the polka dot one, saying &quot;[this one is kinda strange]...&quot; implying
'therefore I won't buy it' as he was agreeing, I said, [so I'll buy it.]</p>

<p>Hahah he laughed.</p>

<p>As I was buying it, we bantered a bit, and then he headed to the back room and gave me another
tie.  Wow.  Two for one.</p>

<p>One for now, and one to keep in my room.</p>
