<p>Last student at work is a Japanese Self Defense Force soldier.  I challenged him to arm wrestle
and he beat me pretty effectively.  He was solid.</p>

<p>He was a weather forecaster for 4 months (April - August 2005) in Kuwait, featuring humidity of
5%, high temps, which are easy to predict, of 50 C (122 F) and sand storms, which are hard to
predict.</p>
