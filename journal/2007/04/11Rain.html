<p>Oooky blucky whiney rain today.  It's stupidly chilly for April; I haven't seen the sun in days.
But perhaps that's why we have the phrase about April showers and May flowers.</p>

<p>The rain apparently caught people off guard; I've seen a large percentage of Japanese without
umbrellas.  Normally if a drop falls here, all available umbrellas pop open.</p>
