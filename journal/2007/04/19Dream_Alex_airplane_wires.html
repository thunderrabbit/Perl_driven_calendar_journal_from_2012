<p class="dream">Alex and I were in a bus on the way to the grocery store, when I saw a 747 do a
tight looping maneuver; I thought it was going to crash, but it stayed intact, and then looped
again, but had made some headway, and then I could see it clearly: there was no tail on the plane;
it had somehow been lopped off during takeoff.</p>

<p class="dream">I was watching the plane, though Alex was still talking to me; I had stopped
paying attention to him and was like, &quot;check out this plane!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">He looked over as it was making a shaky emergency landing at a small airport, the
runway for which was not long enough to accomodate a 747.  It turned abruptly at the end of the
runway, doing a 450 degree donut spin, and then whipped around 270 degrees a bit slower and headed
toward some trees where it stopped before hitting the trees very hard.</p>

<p class="dream">I realized I should record it, and that I should have been recording it, but by
that time the bus had continued so we could barely see the plane through the trees anymore.</p>

<p class="dream">At the grocery store, I bought food for long term habitation: a big thing of flour
and a big thing of onions, etc..  not just little meals.</p>

<p class="dream">Back at the house, I asked Alex if he was using a wireless internet router.  I
wanted to piggyback his signal while mine was still down.  He said he didn't know, but that his
friend had set it up, so Alex didn't know the details of the router.  I hypothesized that the router
may be using a cable now, but could also have an untapped wireless ability.</p>

<p class="dream">Snooping around Alex's setup, I couldn't find cables nor connections that made
sense; he had a mush of cables going in haphazard directions, from the TV to the なんとか box to
the watchamacallit to the receiver to the whatsit, and I couldn't make much sense of it.</p>

<p class="dream">He showed me what he has to do to get internet access: unplug these two wires, and
then plug in these two wires, *plus* these two wires over here.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Eeek; I have no idea.&quot;</p>
