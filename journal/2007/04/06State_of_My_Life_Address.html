<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I feel like I don't have enough time to write a State of My Life Address, so I hope I
appreciate this one later.</p></li>

<li><p>I live with Michael in Sakurashinmachi, the same place I've been for a while (since breaking
my shoulder and moving to Jesse's couch in late May 2006), except now there is no internet access.
ETA for access is (more than) 2 weeks.</p></li>

<li><p>I tell people I have two jobs.  I'm working 45 hours a week at English Village for cold cash, and several
hours per week for a currently non-existant company for future stock options, I hope.  That's the
video game that Tariq is leading, Hitoshi is drawing, and I'm coding.</p></li>

<li><p>I've officially almost paid my credit card debt.  Just a few hundred more dollars, and then
I'll start sending cash to Ma and Fred ($3000 total I think).  And I still owe Carla 200 bucks, but
she seems to have vanished temporarily to Costa Rica.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm beginning to realize there's not a lot of benefit for me in my current relationship situation.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is my second Mac.  It's a white MacBook with OS X 10.4.9 (Tiger?) 1.83 GHz Intel
Core Duo, 1 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM, 74.2 GB HD with 4.8 GB free.  I've named it Louis.  (haha just
kidding)</p>

<p>As of last night, it features the new Google Desktop for Mac, which isn't so much a desktop as a
search for computer, mirroring a lot of Spotlight's functionality, but including browsed web pages,
and Gmail account.  (awesome)</p></li>

<li><p>I-group is still meeting in Shibuya, though Enio is going to be moving to Shanghai 3/4 time.
Not sure if he'll keep that apartment.  We've met at this apartment more than once.  We are
expecting another man will join us starting in April or May.  (he just did his training in
Australia)</p></li>

<li><p>I've actually put some money toward my coaching with Kim.  I'm paying him $300 per month for
3 months, and then $450 for the next three months, and then his full price of $600 per month after
that.  I realize I need to do more homework in this arena to make it worthwhile for myself.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't really volunteer my time, but I do have dreams featuring YRUU sometimes.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm not really studying Japanese.  Basically I am sick of &quot;teaching&quot; (more like
babysitting) students who don't do homework, and who have no idea what they want to study.  I don't
do homework in Japanese, so I can't really stand to have (and do the same thing to) a teacher.  I do
meet Shimpei nearly every week in Shibuya on Saturday evenings, but he is more like a friend than a
teacher.</p></li>

<li><p>Basically every day that I work, I visit the convenience store next to our building.  There's
a cute girl with red hair who works there.  I call her Akami, which is a merging of aka (red) and
kami (hair).  There's a guy name Shirosuna (I think) but I call him Tsunashima for fun.  We banter
about silly stuff each time they are working and I go in.  ¤ª¼ê¶Ì, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't done a lot of Perl programming recently, but just two days ago picked up a book
called Flash Video Games Demystified, which includes source code, using actual trigonometry and
Newton's Laws of motion to calculate force and collisions, etc.  It's pretty durn cool.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently added 1 year to thunderrabbit.com and Hitomi's website, in a moment of really
missing Hitomi.  She really lavished a lot of attention on me, which proved ultimately to be too
much, but now with a near lack of such, I certainly feel it.</p></li>

<li><p>No pets.  I assume Spot the old man kitty is doing well with Jennifer in Houston.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't worked on Marble Track 2 in over a month, but I did recently pull it off the shelf
to show one of my students, and I <em>just now</em> figured out how I want to solve one of the two
problems that has/d been vexing me for a long time.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently I moved all of my iTunes music to Amazons Simple Storage Servers (S3), and had been
listening to my tunes stored on their servers with 99.99% uptime guarantee, and cheap as chips.
Now without internet access, ... argh.</p>

<p>But, last night while at McDonald's chatting online with Tariq, I had my music playing through
built-in speakers.  At first it was nearly drowned out by the din of customers, but as everyone
headed home before the trains stopped, Beastie Boys were more and more apparent, but of course no
one cared to say anything.  I like the security of never losing my music again.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently I paid $5.01 for the Amazon S3 service of storing those 6+ Gigs.</p></li>

<li><p>If I lost my computer, I would lose several megs worth of photos that I still want to go
through and upload as albums.  Part of the slowdown there is getting iPhoto to output albums in a
format that I'd use.  I basically want to make a custom header in the output, and make the photo
names be human-readable instead of just numbers.  (both the images, and the thumbnails), and I want
the big images to have a watermark on them.</p>

<p>I'd also lose some hours of time installing other programs.  I have no systematic way of keeping
track of what I have on my machine, application-wise.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't really created any art recently, though in the back of my mind, I'd like to get back
into painting.</p></li>

<li><p>Have been taking pictures of Sakurashinmachi station construction.  They just recently
finished the security fences, escape doors, and escalators.  There was only 1 escalator for years
(going up from platform 2 to platform 1), but now there are 4 (up and down from 2 to 1, and from 1
to ticket level).  It seems conceivable they'll make an escalator from the ticket level to the
street, but maybe not, for it wouldn't be protected from the elements at the street level.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't had any awesome earthquakes in the past few months.</p></li>

<li><p>It's Spring in Tokyo, but recently has been cold cold cold.  After the warm winter, cherry
trees were expected to bloom 2 weeks early, but then it got cold again, and they bloomed
sporadically during the first week of April, and now it's crazy cold again and it was rainy for a
bit so a lot of the petals are gone.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really traveled recently.  Would like to go to Okinawa to see Aiko, would like to
do the BEE Japan ride, would like to climb Mt Fuji again.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been basically in touch with Fred, not so in touch with Ma or Dad.</p></li>

<li><p>Ultimate frisbee has been fun.  It's my one escape per week.  Last week I brought my bouncy
yoga ball, which was fun enough that I'm considering bringing it again.  But it was a bit of a pain
to clean, so I'm considering buying a new one just for ultimate.  I'm sure it wouldn't be *all*
that popular, and it's kindof a pain to inflate and deflate (or bring on the train inflated), but
it could be fun again.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't really meditated recently, though I'd like to get back into that.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently learned all the US states in order.  Let's see if I can knock them out again:</p>

<p>Hahahaha!  I just had a Firefox extension read this SoML.  Pretty funny stuff.  It's called CLiCk I think.</p>
