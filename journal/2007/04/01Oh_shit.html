HI Kellie

Thanks for your card.  It is pretty funny, but I can't actually laugh.  I'm glad you wrote because I
have big news that my g/f, after we finally started having sex, is.. late with her period, and we
just have to wait a few more days before the waiting period for the pregnancy test is official. She
took a test a few days ago, and it was positive, but she also said it said something about the
number of days after her period was supposed to end, and I'm totally like, "oh shit" cause I just
don't want to have to make a decision to abort or have a baby with a woman that I don't actually
love, but just love(d) to bang.  egad this sucks.

Fingers crossed that she is *not* pregnant, or that it's not mine (I'm sure she's not doing anyone
else, but it sure would be ironic if that was the reason all along that we weren't doing it.)  FUCK!

Thanks for listening, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner but I've just been caught up in all this
shit in my brain and not knowing wtf to do.

 Love
 - Rob
