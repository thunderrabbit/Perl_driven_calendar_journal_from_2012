<p>Going to meet Yurika now.  :-)</p>

<p>Gotta get dressed!</p>

<p class="date">10:27pm JST</p>

<p>Lovely lovely lovely day with Yurika.</p>

<p>First Kitchen first for food carried to Yoyogi, where we chilled by a bush watching kids throw
things to get a bag and a ball out of a tree.  Climbed a statue of Quetzalcoatl then walked around
the loop in Yoyogi, during which we came to the Dog Run with a pen for little dogs and a pen for all
dogs, then came upon a couple of contact jugglers, one of whom was pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Headed out and back to Shibuya, but got sidetracked at Shibuya AX, where we sat on the wall
watching trains go by.  I napped with my head on her lap, and after a while she lay her head on my
stomach, so we were using each other as pillows.  Pretty cute, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Shakey's Pizza, where we finished two medium sized pizzas, and then headed toward our respective
stations, which happen to be on the same line.  She showed me the view from the top of Carrot Tower
(not kidding about the name) and then it became time for me to head home for a meeting with
Tariq.</p>

<p>The meeting didn't happen.  Dammit.</p>

<p>I definitely wanted to kiss Yurika.</p>
