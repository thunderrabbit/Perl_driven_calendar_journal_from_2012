<p class="dream">I knew I had *just* made an appointment with the dentist, but I couldn't remember
if I had chosen Thursday or Friday.  And ah, crap, I had been distracted and didn't even write down
the name of the dentist!  I knew where I had looked up their number, so I could find it again, but
it was too late to call them back to confirm the time, and the time was either *tomorrow* early or
the next day.</p>

<p class="dream">I pored over my calendar to see if I could discern any clues, but instead I found
more problems! I had scheduled a movie with Juno from 2 to 4pm on Friday, but I knew I had to work
starting at 2!  Or did I?  Would I have made such a mistake in scheduling?  I tried to remember if
I had requested off Friday early afternoon.</p>

<p class="dream">After a while, it began to dawn on me why all this was happening.</p>

<p>Note to self:  when working on my schedule, wake up first!</p>
