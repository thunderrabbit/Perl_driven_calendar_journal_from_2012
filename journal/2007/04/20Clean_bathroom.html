<p>As of 3.14 weeks ago, my job has been to clean the bathroom and take out the garbage.  (Michael's
job has been to vaccuum the floor and take out the recycling.)</p>

<p>Today, as each Friday morning since then, I've done a Rob-version of cleaning the bathroom,
which is basically to clear everything out, scrub everything down, dry everything off, put
everything back.  All while naked, of course.</p>

<p>For cleaning purposes, there are two good thing about Japanese bathrooms:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are small.</p></li>

<li><p>(and this is the big one) They are waterproof.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ha ha; sounds funny, I know.  But, in the US, I could not spray water all over the floor: it
would soak into the carpet in the adjacent room.  And, there was no drain.</p>

<p>In all the bathrooms I've seen in Japan (and I've seen several), the floor is smooth solid
plastic or tile, and it's got a barricade at the door to keep any water from escaping the wrong way.  And it has
a drain to let the water escape the desired direction: down the tubes.</p>

<p>The shower head in our bathroom is portable; it's got a hose connecting to the faucets, so I can
spray down all the walls and the floor and <em>everything</em>.  I do this happily.  Happily
violating an old household rule: Boys, don't splash water out of the tub!</p>

<p>Then, I take my own shower, dry off, dry off the bathroom mirror, walls, toilet, and floor.
Then toss the towel into the washing machine.</p>

<p>Presto: clean bathroom, happy Rob</p>
