<p>Headed back to some old code to make some twizzles that we thought would be good.  I made some,
but for some reason I couldn't get a couple of functions to work.  And they're just functions that
call trace()..  like the functions themselves were not even being called.  Cripes.  I finally gave
up and hopped into the shower.</p>

<p>Headed to work now.</p>
