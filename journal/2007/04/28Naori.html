<p>Wow.  Saw Naori as I was leaving-half-running for the train, but was happy to talk to her for a
second.  She was at the school to make a reservation and not actually take a lesson, and then going
to dinner with her friends in Kichijoi, so didn't get much of a chance to chat with her.</p>

<p>Told her she was too young to be going out drinking and that she should be home with her mommy.
She was like, &quot;what??  You're too young!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <em>act</em> young, but I'm not actually young; there's a big difference.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me too,&quot; she assured me.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, you're not young; you're old.&quot;x</p>

<p>&quot;Hey!&quot;</p>
