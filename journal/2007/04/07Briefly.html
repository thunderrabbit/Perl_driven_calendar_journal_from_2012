<p>Yesterday after work, not scheduled to meet Shimpei, and Juno cancelled our dinner, so I did something
I've been needing to do for a while: buy new shoes.</p>

<p>The shoes I've been wearing are over 4 years old.  I bought them with janette (actually I think
she paid and I eventually paid her back) in Dallas back in &quot;oh-three&quot;</p>

<p>This time I went out with the girl to a shop that had sizes up to, but not including my size.
They suggested a shop in Gotanda which easily had my size.  I actually enjoyed being in that shop.
Ah dang, I should have gotten some pictures of Francois there.</p>

<p>Feelin' pretty spiffy with my new shoes, I suggested we sing some karaoke, which I've not done in
a while.  We bought some food at the conveni and then sang for 90 minutes.  I mostly rapped,
actually, and did some songs that I had never seen before.  One by DMX, perhaps called &quot;get it
on&quot; and one by Nas perhaps called &quot;New York Style&quot;</p>
