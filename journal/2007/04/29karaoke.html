<p>I made sure not to hog the machines, but ended up doing Eminem's &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; (they
didn't have &quot;Business&quot; nor &quot;Rabbit Run&quot;), then ペパ家部 (sp) by Pink Lady (just
the refrain), &quot;Livin' La Vida Loca&quot; by Ricky Martin, part of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;
by Kate Bush (which is in an impossibly high register for me), and looked for &quot;The
Distance&quot; by Cake (nope), and something good by Beastie Boys (nope)..  I forgot to look for DMX
or Nas or that other one I did sorta well last time I karaoked.</p>

<p>I sat between Hisa and Yasuko, and knocked her small can of ウメ酒 from her hand.  Oops.  I
slurped a bit of it off the table so as not to waste it.  Mmmm.  I like umeshu.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to have a hella good time, though Peta left just before all her songs came on.
D'oh!</p>
