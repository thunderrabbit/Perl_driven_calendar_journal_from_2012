<p>Wow.  I woke up early(?) and was deciding whether to use the time to buy art supplies or a new
phone (mine seems to have left my list of possessions).  I decided I only had time to do one, plus
I didn't necessarily have all the data I'd like before buying a  phone... so I sat down to let the
choice come in a meditative manner... and promptly fell asleep.</p>

<p>For 3 or 4 hours.</p>

<p>わ。びっくり！</p>
