<p class="dream">Happily minding my own business, semi ignoring people around me, even though there
were new friends of friends coming in; I didn't really have the energy to meet them.  But then one
person was like, &quot;have you met Rob?&quot; and brought her friend over, and I perked up and was
like, &quot;HI&quot; and asked her some questions about her life, plans, etc.  She had just moved
to the area from northern London, and I was like, &quot;is that near Brighton?&quot; and it
apparently wasn't, cause she was like, &quot;what?&quot; and I stumbled onward: &quot;I thought
Brighton was either in northern England or northern London, but I've never actually been there; my
friend Dan is from there, but anyway, how long will you be here?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Turns out she was just starting a 14 year adventure in Japan, and she was 14 years
old.  &quot;Wow, so what is the most surprising thing you've seen here so far?&quot; and she told
me it was the honesty which spills from people's online diaries, which led me to realize she was in
a prime position to start her own diary.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;How long have you been here?&quot;  I knelt down to get to a more 'serious'
discussion with her.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Two weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;And you'll be here for 14 years.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Okay, listen:  You'll be twenty-eight years old in 14 years.  I started my
diary when I was 17.  I'm 38 years old now, and my life continues to change and be filled with
stories every day.  I think you should consider writing down the things you see and feel now.  They
will change in 14 years.&quot;</p>

<p>Or something like that; it felt much more eloquent in the dream.</p>

<p class="dream">She agreed that it *might* be a good idea, and agreed to write down a summary of
the last two weeks she's been here.</p>
