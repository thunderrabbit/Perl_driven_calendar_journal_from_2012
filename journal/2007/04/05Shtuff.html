<p>At the McDonald's in Shibuya now, slurping on the internet access that Hitomi hooked up for me
some months ago when we were talking.  I told her I didn't need it anymore, but now I do; she seems
to be completely busy or disinterested in talking to me, so I have no idea how long this access will
continue to be available.</p>

<p>Work was bearable tonight, though my last lesson was quite challenging as she was just reading
with basically no comprehension.  I thought about writing a letter to my boss to say I never want a
lesson with her again, (the way I no longer have lessons with a student who similarly wrote to him),
but, assuming such a request would not be honored, I thought of a different way of handling it.</p>

<p>Basically told her it was really hard for me to know how to help her, given that she doesn't
understand the word brain, though she's reading an article that starts, &quot;It won't come as a
surprise to fitness freaks to learn that aerobic exercise does more than increase the heart rate and
raise one's confidence: it increases blood flow to the brain, which strengthens it as well.&quot; or
something like that.</p>

<p>I had her go bit by bit through the article until she actually understood the sentences of the
first paragraph, and the we were out of time.  After I suggested an easier book, she poo-poohed them
as too easy, but I pointed out that she can't produce the easy language without <em>reading</em> the
book.  She readily agreed and I was like, &quot;see??&quot; as if I had turned on some light for
her.  Fluency includes speaking without reading.</p>

<p>Anyway, fuck that; Tariq, Hitoshi and I met this morning for a couple hours, starting here 
at ¥Þ¥Ã¥¯ in Shibuya, where for some reason the internet connection wouldn't even register on their
machines though I had full signal strength, and then moving to Shinjuku in search of the perfect
location of free electricity and wireless signal.</p>

<p>We have discovered that Standard's Burgers in Shinjuku has both, but at the cost of a meal.</p>

<p>We hung out there for a while after they opened and after Hitoshi headed out at 12:20, I helped
Tariq with some questions on his website.</p>

<p>Headed off to work myself, enjoying the weather and Shibuya Crossing, which was timely as my
first student(s) (a pair) asked if I had seen cherry blossoms.  I was like, &quot;yeah; four years
ago..&quot; and they were like, &quot;nooooo, <em>this</em> year,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;no way;
I'm not going to *go* anywhere to see cherry blossoms, cause it's not &quot;real&quot; if I go
someplace that I never normally go and see the place how it never normally is.&quot;

<p>They didn't quite get my meaning, but I was like, &quot;I like Shibuya; it's my home station.  I
know Shibuya at night, during the day, when it's crowded, when it's empty, when it's dry, and
rainy, etc.  So, I'll enjoy the cherry blossoms in Shibuya better than I will in Ueno Park.  To me,
Ueno Park <em>always</em> has cherry blossoms.  What's the big deal?&quot;</p>

<p>Or some shit like that, and they got it.</p>

<p>Also chatted with Tomomi, one of my favorite students, for her huge efforts and high level of
speaking and comprehension, and difficult questions.  Also chatted with Yoko, one of my favorite
students, for her smile, height and relaxed nature.</p>

<p>One week alarm went off and I realized I basically haven't done shit since I met Kim last Thursday.</p>

<p>And in other news, I just downloaded Google Desktop for Mac.  Awright.</p>
