<p>Great progress on Marble Track II today.  I added the first 1/2 pi circumfrence of the circular
thing I made for the big marbles.  In fact, I added the next section to four separate tracks (not
the big marble track right above the switch that had been vexing me (but I think I've got it
whipped)).</p>

<p>I figured out how to handle the two small tracks that were crunched up right in the corner; I
brought one back across the aforementioned spiral section with what basically looks like an _____
(*) of the big spiral, and then added four pieces to the top of that piece such that they spiral
inside the spiral, but the opposite direction, <em>and</em> they act as the inner wall for that
section of the outer spiral.</p>

<p>(*) I forgot the term for a straight line that touches two points on a circle.</p>

<p>Plus I added two levels to the back-n-forth toothpick &quot;tower&quot; which now has 6 levels.
I think I'll keep adding to it, though it definitely needs some support.</p>

<p>Basically I'm really happy with the progress..</p>

<p>After work, I showed Marble Track 2 to Reiko (receptionist), and she seemed to enjoy watching the balls
flutter down.  Especially the small ones.  Especially the pink ones, though they are actually a bit
too small to work properly on several of the elements.</p>
