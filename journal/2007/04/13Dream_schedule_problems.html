<p class="dream">Maruan (PB 52) had put together a turntable concert, where Will Robidee (KTRU) was
helping set up the turntables; I had been invited, and showed up in the back after it had started.
Maruan came up to me all, &quot;hey man, when I said it was just a little show, that's what I meant;
there was no reason for you to be hesitant to come.  We're your friends, right?&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Right; yes yes definitely,&quot; and I sat down to enjoy the concert.  Phil
(PB 46, 52, 55) was nearby, doing some card tricks with some weird embossed playing cards, one of
which had been used as a security key to start the turntable.</p>

<p class="dream">After the concert, I was outside watching a roller coaster that basically looked
like the 3D floating tubes screen saver that used to be in vogue back in mid 1990s.  Impossibly
difficult 90 degree turns, and long straightaways, up, down, zoom zoom.  The announcer was like,
&quot;okay, kids, if you think you want to try this ride, you should do it right now, cause it's
slated for deconstruction in the immediate future!&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">I totally wanted to ride, so I helped get some pieces of track together to rebuild
the first section; we had some lengths of rail, and wood that we needed to put together before the
train could run again.  Lots of people were leaving after the show, and I had to be careful carrying
the rail and going against the current of people; I didn't want to jab someone in the eye with a 15
foot steel bar!</p>

<p class="dream">During construction, a girl came up to me all, &quot;did you look at that website
yet?&quot; and I was like, [ah shit; no...] and &quot;I totally want to check it out!&quot; and I
picked her up.  &quot;Give me a kiss and I'll remember to do it.&quot;  She was like, &quot;no
way!  You look it up, and I'll think about it.&quot; And then I put her down, and she was like,
&quot;okay, see you Wednesday.&quot;</p>

<p class="dream">Wednesday Wednesday, shit; have I got something scheduled for that day?  I stopped
construction on the track to look in my schedule book, hoping it was there.  I found a note from
Funky Cold Serena (though she had signed it Rochelle) taking up an entire page by filling just
enough that I couldn't write the calendar page in it.  The page was where her N*1000th day would have
been, had the calendar been there.  The woman with whom I had been building the roller coaster was
like, &quot;I know what you're doing,&quot; referring to my desperate attempt to reconcile my
schedule to accomodate a cute girl.</p>

<p class="dream">&quot;Just a second&quot;</p>
