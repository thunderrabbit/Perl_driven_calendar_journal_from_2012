<p>Fuck; I'm way too tired to write in Japanese.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2007/around_town/roppongi/juno_party_21_april/Francois_Ayako_Miho_Kumi_Mariko_Juno_Rob.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/japan2007/around_town/roppongi/juno_party_21_april/thumbs/Francois_Ayako_Miho_Kumi_Mariko_Juno_Rob.jpg" alt="Juno's party" align="left" /></a> Great to see Juno, and shockingly wonderful to walk into a restaurant otherwise deserted except
for four (4) women at a table in the center of the room..  friends of his, but still, four women
all for us!  I met them: Ayako, Miho, Kumi, and Mariko, whose English is pretty darn good, and who
arranged the dinner.  Totally great.</p>

<p>I mostly talked to Ayako: she's an administrative assistant (or I'm too tired to remember
correctly) and is pretty cute.  She tried hard to keep a conversation going with my slacking
Japanese.  That was nice.</p>

<p>After chowing, we headed to a club, where at first I was just happily dancing, and later I
realized I was nervously dancing, cause I was afraid to talk to two women, one of whom had clearly
smiled at me.  I finally realized that was stupid, so I walked over and met Julia and &quot;I don't
have a name.&quot;  They both came to Japan looking for adventure, 10 months and 6 weeks ago,
respectively.  They are both working at Nova.</p>

<p>We got bored of each other; they didn't believe I was not on anything (cause of my high energy),
and had never gotten drunk.  I didn't believe the second one's name, and they both smoked, so
whaeva..</p>

<p>Went back to Ayako, for whom I had grown a bit fond of talking, and then she had to take off
suddenly, and I went over and talked to a woman semi-behind the DJ Booth.  Her name is Grita (sp (I
think she spelled it as 4 letters, but I don't think Gita is correct..)) and I knew immediately she
is from Germany.</p>

<p>Interestingly, she tried to place my accent and looks; she had pegged my heritage as northern
European, but then when I spoke, she gave up that idea; the said my accent was quite beautiful.</p>

<p>We talked a bit and I met her friend Michi, who is/was looking for a language school in Shibuya,
so I gave her the school name and phone number.</p>

<p>Juno et. al. left, and I continued talking to G for a bit, and then I headed home.</p>
