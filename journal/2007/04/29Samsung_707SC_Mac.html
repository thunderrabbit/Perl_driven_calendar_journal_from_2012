<p>I just got a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=samsung%2B707sc">Samsung 707SC</a>, and I
basically can't use it in conjunction with my Mac.  Maybe it would have been a good idea to do more
research before just signing a 2 year contract with them, but ah well.  I've done dumber things.</p>

<p>Basically the phone is okay, but it has some silly quirks.  I can save contact data to the phone or to
the USIM card, but when I search for said data, I have to tell it which to search.  It should just
grab the data from both sources and display it in one list!</p>

<p>I can transfer addressbook data from (Address Book on) my Mac to the phone, but I can't save
contact data from the phone to my computer.  Why?  Maybe there is some tweak I haven't tweaked yet,
but so far, I can't figure it out.</p>

<p>I transferred a .swf file to my computer from the phone.  It worked fine, and I was all excited
to create a killa .swf for my phone,
but <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showpost.php?p=22572594&postcount=31">I can't transfer
.swfs to the phone</a>.  Barf.  This is dumb.</p>

<p>So the phone is slim, and has a pretty high res camera, can surf the web (though I can't set my
preferred home page), and read gmail, (but not download gmail's mobile app), but only 3 thumbs up
out of 5.</p>
