<p class="dream">With PB49 peeps at a water park of some sort, watching swimmers race, we saw some
guy get a leg cramp and have to be stretched while in the water, and then carted out inside a big
padded box handled roughly by his friend (as a joke).  then there was another problem, and they knew
Kris was trained in CPR and other physical therapy techniques, so they asked her to come help, even
though she wasn't on staff there.  I was like, &quot;go, Kim!&quot; cause Kimberley was sitting
right next to me, and then Kris was like, &quot;do you remember where I'm from?&quot; (they're both
from Canada) and I was like, &quot;Aaaahhh!!  I'm sorry!&quot; because I totally know their correct
names; I couldn't believe I had fallen back to such a blunder.</p>

<p class="dream">I ran out of the car for a second, and then ran back and cuddled up on someone's
lap as we headed to the next part of the trip, where we were going to experience a luxurious meal
and bath in our own concoction of food and bath salts.  They proprietors were speaking German, and
most of them did *not* speak English, so it took a little bit of negotiation to get the finer points
of how to choose the best concoctions for our specific needs (heal sore muscles / reduce fat /
improve blood circulation / etc)</p>

<p class="dream">I sampled some of the food, but didn't get to soak in the bath before it was time
to go to the next location, a cafe at street level on one side, and on at the top of a high rise
building on the other.  I went in there with Francois peeking out one pocket, and Rabby peaking out
my other pocket.  Jesse and Anna were there, but not very talkative for some reason; it turns out
Jesse had lost my frisbee which he had borrowed some hour earlier.  It had gone off the high rise
side of the cafe and into a long descent until it disappeared into the city below.</p>

<p class="dream">I was like, &quot;don't worry about that&quot; and &quot;c'mon, let's get outta
here,&quot; cause I wanted to head to the next location.  I went out to the car and found a
Metropolis magazine, that turned out to be a different magazine trying to gain market share in the
same market.  I woke up before any of the others came out.</p>
