<p>I finished the tricky switch on my marble track (Marble Track 2).</p>

<p>Took a video of it in action, and will post it soon.</p>

<p>The rest of the track should be a lot faster, though I have added one more tricky element to the
list (*) and one more super tricky element to the list (**) of things to do.</p>

<p>(*) the tricky thing <em>shouldn't</em> be all that bad; I've just got to squeeze a track in
where there's not much room.  I believe there's enough room to do it, though;... so it's not so
much tricky as just an idea that I'm glad I'll be able to do.</p>

<p>(**) one of my students suggested making a vertical tube before a switch that I'd like to have
ahead of the spiral -vs- the outer rail for small marbles.  If I can do what I'm thinking, it will
be pretty cool, though I'm not sure if I can do it.  Back back back in the day, we had a game with
white X-shaped switches that alternately caught marbles and let them pass..  I'm thinking of doing
something like that, but not sure if I'll be able to with the imprecise construction techniques I'm
using for Marble Track 2.</p>

<p>And there's *not* a lot of room left in my mind of going vertically.</p>

<p>Gotta give this some thought, but fast, so I can present it this summer for her birthday.</p>
