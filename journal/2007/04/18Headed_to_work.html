<p>Headed to work now; I intend to pick up my new hanko along the way, though I will arrive
somewhat before 3pm.  Not too much, though.</p>

<p>There's a new bit of construction happening regarding some doors to a maintenance area near
where I normally board the train.</p>

<p>That remizzles me; I've got several albums worth of pics on this machine that I need to get
uploaded!  The tedious part is naming all the pics, but the trickiest part is that of matching up
the directory structure and the navigation structure for the albums.  My images project should take
care of that, but it's been on ice for a while.</p>

<p>I also want to get my TJ Bike adventure mapped out the rest of the way.  It will only get
foggier the longer I wait to do it ¤«¤Ê¡£</p>
