<p>My neck is super sore, like my spine wants to pop, though I can't quite get it.  The muscles are
all tight and I'd probably benefit from going to a chiropractor.  I'm considering going to see Saki,
who I know from PB 54, a woman over whom I cried when it became apparent my best attempts at
flirting with her would not result in any kissing.  She opened her own clinic recently in Ueno area,
but that's like miles away; there's no realistic reason to go that far to find a chiropractor.
Going to Ueno to see Saki is a legitimate reason, but.. maybe not for the best reasons.</p>
