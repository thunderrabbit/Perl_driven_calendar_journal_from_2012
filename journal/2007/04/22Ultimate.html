<p>I met Kumiko for ultimate today.  The wind was really crazy, but she played and made some catches
and throws during the game.  I don't know if I trained her very well, but she understood the basic
mechanics of the game (turnovers), if not the strategies (covering people)</p>

<p>I actually had a pretty hugely great game, overall.  Huge fast hucks into the wind for points or
completions; some long carefully placed hucks with the wind for points or near misses, a few
connections with Jolian for points, and one for Bruno, plus lots of funny banter as Bruno and I
played on the same team, or as we covered each other on opposite teams.</p>

<p>And a couple of (three?) tall well timed jumping catches, including one &quot;over&quot; Andy,
who is taller than me, and can usually catch things I cannot.</p>

<p>I think the trick was I could read the disc in the wind better than most of the others.  My years
of experience overcoming these young speedy players.</p>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p>That, plus Kumiko was there, so I wanted to do well while she was watching.</p>

<p>Jolian hurt his ribs during a layout (in which I was not involved) and asked if I could go in and
play.  I could, though I was sitting next to Kumiko.  I went in because, wow, Jolian asked me.</p>

<p>Kumiko's right contact went flying at one point.  Cutely, she explained it as とんでちゃった,
which I was happy to understand.  For that reason, she did not join us for dinner at the patio
place, but went home to invoke her contact insurance, which I thought was a pretty cool thing to
have.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I lost my contacts, too.&quot;</p>

<p>I had the same thing I've always eaten there, the Malai Kofti (sp) from the Indian restaurant,
though I did actually go upstairs and decide I wanted to try the bowl of soup with what looked like
rice crispies in the bottom (though Yasuko assured me they were like sembe, and not sweet).  I went
into the closest door to that sign, which funnily enough was for the Mexican restaurant.</p>

<p>あっまちがいた。</p>

<p>I went to the door on the other side of the sign, but that was the kitchen/back door of the
restaurant.  One of the girls (?) laughed again and led me to the correct entrance, which was way
way way down the balcony from the menu.</p>

<p>wtf?</p>

<p>Oh, I know why (which I didn't realize before): the menu is placed right at the top of the
escalator where people will see it.  Makes sense.  But still not very well marked.</p>

<p>Bruno, Andy (?) and Tamau (I think) were in deliberations at the register, without much look of
progress, though I was ready with my order of salty rice crispie soup.  I decided not to wait and
headed down to the Indian restaurant for my usual.</p>

<p>I sat with Little Jay on my left, Yen on my right, Big Jason and British Mike across from me.
Yen was chatting with the people to his right, and the other three boys were talking about TV shows
that I've never seen, and have little interest.  Lost, Heros, 24, and others(?), intermixed with
religious, gender, and sex comments, some of which I derided as inappropriate, plus a small belching
contest started by Mike's inadvertant ripper after drinking half his carbonated beverage.  Andy
tried to hook one up by chugging his drink, but it was a dud, but then it came out later, to much
commentary on delayed reaction.  I won the contest (or took it too far, (or to the next level),
depending on who was asked) with my trained-since-junior high ability to breathe with my
stomach.</p>

<p>I stayed until the very end, and was talking to Tamau on the way back to the station.  I've
always had a bit of a crush on her, but she always seems to be connected with Jason, so I haven't
asked her out.. but today she was like, &quot;yah; I wonder how long I should wait [to get married]
as we were commenting on the Japanese 'rule' that women over age 30 are too old to get married.  ((
this is one of the things I hate about Japanese culture; I'm glad it's changing かな ))</p>

<p>We got interrupted by people saying bye to Kumi, who will head to the US for six months after
next week.  (Oh; that's where the commentary started; I was jokingly like, &quot;she'll get
married&quot; which wasn't a negative comment toward Kumi, but, I realized later, a comment based on
my sadness for Miki, who got married to a guy who doesn't want kids (she does) in a ceremony where
she didn't get to wear a white dress (she wanted to).</p>

<p>Anyway, we got interrupted before I could ask Tamau &quot;what about Jason?&quot; or some
variant; after the byes to Kumi, they both headed to the southbound platform.</p>

<p>I waved to them in a silly Tokyo-wave manner, ostensibly as a joke, but actually with the desire
to talk more with Tamau.</p>

<p>Maybe next week.</p>
