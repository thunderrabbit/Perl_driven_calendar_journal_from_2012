<p>Sitting up helped me stay awake longer, and at some points I was listening to his instructions
and seeing my computer in front of me.  I could imagine the different instructions, though I don't
know if I experiencd them as such.</p>

<p>In the last minute or so, after coming back from Focus 12 to Focus 10, and he was equalizing the
body functions, I totally fell asleep just as he was saying it was time to wake up.</p>

<p>I feel quite like I could take a phat nap, which I think I may do now.</p>
