<p>I'm headed now to get some art supplies: basically a canvas and some acrylics.  I could probably
put some effort into getting them free, but I want them *now* more than I want them cheaply.</p>

<p>Not so much *now* as, time to just get off my ass and go get them; I've wanted to start painting
for a while.</p>
