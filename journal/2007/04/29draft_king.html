<p>Chatted with Peta after the game and while we were walking back.  She's got several interesting
piercings, including a ring on the front center of her upper lip that hangs down against her teeth,
and a bar through the nape of her neck.</p>

<p>We determined that we both don't really watch TV, though she does have a favorite sports
team.</p>

<p>I sat between Peta and Kumi, across from Little J, Jolyon, and Bruno at Draft King where we took
like 20 seats at the long table in the back.  Lots of fun and joking around as we ordered, waited
for food to come (like a lottery), chowed, sharing french fries and other bites.  They ordered a
tower of beer (4.5 liters or so in a tall-ass clear tube), as usual, and as usual, I had water.</p>

<p>At one point, Peta said something like, &quot;I didn't hear that;&quot; and I was like,
&quot;what?&quot; as a joke, as I always do in that situation.  She called me an asshole, and I
thought she was just being a little harsh, so I put my arm around her, &quot;oh; it's just cause I
like you...  I always make that joke when someone says, 'what?' or 'could you repeat
that?'&quot;</p>

<p>She was really upset and left the table for a bit, as I suddenly realized she says she is
slightly hard of hearing.</p>

<p>oopps</p>

<p>When she came back, I was like, &quot;Peta, I'm really sorry; just let me say one thing: I don't
think about you as hard of hearing.  I think of you as just a 'normal' person&quot; (I used bunny
ears for &quot;normal;&quot; who is normal??)  &quot;Had I remembered what you've said, I wouldn't
have made that joke.&quot;</p>

<p>She was like, &quot;it's okay,&quot; and seemed to be okay after that.</p>

<p>I followed up with what I had said before: &quot;and I really do like you..&quot;</p>

<p>Also got some digits of different cell phones:  Tamau's, Little J's, and Peta's.  Was invited to
go to karaoke with Tamau et. al. on Friday.  Awesome!</p>

<p>It became time to leave, as rumors began to fly about people wanting to do カラオ
ケ <em>tonight</em>, completely down for which I was.  We ultimately (no pun intended) left it up to
Kumi, whose last day of ultimate (with this group, for a year) was today.</p>

<p>She chose to visit the karaoke place right next door, which we did, as a group of 14 people.</p>
