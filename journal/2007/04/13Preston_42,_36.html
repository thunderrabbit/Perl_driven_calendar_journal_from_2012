<p>Today I wrote down 42 before Preston guessed a number between 1 and 50, comprised of 2 even
digits.</p>

<p>Then I asked him to do it again, after I had written down 36.  He guessed 26.  Then I realized I
had broken the rule by using 3, an odd number.</p>

<p>While walking to work, I found a sticker on the ground with a big 36 printed on it.
&quot;length 36 cm&quot;</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>
