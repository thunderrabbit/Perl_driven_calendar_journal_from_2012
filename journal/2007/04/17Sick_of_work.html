<p>Getting sick of work; the great students don't seem to be making up for the students who don't
study.  I just don't have the energy to help these people who come in here with no idea what they
want to study, nor having done any homework, nor asking questions when they don't understand.

<p>On the other end, I met a guy who knows the owner of NOVA, and who buys and sells businesses
like a game.  That was interesting.  I got his card.</p>
