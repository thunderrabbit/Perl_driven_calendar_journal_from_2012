<p>I finished plotting my TJ Bike trip!  For now, the way to view the map isn't easy, so I'm not
going to actually link to the URL, but if you wanna see, add cgi-bin/maps to my domain, click L in
the top left of the new rectangle, then click a route you want to see.  The first list of buttons
load day by day routes (except for the first one where I went to Takadanobaba to see my PB peeps
(which amounted to starting off in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction)).  Scroll down and the top of the
second list should be &quot;All: my entire trip&quot; or something.  1400km.</p>

<p>Of note is the end of the trip (it's in the middle of green, not gray)...  that's pretty much
exactly where I glanced off the car that dumped me sideways in a shoulder breaking manner.</p>
