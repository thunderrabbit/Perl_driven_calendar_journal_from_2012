<p>Lesson with Mika was cool; she had written some stuff about onsen vs sentou in Japan.  She may
come play ultimate with us in a couple weeks.</p>

<p>Interesting.  First lesson for a woman, and she stepped out of the room to talk to Reiko for a
bit after my question &quot;what do you want to study?&quot; in an attempt to find out what's best
for her.</p>

<p>Shhh shh; here she comes. ;-)</p>

<p>Holy shiz!  That's never happened before.  She talked to Reiko for a few minutes, came back, and
was like, &quot;I'll prepare a topic for next time,&quot; and I was all, &quot;we can still talk
about whatever, if you'd like,&quot; but she politely declined.</p>
