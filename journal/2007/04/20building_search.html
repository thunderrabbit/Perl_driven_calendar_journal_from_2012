<p>Last night was the night Reiko and I went looking at a couple of different buildings where our
office might be moved.  The building the president likes was closed, so we couldn't scope it, but it
*is* very close to the station.  It's two levels in a small building, so I doubt I will prefer it
over the first building we looked at.</p>

<p>It featured a huge room on one level, about 3 times bigger than what we have now.  And its
neighbors are a beauty salon and a nail salon, so we might help/get crossover traffic.</p>

<p>We'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Oh!  We were looking for the next building, and the slack-ass who gave us the information had
transposed the numbers in the address!!  We walked around for like 35 minutes looking for 2-7-10,
but it should have been 2-10-7.</p>

<p>Bitch!</p>

<p>I was pretty unimpressed with the quality of service there....</p>
