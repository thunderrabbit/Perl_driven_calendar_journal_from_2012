<p>Headed back to the station after hugs to Kumi, and then got the good news that she'll be at the
Friday thing as well.  Cool!  I'll very likely see her again, then.  Hand shake with Shag, then
Kumi, then a cool handshake with Tamau went awry, and turned into alternating fist to fist
punches.  See you Friday!</p>

<p>They headed up to the southwest bound platform, and the rest of us to my platform.  Bye to
Little J, Bruno, Yasuko on the train bound for Oimachi, then jumped on my train with Rob, Hisa and
Julie, LJ's girl.  Only two stations to my stop as I explained to Rob where &quot;that other
train&quot; (Oimachi) goes -vs- where we were going.</p>

<p>It's nice to have a bit of a sense of the Tokyo train system.</p>
