<p>Went to McD's after saying bye to Sanpo, just to check email and see if I got a response from
Blythe.  (yes.)  Nearby a guy was doing some card magic tricks, with a crowd of 5 around him, two
of whom were squealing with shock at the tricks.  I headed over to see what was up.</p>

<p>Basically, the coolest trick was variants of sorting the deck between red and black.  They'd all
be shuffled, and then he'd go through the deck pulling out 4 aces or so, and then put the deck down
and do a trick with the aces.  Then he'd go back to the deck and be like, &quot;remember what I
said about the black cards being heavier than the red cards?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;yah&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, all we have to do to sort the cards is *wait*, and they'll be sorted.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure enough: all the red cards on top and all the black cards on the bottom.</p>

<p>What??????</p>
