<p>It could have happened a few days ago when Mike announced our internet connection will be cut
off soon.  I had happily been listening to iTunes all night (this is relevant because all my music
is stored on Amazon's S3), and this morning had just set iTunes to only play songs it hadn't played
yet.  (not sure why the randomness had some songs played 6 times, and some songs played 0 times,
but whatever)  &quot;Voices Carry&quot; by 'til Tuesday, &quot;This is Ponderous&quot; by 2NU, and
then several Beastie Boys songs from a live album recorded in Germany.</p>

<p>Had just paused the music during &quot;Three MC's and One DJ&quot; and headed down to get some
foodage.  Saw a guy on the phone standing inside a control room thing next to the elevator, and
actually guessed they might be *installing* our new service, which I'm glad to say Mike signed up
for already (just yesterday, and at my repeated request).</p>

<p>Got 1.5 liters of OJ, a slice of pizza, and a bowl of some sorta soup, headed upstairs past the
guy behind the scenes, and covered the pizza and soup in cheese, and tossed them into the toaster
oven and microwave oven, for 3 minutes each, respectively.</p>

<p>Balanced pizza on soup bowl on plate in my right hand, orange juice bottle under my left arm,
carefully didn't drop anything while opening the door to get into my room.  Sat back down, put on my
headphones, clicked play.</p>

<p>(!) This song does not exist; would you like to look for it?</p>

<p>clicked play again.</p>

<p>again.</p>

<p>Clicked Yes to search for it.  Jungle Disk wasn't responding.</p>

<p>Oh shizah.</p>

<p>Flipped over to Firefox and saw under Quick Contacts, &quot;Unable to reach Gmail.  Please check
your internet connection.&quot;</p>

<p>Shit.  Plus I have a meeting online with Tariq at 12:15pm.</p>

<p>(haha; Michael just woke up.)</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Howdy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Today's the Big Day!&quot; I shouted to him in the living room.</p>

<p>No response yet.  Maybe he'll discover the awful truth before I finish this sentence and walk
into the living room.</p>
