<p>Kumiko drew a map of Kichijoji for me, and suggested that we go to the nearby park!  We left the
lesson and walked over there... about 7 minute walk each way and about 10 minutes to look around.
Good times.  I must say that's about the most exciting lesson I've ever had.</p>

<p>Tomorrow she's going to come to ultimate!</p>

<p>I'm totally tired, but I just want to say I was happily reminded of Hermann Park and the zoo and
pond in Houston.  I'd like to see what it looks like now.  Hmmm.</p>
