<p>I stayed awake for more of that than the last time.  There were two new parts of the exercise that
I hadn't noticed before when I did it a few days ago.  I was in a sorta dream state while he was
explaining those parts of floating and moving backwards.  I sorta think I have a different feeling
between Focus 10 and Focus 12, but not realy sure what it will be like for me.</p>

<p>I saw Tariq in one of my dream states, and I was going to show him something, and then I was
like, wait-a-minute, and I sent him away so I could finish the exercise at hand.</p>
