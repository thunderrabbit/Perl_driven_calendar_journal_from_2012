<p>Yesterday at work, I had like 3 lessons in a row of the worst variety.  よろしく, with no
freakin' idea what they want to do.  No homework, no questions, no nothin'.  Ffaauuckkkkin A.</p>

<p>The last of those three was a pair of guys named Miki and Keigo. (( When they first registered
over the phone, their names were written down as Miki and Keiko, two <em>obviously</em> female
names.  What a funny schock to realize they were guys!  I had never seen Miki as a guy's name, and
have yet to see Keiko as a guy's name.))  I hadn't had a lesson with them before.  They came in like
Mari and Chika on day one, with no ideas, no questions, no paper, no books, no notebooks, no
anything.</p>

<p>I worked hard not to bitch them out in an angry manner, and tried in a gentle manner; I was like,
[What do you want to study?]  and Miki was like, &quot;English.&quot;</p>

<p>I wrote &quot;CAT&quot; on a piece of paper.  &quot;Please repeat: cat.&quot; and then
&quot;DOG&quot; and &quot;please repeat: dog&quot; but they were still like deer in headlights.</p>

<p>&quot;This is English,&quot; I assured them.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>I checked what book they had been using before, grabbed my copy, turned to a <em>random</em> page
that they had ostensibly studied before, given they were reportedly on page 90 of the textbook.</p>

<p>&quot;Please read&quot;</p>

<p>I had them both read the page, and then asked if they had any questions.</p>

<p>No questions.</p>

<p>I used two popsicle sticks to cover vertical columns of the text.</p>

<p>&quot;Please read.&quot;</p>

<p><em>That</em> finally got something.</p>

<p>[Oh... speaking a language is more than just *reading*, but actually *thinking*]</p>

<p>Long story shortened: I challenged them against each other: Miki got 5 points, Keigo got 1.  Both
were up from an initial score of -1 (negative one).</p>
