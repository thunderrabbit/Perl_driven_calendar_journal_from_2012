<p>"Today" I read the first chapter in each of my books.  That was my
first homework blockade.  I went to the school to hang out and I saw
Caleb walking to his room with Audrey, the girl who did the shrill
giggle sound file on the NeXT, and his roommate.  I went with them to
check out Caleb's new computer.  While I played on it, Caleb and
Audrey were totally kissing.  I didn't pay attention too much until
they sang some lines from Rocky Horror Picture Show.  A bit later, I
noted that Audrey was totally kissing Caleb's roommate.  Dude.</p>
