<p>We did inventroy in the pharmacy from 8AM to 11:30AM.  Then I went
home and got ready for the Great Super Soaker War Castle of Dreams
Party.  I brought 3 gallons of gatorade and a lot of carrots.  As I
arrived, Windy the Wise came out and watched as the wetness of the
carrots caused one of the gatorades to drop out of the bag and cleanly
break the entire bottom off the bottle and be emptied in 1/2 second.
We talked and chilled inside for a while until the GSSW started in the
pool.  I went out there and it was great.  The war was mostly mayhem
and fantastic.  While we were at the pool, Trikshot came up to the
fence, "this is Guenivere.  This is Thunder Rabbit."  She was
beautiful.  So so so pretty.  I was totally smiling as I offered to
help her carry stuff up.  She was fun.  I went back to the pool and
requested that she join the fun.  She sat up on the steps and watched
at first and then joined us.  I was totally carefully flirting with
her.

<p>At one point, I was crouching by the pool filling up the water tank
to the gun I was using.  Night Mage came up behind me and pushed me,
so I braced my hands on the edge of the pool and pushed my legs out
away from the pool so that he lost all his leverage.  I didn't go in.
Dude.  2 of Windy & Tara's kids, Speed Racer and Snow White were
there, trying often to push me in.  Each time, I would grab them and
throw them in.  Finally Speed jumped onto my back and Snow pushed from
one side- so I was leaning over to dump Speed in over my head and to
pick up Snow and throw her in when someone pushed me from behind.
They both fell in and I went in on top of Snow White.  Bonk.  As I
oriented myself, I noted that my leg had gone through the arm hole of
Snow's one piece bathing suit.  Whoops. So as she was standing up, I
got my leg out and grabbed the strap and put it back on her shoulder
where it belonged.  Cool.

<p>We all played and played.  Guenivere hopped into the hot tub soon
after I did, and Shadow Thief and Poet and Speed Racer joined.  That
was fun.  I sat underwater for several seconds (probably one minute).
Fun.  We also did some chicken fights.  That was enjoyable.  As a
base, I held my partner up (Speed Racer I think) through 4 other
teams.  Cool.

<p>Once, Jack Dracula was having trouble with his water gun.  I
watched this happen:  he pointed the gun up and looked down the barrel
and fired it at the same time.  PPsssshhhhh right in his face.  Oh my
gosh that was hilarious to see his expression.  He was so embarassed
and thinking "I don't believe I just did that."  I laughed and told
him, "there <em>will</em> be a message about that."  and patted him on
the back.

<p>We went inside and ate and then played Castle Charades.  My team
was Windy the Wise, Black Magus, Thunder Rabbit, and Guenievere.  I
sat beside her.  We played for about an hour.  I did "ain't she sweet"
and I can't remember the other - But I did them both successfully.  We
broke the game for a while to get drinks and such.  When I came back
into the room, Shadow Thief was brushing Guenivere's hair, and she was
in <em>Heaven</em>! Oh my gosh I was so stunned and jealous.

<p>Apparently it was very obvious that I was jealous by the way I was
watching her.

<p>The game resumed after a while, and I got to sit beside her again.
I rubbed her back some with my left hand, and then invited her to sit
in front of me so I could use both hands.  She said no and actually
asked me to stop rubbing entirely, so I did.

<p>The game ended and we went into the room containing the Castle and
played in there.  I came back into the living room and noted Guenivere
on the couch, so I lay in the middle of the floor.  A few seconds
later, I heard a flop of papers land by my head.  I looked, and Laura
had tossed her law school catalog to me.  Dude.  I noted her
initials.  Cool.  I told her, "cool initials."  She smiled, and I got
a tad bit of courage and decided to sit by her on the couch.  I almost
sat just on the edge, but I decided, "that is stupid.  Sit beside her
like she's a normal body and be her friend."  So I did.  We talked
about her school thoughts and prices and how cool the schools were.
(either she'll go to UH because it's good and inexpensive and
convenient, or to Chicago school because it's a great school)  As we
sat, I found out that she's going to <em>graduate</em> school.
Whoah.  The girl is <em>smart</em>.  I was glad that I chose to be her
buddy.

<p>Someone announced that someone else had spent 30 minutes so far
writing an otherwise short message to Guenivere.  So we went in
there.  On the other computer, there was a cool word processor on, s/
(*) so I typed, "Thunder Rabbit was here."  and then my tagline
"... Oh, and here is the key to the restroom."  and then "~~~
Bluewave/Max " A few minutes later, Shadow Thief gave me a hard copy
of it, "109 point font" he says and handed me two sheets of paper.  He
had printed it out on the ink jet printer.  Cool.

<p>Black Magus and Shadow Thief prepared to leave and I walked them
out.  Shadow asked, "Why were you giving me those weird looks [while I
brushed her hair]?"  I told him it was because I was stunned and
jealous.  I told him that I was in lust with her at first, but then I
decided to be her friend.  I told them that I intended to apologize to
her for flirting so much with her, but that wasn't quite the right
word.  "obnoxious flirt." said Shadow.  Perfect.  I told him "thank
you. that is the term I shall use."

<p>Black Magus looked up at the sky.  A second later he looked back at
us and said, "Damn!  I have to go to Brenham tonight!"  "What the
hell???" we responded.  "I can't see the stars for these darn lights."
Ha.  we laughed.  Then I looked up at them and said, "Damn!  I have to
go to New Orleans tonight!  And be back my 11 AM!"  Then Damn... to
Jupiter  Damn ... to Alpha Centauri.. then "Damn!  I have to
Circumnavigate the universe tonight!"  Funny.  They left. and I
returned to the Castle. (!!)

<p>After a while Trikshot, Guenivere and I walked Guenivere to her
car.  She was in her car and Kirt and I both obviously wanted to talk
to her.  In her words, I looked like "a classic image of a young boy,
carving an arc in the sand, hands clasped behind his back, asking a
girl to his first dance."

<p>So we both wanted to talk.  She had to leave, so I just told her,
"Laura, I apologize for being an obnoxious flirt."  She smiled and
said it was Ok, & that she didn't mind at all.  Cool.

<p>After that, Kirt and I talked for about 2 or so hours until almost
3am.  We talked about Guenivere and what he wants in a girl and what I
want and computers and everything..

<p>Sunday morning I left a private message for Laura on the Castle.  I
gave her my address and phone number.  She called Sunday at about
10PM.  We talked until 2AM.  We discussed everything that occured at
the Castle Party and laughed about every inch of it.  My jealousy, and
flirting and coments that I had made, ("You know you've got me by the
ears.") the fact that she didn't flirt back to much becausekrit was
there.  So funny.  We flirted like crazy over the phone.  She gave my
a verbal back massage at the very end, just to ensure that I would
have sweet dreams.  Wonderful As we hung up, she said, "Goodnight,
Snuggle Bunny."

<p>Monday I was dancing all day at work.  I was ecstatic.  I was
singing and carrying on; everyone knew I had a new girl.  4:30PM came
and I raced home to see if Laura had called.  <em>She had come
by</em>.  There was a note in the mailbox saying she had come out to
see if she could find me.  AAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!  I read the note about 20
times.  Oh my god she had been right here!  She called me at about
10pm and we talked till about 1AM.  We confirmed a lunchtime meeting
today at 1PM (6 hours from now )  I behan to describe my back massage
method on her.  "Is this phone sex?"  she asked.  "If you want it to
be." She begged me to stop after a while because she couldn't stand
just to imagine it, but not feel it.

<p>We discussed genealogy, and she will show me around some archives
some time.  Cool.  She was impressed and pleased that I was
interested. 

<p>At the very end, she said, "Goodnight, Snuggles."  Oh - I asked her
what her favorite snuggle position was.  She describe one of my
favorite, too.  Me snuggled in behind her, mathcing her body
countrous.  Word.  RIGHT!!!

<p>(It's now Tuesday morning (I started this entry last night.)  Laura
called at the (!!) page 109) See the "s/" on page 108 by the (*)?  that "/" was
designed to be an "o" but the phone rang as I was writing it.  It was
Tammy.  I jerked when the phone rang.  Whoah!!  Funny.

<p>"Animals are not spare parts."  apparently read the sign of some
animal right protesters in response to a guy receiving a baboon
liver.  I just heard that via Barsky on 104 KRBE.  cool.

<p>I decided to give Castle of Dream names and real names.

<p>This morning I woke up at about 5AM because the stupid fish tank was so loud.  I went in there, and noted that the tank was only half full.  Holy Shit.  It turns out that over the night, one of the hoses had come loose and was siphoning the water onto the floor.  Damn...  I filled the tank partway back up and I'm letting it be oxygenated and lose its chlorine and stuff.
