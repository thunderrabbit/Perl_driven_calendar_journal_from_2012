<p>Went to Jerusalem Hotel with Rochelle, Serena, Marisa, Ed and
Keemah (sp; I've never really learned his name), but they were all
booked with a wedding party so we headed over to Philadelphia, but
ended up at a gas station that had food and hookah pipes.</p>

<p>Marisa helped me get a picture of Francois smoking, though
ironically I didn't get a photo of the group.  Serena was on my left,
with Rochelle on her left.  Marisa on my right with Ed on her right
and then K-man opposite me.  We spoke a lot of politics as viewed
from different countries.</p>

<p>Back to the Faisal with Rochelle keeping warm by linking arms with
both Serena and me.  We tried a circular connection, but didn't make
it too far like that.  "We'll just spin around in circles and not
actually go anywhere..."</p>

<p>Back to the Faisal I sat around another hookah pipe for a bit and
then chatted with Rochelle (while giving her a bit of a massage)
until she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Tonight is Serena and Rochelle's last night at the Faisal for a
while; they are excited to be heading into Gaza tomorrow!  This trip
is beginning after 9 months of preparation.</p>

<p>I am sure tomorrow Ben and I will speak fondly of them both.</p>
