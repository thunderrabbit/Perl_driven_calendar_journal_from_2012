<p>Oh my god the funniest thing!  I just went downstairs to the bakery
where there's a guy with moustache who is the friendliest and funniest
of all the little shops in the area.  When Sarah and I first started
our nightly food-purchase missions, we ended up always going there
first, just to joke with him in the <em>very limited</em> shared
language we have.</p>

<p>If there are no other customers, I will often "pay" with Japanese
money.  He will inspect it mightily, we discuss its value, and then he
gives it back and I pay with NIS ("New Israeli Shekels," I think).</p>

<p>Today I greeted him as I walked in and he greeted me back and I
grabbed a tub of hummus and a bottle of Pear Cactus Apple juice and
put them on the counter.  He said, 'twenty shekels,' and put out his
hand.</p>

<p>I put a 0.05 shekel coin in his hand.  He looked at it for about a
half second and he tossed it backwards over his shoulder, never to be
seen again, and put his hand again.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHHAAHAAA!!!!  I burst out laughing, for there was nothing
else I could do.</p>
