<p class="date">11:11am JST Wednesday 30 November 2005</p>

<p>11:11am is my official starting time.  It's now actually the next
day, 24 hours later, and I'm in Atami.  But,</p>

<p>Riding to Odawara was tough.  I don't know if it was worse than
going to Gora station (certainly not), but it may just be that I am
tired now.</p>

<p>Ack; anyway, I took 246 for about 60+ km, 255 for about 20+ km, 1
(for just a smidgen), then 135 for just a bit.  By that time it was
getting properly dark, and *and* I was next to the beach.</p>

<p>If by beach I mean a gravel coated area with large rocks strewn
about and a rather tall highway sailing overhead plus a gently waving
ocean, than that's where I was.  I arrived just before 5pm and wrote
in my TJ Bike diary (after writing part of a postcard to Fred)</p>

<blockquote><p>
5pm 30 NOV 2005 In Odawara 小田原 now on the rocky beach with a
rather big highway above us and highway 135 next to us.  It's rather
cold, but only slight wind.  Cloudy skies, but not enough to rain.
Composed parts of a new song to Sir Mix-a-lot's Posse on Broadway</p>

Me and TJ Bike at home away from home
rollin on the highway got a helmet on my dome
Francois' on the back side peepin' out the bag
But ya better not laugh or ya gonna get tagged.
Francois got a glock an' he ain't afraid to use it.
If he see you smile then you best believe he shoot it...

<p>It sounds like I'm a bit self conscious to have a stuffed rabbit,
but [after that punky fake-email kid sent me a mean comment] yeah.
I'm a bit HUNGRY but a bit cold .. chill for a bit and see what I
do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I climbed into my sleeping bag and almost instantly fell asleep.
A spam email on my phone woke me up at which point I turned off my
phone, brushed my teeth, settled in for the night.</p>

<p>for the record, I went through a tunnel (the kanji for which I
cannot read in my book, but it's 新(something)(something)) at 2:50pm
yesterday. It's on 246 just east of where 246 intersects 70 and
71.</p>
