<p>Suzanne asked if anyone had a bit of laundry to add to her bit of
laundry.  Ben and I put our laundry together and came up with a full
load, and I offered to walk with Suzanne to the laundry place in the
old city.  I couldn't bear to imagine letting her do my laundry for
me; I don't know her well enough for all that.</p>

<p>Turns out the laundry place is Mike's Center, where Rochelle and
Serena went for internet access.  It's a convenience/service center:
laundry, drinks, internet, international calls, optical mice and
computer keyboards, and taxi service to Ben Gurion Airport for 50 NIS
per person.</p>

<p>We dropped off our loads and headed toward Jaffa Gate and arced
around to the outskirts of the old city, and found half a tunnel,
while I fabricated a story of how I met Francois.  We came out the
other side near Zion Gate, headed down into the valley of the Mount of
Olives, walked down into the East Jerusalem Palestinian slum of a
neighborhood and then back up toward old city, back into Zion Gate,
and to her favorite sunset watching area.</p>

<p>It was filled with teens and the opposite of quiet, so we walked a
randomish direction and ended up on the rooftops that would make an
awesome yet rough skate park terrain that had all variety of obstacles
from walls and rooftops to benches and playground equipment.  We
discovered a white cat with one blue eye and one green eye and
discovered ourselves on top of where we had been previously on the way
to Jaffa Gate after Mike's Center, but with no way to get down.</p>

<p>Backtracked until we found some steps off the rooftops and walked
to a restaurant she knew where she treated me to a lovely dinner of
falafels and pitas and several sauces during which time I conceived a
plan for navigation on my website for geocoding pictures and journal
entries.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the restaurant building were two postcard racks
with old postcards, many of which seemed dusty and warped with age.  I
had been tempted to grab one on the way up the stairs, and was tempted
again on the way down.  I chose one conveniently located by my hand
with the intention of letting the card tell me if I could have it.</p>

<pre>                Mount of Temptation</pre>

<p>it read.  Fair enough; I put it in my pocket.</p>

<p>Headed back to Mike's Center and found her laundry done and she
paid.  I gave him 100 NIS note to pay for mine, but he was like, "slow
down; it isn't ready yet; wait until it's finished." and we checked
the load in the dryer, but it was still a bit damp, so Suzanne and I
shared stories for about 20 minutes and then I checked again.  They
were fine, so we put Ben's into a bag and mine into my laundry bag and
Ben's bag into my laundry bag and headed out.</p>

<p>Without paying.</p>

<p>I noticed soon thereafter, but didn't say anything and accepted the
gift as a blessing.  Told Ben about the good fortune and he said I
could have gotten 22.5 NIS from him and made money overall.  Yes;
that's true, but no.</p>
