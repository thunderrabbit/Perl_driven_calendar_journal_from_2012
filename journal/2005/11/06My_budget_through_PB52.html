<p>I've been a bit concerned about finances, and have put together
this budget:</p>

<p>While in Jerusalem, et. al.:</p>

<pre>
lodging: 25 NIS / day
food:    20 NIS / day
travel:  20 NIS / day
        --------
         65 NIS / day * 11 days = 715 NIS = 153 USD
</pre>

<p>Then while I'm in Tokyo, et. al.:</p>

<pre>
travel:  1000 YEN / day
food:    2000 YEN / day
        -------
         3000 YEN / day * 38 days = 114,000 YEN = 963 USD
</pre>

<p>While I'm on P&B:</p>

<pre>
expenses in port: $50 / day?
</pre>

<p>Total around $1300, which would depletes my bank and maxes out my
credit card to $1900</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>
