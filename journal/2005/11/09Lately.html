<p>I just want to capture the essence of the last couple of days.
I've been chillin' in the Faisal, not wanting to spend much money,
enjoying being online, sleeping, folding origami..  Basically just on
vacation away from the insanity so easily available outside.</p>

<p>I haven't heard from Niveen in a couple days (nor have I tried to
contact her recently) but I've only got a week left before I go back
to Japan.</p>

<p>Today I'm going to visit Rami at PalVision, presumably to write
something for him.  Tomorrow Rami and I are going for an overnight
adventure in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Oh little town of Bethlehem, I'll get to see you soon.</p>

<p>I've been hanging out with Ben in our little cozy internet cafe of
a table in the middle of this dorm style room with 10 bunks.  We have
one cable coming in through the window above the door feeding TCP/IP
to one of our machines, which in turn broadcasts a wireless signal
the other machine can use.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>
