<p>Going to bed early tonight because we are getting up even earlier
tomorrow to go to Bil'in.  It will definitely be different tomorrow
than the previous times I've been to Bil'in; there will be a specific
demonstration with Palestinians chaining themselves to trees.  I have
specifically specified I am not arrestable; I will stay in the
background photographing the action.</p>

<p>I plan to not take my computer.</p>
