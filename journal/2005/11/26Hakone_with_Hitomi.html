<p>We met in Yokohama near the ticket gates of the red train (Keikyu
(actually Keihin Kyukou) line) the name of which I had forgotten in
my five weeks away.</p>

<p>Took the Tokaido line to Odawara and then the next line to a
station not quite to Hakone Yumoto where we made _____ and _____, two
Japanese foods that I don't really like, but now know sorta how they
are shaped.  Basically they are shaped of a thick gooey batter that is
apparently based on ground up fish.  The battery is formed into
various shapes and then baked (cake shape) or turned on a spit (tube
shaped) until the batter gels.  The texture is quite rubbery and they
have a very plain taste.</p>

<p>We took the train to Gora (where I rode TJ Bike one time) and then
rode the cable car up the mountain and the gondola even further up.
Gora and the surrounding lines were quite crowded, given that it was
around 2pm on a Saturday.</p>

<p>We each ate 2 "black eggs" that are supposed to give us 7 extra
years of life each (I'll get about 63 extra years given the number I
guesstimate I've eaten over my tenure in Japan) and then headed back
toward the base of the mountain.  The line for the next gondola
(older, with smaller cars that go down the other side of the mountain)
was simply too long to be worth the wait.</p>

<p>Chowed at a quiet restaurant not so many steps off the main street
next to HakoneYumoto station and are now in a hotel sorta near
Tounosawa station.</p>
