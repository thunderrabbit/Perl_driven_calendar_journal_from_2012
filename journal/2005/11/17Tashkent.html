<p>Cool.  It's basically bedtime for me, but I've apparently got an
hour.  Oh I got my flight info hooked up:  Flight 527 with a boarding
time of 22:10.  Two hour layover.  Gonna try and sleep to get my body
on Tokyo Time.</p>

<p>Slept for a bit over an hour in the airport.  On the plane now in
the frontest of seats that are not First Class.</p>

<p>I was disallowed to take a picture of the moon with airplane tail
in the foreground.</p>

<p>The dude wouldn't even acknowledge it was beautiful.</p>
