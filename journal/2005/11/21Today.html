<p class="date">2:25am JST Tuesday 22 November 2005</p>

<p>Woke up around 2 and rode TJ Bike to Takadanobaba (about 12 km)
where I got to see Matt, Auds, Joel, Josh, Yuuka, Natalie, Masae,
and Sachie.  Met Ken and Imo as well.</p>

<p>I talked with Joel for a bit who said there were some concerns
about some of the content of my journal entries.  Some pictures of me
breaking the rules on PB 49 freaked out Auds who feared she could be
fired for not having kept us "in line," though there's realistically
no way she could have controlled us.... So he asked me to think about
ways we could help balance artistic license vs the other concerns, and
it was all good and friendly and I basically decided to remove the
pics [ (this is being written 36 hours later) ] (they are actually
still on my site, but not linked from within the journal entries) and
change all references to the name of the organization to PB or Pb or
P/B or P&amp;B or P-B or P_B.  It took quite a bit to change the
directory names of the image directories, and keep all the links
linked, but I *think* I did it; I haven't seen any 404 emails show
up.</p>

<p>I emailed Josh to tell him what I had done, but haven't heard back
from him.</p>

<p>Natalie and I hugged a lot and were realllly gooey happy about
seeing each other again.  I came to her class for a brief hello to her
two students, and she treated me to dinner at a Chinese place down the
street in exchange for a back massage that I haven't yet given
her.</p>

<p>Rode TJ Bike back to Jesse's and am here now.</p>
