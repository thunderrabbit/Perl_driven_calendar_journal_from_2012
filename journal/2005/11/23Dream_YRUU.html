<p class="dream">Pulling together a lot of luggage for a big lock-in
with a lot of old faces and new people i the big auditorium place
with various rooms off the sides.</p>

<p class="dream">A guy was like, "this could really have been done
more efficiently; we've waited until the last minute to bring in all
this luggage.."  and I was like, "it's not the last minute; people are
still coming in!"  (which I meant in a "life is good" way; no worries,
mate!  but not sure if it came acrosss that way)</p>

<p class="dream">I had had a box that I couldn't figure out whose it
was, and Sarah was like, "did you look inside?" and I jokingly said,
"I'm scared to look inside," though I actually already had and found
tubes and ear flushing components, and she was like, "look inside to
see whose it is," so I looked again at the contents; some ear
flusher-outers and a name on the inside: "May" from England.  and I
was like, "who is May?"  cause I had no idea who that could be, and
Arlene was like, "May is from England, so some youth from England must
have borrowed the box," and I was like, "aight" and then I walked back
into the main room and I saw Anna over at a table sitting happily
drawing or someting on the other side of a cafeteria table, and I got
down on my hands and knes to sneak over and crawl under the table to
go hug her when I heard my name called in front of me, and making
happy eye contact with Anna who noticed me when they called my name,
and I crawl/slid over to Denise (DRE at Emerson) noticing the floor
was realllly slick and good for crawl/sliding and she was all like,
"Rob, I see you've taken up painting" and the woman next to Denise
interrupted quickly, "Rob; this is Robin from England; it's her box,"
and I was like, "cool!  nice to meet you" and then to Denise, I was
like, "yeh; I like to paint from time to time" and she continued, I
remembered when you were here last, you used to do atomic
lettering.. and I was like, "what?  what's that?"  and she goes, "you
know, making letters with dots" and I was like, "oh!" and then
jokingly, "yeah that old stuff... I didn't know it had a name; I
thought it woudl just be called like pixelation, not "atomic
lettering" but okay, yeah cool" but she didn't respond, but I didn't
really care if she did cause I wanted to go back and say HI to Anna
from whom I had been doubly distracted, and I turned around and found
an empty seat beside her but then another person beside that seat, so
I was thinking "I hope I don't scare this other person too much; oh
well." and I crawled under the table and popped up at the seat beside
Anna and we hugged each other at the same time as I stood up beside
her and picked her up out of the chair and our huge hug just locked
her onto me and we laughed and giggled and just basked in the shared
memories of all the hilarious days we had shared at Chuck E Cheese (*)
in the old days.</p>

<p>Such a lovely dream moment brought me happily awake.</p>

<p>(*) It appears that I didn't write online about those adventures;
that was about the time I was transitioning from book to online
journaling.  But <a

entry</a> gives a sense of what it was like.  And the Wednesdays
before that.</p>
