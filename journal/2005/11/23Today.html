<p>Of note today:</p>

<p>I got to talk to Kris for a while on Skype!  She had just gotten
the Skype hookup and I was the first person to talk to her that way.
She's doing well and looking forward to hearing my thoughts on PB 52
which is basically the same as her pb47.</p>

<p>I got to talk to Niveen for a while on Skype!  She asked me what I
felt about Palestine now that I've been there, but I wasn't too
talkative; she was more talkative than me.</p>

<p>I got to talk to Madeline for a while on Skype!  I haven't talked
to her in *years* and I'm quite happy to report that we will probably
hang out when PB52 goes to Argentina!!  She might even join the voyage
for a week..  Wow!</p>

<p>I spent some time getting familiar with <a
href="http://couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing.com</a>, which seems to be
a pretty cool site.  I may try to couchsurf around the world!</p>

<p>Then it was 7am and I went to sleep until 3:30pm.</p>

<p>Woke up; wrote my dream; got a call from Hitomi whose brother drove
her and my bags here to Jesse's, saving me a big hassle and a lot of
time.  I was quite thankful, but he didn't hang around to chat.  Or
even say HI.  But Hitomi and I went to Shibuya (after not finding a
drink bar at either of the two local Royal Host restaurants here) to
the Royal Host and drink bar where I got about a liter of orange juice
and two hot cocoas and 200ml of Calpis water.  And four fried chicken
pieces, all for 960 yen including 300 yen round trip train tickets to
Shibuya from Jesse's.</p>

<p>Hitomi and I taught some Japanese and English respectively, and she
bought me a dessert after which I was quite thoroughly stuffed.</p>

<p>We scoped out the touring map of this region, and I pretty much
decided on a route to ride TJ Bike from here to Atami (for CDF meeting
on 1 December) and then to Earth Embassy's location.  Keiko texted me
and said she moved to Yokosuka, so maybe I will swing by there along
the way.</p>

<p>Hitomi also gave me namecards featuring my favorite Francois in
Acapulco picture and several postcards.  We talked about making some
Francois branded playing cards (optimally with Francois posed as the
face cards as well)...  I know I can find companies online that offer
to make T-shirts with any image I want....</p>

<p>And she gave me M&amp;Ms and sembe and cheesie poofs and dried
mango!  Wow wow wow!</p>

<p>Back to Jesse's to discover Michael and Billie from Gaba slash
Jesse's church hanging out and chowing some thanksgiven dinner.  I
surprised Billie with all the places I *hadn't* visited in West
Bank.</p>

<p>Jesse handed over an extra battery that Jay (from Gaba) donated
for my computer!  Holy cow wow!!  So thankful!!</p>

<p>Right now I can't stop eating the M&amp;Ms Hitomi gave me even
though my stomach is beginning to complain.  Argh.</p>

<p>Okay; I put them away.  Looks like I ate 7 oz, or 200 grams.</p>

<p>Oh!  Hitomi also bought a little tube of fluoride gel!  (My old one
finished around the end of PB 49.)</p>

<p>I was just taking a shower and getting ready for bed when I thought
of a way I'd like to enhance my source code viewer, so I think I will
work on that now, but... why?</p>

<p>Cause I like the challenge.</p>
