<p class="date">7:07am IST Thursday 17 November 2005</p>

<p>Packed, and eating, I'm basically ready to walk out the door of
the Faisal, the best hostel in town.  Just gotta say bye to my peeps.</p>

<p class="date">8:17am IST Thursday 17 November 2005</p>

<p>A bit (30 mins) later than I expected, but the taxi-bus swooped by
Jerusalem Hotel to pick me up for an 11:30am flight at Ben Gurion for
the low low price of 45 NIS.</p>

<p>Last night I was a bit bummed about all my friends gone and not
getting to say bye to Sarah, but she showed up(!) after also going
through the nightmare cattle facility out of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class="date">8:27am</p>

<p>It's interesting to note that I am distinctly nervous when I think
about the predicted confrontation regarding getting my laptop through
customs.  Jason says they often try to intimidate people into giving
up their laptops.  I trust that they won't try such tactics with me; I
am visualizing a smooth exit with happy faces.</p>

<p class="date">10:35am</p>

<p>In the airport; through security.</p>

<blockquote><p>Jason: they never told me they needed to keep my
laptop, and though they didn't treat it with the gentle touch that I
do, it still works fine.  They did, however, try to log me out, but
gave up when a bunch of dialog boxes came up asking if I wanted to
close multiple tabs in Flock.</p>

<p>At one point, they asked me, "where is the camera?" which I assume
means they assumed I had a camera.  I pulled it out of my pocket and
they inspected it, turned it on, pushed a lot of buttons, and took a
picture with it.  They asked to see my cellphone, and I promptly gave
them the one I have from Japan, having given the one I borrowed from
Niveen back to her, and they asked me if I could speak Japanese and
"knew what all these symbols meant" on the face of the phone.</p>

<p>"Yes.  They are Japanese characters."</p>

<p>I was not strip searched, but I did have to leave my luggage in
their care as I was carefully searched with a metal detector.  They
X-rayed my jacket (with Francois in the pocket) and hat and little
tiny padded Japanese good luck charm thing when its metalic
embroidered thread triggered the metal detector.  I think they X-rayed
my shoes, too, because the rivets in the back made the thing beep.</p>

<p>When I got my jacked back, Francois was in the *other* pocket, but
he seem unscathed.</p>

<p>About 5 people asked me why I came and who I saw and where I
went.  I told them I took pictures in Bil'in and helped with the
olive harvest in Nablus.  They asked why I came now [this time of
year?] and I explained the olives are ripe at this time of year.</p>

<p>Once I got back to my luggage after the non-strip search, I found
they had packed my pillow very well in one side of the bag, but the
other side with all my clothes and stuff was quite a mess.  I asked
them if I could help, and the guy was like, "sure; you can do it
yourself if you like." I asked what time it was and if I had enough
time for my flight, and he said yes.</p>

<p>Though they asked for my consent first, they <em>opened</em> the
brand new bottle of olive oil that I had bought last night as a
souvenir, but consented to put an "official" sticker on it to explain
to the recipient why it was no longer sealed.  The sticker was just a
barcode something used to identify luggage wrapped around the top of
the bottle.</p>

<p>After they were satisfied that I wasn't carrying the bomb, er, I
mean *a* bomb, I was led by a guy with all my stuff to the airline
check-in counter, where they request proof that I live in Japan or
proof of onward travel from Japan.  Thank goodness I had *just*
received proof of onward travel for Peace Boat, so I could present to
Japanese customs.   And Israeli airport.  After that, he led me with
my carryon through a gate that bypassed the metal detectors for the
masses.  Just after I passed through the gate, I saw a sight that
would make a fantastic jigsaw puzzle: an electric cart/truck thing
with its bed filled about 6 inches deep in scissors and knives and
lighters and all the things that people can no longer use to hijack a
plane.</p>

<p>I asked if I could take a picture because I wasn't ready with my
camera in time and would have to pull it out, etc, and I didn't think
the guy would be down with that.  He assured me with a firm "no," that
I could not take a picture of it.</p>

<p>"Can I take a picture of Francois sitting on it?"</p>

<p>Actually I didn't ask him that, but I thought it would be a great
picture.</p>

<p>So, when leaving Israel though Ben Gurion:</p>

<p><ol>
<li>Have mailed as much stuff back as you can afford.</li>
<li>2 hours is long enough to get through security at the airport.</li>
<li>have yer camera ready to take a picture of the cart loaded with scissors</li>
</ol></p>

<p class="date">22:47 JST Thursday 17 November 2005</p>

<p>Watched Mona Lisa Smile(s) starring the uber beautiful Julia Stiles who reminds me so much of uber beautiful Sally in Cali, and then Freaky Friday, which made me cry at the end.</p>

<p>We are about to land in Tashkent in about 25 minutes.  I've just realized that I don't know what connecting flight to take to Narita.  I assume I have to change planes here, but when  I set up a new departure date, I didn't ask about connecting flight information.  I'm sure it will be okay, though.</p>
