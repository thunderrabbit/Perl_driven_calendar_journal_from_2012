<p>Awesome!  I just spent about an hour in a mostly Japanese language
conversation, both speaking and listening.</p>

<p>Before that, I spent probably over an hour chatting with Rochelle,
a big portion of which was spent in a strange theological (?) debate
with Ben, kinda sorta trying to explain why we believe there is more
to life than meat, and that science is a self-limiting construct.</p>

<p>Could not make much headway either way.</p>

<p>Didn't play silent football tonight, but (who-was-it?) got a text
message from Chris and David; they were playing silent football in
Hebron!  It's expanding!!</p>

<p>Even though I'm supposed to be studying Arabic in eight hours, I
am still typing.</p>

<p>Finally got settled on my visa situation today: because I would
basically have to forge two documents to get the Brazilian visa done
in Tel-Aviv, I will go back to Japan early to get it done there.
Unfortunately, there is only 1 flight per week, and the flight that
is quite convenient timing-wise is filled with 7 passengers on the
wait list.  So I went a week ahead and will fly outta here on the
17th of November.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed now.</p>

<p>Have a good night.</p>

<p>I'll type more tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just how long can I keep this up?</p>

<p>Keep going, and I'll find out.</p>

<p>Last one, is right here.</p>

<p>Maybe not.</p>

<p>Now this has got to be the last one.</p>

<p>Okay, then, this one.</p>

<p>Perhaps this will do.</p>

<p>Quit writing new sentences!  Just go to bed!</p>

<p>Right now, I will stop.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right?</p>

<p>Took a bit too long to think of this one.</p>

<p>Unfinished sentences are no longer making sense.</p>

<p>Very good idea to go to bed.</p>

<p>Will I stop this?</p>

<p>Xcruciating circumstances permit a misspelling.</p>

<p>Yes, this is the end.</p>

<p>Zzzzzzzzz.</p>
