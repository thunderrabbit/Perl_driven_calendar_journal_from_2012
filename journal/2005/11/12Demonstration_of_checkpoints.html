<p>There was a demonstration at noon at Qalandia today.  Then it got
moved to a different location at 1pm.  Then it got cancelled
altogether because not enough people (Palestinians?) were able to get
there.  The checkpoints worked, and kept them from demonstrating
against the checkpoints.</p>

<p>Got to talk to a guy who's both American and French and doing a
documentary with some something something here in this crazy area.
Quite interesting to see how he was all shocked at the chaos of
Qalandia, and I can <em>remember</em> being shocked at the chaos of
Qalandia, but after 4 weeks here, I'm over it.</p>

<p>That's messed up.  It's like I'll leave this occupied territory
and people will be like, "what's it like?" and I'll say "meh; not a
big deal."</p>

<p>But in reality:  It's shocking.</p>

<p>Chatted with Ben on the way back; I am pretty focused on the idea
of getting pictures on my site to include coordinates so I can link
them to a google map on my site.  Right now I'm going to go design
what I'd like the user interface to be like, before I get caught up
in code and what other people have done.</p>
