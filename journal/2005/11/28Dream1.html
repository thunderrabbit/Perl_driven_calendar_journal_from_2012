<p class="dream">In a really difficult class with one of my favorite
teachers and he was telling us we would have a list of questions on
five differnet topics, and the answeres to these questions would give
ourselves some insight as to what kind of people we are.</p>

<p class="dream">I wrote down the topics on the top of each page in my
book and was ready to write down the questions, and then the lecture
was finally over (I thought) as he was like, "okay, I'll give you the
questions now," and I thought he would give us a URL of each list of
questions but he instead was giving us topics of some really far out
things like, "american chronyism" and "seahorses" and "topical cream
ointments" and "dna structure in history" and "latest football scores"
and I got shut down as I interrupted his flow at one point, asking him
how these were related or something.  Then as he would write each one
down, he stood in front of the board so I couldn't see it, so I moved
my desk, and he goes, "wanting to make a fuss, but not willing to do
extra credit?" and I was on the verge of tears (for a reason I didn't
understand) and I was like, "I thought we were going to get a list of
questions on a topic, but we are getting a lits of unrelted topics.
We could just write down any old topics and get an even better guage
of what's in our subconsious than having us respond to what's in your
subconsious.  If we just have a list of five broad topics," and I
flipped through my book to find the ones I had written, but couldn't
find them (*) "then that would make sense, but as it is, we are
getting exactly the wrong amount of input; broad topics and specific
topics under them that don't make any sense to anyone but you so they
won't show any insight on ourselves, which was the point of the whole
exercise."</p>

<p class="dream">He considered this point for a moment and I woke
up.</p>

<p>(*) this should have triggered me to realize I was in a dream</p>
