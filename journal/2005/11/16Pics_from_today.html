<p>Hanging out with Niveen today!!  We are en route to Bethlehem,
which is good cause I have wanted to go...</p>

<p>She is shocked at the new settlements and the wall that has been
built in the past 3 years since she was here last.</p>

<p>We still have to get through one checkpoint.</p>

<p>There is now a wall across the road where she used to go in.</p>

<p>"I am about to cry; oh God Rob why did they do this?  I hate them.
I hate them..."</p>

<p>Were her exact words.  Now tell me that this wall doesn't bring more
angst and anger to the Palestinians.</p>

<p>After a few minutes.. "They've split the city into pieces.  This
really sucks."</p>

<p>"Look at all these Israeli flags.  I feel sick, Robert.  They are
so fast at destroying lies.  They are so fast at building the
wall."</p>

<p>"If I was living behind the wall, I would be the first person to
bomb the Israelis."</p>

<p>I am getting pretty tired and for now will just toss pictures up

over his shoulder:</p>
