<p>Wow.</p>

<p>The workshop leader (whose name neither Max nor I know) showed me
how to make long shutter photos on Hitomi's camera!  How totally
fantastic!  I can take pictures of superdark situations and they seem
to come to life!</p>

<p>But even better than that, I can take pictures of ghosts!!</p>

<p>Some ghosts went into the kitchen to snoop about and came out with
pita and hummus, then some sour cream and pita.  Another ghost
wouldn't go into the kitchen, but didn't mind partaking of the
feast.</p>
