<p class="dream">I was a soldier without guidelines, in a driving
school where some students had just finished their course.  Other
people were there, but since the driving school instructors didn't
know them as students, I requested their passports so I could
photocopy them.  They were like, "why do you need our passports?" and
I was like, "I just want to photocopy them so we know who was
here."</p>

<p class="dream">I wouldn't let them out of the building without
handing over their passports, and since I was the one with the power,
they had to oblige.</p>

<p class="dream">Their passports were not little books, but buttons
with various slogans and little knickknacks attached.  I received all
four passport buttons, and had to take them apart and find the actual
photo parts so I could put them in the photocopier and properly
photocopy them.  In order to conserve paper, I wanted to photocopy
them all at once, which required that I take apart all their buttons
at the same time.</p>

<p class="dream">The workspace where I was doing this disassembly was
messy; I tried putting all the button pieces in little piles and
carefully remembering what was whose and which went where and in what
order, but the whole mess just got worse and worse to the point that
I couldn't keep track of everything.  I couldn't find all the pieces,
but I didn't want to just be like, "sorry," and give them back a pile
of rubbish; I had taken their passports on good faith that I would
give them back.</p>

<p class="dream">I got really flustered at not knowing what to do, and
was really quick to wake up when I realized it was a dream.</p>

<p>wow.  what a relief.  I blessed the passport holders of my dream
and trusted they had all their bits and bobs back intact.</p>

<p class="dream">I was carrying a huge fake gun through an exit, and
had to prove it was fake.  I threw it on the ground so the hollow
plastic clatter could be heard, but it sounded like a real gun.  Oops.
I still knew it was fake, so I told the guy he could inspect it.  He
leveled the gun at my face and pulled the trigger.  I made a
bullet-catching hand gesture, then ate the air bullet.  Satisfied at
its disauthenticity, he gave me the gun back and I walked out.</p>
