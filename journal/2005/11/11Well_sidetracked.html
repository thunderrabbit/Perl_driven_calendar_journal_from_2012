<p>Fred sent me a link to a fantastic video:</p>

SUBJECT: this is what i want to be when i grow up
TO:      oh....emm....g.@robnugen.com, Dude

well, okay, i don't want to be an asshat who does this kind of shit,
but i want to be *able* to do this kind of shit.  i would so be a race
car driver if i had a bankroll or a sponsor!

Before you watch the movie, though, be sure you're connected to a
decent stereo--headphones will work too--and have the bass up high.
Also, turn the brightness and contrast up--there's a part where it's
dark, and you won't want to be messing with the controls then.  Your
face will be glued to the screen.

Rob, these're for you:

<p>The video is definitely money; well worth 10 minutes.</p>

<p>But then I checked out the renegadetourist link; anything with
"google" near was worth a peek, and I was like, "woah," cause I had
never really seen google maps in action.</p>

<p>I thought it would be the perfect way to do my TJ Bike adventure;
I wanted a little red line on a map, and this will do it, by golly.</p>

<p>So I <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html">got an
API key</a> and got really sidetracked when trying to figure out how
to use it.</p>

<p>Steps I've done so far:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>have <a href="http://firefox.com/">firefox</a></li>
<li>get <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org">greasemonkey</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Brain shutting down...</p>

<p>The <a
href="http://steeev.f2o.org/mt/2005/05/geotagging_flickr_with_google_maps_and_greasemonkey_part_2.html">coolest
page</a> I've found so far has a pretty step by step way of doing it,
but...   I'm not sure that I want to use flickr.  I have read
somewhere they only allow 100 pics free of charge.  Maybe when I am
less tired I will try it with a few pics, but it seems beyond my
brainpower now.</p>

<p>Holy shitballs!  That was basically easy squeezy.</p>

<p>I don't really know what to do with it, but I have <a
href="http://www.geobloggers.com/?itemID=89796">linked a photo</a> to
a worldmap.</p>

<p>This is GREAT progress toward my desire of a little red line and
photos on a world map.</p>

<p>If I can get this working, I'll be happy to give some money.
Especially to <a
href="http://steeev.f2o.org/mt/2005/05/geotagging_flickr_with_google_maps_and_greasemonkey_part_2.html">steeev.f2o.org</a>!</p>

<p>Stripes.  (short for "Yikes Stripes!", but in this case is sortof a
letdown feeling, perhaps like, "egad."</p>

<p>It's late; I've been farting around on geobloggers website.
Pretty cool.  Really cool, but I can't see how to just have my pics
only; I get all these other users' pics, depending on the map I'm
looking at.  I just want it to be me me me me me!</p>
