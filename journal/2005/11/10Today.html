<p>During the day today I have been thinking about ways to display
pictures on my site.  I have wanted to display them, but they are
just arranged in directories, with no real way for people to know
which ones are recent.</p>

<p>I've been designing an interface... or rather, thinking of things
I'd like to be able to do from a user perspective regarding viewing
pictures.</p>

<p>Basically I'd like to see pics sorted by date slash topic.  The
topic is sorta vexing me cause there are so many possible topics.
Easy would be to use the directories as topics, but they are rather
coarse and arbitrary.</p>

<p>Picture filenames as topics could work, except for topics like
IMG2082.JPG</p>

<p>Still thinking....</p>

<p>I want to have the admin side of it be able to create directories,
create thumbnals of the pictures and put watermaks on the big
pictures, and I also want to just pushbutton create an index of
everything, of course.</p>

<p>I'm considering wrting the user side in PHP and the admin side in
perl, just for the practice in PHP and the security with which I'm
more familiar in perl..</p>
