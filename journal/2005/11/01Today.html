<p>I'm not miles behind, but I have to work to catch up...</p>

<p>I will probably never fill in the gaps of the previous entry.</p>

<p>Earlier today I went to Palestinian Vision and wrote an email for
Rami, basically telling their benefactor that another NGO had kept
funds away from PalVision, but with the benefactor's approval.  The
funds were going to be used for a project in a different city instead
of the original one planned by PalVision (Jerusalem).  Rami still
wanted to do the project in Jerusalem, and wanted to organize a way to
do that.</p>

<p>Also met Nayira, who taught me (and Max) some Arabic, and will
teach me again tomorrow at 10am.</p>

<p>If it works out well, I will offer to pay her for her efforts, and
look into having her suggest an Arabic teachin' book that I can use
while on p\b.</p>

<p>I've just spent the last 2 hours or so talking to Dave from
Chicago,.. getting into deeper sharing of family history and personal
growth issues, but not 100% specifics.  I touched a huge well of
sadness telling him about having broken up with Wende.</p>

<p>He is interested in getting a blog hooked up online.</p>

<p>Silent Football was awesome last night!!  We had 10 players!!</p>

<p>I was dictator first, then Sarah, then Dave.  We played for over 2
hours.  So fantastic!</p>

<p>But right now we are about to get some fooooood!!</p>

<p>I added some pictures from when I <a

in search of the ministry of health.</p>

<p>Food was fun.  Suzanne, Trent, Ben, Dave and I hung out chowing
falafel sandwiches down on the tables basically under the blinky
lights near the Faisal.  We <em>hung out</em> in Jerusalem near
Damascus Gate.  Fucking awesome.</p>
