I have lived in Tokyo for basically two years.  I love the trains;
they are always on time

I love the level of customer service I receive in convenience
stores.  The clerk runs to the register when I walk up with my
purchase.

If I could describe the underlying framework of Japanese society in a
word, I would choose "ordered."  Everything has a place.  Every step
has a sequence.

Japanese seem to wait for the green crosswalk light, regardless of
traffic.


I recently spent some time in Jerusalem, the largest city in the West
Bank, an Israeli-occupied territory of Palestine.

In the Old City of Jerusalem, markets, restaurants and churches fill
different sections called "quarters."  The Jewish quarter has clean
sidewalks and streets, smartly dressed happy children with trees and
playground equipment.  Restaurants where a falafel pita costs 10 NIS.

The Palestinian quarter brims with crowds, sometimes to the point of
not being able to move.  Vending carts for socks, candy, toys,
fruits, nuts, vegetables, pitas, falafels, pomegrantate juice 

Souvenir shops feature prices that seem to change by the minute,
according to how much the customer wants to leave.  I personally was
offered an embroidered bag that went from 15 NIS to 10 NIS to 5 NIS
without me actually saying anything.

In a classic example of Divide and Conquer, the Separation Barrier
separates families from land, friends from each other, and generally
halts the flow of people and the economy.

Between Jerusalem and Ramallah, a city about 18 kilometers (11 miles)
to the north, is a checkpoint called Qalandia.

This checkpoint blocks the highway between Ramallah and Jerusalem,
which would make the trip take about 15 minutes by car.  However, the
checkpoint makes it a 45 minute trip from Jerusalem to Ramallah.

Basically, there is a barrier on the highway, through which vehicles
may not pass.  As a result, to go from Jerusalem to Ramallah, everyone
must get out of the vehicle (taxi or bus, unless someone has a friend
to drive their personal car away) walk 100 meters past guards and
through a one way gate, then secure another vehicle to go the
remaining 5 minutes to Ramallah.

To get from Ramallah to Jerusalem, everyone must get out of the
vehicle, walk 50 meters, go through a one way gate, through a metal
detector, show passport or ID to the soldiers, and then the remaining
50 meters to secure another vehicle on the other side.

In East Jerusalem neighborhoods, the streets are filled with rubbish.
The city service of garbage removal simply does not exist.  The residents

Things that shouldn't be normal:
   grenade destruction
   cow carcasses
   rubbish non-collection
   checkpoints
   gunfights in refugee camp at night
BETHLEHEM CHECKPOINT
CPOINT near mt of Olives
   soundbombs to break up crowds
   
Things that are different and okay that way:
   men holding hands in streets
   women holding hands in streets
   men and women never touching in streets
   falafels everywhere
   no queues; just mobs
   paying for taxis by handing money up and getting change back
   poor customer service
   sweet drinks

Hey Rob - find the list you already brainstormed.  Write to Jason to
ask about picture usage in a fundraiser.  Ask him the name of the
valley of the mount of olives.

Great places: Faisal hostel

Cool valley: Mt of Olives
