<p>I've just spent 4 hours walking to and from Mount of Olives, where
I sat for a while and wrote 6 postcards and 1 letter.  This was in a
well-delayed attempt to catch up on my letter writing.</p>

<p>Embarassingly, I found two <em>unopened</em> letters that I
received around the time I moved to Japan.  They musta gotten tossed
into my to-read-soon pile, and never got read.  Until today.  From
Delayana (Dorman) of my YRUU days, and Cathy (Saur) of my YRUU advisor
days.  I wrote to Cathy, but haven't written to Delayna yet.</p>
