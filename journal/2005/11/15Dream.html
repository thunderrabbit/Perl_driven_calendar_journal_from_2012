<p class="dream">With ridiculously cute ぴろり and got to kiss her,
with a bit of tongue connection.  I was like, "do you mind if I lick
your face?" and she consented and I gave her little licks all over
her cheeks and lips and little nibbles on her nose and lips.</p>

<p class="dream">She seemed to enjoy the affection and I definitely
enjoyed it and could see my hardness as if watching a movie.  Ben was
there and wanted a bit of the action, but I was a bit jealous and
disallowed it.</p>

<p class="dream">Walking to Kellie's house, I called her on my
cellphone and learned she had *just* arrived back into Japan from her
Peace Boat voyage!  I walked up the street to her house and could see
her car parked slightly blocking the right hand side of the street,
whereas three other cars were parked on the left, fully in the parking
lane.  On top of her car was a travel pack thing which she hadn't yet
unloaded.</p>

<p class="dream">I turned right at those cars and walked up the short
sidewalk to her house and knocked a bit on the door as she was saying,
"come in!"  She yelled it a bit louder after she heard my knock as if,
"[I'm too tired to get up, but not too tired to yell, so you better]
Come In!" and I did.  She was in the kitchen and her husband Go was in
the living room.  I gave her a big hug and said おつかれさま to
summarize the entire voyage, knowing how amazing yet tiring it must
have been.</p>
