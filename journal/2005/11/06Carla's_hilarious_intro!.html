<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  This is Carla's introduction message to the
rest of the PB 52nd voyage teaching team!  I'm stealing it without
permission...</p>

<p class="note">G' Day Mates</p>

<p class="note">I'm so not Australian but I've been trying to use as
much sea/boat/pirate language as I know in preparation for our
upcoming voyage. </p>

<p class="note">So I've honestly been meaning to send out this
"HELLO..I'm Carla..I'm from Canada...blah blah blah!!!" email for days
now...but I've kinda been putting it off (don't say procrastinating)
cause I really have no idea what to write!!!!  I have never been at a
loss for words......never......but as your introductions have been
coming in...I've been trying to recall how well I must have faked the
funk in the interview to be a part of such an amazing/diverse group of
people. </p>

<p class="note">So my original plan was to wait until all your intros
came in..and then I was gonna cut and paste all your good stuff and
make myself sound great...but you're a clever bunch and may have
caught on to my scam...so I decided against that.</p>

<p class="note">So then I emailed my sister and told her I had to
write this intro..and I asked her "What are my good qualities???"  And
she emailed back..."Tell them you can ski!!!"</p>

<p class="note">So then my roommate came home and I asked her..."What
am I good at???"...and she said "Wakanai"..and I said
"Wakanai!!!!!!"..and she said "You can ski deshou!!"</p>

<p class="note">So I guess at this point I can tell you that I can
ski... albeit not well!!!!!!  And I'm thinking to myself...that is
gonna be a great asset..to have someone that can ski...on a cruise
ship...of the southern hemisphere!!! Sigh!!!!</p>

<p class="note">Anyway..I am so excited about our upcoming adventure
together.  And to have the opportunity to work with such an
outstanding team.  I will try to come up with some quality (that
doesn't involve chairlifts and bindings) that I can add.  I've met a
few of you already...of course Rob...my bestest NOVA bud...I was soooo
happy to see a familiar name on our team roster...Lisa I believe we
met waaaaaaay back in the day also through NOVA.  Leo, Daniel and
Laura...we survived interview day together so the real deal should be
a piece of cake.  And of course I met both Kellie and Phil at the
Halloween Party and I'm looking forward to meeting you again out of
costume (I don't know that I've ever said that to anyone
before).  </p>

<p class="note">I won't bore you with the details of my life....we'll
have lots of time at training, on the boat and in the ports over the
next few months to have those "bonding sessions"!!!!!  I'm fairly
open, pretty adventurous....and will try anything once!!!</p>

<p class="note">I live in the Tokyo/Yokohama area so if anyone else in
the area is interested in meeting up for a drink/coffee/ski
lesson...before we all meet at training..I'd love to.. so send me an
email!!! </p>

<p class="note">OK..I'm gonna go and ...umm..read the dictionary or
something.  Can't wait to meet you all in person!!!!!!!!</p>

<p class="note">Hugs.....CARLA</p>
