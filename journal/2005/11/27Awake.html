<p class="date">9:06am JST Sunday 27 November 2005</p>

<p>Hitomi and I just got up for breakfast at 7:59am, a time chosen
because her phone alarm announces the time, and we wanted to get as
many syllables as possible: "しちじごじゅきゅふんです。" instead of
just "はちじです。" 1 minute later.</p>

<p>I guess we should have gone for "しちじごじゅななふんです。"
7:57am, which written has the same number of characters, but is
actually one more syllable, <em>and</em> a good example of the two
Japanese pronunciations of 7.</p>
