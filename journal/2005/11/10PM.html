<p>In a hotel slash school thing now; Max and I have our own room, and
will probably stay up late talking about random silly stuff.  I really
don't know why we are here, except I've been getting hints that we
might be setting up for a conference.  Max drew an image of a tree and
camel and couple guys and background- he might be painting that on the
wall.</p>

<p>In any event, whoohoooo!</p>

<p class="date">8:16pm</p>

<p>Aha!</p>

<p>We are at a Palestinian / Israeli / German exchange via
photography!</p>

<p>Tonight I've met Shuham ("you can call me shushu"), Jandak, Lee,
Elam, and others.</p>

<p>10 Palestinians and 10 Israelis went to Germany for 14 days a few
months ago, and now they are meeting again.  The task for pairs of
people tonight and tomorrow: each person take a photo using the other
as a subject, with the topic being the other side of the conflict.
Then each person take a picture of the other person the way the
photographer sees that person.  Then a dual pic with both people as
topics and subjects.</p>

<p>But right now, dinner!</p>

<p class="date">8:50pm</p>

<p>Yummmm.  I'm stuffed on pita, hummus, water, salad, veggies, and
something else.</p>

<p>Max and I chatted on banana phones on the way from dining area to
our room.</p>

<p>Supposed to go back to the group in 8 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm greatly looking forward to a shower tonight!!  I've been
loathe to take showers in the hostel because there's not much hot
water, and not much water pressure anyway.  I'm not sure how many days
it's been since I took a shower.  Perhaps 3 or 4.</p>

<p>Oh, today, for the record, I bought Pear Cactus and Apple drink.
It tastes a lot like Odwalla SuperFood.  SO YUM.</p>

<p class="date">9:19pm</p>

<p>I took a picture of Max from below; with him all like, "rar!" as a
rocker.</p>

<p>He took a picture of me eating an apple, talking on a banana and
looking like I'm going to kill someone with some intense Jack
Nicholson eyebrows.</p>

<p>We got pictures of us both in double mirrors in the restroom.  They
are pretty funny, I think.</p>

<p>Okay; Max and I are taking pictures according to the task.  We've
got 3 of 5 finished.  For this next one, I'm taking a picture of Max
the way I see the Israeli side of the conflict.</p>
