<p>Today I practiced peace by folding origami shapes and making a
ball.  I found it took a lot longer to fold the shapes than to put
them together.  After the first assembly, I decided to make it again
with a more lovely color scheme, so I made ten sets of three colors
each, but it turns out I couldn't keep all the sets together.  It
seems that up to six sets of three can be kept together.  I sorta
have an idea for how they could be combined nicely, but I ran out of
colored paper and basically out of patience.</p>

<p>Went on a tour of parts of the city with Ben et. al.  Nightmare
stories of the insidious ways Palestinians are being cleansed from
this region.  Near the end the tour leader was informed of a home
demolition occuring nearby.  I was too distraught to go.  Ben, Juliet
and Andrea went.  To varying degrees, they were distraught
afterward.</p>

<p>Dude.  Their fucking home was destroyed in front of the family's
eyes.</p>

<p>Home demolitions happen weekly.  The basic story goes like this:
they had no permit, so the house is illegal.  but they have been
unable to obtain a permit because it is too expensive slash too
impossible to get.</p>

<p>Night fucking mare.</p>
