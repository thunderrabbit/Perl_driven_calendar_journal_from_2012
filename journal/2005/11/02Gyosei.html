<p>Cool.  I'm in Gyosei's little apartment near Azalea (sp) (not in
Kawasaki, Japan, but Jerusalem, on the Palestine side of the wall).
Gyosei is a Japanese monk, and we have been chatting in Japanese, and
I can just about wet myself with joy to be able to say that.  My
Japanese is not *money*, but I'm able to hold a bit of a conversation
that is more interesting than "I like salt."</p>
