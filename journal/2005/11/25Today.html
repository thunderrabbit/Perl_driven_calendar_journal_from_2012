<p>Today I woke up at 11:59am ("so you're officially not lazy,"
assures Jen), and chatted a bit with Tom and Anthony and Shoko before
riding back to Jesse's.  Matt had wondered about getting some of the
repeaters together, but had been unable to reach anyone but me.  He,
being a good Kiwi, said he'd prefer to have us meet as a group
instead of meeting us individually.</p>

<p>I considered coming out just to flirt with Natalie but ultimately
decided against that.  I will see her before the 52 heads out.</p>

<p>I got a funny/mean comment regarding making Francois branded
merchandise:</p>

Subject: Francois Branded Merchandise Brilliant!


Quickly: Hahahahahaha!!

That is fucking the best thing I have ever heard. Maybe you could
co-brand francois the rabbit with some sort of other character, like
some kind of sidekick.  Wait! I got it how about a 35 year Eikaiwa
teacher who acts like he is a funny and witty like a 13 year old girl?
Yes that would be brilliant.  You could have other accessories like a
bicycle (pink frillies extra) and little candies.  Maybe I am on a
role here.  Whaddya think?

<p>Pooh.  I've been snotty nosed a lot today, and I've felt the tiny
edge of a headache as if I could be getting sick.  I've eaten decently
today, but didn't do quite as well yesterday...  Just bought a liter
of orange juice to chug.</p>

<p>I just finished the dishes here.  Around 4pm I got a visitor named
Toru who wanted to read bible scriptures to me.  I let him in and we
sat on the floor in the dining room and explained why we did or did
not choose to believe the bible.</p>

<p>I took a big fat nap until 11pm and fucked around online reading
news, including a neat way to make animal rights activists upset:
"wasps are disposable," according to <a

article</a>.</p>

<p>Time for bed; gotta be up in 4 hours-ish.  I determined that it's
about 80km from Keiko's house to the CDF meeting place; I won't
attempt to ride that distance in one morning.  We are supposed to
meet between 1:30 and 2:30.</p>

<p>Crap.  I have just noted an apparent absence of the sandals I
bought in Viet Nam.  I pulled out everything from the suitcase in
which I believe I packed them, but they didn't appear.  My first guess
is that they didn't end up repacked after all my shit was searched at
the Ben Gurion airport.  Maybe I packed them in a different place.
Maybe I forgot them.  Maybe I left them in Kellie's or at PB.  I
haven't checked all my bags yet.</p>

<p>I had hoped to have them when PB returns to Viet Nam, so I could
show them off to the shop where I bought them and say how much I love
them.</p>
