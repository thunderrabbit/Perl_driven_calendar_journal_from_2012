At 15:50 we heard several soundbomb explosions outside Damascus Gate
in East Jerusalem.  We went outside to investigate, following where
the soldiers had gone up Nablus Road.  Video footage and images show a
soundbomb thrown by Israeli Border Police into a street crowded with
civilians.  <a

A photo journalist confronts the commanding officer of the Israeli
Border Police outside Damascus Gate.  A Hasidic Jew who said he was
hit in the face with a stone expresses his concern and poses for
photos. <a

<p>These are the two writeups that we'll probably put on indymedia.com
or some such.  I had no idea such a site existed, but Ed mentioned it
and says we have enough evidence to make a court case against the
soldier who threw the sound bomb.  I'm not sure we have enough proof
to say *who* it was that threw it, but certainly the video I got shows
it thrown ridiculously close to little kids.</p>

<p>Ed uploaded the videos to his site, but I uploaded them to my site
as well.  He had to change the longer filename because Windows
couldn't handle it.</p>

<p>Because I shot these videos, there's a little part of me that is
all hoping these vids will become famous...</p>
