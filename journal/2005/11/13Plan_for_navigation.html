<p>Given a journal entry or image, have "where" link associated with
it.  Clicking the link brings up a map with a flag indicating the
location.  And there may be other flags depending on the size/scale
of the map... clicking a flag on the map can bring up a list of
entries or images (not sure how to decide which or combine the
results) based on location.</p>

<p>Now, granted, this is very close to what geoblogger does, but
<br>1) I came up with it myself
<br>2) I plan to not crowd the map with flags: if there are 500 images
/ entries for a region, just have one flag.
<br>3) I have a sense of how it will work.</p>
