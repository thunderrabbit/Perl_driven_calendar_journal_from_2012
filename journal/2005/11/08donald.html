<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>Donald is a good natured missionary who believes wholeheartedly
that the King James Bible is the authoritative word of God.</p>

<p>He says slavery was not condoned in the bible.  "It refers to
bondmen, who were obligated to repay a debt.  The simple word 'bond'
explains it.  There was an agreement; a bond.  It's not slavery."</p>

<p>Ben looked up bondman. "bondman, noun: a male bound to serve
without wages.  a male slave." </p>

<p>"I don't trust people who write dictionaries."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Donald says continental drift is a lie; there is no way continents
can move around.  "Take an egg and crack its shell.  Can the pieces
slide around?  No; they are all bumping into one another."</p>

<p>Sarah explained that the plates crash into one another to create
mountains, and sometime go under one another causing earthquakes.</p>

<p>"If it's been happening for millions of years, as you say, why
aren't the mountains higher?  It's just a ridiculous proposal to
ignore what they can't explain."</p>

<p>Donald disproves the theory of evolution by pointing out that we
can't explain where all the matter came from in the universe.
"Before the Big Bang, was there matter, or wasn't there?  It's a
simple question."</p>

<p>Ben goes, "by definition, if there is a point at which the laws of
physics break down, we can't know what happened beyond that
point."  He continues, "but that has nothing to do with the origin
of <em>species</em>; there were billions of years between the Big
Bang and any life."</p>

<p>"The Origin of Species means the Origin of Matter.  It's as simple
as that."</p>

<p>A different topic, that was more complicated than I can
realistically capture, went something like this:</p>

<p>Ben: "settlements are illegal."</p>

<p>Donald: "no they're not."</p>

<p>Ben: "yes they are; under the 4th Geneva Convention."</p>

<p>Donald: "Geneva Convention?  What's that?  When was it
written?"</p>

<p>Ben: "Right after World War II."</p>

<p>Donald: "settling happens all over the world.  Take Texas for
example; the Americans invaded Mexico to take over the Mexican land."</p>

<p>Ben: "Ignoring that happened before the Geneva Convention was
written, because an international law is broken by one country
doesn't make it right for any country to break the law."</p>

<p>Donald: "That law doesn't exist."</p>

<p>Ben: "Yes it does."</p>

<p>Donald: "It's the spoils of war.  Take Kuwait for example.  Iraq
attacked them without cause, the bastards, and Kuwait was able to
hold them back.  Had Kuwait gone ahead and taken the land, more power
to them."</p>

<p>Ben: "I'm not talking about Kuwait or Texas.  I'm simply saying
that settlements are illegal under the 4th Geneva Convention."</p>

<p>Donald: "Whoever wrote that was out of their minds."</p>
