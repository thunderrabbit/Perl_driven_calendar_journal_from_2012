<p>Big big big big big big big big fun at the Dead Sea!!</p>

<p>It was originally my idea, so I was quite pleased when Dave and Ben
chose to join me!  Hisham told us to go early and stay late in En Gedi
and guaranteed us a good time.  He looked up bus routes and times for
the main bus station in Jerusalem and I set my alarm for 7:15am so we
could get the first bus there.  7:15am came earlier than planned and
Ben easily convinced me to sleep in so we could take the next bus.</p>

<p>Dave was already well awake and had gone for a run, taken a
shower, and eaten before we left.  Ben and I both got morning
sustenance on the 30+ minute walk to the bus station.</p>

<p>We were greeted with the most inane security at the bus station
entrance.  I was able to get my cellphone, camera, and wallet through
without them being scanned.  Simply put them in my bag as I walked
through the metal detector and then put them in my pockets as my bag
went through the X-ray machine.</p>

<p>Walked into what I expected to be a bus station and found a food
court of a shopping mall!  We followed signs upstairs to another mall
looking area with ticket windows on one side.  The first two windows
were full, so I went to the next one, but it she grunted and pointed
over her shoulder when I tried to get a ticket.</p>

<p>Went to the next window (which had become free) and she was like,
"what?" when I asked if I could buy a ticket and wondered why she was
in the same room as the first woman, and *then* I realized the first
two windows were *tickets* and these other were *information*.</p>

<p>Ah.  I saw they were labeled with signs that blended in well with
the decor.</p>

<p>Got the tickets (54.4 NIS per person round trip from Jerusalem to
En Gedi) at the next counter with limited problems.  I forgot to ask
her which gate to use, for the next customer was already pushing
forward with an order.</p>

<p>Asked one of the many soldiers if he could tell me.</p>

<p>"No.  You should ask information," he said, pointing to my
original window.</p>

<p>I did that and I was like, [something] and she answered a
different question or something and then something else, and we
finally communicated enough so I knew to go to Gate 3.</p>

<p>There was a queue behind the door, but it was sparse and
disinterested, so I figured we could walk to the front.  Past a
certain point, people became interested, and I asked a nice looking
soldier if she knew if this bus went to En Gedi.</p>

<p>She said I should ask the driver, but the first guy in line kept
pushing me toward the back of the line when I tried to speak to the
driver, who was standing outside the bus trying to field queries from
about 5 different people with different problems and varying degrees
of impatience.</p>

<p>Various parts of the mob stayed in place, while various other parts
seemed to move semi-smoothly onto the bus.  Finally the driver spoke
to Ben and Dave, saying something like, "this other guy (referring to
the older guy who wouldn't let me talk to the bus driver) was here
first, so if you don't mind, just wait a minute,"</p>

<p>Dave was like, "well we just wondered if this is the bus to En
Gedi."</p>

<p>"How many people are you?"</p>

<p>"Three.  One, two, three," pointing to himself, Ben, then me.</p>

<p>The driver looked at me before Dave finished counting, "and what
do you want?"</p>

<p>"I'm with them."</p>

<p>And that seemed to be the back-breaker as he was like, "you three;
go go to the other bus," and shooed us away.</p>

<p>We sorta wondered where he had pointed, but soon enough the next
bus pulled up, and it had the correct bus number on it and it dawned
that we had been barking up the wrong bus and that our bus was simply
late.</p>

<p>People crammed for the door, and I commented to Ben, "they're not
even letting anyone off the bus," but it turned out no one *wanted*
off the bus.  The driver punched each person's ticket as they
boarded, and the mob slowly diminished outside the bus.</p>

<p>Right in front of me was the butt of a rifle, and I told Dave I
wondered what it was for.  He was like, "I dunno," and a soldier who
saw me said, "-------" which only Ben heard, and then laughed.</p>

<p>Ben said he said, "to hide the pot," and I laughed, too.</p>

<p>We politely waited for everyone to get on the already crowded bus
and ended up standing in the aisle with a bunch of soldiers for the
first part of the journey.</p>

<p>I ended up next to the soldier who said the secret compartment was
for pot, and I broke the ice by asking, "so, what is it really for?"
and he explained that legend says back in Viet Nam, the soldiers used
to hide drugs in the back.</p>

<p>"In fact, this little mark on the gun shows the exact middle of the
gun," oh this gun doesn't have one, "but it shows the middle so we
can balance it at that point and if it doesn't balance, we know
there's something hidden in the gun."</p>

<p>This seemed like a pretty interesting story to me for two or three
reasons: 1) it seems easily defeatable by stuffing some other
counterweight in the barrel as well as drugs in the butt, 2) these
guns were apparently used in the Viet Nam war, and 3) it wasn't "his"
weapon, for he didn't know that there was no mark in the middle.</p>

<p>I didn't pursue any of these to continue the conversation, but
just said, "wow."</p>

<p>He asked a bit about where I was from and what I was doing and what
side of the wall I was on and blah blah blah and I was just a bit
curious about my emotions; it was a bit delicate situation to be
dancing around trying to see just what would make him say, "what do
you <em>mean</em>?" or "what were you doing <em>there</em>?" or the
like.  He started to tell me both sides of the conflict, but said at
the end, "and the other side is...." and just left it hanging.  I
didn't say, "and the other side is?" in an expectant way to remind him
I was still listening, because, given how quietly and obtusely he was
speaking, I didn't even know which side he had already described, and
therefore if I was assumed to know what the other side was.</p>

<p>His stop came soon enough, so everything turned out fine when he
said, "nice to meet you," shook my hand, and got off the bus.</p>

<p>Once we all got seats as the bus slowly emptied, we were seated
near the back where I chatted a bit with a couple from the Czech
Republic, and Ben talked to a really cute soldier.</p>

align="left" /></a> The cute soldier translated that we have a ten
minute break as the bus stopped at a rest area of sorts.  People got
out and took picture of various things and ate and smoke and played
jump rope.  Actually the jump ropers were with a different group.</p>

<p>I asked Dave and Ben if one of them would take pictures of me and
Francois by the signs.  Ben agreed and hooked me up.  Interesting to
wonder about all the other places on the signs.  Are they cool?  Would
any of them have become my favorite place so far?</p>

<p>We chilled out in the grass and then headed back to the bus.  There
was no real control of passenger entry, so I wondered if someone could
just hang out in that rest area and hop on the next bus to
anywhereville and just go.  What would that be like?</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/533_irrigation.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/533_irrigation.jpg"
align="left" /></a> Back on the bus and drove on and on and on and on
until we finally got to the Dead Sea, where we didn't stop, but turned
and drove along it for miles.  Surprising crops of trees in the middle
of the desert punctuated the barren plains.</p>

<p>I kept saying to Dave stuff like, "Dead Sea in da house!" and
"guess what?" (what?) "we're goin' to da Dead Sea, baby!!  whutwhut!"
and all variety of silliness.  Definitely in a great mood!</p>

<p>After a while, the sea started to look really nice.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/534_sink_hole.jpg"><img

src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/535_Dead_blue_Sea.jpg"
/></a></p>

<p>The bus stopped at about 5 places called En Gedi.  We kept
wondering and waiting and not getting off and then Dave went up and
asked the driver.  We ended up getting off with the crowd at En Gedi
Spa, which was uber-touristy, and probably a great way to spend about
100 NIS per person.  I talked to the information desk woman who talked
to a guy who drove us most of the way back to En Gedi Beach.  We
walked the remaining kilometer or so in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Next time we want a free and lovely place to experience the Dead
Sea, we will get off the bus at En Gedi Beach.  Without a doubt.  Free
entry, free showers, not free restroom, but it was so uncrowded that
we just changed quickly down between the parking lot and the
beach.</p>

<p>The food is definitely not free, so we'll bring our own next time.
We each ate a 20 NIS sandwich and Dave got a 10 NIS 1.5 or 2 liter
bottle of En Gedi branded water that didn't taste all that
awesome.</p>

<p>We wondered if we'd be able to swim across to Jordan, and tried to
make educated guesses. I was really anxious to splash around in the
sea so I was all like, "let's rock," at the first minute that seemed
like everyone could be ready.</p>

<p>We learned that the restroom cost like 3 shekels and the shower was
7, so we skipped that part and just went down toward the water in
search of a place to change.  Covered for each other and changed but
seriously no one cared and then we were ready to engage the water.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/542_Francois_on_salt.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/542_Francois_on_salt.jpg"
align="left" /></a>But first, a quick picture of Francois on this
white rock holy cats that is *salt*!!  The rock was basically covered
in an inch of salt except for the top where it had regrown only 1/8th
inch after layers had been converted to souvenirs.</p>

<p>The Dead Sea was *freeeeezing* cold!!  Ben and Dave were both like,
"what are you talking about??? it's so warm.." and I was like, "you
are *crazy*; it is freezing!" but I got used to it quickly enough as
we splashed around.  We were giddy with silliness as to how easy it
was to float!  I was pleasantly surprised that none of my body had any
open wounds; no pain involved for me to bask in the water.</p>

<p>At it was *so* *floaty*!!  Really weird to float effortlessly, and
when we tread water, we could get out entire chests out of the water.
At least Ben could, and it felt like I did.  Dave was like, "wow; are
you *standing*?" cause I was so far out of the water.</p>

<p>We decided we could <em>easily</em> make it to Jordan; the sea was
a bit wavy, but on a calm day it would be *trivial* to float there!
Unless someone were actually monitoring these things...</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/546_Francois_Rob_Ben_float.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/546_Francois_Rob_Ben_float.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/547_dave_float.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/547_dave_float.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/553_Francois_Rob_Dave_float.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/553_Francois_Rob_Dave_float.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/555_Francois_Rob_liberty.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/555_Francois_Rob_liberty.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>At one point Ben got a bit of water in his eye (while wearing
contacts) and he was like, "augh!" cause it really burned, and he said
quite dramatically as if to assure himself of this truth, "I must not
rub my eye."</p>

<p>I offered the service of holding his wrists so he wouldn't be able
to rub his eyes even if he couldn't resist the temptation.  The
searing pain went away after a bit he said he would be okay, so I let
him go and we continued our float.  Hard to call it a swim cause we
couldn't really submerge our legs for a normal kicking type motion,
and if we submerged our heads for a crawl, we were in for a world of
searing eye and nasal passage pain.</p>

<p>Ben, however, noticed how easy it would be to do the butterfly
stroke, so he tried it, and immediately submerged his ehad and
immediately realized what an unwise decision he had made.  Especially
considering he was still wearing contacts.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes closed and I led him floatingly out of the water
and carefully onto the rocky sometimes sharp shore and onto the beach
where we had our stuff and Dave's 10 NIS bottle of water.  At one
point Ben sorta stubbed his toe on a sharp (salt crystal covered) rock
and scraped a bit of skin off.  "Ouch!"</p>

<p>"Oh; sorry;" I had seen it, but didn't think quickly enough to tell
him to avoid it.</p>

<p>"Okay, lean your head back," and I poured water onto his eyes,
trying to balance between wasting Dave's drinking water and actually
flushing the brine from Ben's eyes.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/557_Francois_on_salt_on_Rob.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/557_Francois_on_salt_on_Rob.jpg"
align="left" /></a> Success.  He opened his eyes without further ado,
and without any ado whatsoever, he talked to a bikini-clad woman who
looks somewhat like Halle Berry as I waited around for the water on my
skin to dry.  I wanted to see just what it would be like, but it
wasn't all that amazing once it dried on my shoulders, so I didn't
wait for it to dry everywhere.</p>

<p>I found a Sprite bottle and filled it with just a sampling of water
so I can send to my mom for the next welcome-back-after-summer water
ceremony at her church.  It looks crystal clean and clear.  <em>Mmmmmm
delicious....</em> "I must not drink this 'Sprite.'"</p>

<p>A group of people came as some kind of tour, and Dave and I decided
they were speaking Italian.  Many of them got their own samplings of
water, and some tried to break off chunks of salt to taste and show
their friends.</p>

<p><a

src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/561_Francois_Delphine.jpg"
align="left" /></a> I went a bit Francois-picture-crazy (surprise),
but used him to introduce myself to the woman Ben had met.  She was
quite friendly and seemed happy to chat with us.  I learned her name
is Delphine, and she's from Switzerland.  She's here on vacation for
about 2 weeks.  We all chatted for a while about the locale and our
adventure in not knowing exactly where to get off the bus, and didn't
want to pay high dollars for the mud bath at En Gedi Spa.  However, we
all agreed a mud bath would be fun, and after a guy walked toward us
covered in mud, we all decided to go where he had come from to try
this mud for ourselves.</p>

<p>I chose to carry my stuff since it wasn't all that much.  Ben put
his stuff with Delphine's and she covered it all with her towel.  I
think Dave carried his.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/562Ben_Delphine.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/562Ben_Delphine.jpg"
align="left" /></a> Dave and I walked ahead while Ben and Delphine
were engrossed in conversation.  I looked back at them and thought it would be a good pic for Ben's collection and was like, "hey Dave; grab my camera out of my bag...."</p>

<p>He was on the same wavelength, "and take a picture of them?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>And he did and I don't think they even knew.</p>

<p>We came across a really cool chain frozen in place by the salt crystals coating it.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/563Francois_salty_chain.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/563Francois_salty_chain.jpg"
/></a></p>

<p>We arrived at a little speck of a mudhole, and then another, and I
kept walking forward expecting to find an entire swamp of muddy
entertainment, but that never appeared.</p>

<p>I noticed that the two mudhole we found seemed to just be where
people had dug up some rocks from the beach, and figured that we could
dig <em>anywhere</em> and come up with muddy goo-dness.</p>

<p>"Hey Dave, help me lift this rock," I suggested, pointing at one
that looked like it might cover a nice cache of mud.</p>

<p>He gave it a bit of a tug and was like, "no way [can we lift this]."</p>

<p>I quickly agreed after I tried as well.</p>

<p>We went back to the original two holes and started slathering.  And
posing.  And slathering.  And getting more and more into it until we
all just slicked back our hair and turned ourselves into a new hue of
Blue Man Group.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/568Ben_Delphine_Rob_Francois.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/568Ben_Delphine_Rob_Francois.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/569Dave_Ben_Francois_Rob.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/569Dave_Ben_Francois_Rob.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/571_Dave_Ben_Francois_Rob.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/571_Dave_Ben_Francois_Rob.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>At one point Delphine stepped into the hole we hadn't really been
using and <em>fell in!!</em>  It was quite deep and turned out to be
quite muddier and lovelier than the mud we had been using, which
commonly featured bits of sticks and little pebbles.</p>

<p>This new mud was pure muddy goodness, so I put on a new layer and
basked in it.</p>

<p>After a while, we decided it was time to start heading back; the
3pm bus would arrive soon and the consensus was we should go back.  (I
could have stayed longer, but Delphine has this certain allure.)</p>

<p>Back into the water, which had gotten *cold* again for some reason,
and the mud sloughed off into a cloudy waft of dark.  I had coated my
swimtrunks in mud, so it took a bit of extra scrubbing to get them
rinsed out.  So fun to just be floating and scrubbing and not worrying
about swimming!  I could have stayed in the Dead Sea all day.</p>

<p>I didn't dunk my head in the water, so I was completely clean and
completely covered in mud depending on which side of my neck one
examined.  Walked back with Delphine as Dave and Ben had gone ahead to
the showers.  She told me she is a nurse in Switzerland, doing post-op
care for patients.  I didn't query for details on types of surgery,
but just blessed her efforts toward helping others.</p>

<p><a

src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/574gratuitous_um_Francois_Rob_clean-ish.jpg"
align="left" /></a>Into the shower where I got most of the mud off
without direction from Dave and Ben as to what I had missed
(specifically, a blob of mud right under my nose).</p>

<p>Got rinsed, headed back toward the umbrella area between the sea
and the 7 NIS restrooms and changed quickly, Delphine doing some
girl-magic under a towel.</p>

<p>At the bus stop, another woman walked up and joined Dave and Ben's
pullup contest.  Her name is Frederique, and is from Quebec.  I don't
remember what city.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/575Frederique_Delphine_Francois.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/575Frederique_Delphine_Francois.jpg"
align="left" /></a> After waiting many minutes as several different
tour buses did not stop for us, the five of us rode together in the
back of the bus to Jerusalem's main station.  For the first part of
the journey Ben sat between the girls and me an' Dave, but Dave was
pretty much sleeping and I was pretty much wanting to bounce around
and be crazy cause I was so excited to have just had such a cool
experience in the Dead Sea!</p>

<p>I took several pics of mountains and basically wanted to climb
*all* of them because they all looked climbable and none of them
looked cold.  I could imagine climbing and camping and having a blast
for quite a while.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/581_I_want_to_climb.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/581_I_want_to_climb.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/585Definitely_climbable.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/585Definitely_climbable.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/596sunsat.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/596sunsat.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Also got a picture of an interesting curved contrail, apparently
from an air force jet.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/592_curve_contrail.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/592_curve_contrail.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I noticed sections of mountain had been cut beside the highway; I
think it's slated to be widened.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/597_highway_widening.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/597_highway_widening.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>And I saw a bedouine settlement/camp/village/home that just looked <em>poor</em>.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/598Bedouin_village.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/598Bedouin_village.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/599Bedouin_village.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/599Bedouin_village.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/600Bedouin_village.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/600Bedouin_village.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/601Bedouin_village.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/2005nov14DeadSea/thumbs/601Bedouin_village.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Outside the bus station slash mall in Jerusalem, four of us said
bye to Delphine, then ate at a vegetarian restaurant then came back to
the Faisal.  She is switching from her hostel to ours to save ten
shekels and get free internet!</p>

<p>My new Dead Sea hair style, matching Kris' after she got back on
the ship in Sri Lanka:</p>
