<p class="dream">Waking up in a hotel with Hitomi I was like
distraught at being so late and she woke up (actually it was Wende)
and she called her firend to see if she could leave right away, but
she came with me as I drove to school.</p>

<p class="dream">As we were still in bed, I was like, "where are we?"
cause I couldn't remember where we had gone to sleep the previous
night and she goes, "by a road" or something that reminded me and then
I was driving myself to school and she came with me (acually it was
Hitomi) and I was thinking I'll just have to drive her back and we
were on this rather wide street with only one other car, and we were
debating between circulating on the left versus circulating on the
right and we chose the right after I realized we were in the United
States and I drove past the guard booth and the guy was like hey wait
a minute but I just rolled through and then got to a big dead end
where I normally drove into the school.  And I dropped off my mom; I
was I was like, "quick; get out before they see you" and she hesitated
a bit and I repeated "get out and go into the building" and she got
out and they stopped her, but I did a U turn loop around and was like,
"will my mom be able to go in?" and they said "Yes."  "Will I be able
to go in?" and there was no answer.</p>

<p class="dream">"Can anyone tell me where I need to go?"</p>

<p class="dream">"You can't go inside this way."</p>

<p class="dream">And I drove around to the next person.  "Honestly.
where should I go?"  and he said with as much sympathy as didn't make
sense, "you won't be able to get in within ten minutes."</p>

<p class="dream">and I was like, "where should I go in 9 minutes,
then?  or 11 minutes?"</p>

<p class="dream">"What kind of school is this if I can't get in?"  And
I just turned around and started crying, driving back and woke up.</p>
