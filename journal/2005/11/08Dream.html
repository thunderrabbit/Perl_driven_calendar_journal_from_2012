<p class="dream">Explaining to my mom where I had been:</p>

<p class="dream">"I went to the nine inch nails concert over there,"
indicating with my finger, &quot;and Fred came a bit later, and he wanted
to talk to me about something I didn't want to talk about, so I ran up
to my room and crawled underneath the bed and ate some of the pudding
that I had left over.</p>

<p class="dream">"He came up but didn't find me, so I got up and I'm
not sure how I got home; but I can't remember parking over here; I
must have left Mr Van back there."</p>

<p class="dream">Ma didn't seem too impressed with my story, or any
less upset that I had left Mr Van parked somewhere overnight, but she
didn't get angry at me.</p>
