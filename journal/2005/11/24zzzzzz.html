<p>Rode TJ Bike to Millenium House today, after cleaning up a bit
around Jesse's - washed the delicious Thanksgiving dinner dishes, and
put my clothes away after they dried.</p>

<p class="date">3:17am JST Friday 25 November 2005</p>

<p>In Jens' noom now, chatting chatting chatting.  Met Juliana, a tall
attractive Italian woman, and chatted with her a bit, with me using
my limited Spanish as Italian, and her using her English as
English.</p>

<p>Got to see Jade, Sam, and Andrew a bit, and talked at length with
Ikumi and Nopants Shokoshoko.</p>
