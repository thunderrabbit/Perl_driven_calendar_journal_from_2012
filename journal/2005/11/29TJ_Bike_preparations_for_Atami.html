<p>And that's how far I got before getting distracted.  I've got a
mess of suitcases and bags half empty and half full and a bike half
packed in Jesse's living room.  Then I got on email and added a person
to my Rob Update list and then did a bit of research and noted that I
emailed her before saying I had added her, but she wasn't on the list,
so I took her off the list and am using this as an excuse to add a way
to keep track of who has been on the list but subsequently was
removed.  For now, I'll just make it a static file; I don't want to
spend the time to figure out again how to add a table to mySQL
database, etc.</p>

<p>Did it.  And tested it.  And included a note to self about how to
make it better.  All good.</p>

<p>Ready?</p>

<p>Set?</p>

<p>Pack TJ Bike!</p>
