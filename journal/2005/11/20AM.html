<p>I've got plenty of distractions at Jesse's; more Southpark and
Futurama episodes than I can imagine watching, and more internet
bandwidth than the Faisal would ever need.</p>

<p>Today I plan to eat, get Kellie's key, go play ultimate, then go
get TJ Bike.</p>

<p>But, it's immobilizingly cold.  Argh.  brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!</p>

<p>And I'm not sure where I can put TJ Bike around here.</p>

<p>The balcony: okay, but a bit of a hassle since TJ Bike cannot
(yet) fly.</p>

<p>After a great number of delay tactics: eating, drying jeans,
meditation, wondering wtf I am doing, and writing this entry, I have
decided not to go to ultimate today, even though I will also not be
able to go next week.</p>

<p>That wasn't so bad at all.</p>

<p>I spent the bulk of that time methodically getting TJ Bike
uncovered from all the cloaking devices I had set up some 5-6 months
ago.  Put on his saddlebags, loaded up tent and other sleeping
equipment, checked the map, saddled up, headed out, got a bit lost
looking for 246, found it, rode it, made it in 1.5 hours.</p>

<p>And now I am super thrilled to find an open invite to 52nd GET Ts
to meet Carla and Carl tonight for drinks!!  TJ Bike and I can go!
Whooo!!!</p>
