<p>A bit of trouble going to sleep tonight, but I dreamt</p>

<p class="dream">My friends and I were alongside the Panama Canal, and
the Israeli soldiers were blocking our passage and had cut some of the
mule (train locomotive) tracks so we couldn't ride them.  They had one
train working, but had reconfigured it so it was laying on its side,
using one side (previously the top) for attack and the other side
(previously the bottom) for defense.  They rolled by and I was afraid
they might attack us (though the bottom was facing our direction), but
they just went by.</p>

<p class="dream">I drove our mule, but it went off the end of the
tracks and I had no way of steering it.  Tried to get back on, but
couldn't and then there was a soldier with a gun at the end of the
lock, and he saw us, but didn't know who we were and didn't try to
stop us; we were in a mule, so he thought were were on his team.</p>

<p class="dream">Rolled by and up a hill into some traffic and stopped.</p>
