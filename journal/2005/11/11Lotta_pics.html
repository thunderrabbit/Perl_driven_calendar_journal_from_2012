<p>Took a lot of pictures while outside on the playground with Max
and Carmella.  Max and I both agree she's quite strikingly lovely.
She balanced on the teeter totter, acting as a counterweight to keep
our different masses balanced.</p>

<p>I climbed across the swingset thing; Max and I each spun on the
wobbly merry-go-round.  We all tried to navigate from the road to the
playground without touching the ground - stepping only on the rocks
for safety.</p>

<p>I found Hitomi's camera can do Color Swap!!</p>

<p>Time for lunch now.</p>

<p>Lunch was pita and fillings and chicken or spinach pastries for
vegetarians.  I don't know the name of the woman next to whom I sat,
but she has two-tone eyes (gray with dark rings) and is vegetarian
because she saw a TV program of ducks being (force) fed.</p>
