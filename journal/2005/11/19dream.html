<p class="dream">passenger in a car down a fantastically steep hill
about 45 degrees and straight as an arrow, allowing cars to go
exceptionally fast, and with a really long level braking area at the
bottom.  Traffic was crowded, but going at least 150 miles per hour.
The woman driving wanted to reach her client from India in time to
show him a hurricane that was coming toward his location.  I looked up
and confirmed that clouds looked like they were going from right to
left over the freeway and that a huge dark cloud-storm was over on the
right and ahead of us.  If we hurry, we just might make it.</p>

<p class="dream">We had to stop at a JR train station, which happened
to be Motosumiyoshi, within scrambling distance of the next station,
all within a wooded area like a campground.  I clambored over to the
next station, Musashikosugi and found I needed to get to the other
side of the tracks and climbed through some playground equipment and
ran through the porch area to the other side of the building and then
across the parking lot where I looked over to my left over the
building and noticed rain was being wiped down out of the clouds by a
woman with a long squeegy.  She was cleaning up after the storm and
essentially squishing all the rain out of the clouds into harmless
sheets of rain.</p>

<p class="dream">Later, on a passenger bus filled with a variety of
passengers, we were all surprised to hear and see what could have been
fireworks, but was raining down firey rocks.  We couldn't tell if they
were a man-made weapon or asteroids from outer space.  We yelled,
"drive faster!!" to the bus driver who promptly did so, but the firey
rain kept coming down.  The bus driver sought a garage type thing for
protection, and finally found one in front of a mall.  I opened the
door and jumped off first, except for the toddler who jumped off like
a cat right when the door is opened.  I whooshed him back on the bus
with an announcement, "the baby is back on the bus!" and closed the
door.</p>

<p class="dream">Ran through to the back room of the mall and out the
back door to try and get photographs of the craziness.  I ended up
walking out along a chain link fence and realized I wasn't close
enough to a roof that I could run back in time if a fire shower
happened right over me.  I decided not to worry about such details and
then was surprised to see smoke ball appearing in a bush across the
road from me; it appeared people were shooting weapons from inside the
bushes!  I took a few pictures, but was having trouble with the zoom;
it was zoomed all the way out, but the pictures still looked too far
zoomed in.</p>

<p class="dream">Some soldier types started to come my way, herding
everyone out of the area and warning me to keep my gun in front of me
where they could see it.  I was like, "I have no weapon," and held my
camera up for them to see.  They ignored me again for the moment and I
kept taking pictures over my shoulder of the bush smoke.  Then I
noticed there was some kind of activity like one of the firestorms
happening behind where the soldiers were coming from.  They seemed
oblivous to it, as if they knew what it was (or were just completely
unaware of it) and continued to process people to cleanse them of the
toxins they may have received in the recent chaos.  The soldiers were
having people strip and then be sprayed down with hoses and then stand
on some sort of carpet to check for any more toxins.  The carpet was
beige with a sorta quilted checkerboard pattern of thin and thick
pile.  The thick parts had shorter pile on the edges and looked
therefore like rounded square lumps.</p>
