<p>Haha; <a href="http://qwantz.com">Dinosaur Comics</a> has become a
Reuters news delivery agent!  <a
href="http://www.bonebox.net/newsrex/">News Rex</a> combines Reuters
news with Dinosaur Comics imagery to make an entertaining
combination.  It appears the combination is done programatically,
which I think is pretty cool.</p>

<p>But right now, TJ Bike and I have some bike riding to do!</p>
