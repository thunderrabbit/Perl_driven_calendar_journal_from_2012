<p>Great fun hanging out with Carla and Carl tonight!  I rode TJ Bike
6km to Shibuya in 30 minutes, (basically straight shot along highway
246) and met Carla at Hachiko for a big hug and chatting until Carl
texted her that he would be late.  We walked to Pink Cow and chowed
tortillas and guacamole and talk talk talked and it was really weird
for *me* to be doing most of the talking, cause Carla is reallly good
at it!</p>

<p>Carl came and told us about the award ceremony that made him late
and then asked some of the same questions Carla had asked of me. At my
request Carla told him the story of how she came to apply for this
voyage and practically forgot about the chance of getting it until she
did.</p>

<p>We were both so happily stunned to see each others' names on the
list!</p>
