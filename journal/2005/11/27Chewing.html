<p>I like chewing food.  It gives me a moment to be mindful of those
who worked (coherently and independently) to harvest, grind, mix,
bake, serve the food, plus all the transportation in between and the
design somewhere in the process.  I like that Gyosei complimented my
chewing instead of saying something like, "man, you take forever to
eat," or some variant, which seems to characterize most of the
responses to my chewfulness.</p>
