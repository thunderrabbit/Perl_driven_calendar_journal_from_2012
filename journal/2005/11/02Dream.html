<p class="dream">Someone had just logged out but I needed to check
something really quickly on the public computer, so I asked what the
username/password was.  Sarah told me the usernme was FAISAL and the
password was EMVISION.  I entered those and it wouldn't log in.  I
checked both the username and password again, and was certain they
were correct. I got pretty frustrated and was like, "it should work!:"
and Sarah said, "Examine the Ms to see what they should be."</p>

<p class="dream">But I just hit alt-Q and quit the program and walked
away from the computer.</p>

<p class="dream">I went back up to her a bit later sorta angry like,
"How can I 'Examine the Ms?' ...  No, really, how can I do that and
make a decision about what should be changed?"</p>

<p class="dream">and she could tell I was mad, and told me the answer
more clearly;.  You had written EMVISON, but it should have been
ENVSION.</p>

<p class="dream">and I was like , "Oh; I guess I could have figured
that out."</p>

<p class="dream">and I didn't feel *bad* about it, but just a bit
silly, but glad I had gotten away from the computer one way or
another.</p>

<p>but then when I realized it was a dream, I thought it was the most
bizarre dream ever.  How could I have been sure of a misspelling, and
then make the correction after being sure I couldn't do it?</p>
