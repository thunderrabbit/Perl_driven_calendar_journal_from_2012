<p class="date">6:17am  IST Friday 04 November 2005</p>

<p>I almost typed November 1997, the date of my Mankind Project
training.</p>

<p>Ben and I are in the servis from Damascus to Qalandia, with plans
to reach Bil'in to document the stuff that will begin at 7am.</p>

<p>We left the Faisal with Jason, but his friend gave him a lift.
When we arrived at the servis place, only 2 other people were there
and no servis's.</p>

<p class="date">7:11</p>

<p>Magically, after declining the 100NIS taxi offer to Bil'in,
standing in the cold calling ISM Media Office, Eisa, Hisham, and
Mohammed, following Mohammed's directions to find a car in the middle
of Ramallah to ask for a ride to Bil'in....</p>

<p>A servis drove up and stopped while I was on the phone to
Mohammed.</p>

<p>"Bil'in?" the driver and I asked simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Khumseh shekl" he replied</p>

<p>Magic.  5 NIS each.</p>

<p>The crowd is being noisy, but basically peaceful.  The 8-10 year
old kids are actually being the most aggressive toward the soldiers
taunting them with song and dance.</p>

<p>The theme for today seems to be play, as in "let the children
play;" a slide has been brought, and noisemakers and toy cars ad
trucks and little dogs with heads that bob around.</p>

<p>For the younger kids, a little Fisher Price looking ball rolling
toy tower thing.</p>

<p>I've grown a bit bored and am sitting with Ben over on the side.
We had been on the other side, but when a little kid came walking up
along the wall, everyone started to encroach on our territory, trying
to get photos of the kid.</p>

<p>He was given a brave soldier's welcome when he arrived, but he
seemed nonplussed.</p>

<p>Ben and I arrived in plenty of time, compared to the activists who
were getting ready with their L shaped tubes for covering their
forearms and locking themselves to support poles on the wall
construction line.</p>

<p>Francois got a pic with Suzanne, who said basically, "we'll chain
ourselves to the poles, spend about five minutes being taken off, and
that's it."</p>

<p>Soon thereafter we were ready to go.  Piled into cars and
caravanned to the site, and ran to the posts to try and beat the
soldiers to the site.</p>

<p>Ben and I laughed at the ludicrous situation; we were able to just
<em>come early</em> before the soldiers were out and do a surprise
chaining.</p>

<p>The first guy was extracted from his chains in about
five <em>seconds</em>, though he stayed in place while the soldiers
took his L shaped tube and went to work unhooking the others.</p>

<p>None of the activists were attached particularly tightly, and the
most durable connection lasted about 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Two people were hauled to the soldiers' side of the wall (*) and out of
sight, but the rest were deposited on the Palestinian side, as gently
as they heeded the soldiers' attempts to move them.</p>

<p>I'd guess about 8 activists had chained themselves, or attempted to
chain themselves to the poles.  No injuries due to soldiers, but a
couple of people slipped on their own accord while crossing a
ditch.</p>

<p>still chillin'</p>

<p>(*) It turns out they are building a fence in this area, not an 8
meter wall.  But, as written by my friend Sarah:</p>

<pre>
       we headed to Bel'in for the weekly demo against the separation
       barrier in their 'hood. In this case it is in fact a fence,
       which does not look so unsightly, but is actually worse than
       the wall cos it takes up MORE space: it's a fence, with
       electric sensors, and a tracer road on one side (a dirt road
       kept smooth so that footprints can be detected easily), then
       the fence, then a patrol road, then another tracer
       road. Mintox.
 
       The Fence has been routed to not only enclose an illegal
       settlement (case in point, they are all illegal under
       international law, and the armistice agreements Israel signed
       back in the day), but also to annex the village's fertile
       grounds specifically to allow the enlargement of that
       settlement. Pah!
 
       I can't even summon the energy anymore for righteous
       indignation. This is just so ingrained and normal and
       inevitable and happening in so many places.... and I am worried
       that after only 2 months I am so used to the sight of The Wall
       that I forget to be appalled. Abnormal becomes normal, might is
       right. cliche, cliche, who cares?
