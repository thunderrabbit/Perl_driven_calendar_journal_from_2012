<p>Have just arrived at Yutopia, an onsen in Hakone that I visited
with Yuuko back in the day.  Paired escalators were moving forward on
the right (thought in Japan traffic circulates on the left) and I
commented that it seemed curious.</p>

<p>Hitomi seemed surprised, too; in her case, that traffic in Japan
circulates on the left.</p>

<p>There's a monstrous line; I'm glad I've been here before when it
wasn't so crowded.  I'm glad we're saving the monkey net for tomorrow,
when it should hopefully be less crowded all around.</p>

<p>Big time fun overall today.  Yutopia/Yunesan was definitely more
crowded than the last time I was there, but we still pretty much got
to do everything we wanted.  The most crowded item (per space
available) was the hot flat rocks for sleeping; but even that became
available for us after a few checks.</p>

<p>I slept on the rock for about an hour starting then.</p>

<p>I returned most often to the dead sea pool, which I must say was
not as buoyant as the real Dead Sea, yet stung cuts more than the
real Dead Sea.  Hmmmmm.  Hitomi and I agreed on both of these points
and decided it's simply because the real Dead Sea is natural.</p>

<p>A couple of places were changed from when Yuuko and I went.  The
outdoor onsens of Yutopia were themed as different beverages.  Coffee,
wine, green tea, sake.  They used to have smaller pools with these
themes, but no decanters pouring the beverage into the pool.  Cute to
see two little kids in the huge Japanese green tea cup.</p>

<p>Also cute was the kid with little leaves on his face to give him a
Groucho Marx look.  The kid and his mom wanted to do some similar leaf
art on his dad, who suggested they play rock-scissors-paper to see
just who would decorate whom.  The dad played scissors against two
rocks.</p>

<p>Outside there are three water slides, and the three sliders at a
time are synchronized, "はいどぞ" when they can go.  It was my turn to
go, so I put on swim goggles (similar to what hundreds of people had
in the various pools, etc) and the guy came up to me and asked me to
take them off.  "Please take off goggles and wrap around the
wrist."</p>

<p>I took them off and was all, "what if I lose a contact?  Are you
going to buy new ones?"</p>

<p>But the complaint in English went over his head, "contacto?"</p>

<p>I switched to Japanese as best I could, 
"もし、私のコンタクトはバイバイしったら、どうする？" and he was sorta
looking to his radio for backup, and I just went "fuck off" and slid
down, purposely flipping forward onto my stomach to almost certainly
break a rule he had not cited for me.  I found it trivially easy and
then flipped to crouch surfing on both feet and soon splooshed into
the pool, never getting my head wet.  All this in about a 20 meter
gentle S curve slide.</p>

<p>I considered going back up so I could try surfing all the way down,
but I didn't, after I recognized it would have been out of anger at
this guy more than trying to do something fun.</p>

<p>We sat in the main pool for a while, getting a sorta massage with
the water jets in a seat-shaped curve in the pool.  It made my skin
itch after a while; I wonder why it should do that; they seem
unrelated.  We giggled as the spray during the fake rainstorm came
hugely arcing over the pool and landed *just* in front of us.  Almost
like it was designed to not splash the relaxation seats.</p>

<p>Chowed lunch at one point and big ice cream cone thing.  Was
unable to get a sample of the other ice cream, but they at least had
a specific description of the flavors behind the name Blue
_(something)_.  Grapefruit and lemon.  Oooh; not getting that one.</p>

<p>We enjoyed basically every body of water in the place, except for
the one under the gold dome; it was always crowded, and I couldn't
figure out why.  Oh, that one and the sake one.  ....  Hmmm; I think
the sake one was specifically a hot hot water pool last time.  Maybe
it still is, and that's why it was so crowded.</p>
