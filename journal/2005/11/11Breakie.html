<p>Somehow dragged myself out of bed to chow breakfast.  Max did not,
so I made him a pita sandwich.</p>

<p>Though almost half the participants are Muslim, and almost half
the participants are Jewish, ham was served at breakfast.  After a
bit of a discussion, it was replaced with turkey.</p>

<p>I ate cornflakes and milk and sugar.  I've not had that in
*years*, and it was *so* *good*.</p>

<p>So good that I ate some more, and it was *so* good.</p>

<p>So good that I ate some more, and it was so *good*!</p>

<p>After that I was full.</p>
