<p>I had called this entry "thoughts" but then decided I should mix
this in with a state of my life.</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address:</h1>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>I am in Ç®³¤ (with Cheerful Dancing Fellows, my crazy class
from PB 49), to where TJ Bike and I rode from Jesse's place in ºù¿·Ä®.
9 hours of riding over a 23 hour period.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been living on Jesse's couch recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I've just been thinking about the future and funding my future
and doing the right thing, and have thought it may look like the
following:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>On PB 52, do a fantastic job of my job.  Wake up early; take time
for myself; go to bed early; take care of myself.</li>

<li>Create the reality of $3000 donation for hurricane victims and
join the bicycle ride from Texas to New Orleans in May 2006.</li>

<li>Come back and hook up PB 54.</li>

<li>Study with some monks, with focus on shiatsu.</li>

<li>Go to Univeristy of Santa Monica and get a degree in Spiritual
Psychology.</li>

<li>Sweet.</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>I have recently set my Rob Updater to keep track of remove
requests, but it doesn't do it via the database.</p></li>

<li><p>I'd like to add a field to Rob Updater mail list recipients
that describes how easy it is for them to escape the list.  For my
friends and family who I know would "never" want off, it would write
"Let me know if you want to change your email address, or *gasp* want
off this list."  For everyone else, it would say, "click here to be
removed from the list."  But then have a type of person who
occasionally gets "House cleaning time!  If you want off this list, do
nothing.  If you wanna stay on, write me back."  Maybe once every six
months.</p>

<p>Ooooh; it could keep a date of the last time they were asked (or
added to the list), and then automagically ask them when the date has
grown older than six months.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not finished the thing I want to write for Gyosei and PB
peeps comparing / contrasting Jerusalem and Tokyo.  But I have gotten
a good start on it.</p></li>

<li><p>No one in CDF took a single picture of our day.</p></li>
</ol>
