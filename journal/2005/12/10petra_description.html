<p>My description of Petra:</p>

<pre>
From the modern city of Petra (with hotels and houses and everything)
we can go into a national park area.  It looks a lot like West Texas;
there's rocks and tall things to climb on.  But there are some
carvings that I don't think we'd find in Texas.  We walk walk walk
walk along this road, and see lots of carvings and ancient
dwellings(?) or burial areas (?), and then the famous crevice
comes..  Walk through that and *blam* the big facade made famous by
Indiana Jones.

Past that there are *more* facades, but not hidden, so they are worn
by weather and not as surprising once we have seen the first one.  But
to be sure, they are just as cool and took just as long to make, I am
sure.

A bit further down there are some stalls, but I wouldn't call it a
*market*..  There's like a place to buy postcards or coffee, and
across from that are some restrooms, though I didn't go in there, and
don't know what kind of plumbing they have.   Along the way, there
were some really poor families who were selling various things for
super cheap.  Trinkets and necklaces and the like.  I had no interest;
I never buy that stuff.  Very rarely, at least.

Further further down the road there is some more excavation and
archaelogy going on, and there's a restaurant and small museum.  A
restaurant!!!!

We didn't go further than that; we had to start heading back to catch
the bus back to the ship.   There are so many many more places we
coulda gone in that area!  Wow!
