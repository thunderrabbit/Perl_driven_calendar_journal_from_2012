<p class="date">8:26am JST Thursday 29 December 2005</p>

<p>I woke up around 3:30am with some dreams, but chose to sleep
instead of write.  Again at 7:am, but I got up for breakfast in the
Yacht Club instead.  A man named Teru came up to me.  His full first
name is Teruaki, but his mom calls him Teriyaki when he's in trouble,
so I think he prefers just Teru.</p>

<p>Hung out with Christina downstairs in Topaz as her "assistant" for
a few minutes.  I would say "おはようがざいます" to most people as
they came by.  She was like, "this is Rob, my assistant."  One
passenger was like, "your sister??  wow...."</p>
