<p>Daniel had a wooden cube puzzle that he took apart for me.  It's
similar to some of the ones grandad showed me and Fred.  I think Fred
has them all now.  I'm going to try to work on it starting
right....</p>

<p>Ug.  I'm completely stuck on this puzzle.  I can see a pattern in
which all the pieces will fit exactly, and I can get them all
together, so long as I leave one out.  It seems super frustratingly SO
close!</p>
