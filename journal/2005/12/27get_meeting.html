<p>Got the main GET Meeting done in an hour and then talked for 30
minutes and ended up completely redesigning the GET Orientation
performance.  It's much better than what we had come up with before,
but I'm glad that we four had met already and come up
with <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>It's dindin time now, but I hope I haven't missed the last seating
cut-off time.</p>
