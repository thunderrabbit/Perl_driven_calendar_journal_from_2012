<p>Just got back from a lovely dinner with Mr Sumida and Tomoko at the
Ginza Lion.  We had two things of cheese fondue and roast beef and
fried oysters and I had four glasses of orange juice.  Lovely and
delicious.</p>

<p>We did two hours of karaoke after that; I did several Eminem songs:
"Just Lose It" "Business" "Ass Like That" "Lose Yourself" and "Mosh"
and LL Cool J's "I need love" and a few others - "A Whole New World"
in duet with Tomoko.  Good times; good times.</p>
