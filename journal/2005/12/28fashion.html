<p>The life-boat drill was fun; I brought my book to read.</p>

<p>Kellie used my camera to take a few pics of people in their life
preservers.  I haven't taken many pictures with my camera...</p>

<p>We were all dressed up for the Formal Thingamajig and now the
Formal Dinner.  At the thingamajig there was a band and the captain
presented all his officers and we clapped and made jokes and it was
great.  A woman named かな asked if she could sit next to me and
Maruan, which was definitely cool with me, and actually a bit
surprising, but I guess it's a natural extension from someone who
jumped on this voyage alone.</p>

<p>Also met あさみ, who is also on a solo adventure.</p>

<p>On our way out of the room, we met のん、さち、and いしこ.  Ishiko
has purple hair.  I didn't have enough time to memorize distinguishing
features of the first two.</p>

<p>Was supposed to chow with Kana, but I musta taken too long on the
above entry.  Ah well.  Was back up there before 7:30 by my watch,
but people had already started to go in.</p>

<p>I sat between Kellie and Sachie.  The restaurant was packed with
peeps, so food took a while to come out, but everything was quite yum.
I would have preferred the vegetarian meal, I believe, but I enjoyed
the steak even so.  Also enjoyed three pieces of cake at the end.
Maybe four.  People were pretty amazed at the amount of sugar I chewed
through, saying it was my alcohol.  Probably true.</p>

<p>Met one of the waiters at the end (who had given Kellie milk this
morning after all the others said it was imposserous) cause Kellie
wanted to get his name.  We got it, but I've forgotten it (though I'm
writing this at 12:16am...)</p>
