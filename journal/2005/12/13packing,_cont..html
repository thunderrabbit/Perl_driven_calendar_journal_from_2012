<p>I'll call the discovery of the sandals, plus the construction of a
box to cover my suitcase the top of the hill of packing, a task that
must be completed by 6pm tomorrow, when the takubin company may come
over to take the box to the ship.  Allll my junk is strewn across
Jesse's living room, and I've not got to choose what stays, what goes,
and what goes to donation.</p>

<p>There's a small trick of needing to keep enough stuff to ride TJ
Bike around for 6 days of freedom before the voyage..</p>
