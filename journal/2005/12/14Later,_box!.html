<p>Just finished pushing the elevator button for the guy who carried
away my box for the P3ace B0at Baby!!!  I'll help load that box on the
ship on the 24th; until then, it will wait somewhere, or be sent
through a time machine into the future!!!</p>

<p>I'm really glad to have that done; we are super super close to
heading out!</p>
