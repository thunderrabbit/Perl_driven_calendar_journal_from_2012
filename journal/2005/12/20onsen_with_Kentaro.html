<p>Just got back from the onsen with Ken; we both hit the 45 degree
baths and then the 17 degree baths (Celcius), and I felt a sorta
bone-chilling shock that melted into a vague sorta relaxation based on
the knowledge that at any point, I could get out and submerge in the
warm baths again.</p>

<p>Ken asked me if I knew about Vipassana meditation, which I didn't.
He said it's a pay-what-you-like 10 day silent retreat thing in
various places around the world.  First three days are spent focusing
on the breath.  The other days are spent focusing on other things.
Maybe.  He said there is a center in Kyoto.  The price is right; I'd
like to ride TJ Bike there after the voyage, perhaps.</p>
