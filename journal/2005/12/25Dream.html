<p class="dream">I was with some friends outside and we were climbing
on some large piles of dirt, but a man came out to tell us we couldn't
do it; we might get some sort of injury.  He said the dirt might pinch
us.  I was like, "how?" because I have played in a lot of dirt and
never been pinched by it.  He went on to explain that because it is
soft, one of our legs might sink more than the other, and therefore a
nerve inside our legs might be pinched from the disparity in height.
It sounded plausible, and I thanked him for the education.</p>

<p class="dream">I soon got an email from him offering me a brief job
as a model for some Halloween performance.  I would get 1 night of
room and board if I let them video me being electroshocked with
something on my stomach on October 12th of this year, and he proceeded
to tell me that I could come visit anytime, and I wondered if I could
use this interest in my body to my benefit; it appeared he would be
willing to pay several dollars.</p>

<p class="dream">I already had a private room with a toilet which I
needed to use presently, and sat down to compose him an email, but
there were a lot of people walking by outside and they distracted me
from my task.  The room was rather large and had lots of tile and pool
slash bathroom type area.</p>

<p class="dream">I looked more closely through the pictures he sent of
me: one with his knee injury (barely visible) from when he fell
recently, and some from the start of the bicycle ride, which I
recognized to be the same place from wich I had started with Don's
Half Fast Flash Mob a couple weeks ago.  Although it ws in a rural
farm setting.</p>

<p>I woke up and fell back asleep, dreaming I was writing this dream,
and then woke up again and wrote it.</p>
