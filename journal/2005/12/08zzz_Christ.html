<p>Jesse and I just spent about 45 minutes discussing slash defending
our religious beliefs.  I said I was unimpressed with "the bible has
no inconsistencies," because people have been poring over the bible
for hundreds of years.  If the same number of people pored over
something else for as long, it would be pretty free of errors.  Open
Source code proves that.  And it's only been around for 30 years, not
thousands.</p>

<p>But he did say one thing that piqued my curiosity: mass numbers of
people converted to Christianity after Jesus was resurrected from the
tomb.  If that's true, it says something interesting.</p>

<p>I can't imagine myself ever trying to convince someone the bible
is true.</p>
