<h1>Good News and Bad News</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>Good News:</p>

<p>We have just finished a meeting that I described to Daniel as my
least favorite meeting (so I was glad to get it over with), but in
the end, I've changed my mind to saying it's my least understood
meeting.  As in why do we do it?</p>

<p>In the meeting, they gave us good news and bad news:</p>

   <ol type="i">
   <li><p>Good News:</p>
   
   <p>There will be a PB office in NYC starting in April 2006!  ((They
   didn't announce this, but) Allison will be working there, so I'm
   really happy for her!)  I'm wondering about the possibility of
   working there, and if I could work there *and* come back for the
   54th voyage.  That would rule.</p>
   
   <p>Wow... me living in New York City!</p></li>
   
   <li><p>Bad News:</p>
   
   <p>Due to the rising cost of oil (thank you, Mr Bush and Iraq War),
   this will be the last PB voyage in the southern hemisphere.  It's
   really expensive to get fuel in the little polynesian
   islands..</p></li>

<li><p>Bad News:</p>
<p>My big toe poked through my (really old) right sock.</p></li>

<li><p>Great Quote:</p>

<p>spoken by Masae as she introduced this meeting:</p>

<p>"We know this is the first day and everyone is really busy so we
are going to try to finish this meeting in thirty hours."</p></li>
