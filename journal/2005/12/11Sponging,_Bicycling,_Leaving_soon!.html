<pre>Hello Human Inhabitants of Earth!

It's strange to realize that on 26 December, we will set sail for another
round-the-world voyage, and yet I have not even really thought about packing or
*anything*!  I'm definitely excited, thinking forward to being back on the ship,
planning lessons and having an incredible experience...  I just haven't thought
about the transition from here to there.

Right now I'm a bum with no job, living in Tokyo on my friend Jesse's couch.  TJ
Bike is living on Jesse's balcony, and on the 15th, he's going away for the
holidays, and we will have to find other living arrangements, which may very well
be my tent and sleeping bag, because I haven't really tried to find anything else!!

I will have three nights with a roof starting on the 18th.  The teaching team for
this upcoming voyage will meet formally for the first time on the 18th, and we'll
have four days of Orientation: getting to know one another, learning about PB and
what's planned for the voyage!

Yesterday I joined a group of cyclists (who cycle at least weekly when the weather
is nice) for a 55km ride through some areas of Tokyo I had never seen before (and
some that I had).  18km of the trip followed along a river, on a generally smooth
and flat track/sidewalk.  I enjoyed settling into top gear and just moving, while
having conversation with fellow cyclists, which made the distance seem quite short!
I imagine that's not particularly mindful of the whole body experience, but
definitely still fun.

We chilled in a park on Tokyo Bay; they said we were near Tokyo Disneyland at that
point, but I didn't particularly recognize anything.  We headed back to our
starting point (in Roppongi) by way of a more direct route; through Tokyo traffic
and lights with all our lights flashing like fireworks (as Don put it).  I rode 8
or 9 kilometers to Jesse's from Roppongi, making my total about 72km.

One day I will mount a video camera on TJ Bike.  Definitely.

Last thing: I have recoded a significant portion of my Rob Update list; it now
periodically asks people if they want to stay on the list.  The period varies by
person.  When I add new names, they go on for a year.  Some people who have said,
&#34;don't you dare take me off this list!&#34; are on for the next 100 years.

If you want to stay on the list, but you got a &#34;last message&#34; warning at the top of
this email, let me know.

Before Christmas, I expect to send out my overview of Palestine.  I gotta get
working on that!!!!

Last Last Thing!

If you want to send any letters or food (snacky foods are quite popular!) to me on
the ship, I have port address information on my website:  
<a href="http://robnugen.com/travel/pb/52/52_contact.shtml">http://robnugen.com/travel/pb/52/52_contact.shtml</a>

I probably won't be sending many postcards; having not worked since April, I'm
stretching my finances to last possibly until next October.  Quite a stretch, but
we're in for some good times.   Having no money can make one quite creative!

      With Love to All
       - Rob!
