<p>I didn't cry during this departure ceremony, and no one came to see
me from the port (that I noticed).  I called Hitomi and she called me
back to say bye.  I plan to call her tomorrow when we are in Kyoto to
pick up the rest of the passengers.</p>

<p>Super duper uper looper special thanks to Hitomi for having funded
my housing for the 10 days before PB.  I could hardly of survived in a
tent, I'm sure.  And she fed me a lot, which was great!</p>

<p>I hung out at the front of the ship, having no interest in the
traffic jam near the 'stage' onboard and onshore.  I met Aiya at
departure, and her mom took pictures of us from the pier.</p>

<p>According to my watch, we left a couple minutes late, though I was
busy collecting paper ribbon streamers at the moment we actually
started moving.  I wadded them up into a ball and threw toward the
pier (wanting as much garbage <em>off</em> the ship as possible
because otherwise a lot of it gets dumped), but... the throw went a
bit short and landed in the water.  "Fuck!"</p>

<p>Oops; passengers all around, hey.</p>
