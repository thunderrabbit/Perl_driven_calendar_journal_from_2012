<p>After talking to everyone, and sending Fred an email from my phone
(I hope that all goes as planned(!)) 
<!-- I told him to send 20,000 yen to Hitomi via paypal --> I was
walking back and said good night to the receptionist, who remembered
me from last time.  Her name is Bilgen, and we chatted for probably a
bit over an hour.  I taught her about hiragana vs katakana vs kanji,
and she taught me how to say I love you (obicham te) and I'm glad to
see you again (radvam se da te vidia pak) in Bulgarian.</p>

<p>I was able to use the second one when I saw one of the Bulgarian
near-twin sisters come back.  And then I was able to correctly
identify her: Kremena.</p>
