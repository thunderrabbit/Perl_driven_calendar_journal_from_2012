<p class="dream">Bruce Willis played a character (_A_) who was
inappropriately accused of sexual harassment by a shadowy, obese
ignorant character (_B_) played by John Travolta...  it wasn't
completely a movie, but (_A_) was willing to go back where he was not
allowed and work to indirectly prove his innocence by performing a
greater good.  He was advertising for something by going to a girls'
slumber party.  And as (_A_) walked through the room, (_B_) was like,
"whut da hell ah you doin' heah?" and then one of the girls calmly
shot (_A_) and went back to talking to her friends at the party.  It
wasn't clear whether (_A_) was dead, but the movie certainly acted
like he was until I woke up.</p>
