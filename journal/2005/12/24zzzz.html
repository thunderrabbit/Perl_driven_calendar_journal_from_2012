<p>What a blessing to have my own room for a night, giving me the
space and time to slowly arrange my junkola the way I imagine I'll
want it during the voyage.  And I enjoy not having as much stuff.  All
my goodies will basically fit within the closet and drawer that I can
use for the voyage.  I'm in room 3027, across the hall from 3029,
where Shawn, Shunji and I were on 49th.</p>

<p>I've read the intro to <a
href="http://bookcrossing.com/journal/3312139">Speaker for the
Dead</a> (I think that's the right URL) this evening, and I have
imaginings that I'll be able to finish it during the voyage.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time considering which bed I'd prefer to use.
I'm choosing the top bunk, it seems.</p>

<p>I always seem to like top bunks, but I was torn between having a
top bunk and a bunk in which I could sit up.  (bottom bunk where the
top one is folded away; we will have only 3 people in this 4 bunk
room)</p>

<p class="date">2:19am</p>

<p>good night.  (though I'm going to read some)</p>
