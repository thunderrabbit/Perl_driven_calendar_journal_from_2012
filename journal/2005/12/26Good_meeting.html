<p>Nice!  Just had a wonderfully productive meeting with Carla, Petra,
Karen...  Really hashed out the issues ... allowing us to present each
different country, but not leaving any one out as a single to do some
silly dance all alone on stage.  I think we nailed it in the end.</p>

<p>Everyone come out in a line sorted by country, then we mix and
match our huge nametags to some silly music (yet to be chosen) and
get them wrong when the music stops a couple times, then line them up
right and then each country at a time announces their names and where
they're from!</p>
