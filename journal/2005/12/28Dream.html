<p class="dream">Way up on the 6th / 10th floor of a hotel / outdoor
bridge with my friend at the bottom, I was tossing things down to him
and he was throwing them back up.  He threw my wallet back up, though
I didn't notice until I threw it back down again that I had tossed it
down at all.  The second time I threw it down, he took everything out
of it and made a digital copy of it, which he gave me on a memory card
that looked just like a Tokyu Toyoko train card.  He gave me the card,
leaving the wallet on the desk, and I switched the card for my wallet.
If the copy was "as good as the original," then he could have the
copy.  He was busy talking to some customer, and didn't make like he
noticed the switch, but we were good enough friends that I knew he
wouldn't mind, and I knew he knew I knew that he knew what I was
thinking when I made the switch.</p>

<p class="dream">Previously, some people had thrown rocks off this
bridge / side of the ship, but were unable to get them past the water.
That's why I was really impressed when my friend threw things that
same distance, but *UP* against the field of gravitational
attraction.</p>
