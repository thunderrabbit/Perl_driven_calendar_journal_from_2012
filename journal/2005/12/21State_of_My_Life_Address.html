<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>The battery on my computer doesn't last very long.  Maybe about
30 minutes.  I'm thankful for the extra battery given to me by Jay
from Gaba (via Jesse), although it lasts about as long.</p></li>

<li><p>Today is the fourth and final day of 52nd PB voyage GET Teacher
Orientation.  I feel like I'm far more comfortable this time around,
sorta knowing what's going on and what to expect; it's a big help.
I've enjoyed being able to answer questions that some people have
asked.</p></li>

<li><p>It seems that I have the equivalent of $24 in my Japanese bank
accounts (combined total), and $600 of space available on my credit
card, and 40,000 yen plus maybe $200 in my PayPal account.  It is with
these finances, plus the universe's backing, that I embark on this
voyage.  Oh, and 18,000 yen in my wallet, plus some miscellaneous
notes from a few of the countries we'll encounter: Singapore, Vietnam,
South Africa.</p></li>

<li><p>I found out yesterday that Rie from 49th voyage will also be
on 52nd voyage!</p></li>

<li><p>I don't really know Stacy, who was been involved since 33rd
voyage, but I look forward to talking with him a lot more.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm planning to be exemplary in many ways on this
voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>A bit worried about cash, but I plan to spend approximately 0
yen onboard.  Maybe even generate some income (cash or chocolate)
through giving back massages.</p></li>

<li><p>Met Kip Cates, who gave a really inspiring thing about Global
Teaching, and I look forward to implementing some of his ideas in the
classrooms.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm wearing no jewelry except the bracelet made by <a
href="http://microseed.org">microseed.org</a> from Sri Lanka, brought
to PB by Allison on 49th voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I wear glasses most of the time.  These are the ones I bought
with janette back in Dallas after losing my glasses in the ocean in
Hawaii after asking for guidance from my angels about the wisdom of
trying to climb onto a basically submerged rock.  These glasses are
definitely cool, but a bit flimsy and superglued together for
strength.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm most looking forward to hanging out with Carla during the
voyage to make up for all the times I didn't back in my Nova days
when I was always so intimidated by Benny; I just couldn't keep up
with his style of communication.</p></li>

<li><p>I think I can identify 1/2 of the CCs/staff at this point: Rie,
Yuki, Ken, Osawa, Ozako, Maiko, Misato, A-chan, Ai.. I get Rei and
Sono and some of the others mixed up still.</p></li>

<p class="date">11:05pm JST Wednesday 21 December 2005</p>

<li><p>Have just done karaoke with Tomoko and Sumida.  I felt quite a
pang when leaving them; I told them they've become my Tokyo
Touchstones.</p></li>

<li><p>Orientation is finished and now I have a couple days to get the
rest of my stuff done before going; actually I'm ready, but I have a
list a mile long of website stuff and emails to catch up.</p></li>

<p><ol type="1">
<li>design and write image upload and manipulation interface (a
ridiculous proposition; it's certainly been written)</li>

<li>catch up on email</li>

<li>think of a way to organize my existing photos without breaking links
Basically mySql that has attributes to photos and points to all the
URLs</li>

<li>collect addresses for voyage</li>

<li>write SOML</li>

<li>update Rob Update email list</li>

<li>write Rob Update</li></ol></p>

<li><p>I've just helped Anthony with two things: getting him hooked up
with the PB url so he could write to them, and telling him how to set
up a website on geocities.  He was asking me how to do all the crap
that I've done on my site, and I was like, "that shit is too hard to
explain" and he was like, "I've got HTML; I just need a server" and I
was like, "oh, do you have a yahoo account?" and got him hooked up on
geocities.</p>

<p>I was really happy to see him so happy with the results.  Turned
him on to <a href="http://htmlgoodies.com">htmlgoodies.com</a> when he
started having HTML questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Also looked at a bit of code by Ikumi (pretty fly looking flash
code that she hacked together from bits and pieces found online) and
she has been asked to expand it, so I offered to help her with that if
she sends me the source of her .swf file.  I think I can figure out a
way to do it... but goodness knows I'm short on time.</p></li>

<li><p>I saw Michael Heatherton at the other building; great to talk
to him again.  He offered props to Kellie and, as always, busted out
with some way funny anecdotes and variants thereof.  I really like
chatting with him.</p></li>
