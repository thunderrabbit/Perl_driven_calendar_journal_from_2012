<p>We met for wine and snacks in their room and then went to the
buffet for a huge spread of goods.  All variety of bite sized food,
mostly leaning toward Japanese concoctions, but with some that could
be western style.  We joked about how much Aki likes to eat, about how
Yama is Zue's young swallow, and how Shunji likes さけのさかな。</p>

<p>Headed down to karaoke after I finished my last plate of half fruit
and half dessert where Shunji sang a song, then we waited forever for
my song to come up (Eminem's "Lose Yourself" (the only Eminem option;
I would prefer "Rabbit Run" or "Business" in that order)) and I was
doing pretty well I thought considering I've never known all the
lyrics to this particular tune..  Some of the class came to the
microphone stand to dance around a bit and the plug got ganked out of
the outlet and the show was over.  9 songs had been cued up after
mine.</p>

<p>Then there were none.</p>
