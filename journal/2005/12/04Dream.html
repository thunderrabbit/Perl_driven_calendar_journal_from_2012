<p class="dream">Going up some stairs with a mom dad and their 
daughter, who was griping and yelling and not wanting to do anything
they said, and finally ran up ahead of them; the mom looked at me,
and was all, "I'm sorry you've had to witness this..."</p>

<p class="dream">I was all, "no no no she's.. how old is she? ..
eight??"</p>

<p class="dream">They nodded.</p>

<p class="dream">"That's her *job*.. to push the boundaries and see
what she can do and what she can't and to drive you guys crazy in the
process.  *your* job is to set those boundaries with love, stick to
them with love, and continue to love her no matter what she does."</p>

<p>Since when did I become the expert on child-parent relations?</p>

<p>Only in my dreams!</p>
