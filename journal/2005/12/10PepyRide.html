<P><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>The PEPY Ride is gearing up for its second ride- this time in the United States.&nbsp; In May 2006, The PEPY Hurricane Relief Ride will take 25 riders from Beaumont, TX to New Orleans, LA in a week-long bike ride raising money for the YMCA of Greater New Orleans.&nbsp; We are currently looking for riders, sponsors, volunteers and beginning fundraising efforts to reach our goal of 50,000 dollars for the YMCAs affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</FONT></P>

<P class=text><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>P<FONT color=#336633>E</FONT>PY stands for "<FONT color=#336633>Protect the Earth. Protect Yourself.</FONT>" </FONT></P>
<P class=text><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>The P<FONT color=#336633>E</FONT>PY Ride&nbsp;began as&nbsp;an educational bike ride across Cambodia raising money to build a rural school. The ride is an education through action program, bringing environmental and health issues right to the most rural areas and raising funds along the way. </FONT></P>
<P class=text><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>The ride concept was developed by Daniela Papi and Greta Arnquist in response to their visits to Cambodia. They both wanted to return to Cambodia to help with the development of sustainable education for a country that has been stripped of its educational foundations.</FONT></P>
<P class=text><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>The PEPY Ride is now expanding its efforts.&nbsp; In addition to volunteer and educational trips in developing countries, The PEPY Ride is working in disaster relief areas where education and health infrastructures have been destroyed or damaged.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>Twenty-five riders will spend one week in late May (tentative dates May 21-29) riding from the Texas border to New Orleans.&nbsp; The ride will stop at Hurricane-affected YMCAs each day, putting on educational programs and fundraisers with local partners in communities affected by this summer's destructive hurricanes.&nbsp; Each rider will pledge to raise or donate 2,500 dollars which will go directly to the YMCA Alliance.&nbsp; Don't be scared off by the fundraising goal-- we have tons of great ideas and will give you as much support as possible in helping riders reach their goal!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>In addition to the unforgettable experience of biking through Louisiana, riders who join The PEPY Ride will actively participate in a rebuilding effort for one of the nations oldest and most respected organizations.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" color=#cc3333 size=4><STRONG>Our Cause- YMCAs of Greater New Orleans</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Garamond, Times, Serif" size=3>Since 1852, the YMCA of Greater New Orleans has been dedicated to helping people of all ages reach their potential. It is the sixth oldest Y in the United States. The YMCA of Greater New Orleans is a nonprofit organization which services the community in the areas of child care, educational services, health and fitness. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, many of the YMCAs were severely affected.&nbsp; Despite this, they have been central in providing community support during the crisis.&nbsp; Our goal is to raise 50,000 dollars for the YMCA of Greater New Orleans, which will go towards the rebuilding the educational services provided by the YMCAs, and supporting those already in place.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
