<p>I have just been blessed with the gift of the wonderful Cheerful /
Crazy Dancing Fellows funding my stay here at this hotel.  Super
thankful to them and the universe and everyone for helping with my
adventure.</p>

<p>We just left room 736 after lots of drinking and more snacking
turned to discussions of Japanese girlfriends and young boyfriends.  I
shared parts of my story and it seemed Kazue was the most moved.  Talk
shifted to where to meet tomorrow, and I believe Yama, Kazue and Naho
are going to drive up northwest somewhere (Izumi?) where Kazue and
Naho have friends.  Not sure what it does for Yama, but maybe he lives
in the area.</p>

<p>Shunji fell asleep and Koji talked about pension (Ç¯¶â) and several
other related topics for a while.  I understood very little.</p>

<p>We are going to meet tomorrow for onsen at 6:30am.</p>
