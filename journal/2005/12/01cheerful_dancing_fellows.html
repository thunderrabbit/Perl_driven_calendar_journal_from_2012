<p>Aki arrived around 1pm, and we chatted for about 30 minutes about
what we've been up to recently. She asked me how I arrived, and I was
like, "by bicycle" and she didn't believe me and asked me again later.
She still didn't believe me, and starting naming off shinkansen types
to jostle my memory. I was like, "Aki. I rode my bicycle."</p>

<p>She said, "that's impossible."</p>

<p>Koji and his wife Kazuko arrived just before 1:30 as I was pulling
out my map to show Aki my trek. I showed them all and they
congratulated me a bit. I was smilin'. We chilled for a bit and Koji
bought us coffees and sandwiches for me and Aki.</p>

<p>Coffee. Hmmm. I've always been a big non-fan of coffee, but I
didn't want to turn down his offer after it had been purchased and
brought to the table. So I poured in three sugars and a creamer
and... it wasn't horrible. I even had ideas in my head that it
wouldn't necessarily be my last cup of coffee, but as I'm writing
this, I definitely have no plans to drink coffee again.</p>

<p>Then Shunji came and presented his speech about the park where he
volunteers as and English speaking guide!  I suggested a change of
"introduce" to "tell you about" when referring to a inanimate entity
such as a park. Yama arrived a bit later, and then took off again,
and Kazue arrived around 2:29 with Naho around 2:31.  Our awesome
class reunited!</p>

<p>TJ Bike was a bicycle sandwich between Koji's and Yama's cars.  All
downhill from Atami station to New Fujiya Hotel, where they let him
park attached to a rail basically out of the way, but near the front
of the hotel.</p>

<p>Nice hotel.  Wow.</p>

<p>Koji's wife and I each have our own rooms.  I'm in 742 and she's in
743.  Koji, Shunji and Yama are in one large Japanese style room
(736).  Aki, Naho, and Kazue are in another room, I believe.
Sweet.</p>

<p>We're supposed to meet at 5pm in room 736.</p>
