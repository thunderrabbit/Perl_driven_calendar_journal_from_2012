<p>Finished the GET Meeting in 45 minutes, <em>including</em> a
Secret Santa exchange searheaded by Petra!  Maruan seemed pleased
with receiving zartan from Palestine; that makes me feel good about
the idea and getting it over, etc.. Everyone looked pretty happy with
their gifts.. though we opened them all at once, so I didn't see what
everyone got.</p>

<p>Karen gave a travel chess set, a bar of Free Trade
chocolate, <em>*and*</em> a blank book that I'll use as my journal
in ports of call!  It has a cute little fish on the front cover.</p>
