<p>I'm remembering some dream snippets:</p>

<p class="dream">The clothes I had hung started dripping on Carl's
bed; I hadn't squeezed them well enough.</p>

<p class="dream">Watching a video of some amateur basketball footage,
I saw Tony score a winning point, towering out of a melee of
people and appendages.</p>
