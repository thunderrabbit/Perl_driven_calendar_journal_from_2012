<p>So far today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Talked to Carla, Yuki, et. al. in my old room; they are
bonding quite well.  Carla and I went up to chow some lunch (my
breakfast) in the Yacht Club.  Saw Christina on the way to serve in
Topaz Dining.  She asked why Francois was naked.</p></li>

<li><p>Met Aki, who recently retired from a steel plant, making
stainless and galvanized steel.  He is on the ship enjoying
retirement, but his wife couldn't come because she is taking care of
her mother.</p>

<p>Talked a tiny bit with Aki's new roommates as well.</p></li>

<li><p>There was one cat who didn't say anything; I wanted to engage
him in coversation, but am hesitant about my Japanese ability and
don't want to open with something like, "isn't the food delicious?"
because it sounds to trite.</p></li>

<li><p>At the same table was a couple keeping to themselves as the GET
Ts were all piling into the table, so I went over to the guy and was
like, "wazzaaahhh!" (actually こんにちは) and commented on his video
camera, [it would be cool if you can video a whale, eh?] and his wife
spoke up more than he, but it didn't matter; they were talking and I
was glad.  Turns out he does video stuff in his free time.  His name
is Susumo, and her name is Kinuko.</p>

<p>Re-met Yasuho on the way out.  Her name means Peace Walk.  She'll
only be onboard till Singapore.</p></li>


<li><p>Walked by the free space and saw a guy doing some 'flair'
bartending with a fake bottle and a drink shaker thing.  He's got
some really phat juggling skills..  well, a large variety of skills,
but not polished <em>quite</em> enough to perform on the street, I
think.  But definitely a huge start.</p>

<p>He was showing me how to do "claw catch," an overhand catch when
doing a three ball cascade.</p></li>

<li><p>Carl, Karen, Laura, Lisa came up and we were doing silly
stuff, me and Carl meeting and greeting each other with the Karen and
Laura's hands as our hands.  Fun fun times!</p>

<p>Lisa and I talked about scenes from "Whose Line is it Anyway?"</p></li>

<li><p>Massaged Rie's shoulders a bit at her request in Sports Bar as
we waited our chance to do emmigration procedures.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="date">2:51pm</p>

<p>Right now we are in Kobe, but there is some delay in the
emmigration procedures; one cat was really particular (Daniel has to
provide an address for where he is going to stay in Japan in APRIL
when he gets back.  wtf???) about stuff so not all the GET Ts got
through before they were like, "aight; too late; we're doing the
passengers first," but even so we are not doing them yet and won't
even meet up until 3:10pm to help them get loaded.</p>
