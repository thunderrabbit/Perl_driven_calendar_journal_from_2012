<p class="dream">Riding bicycles with Jesse and someone else, going
camping down by a river next to a small crowded town.  I was driving
Mr Van for some reason and had to find a place to park him before I
could continue.  I turned right into a little alley but found no
parking spots, and had to back out.  Looking back as I drove, I
couldn't see much through the back windows looking over three rows of
bench seats, but there were people doing random small town things like
walking with strollers, selling from vending carts, riding bicycles,
so I was a bit nervous about squishing someone, but everything ended
up okay, and I drove into a hotel parking lot and asked if I could
park Mr Van there.  The guy was like, "yeah; over by the pool" and I
was quite surprised, but happy to accept the offer.  Drove through a
set of doors they opened and into a wide tree-covered outdoor area,
with a rock-lined pool in two portions connected by a small canal type
thing.  I parked Mr Van backwards in an area that was next to the pool
but out of the way near a tree and when the manager came to check he
was like, "I should have specified not *in* the pool" and I looked and
to my surprise, I had driven one wheel out onto the pool, right along
a wall that jutted out into the pool.  Woah!</p>

<p class="dream">I explained to him where I had tried to park, and got
back into Mr Van, which was now turned around facing the pool and
there was a vehicle apparently in the pool facing Mr Van being driven
by Dan Akroyd (*) who was waiting basically patiently for me to move.
I backed up, and the manager suggested I just pull forward "over
there," which I did and then got TJ Bike out of the back of Mr Van.  I
got all my bags and stuff together, and even had the new light I
bought recently and was ready to head out, but Jesse and the other guy
had already gone.  It was all good, though because I had the tent and
camping gear.</p>
