<p>It's only the first night, but I'll accept this as a success: I
have done laundry (by hand) and hung it up to dry.  It's just a few
items - mostly socks, but getting it done seems better than waiting
for it to become a big pile.</p>

<p>Also called reception to see if they can replace our showerhead
which turns showertime into what Carl described as "pure chaos."  And
then called them to see if they can check on our slow draining
drains.</p>

<p>AND put a glasses holder above my bed, styled after the one I had
last voyage, but using what would have been a wasted plastic bag
instead of plastic ribbon.</p>

<p>There's a part of me (somewhat tired) that wants to go upstairs and
see what kind of festivities are going on.  However, the desire seems
based on some baser instincts, so I'm basically going to brush my
teeth and go to bed, but allow for some reading time.</p>
