<p class="dream">Matt called my full nameas the group was playing
basketball, and I ran up mocking as if I knew how to do something and
stumbled over the ball and recovered it and then did a Hakeem Olajuwan
move on a short basket with a small ball, and pretended to jump
reallly huge and (while actually still standing on the ground)
pretended to be flying in the air and doing a two handed prepartion to
slam the ball in, but kept going up and kept slowing down, as if I
were being watched on TV in super slow motion, one frame at a time
viewing and did a full circle with one hand carrying the ball, and
kept slowing down until I s l a m m e d t h e b a l l i n t o t h e h
o o p i n c r a z y s u p e r s l o w m o t i o n , a n d then
switched to fast motion as I pretended to hang from the rim of the
basket.  The rest of the GET team went wild with laughter and mock
crowd mania.</p>
