<p>I took some time for myself after dinner: showered, hand-washed my
socks and underwear and T-shirt.  Glad to get that stuff out of the
way.  Then flossed and brushed my teeth before going to 345 where the
party was being held in a rather happy and loud manner.  I enjoyed
listening to Petra and Carla's conversation; Petra sat in my lap while
she told Carla about her family, and I scritched Petra's back.  Carla
told the unbelievable pingpong ball story from Thailand; I've got to
see that show to believe it.  It's just tooooo outrageous.</p>

<p>We rolled upstairs around 10:30pm (and I was really glad cause I
thought we were quite too loud and didn't want us to get in trouble
before the first port, even).  I piggy-backed Karen from the third
floor to the sixth floor where some passengers were, so she hopped
down.  Down the main hall on 7th floor, and I poked my head into the
sports bar; it was completely packed with people (mostly teenage
girls) doing some ghetto version of a game show thing.  I watche for
about 30 seconds and then busted out.</p>

<p>Tapped lightly on Rie's door (in case anyone was sleeping) and
chatted with her; she told me about a multilevel business she's in
that actually funded her ticket for this trip!!  Or was it the other
thing?  Anyway, she said she would tell me about it after the voyage.
Nice.  We went upstairs to see stars, but there were none bright
enough in the visible light spectrum for us to see (ie. it was cloudy
and nighttime) and quickly came back downstairs to play Pente, just
like old times.</p>

<p>She won two games and I won one.  Man, she's good!</p>

<p>I'm going to sleep now, like a good GET T should.</p>
