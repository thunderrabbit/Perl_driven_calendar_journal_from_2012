<p>Tonight we are changing timezones AGAIN!  This is the second
timezone change of the voyage; the first was last night.</p>

<p>I'm going to bed early; I just seem disinterested in doing anything
upstairs with anyone; it would just be me flirting with girls, and
leading my brain down various paths that I've been down before...</p>
