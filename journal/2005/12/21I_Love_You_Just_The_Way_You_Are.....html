<p>Before and after being stuffed with the futons into the closet,
Phil kept singing, "I love you just the way you are" over and over
until it became the catch phrase of breakfast with all the GETs and
CCs.  I was quizzed on 玲's kanji and enjoyed watching Kellie do a
short version of her animal guessing game and everyone marveled at the
cards she made!</p>

<p>Breakfast was lovely and continental.</p>

<p>I love you just the way you are...</p>

<p>After カラオケ tonight with Tomoko and Sumida, I will look into
joining these guys for more of the same!</p>
