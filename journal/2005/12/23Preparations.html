<p>Recently I wrote a Rob Update, though I forgot to put in an
'apology' for not replying to all emails, but maybe I'll do that in
the next couple of days...</p>

<p>Rode TJ Bike to Kellie's house in 16 minutes.  Awesomely faster
than either bus or train (esp. due to walking to the respective
stops/stations).  Got him and tent, sleepin' bags, maps, etc. all
packed away for the winter break.  Super special thanks to Kellie
(actually Go) for offering the space.</p>

<p>Super special thanks to Jessie for offering space for my
suitcase!</p>

<p>Did some research on Rapa Nui; learned that it was an ecological
disaster area due to overpopulation in its history.</p>

<p>I'm planning to make some lessons based on that... it would make a
good Global Education topic.  Also garbage: ships are allowed to dump
a certain amount of garbage into the ocean; if I can get my classes
to the top deck to witness this, maybe the shock will help us all be
more mindful about waste production.</p>

<p>Right now about to help Hitomi make a Paypal account so she can
repay me if/when I buy an underwater camera case for her camera.  We
imagine I'll be able to get one in Singapore pretty easily; it's the
'last chance' for buying all those handy dandy items we consumerists
need.</p>
