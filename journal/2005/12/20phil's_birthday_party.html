<p>Actually it was the GET and CC dinner at Forchetta's near 高田馬場駅,
but today is Phil's birthday so we sang to him like three times, once
with cake after I had jumped on his back.</p>

<p>I flitted around the room unlike I usually do, and met a bunch of
different people.  I can see a difference this time vs last time; I'm
*way* more comfortable this time, and am trusting the voyage will be
super fantastic!</p>

<p>Drank a lot of orange juice, chowed a lot of salad and stuff.  I
mostly chatted with staff and CCs because I know the names of all the
GETs.  Maiko, Masae, Joel, Petra, Yuki, and Yuuka are all repeating
from the 49th voyage.</p>

<p>I learned れい's kanji (玲) and りえ's name... ゆき、けん、エリカ、
のそ、とじん、etc etc, names, but I'm a bit tired now to recall them
all from scratch.</p>

<p>Bigtime fun carrying Phil's bag out the door to find out whose it
was, and having him come out after looking for it while we had it, and
me trying to keep it from him as he shouted stuff about Yuuka and
Daniel's birthdays (tomorrow) and someone was like, "your birthday is
over! [we won't listen to any more of your speeches..]"</p>

<p>Big fun overall.</p>
