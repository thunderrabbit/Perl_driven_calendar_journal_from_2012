<p class="dream">I told my friend that some aliens were about to land,
and she didn't believe me, and I let her not believe me because they
actually were coming *right now*, and I didn't have time to convince
her.  Their ship came down, looking like an inflated bouncy game for
kids, and it landed not on the land where I expected, but on a lake,
and it just floated there without a problem.  The door opened and they
walked out and across the water as if it were solid and into a room.
I ran over to meet tem, and they looked rather human, wearing space
suits.  I extended my hand to shake hands with a man looking alien,
and he indicated he knew he was familiar with the custom.  I wanted to
ask, but hadn't yet, if he would show me his true form.  he showed me
somehow that he wanted to show me his true form, and said we could
take a pictue.  My friend got a camera and the alien changed into a
smaller shape and his head fell off with a hard klunk on the ground.
He didn't move for a moment, so I put the head back up near the body,
and then it rejoined and he was back to looking normal hman-ish again.
I saw the picture, and it just looked like his head was leaning over,
and mine did too, for that matter, adn just looked like a silly head
tilted posed picture.  I looked for my video camera, but didn't find
it before we had changed topics.  The alien was looking through his
stuff to find something and I put the picture (Polaroid) on a metal
frame with a magnet, which fell off the frame and went behind
something else where it stuck, and I was inspired to ask a question,
so I asked in simple English, "May I ask you a question?"  and he was
like, "probably", and I asked, "that you have seen, is physics the
same everywhere?"  He goes, "yes; physics is the same everywhere."  I
looked over at my human friend.  "that's a relief!"  with a half
joking smiile, but actually half real because if we were on such a
wrong track as thinking it was the same everywhere, but
wasn't...  eek.</p>

<p class="dream">I was considering asking him if he could help go over
some equations we had been writing to describe some physics
experiements, and he was like, "by the way, I can help simplify those
equations you are working on," and as I was wondering if I would be
able to explain the new math, he wrote a slightly different version of
the equation, and was saying, "this new form will allow you to drop a
whole _____ of your equation," indicating a fudge factor we had
introduced.  I could see the beauty of it, but wasn't really able to
understand the math before I woke up.</p>
