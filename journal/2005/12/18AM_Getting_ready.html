<p>Getting ready for four days of fun and orientation; as predicted,
I am awake well on time.  Last night Hitomi helped by hand washing my
small amount of laundry; I wrung it semi-dry and hung it up.  Still
wet this morning cause the heater was off all night, so I tossed it
into the dryer.</p>

<p>It's ridiculously cold today.  And I'm not just saying that.  I'm
sure it's windchillin' well below freezing.</p>
