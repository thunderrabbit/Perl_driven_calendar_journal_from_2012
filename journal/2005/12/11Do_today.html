<p>I've finished inputting names into my new Rob Update list.  Nice.
I plan to write a bit of a message about preparations for PB,
including snailing addresses for ports, and my latest bike ride
(today).  This will be the last message sent to many names on the
list.  With the new keep_through field set to last week for many of
the addresses, they will receive the message, and I expect most of
them will not respond that they wanna be on the list.  I've tried to
make sure everyone who has responded positively to my emails will
*not* be removed from the list soon.</p>
