<p>Ack.  I sure am not really motivated to do any of these things.
They are basically easy though,... it's just the mental block!  Okay,
I'm going to work on sorting and packing.</p>

<p>Ready... go!</p>

<p>I've gotten a good start on things.. There's a terrific dispersal
of items in Jesse's living room.  Going through old letters now, some
from before Japan.  One envelope of white feathers from Chez.</p>

<p>When I think of her, I light-heartedly call her silly, sending her
good wishes and hopes that she knows she is loved.</p>

<p>Now eating the chicken I cooked(*) yesterday.  In 2 hours I've
culled through a lot of letters, removing cards that are mostly
pre-written with just a tiny note in them, removing a lot of envelopes
and flattening the actual letters for flatter keeping in my acid-free
box.</p>

<p>(*) I really did cook it, but at Jesse's request, to keep it from
going bad in the refrigerator.  He's been slowly(!) teaching me how to
cook.</p>

<p>A bit ago, I arranged for the pickup of my box to be taken to the
ship.  That triggered it for me.  I'm sailing on PB.</p>

<p>Again.</p>

<p>I've been singing the 49th departure song in my head.  なつかし,
and I'm getting pretty damn excited.</p>
