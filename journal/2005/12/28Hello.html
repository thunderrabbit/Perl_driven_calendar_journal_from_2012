<p>Took a bunch of pics up in Yacht Club of every individual teacher;
Laura and I will use them for the GET Board thingie.  Then pics for
something that Phil is working on and then we spent a bit working on
our performance that will go something like, "Hello / Hola / How are
you? / Como estas? / GET!" that will go in an 8 beat rhythm.</p>

<p>Busted down to the rooms to get suited up and now to be presented
to the Kobe passengers..</p>
