<p>I started this at 10:30am JST Saturday 19 November 2005, and have
been picking at it like a scab off and on...  As I tell people stories
of my experience, I can spew forth profusely, but I notice it's filled
with emotion and not particularly unbiased.</p>

<p>I don't know that there's a point nor problem with that, but it's
an observation.</p>

<p>I'm thinking now about starting with the following and making a
small bite-sized outline.</p>

I have lived in Tokyo for basically two years.  I love the trains;
they are always on time

I love the level of customer service I receive in convenience
stores.  The clerk runs to the register when I walk up with my
purchase.

If I could describe the underlying framework of Japanese society in a
word, I would choose "ordered."  Everything has a place.  Every step
has a sequence.

Japanese seem to wait for the green crosswalk light, regardless of
traffic.


I recently spent some time in Jerusalem, the largest city in the West
Bank, an Israeli-occupied territory of Palestine.

I want to emphasize that the situation in the West Bank cannot be
explained in any sort of lecture or report.  One just has to go and
see for one's self.

In the Old City of Jerusalem, markets, restaurants and churches fill
different sections called "quarters."  The Jewish quarter has clean
sidewalks and streets, smartly dressed happy children with trees and
playground equipment.  Restaurants where a falafel pita costs 10 NIS.

The Palestinian quarter brims with crowds, sometimes to the point of
not being able to move.  Vending carts for socks, candy, toys,
fruits, nuts, vegetables, pitas, falafels, pomegrantate juice 

Souvenir shops feature prices that seem to change by the minute,
according to how much the customer wants to leave.  I personally was
offered an embroidered bag that went from 15 NIS to 10 NIS to 5 NIS
without me actually saying anything.

In a classic example of Divide and Conquer, the Separation Barrier
separates families from land, friends from each other, and generally
halts the flow of people and the economy.

Between Jerusalem and Ramallah, a city about 18 kilometers (11 miles)
to the north, is a checkpoint called Qalandia.

This checkpoint blocks the highway between Ramallah and Jerusalem,
which would make the trip take about 15 minutes by car.  However, the
checkpoint makes it a 45 minute trip from Jerusalem to Ramallah.

Basically, there is a barrier on the highway, through which vehicles
may not pass.  As a result, to go from Jerusalem to Ramallah, everyone
must get out of the vehicle (taxi or bus, unless someone has a friend
to drive their personal car away) walk 100 meters past guards and
through a one way gate, then secure another vehicle to go the
remaining 5 minutes to Ramallah.

To get from Ramallah to Jerusalem, everyone must get out of the
vehicle, walk 50 meters, go through a one way gate, through a metal
detector, show passport or ID to the soldiers, and then the remaining
50 meters to secure another vehicle on the other side.

In East Jerusalem neighborhoods, the streets are filled with rubbish.
The city service of garbage removal simply does not exist.  The residents

Things that shouldn't be normal:
   grenade destruction
   cow carcasses
   rubbish non-collection
   checkpoints
   gunfights in refugee camp at night
BETHLEHEM CHECKPOINT
CPOINT near mt of Olives
   soundbombs to break up crowds
   
Things that are different and okay that way:
   men holding hands in streets
   women holding hands in streets
   men and women never touching in streets
   falafels everywhere
   no queues; just mobs
   paying for taxis by handing money up and getting change back
   poor customer service
   sweet drinks

Hey Rob - find the list you already brainstormed.  Write to Jason to
ask about picture usage in a fundraiser.  Ask him the name of the
valley of the mount of olives.

Great places: Faisal hostel

Cool valley: Mt of Olives

Introduction There is a conflict in Israel/Palestine.  I knew nothing
   about it, and even wrote "Pakistan" when I mentioned it one time.
   I will say that realistically I still know very little, but I will
   describe what I saw.

Why I went: 
   I met two students, an Israeli and Palestinian who told me/us a lot
   about the conflict in their area.  They suggested that I come/go to
   the area to see for myself.  So I did.

<p class="date">2:36pm JST Saturday 03 December 2005</p>

<p>I have been agonizing over this document for weeks.  My basic task
is to write about my experiences in the occupied territories of
Palestine, but I find it impossible to actually put to paper anything
that could get across the idea of the reality there.</p>

<p>My friends have asked me questions, and I find the answers
difficult because I have to keep "backing up" to give context before
anything can make sense.</p>

<p>During my travels in summer 2005, I met an Israeli woman named
Eilat, and a Palestinian woman named Niveen.  During a series of
workshops, they described the conflict with which they live every day.
My short, generalized version of the story goes like this:</p>

<pre>
     In the land basically between the Mediterranean Sea and the
     western border of Jordan, people live with tension and fear on a
     daily basis.  Israelis and Palestinians (taken as a group) each
     believe they have the right to live in the area.

     Palestinians say they have lived there for generations and want
     to remain.  Israelis say they are blessed by God to live in the
     area.

     Supported by various western governments, Jewish people were
     given financial and military support to move into the area.
     After World War II, Jews from Europe were encouraged to move to
     this area, for it was "a land with no people" and they were "a
     people with no land."

     The countries in the middle east were clumped together and it
     was assumed that the few arabs who lived in the area could
     simply move to other middle eastern countries with the rest of
     the arabs.

     The area was renamed Israel.

     The Palestinians became angry and fought back against what they
     saw as an invasion.  The Israelis, with superior firepower (via
     the US and British governments) won the war and expanded their
     territory, further displacing Palestinians from their cities and
     villages.

     Palestinians fought back with bombings and the Israeli
     government decided the obvious solution was to build a wall
     around Palestinian areas and control access to/from and within
     this area.

     There is a separation barrier being built now.  Some of the
     barrier is in the form of an 8 meter tall concrete wall, which
     attracts a great deal of graffitti, both from Palestinian and
     international Palestinian supporters.  Most of the separation
     barrier is actually a fence, which does not look so unsightly,
     but takes up more space: it's a fence, with electric sensors, and
     a tracer road on one side (a dirt road kept smooth so that
     footprints can be detected easily), then the fence, then a patrol
     road, then another tracer road.

     Checkpoints on highways and in the separation barrier (where
     highways used to be) slow traffic within the occupied
     territory.

     Palestinians face great difficulties getting permits to build
     homes, and many therefore resort to building without a permit.
     The resulting "illegal" homes face the threat of demolition at
     any time.

     Suicide bombing attacks by left-wing Palestinians on Jewish
     citizens keep some Israelis on edge.

     Non-suicide attacks my right-wing Israelis against Palestinian
     citizens keep some Palestinians on edge.

<p>I found this description beyond reasoning; beyond belief.  I was
assured I could visit the area and see for myself.  So upon return to
Japan, I set out to do that.  I bought air tickets and did some
research about what I could do once I arrived in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>I found the International Solidarity Movement
(http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/) and decided I could start there
and see what else I find once I was in the area.  </p>
