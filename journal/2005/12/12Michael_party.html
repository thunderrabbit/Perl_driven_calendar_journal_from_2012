<p>I'm feeling a bit cramped for time.  Tonight was Michael's (Jesse's
friend from Gaba) birthday party; we met in Shibuya and об╥ц with the
cute nose was there.  She laughed at my Japanese (saying how cute it
was), so the one time she didn't laugh, I was pretty happy. </p>

<p>Michael got a dessert and photograph taken with a big hat for his
birthday; everyone seemed to have a lovely time.</p>
