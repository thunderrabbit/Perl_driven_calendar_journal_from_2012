<p>This voyage I'm across the hall from my old room, in 3027 instead
of 3029 ((There are stinky <em>girls</em> in my old room now (Carla,
Yuki, Rei, and Chieko.))) with Carl and Dan(iel), two pretty cool
blokes (a.k.a. killa dilla mofos) from Tampa and Brisbane,
respectively.</p>

<p>They're both chatty and laid back and there seems to be no chance
of us having any issues during the voyage.</p>

<p>I chose the top bunk for posterity purposes, and they flipped a
coin to see who got the bunk with headroom.  Carl won when Daniel
chose flowers.</p>
