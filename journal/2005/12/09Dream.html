<p class="dream">I had a secret love affair with a girl about 16 years
old.  she was too small to actually have intercourse, but everything
else was okay.  I was carrying her nakedly through the halls with some
magic spell so we couldn't be seen exactly, and carried her up stairs
to a room where we could get to business without having to deal with
magic spells.</p>

<p class="dream">I told her to lock herself in the bathroom while I
went to answer a knock at the door.  It was Jason Fricke, who was with
Shawn from Austin and I was like, "woah!!" cause it was so great to
see them, but I was like, "yo kids; I've got to go to sleep; I'm
really sorry" and I felt bad about it, cause I was choosing sex
instead of my friend, but there was nothing that could be done about
it at that moment.  Jason was showing me some cool stereo equipment
and basically wanted to throw a rather bumpin' party in my room, but
it was late so he didn't mind being turned down.</p>

<p class="dream">I locked the door and went into the restroom to find
my sexfriend waiting loungingly waiting in the bathrub as it filled
with sudsy warm water.</p>

<p class="dream">We were there as the scene shifted to her being a
(legal age) woman who I had just recently noticed.  She was with her
friends sitting on a large fluffy pilow as they told her about a new
experience they were going to induce for her.  They had a guaranteed
method of bringing one's awareness into a parallel dimension.  She was
a bit nervous and mentioned that she would be happier to go with a
friend.  I didn't say anything, though I was interested; I didn't want
to appear too interested, but someone was like, "Rob?  would you like
to go? you had mentioned interest before."  and I was like, "woah!"
because I would really like to have such a mind altering experience
with her, so I was like, "really?" and said "okay, are you sure it
doesn't matter what we do, and the experience is guaranteed?"</p>

<p class="dream">"yep"</p>

<p class="dream">"Cool, cause I gots to go peeeee..."</p>

<p class="dream">They laughed and I ran out of the room and down the
hall and busted into the bathroom from the previous scene and there
were people inside, so I quickly turned round and checked the gender
indication on the door. I saw it was community as they were saying
"it's okay, this is a community bathroom.."  so I went back in.  There
were no stalls, but two guys sitting on the toilets and a huge bathtub
behind them, big enough to have wind driven waves in it.</p>

<p class="dream">I realized I shouldn't bee in such a large tub
because it would be quite wasteful to drain it all.</p>

<p class="dream">I noticed I couldn't pee, and then realized that's
cause I was dreaming.</p>
