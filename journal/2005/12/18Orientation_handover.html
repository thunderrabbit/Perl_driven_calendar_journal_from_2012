<p>Chillin' at the hotel provided for us by GET, and we just happen to
also have wireless access available in Elizabeth's room, so I'm
helping her not get any work done. She just got back from a different
amazing adventure and ought to be unpacking and repacking, but we're
type type typing instead of all that packing stuff.</p>

<p>The orientation was great today; we had the actual handover
portion, which Matt said is usually at the end of the orientation,
but I think it worked really well at the beginning; it let us get to
know each other better by getting to know the other team...</p>

<p>I'm super excited about this new group; we have gelled (what is the
past tense of "to gel"?) wonderfully in just the first day, and it
turns out that I know *another* teacher - Lisa G, who used to be
Morag's roommate back in our Nova days!!  I was caught off guard when
she was like, "ひさしぶり" when I saw her, and I (again) thought she
was Tee at first.  When I saw the profiles some weeks ago, I commented
that she looked like Tee, but wasn't, and at that time I didn't
recognize her because her hair is way different.  She used to have
dreadlocks, but now she has electric hair...</p>

<p>It took me a second to figure out who she was until someone told
me her name...  "Oh!  She's Morag's ex roommate!!"</p>

<p>And, Carla said that Morag is coming back to Japan to hang out for
a bit; we're having a gathering in a couple days from now.
Awesome!!!</p>

<p>Some sad news: Carl had to suddenly go into the hospital for some
minor surgery (though he will be joining us later), and Leo had to
drop out altogether because his mom (I think) got sick!  Oh my gosh
that's totally wack for him.  I trust everything will work out for
the best.</p>

<p>It was lovely to see the 51st voyage teachers, all grown up after
their voyage and passing on the traditions.  I was amazed by Derrick
(sp), who had some super killa fly ideas about getting classes to
bond and such.  Really great to chat with him!</p>

<p>This orientation has been both happier and more relaxed for me,
because I sorta kinda know what I'm getting into, and I have a sense
of what all the terminology is.  When they say _____, I don't have to
ask, "is that a room name, an organization, a type of meeting, or
what?"  Carla was like, "do I have to be there at a certain time?"
Exactly.  I basically know those answers already.</p>

<p>Eeek; I'm falling asleep here.</p>

<p>Great chatting and chowing at the greek restaurant, plus got to see
Natalie for several hugs and Pirori for a moment.  Petra gave me a
huge blessing of hugs and confidence boost for me, saying part of why
she applied for this voyage is that I was on it.  Oh, Petra.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>I got to see Pirori for about two seconds, but didn't properly talk
to her before I left, basically because they were rushing us out of
the restaurant (we were supposed to leave at 9pm, but it had become
9:30 and everyone was still yammering happily) and once I got out into
the street and the cold, I was joined the first group that was headed
toward the hotel and forgot that I hadn't really talked to her.</p>

<p>She texted me later and I felt really bad.  d'oh!!</p>
