<p>Holy shit!!</p>

<p>As we headed out, a boat pulled up beside ours, and reminded me of
the time 'pirates' boarded our ship as we pulled close to Singapore.
It was so close that I couldn't see the interface between our ships.
I heard a clank and then the boat veered away from ours, sporting a
brand new person!  Someone had jumped off our ship onto some other
ship while we were pretty much hauling out to sea!!  I would love to
do that!  (except for the not being on PB part.  Maybe come jump
*onto* the ship!)</p>
