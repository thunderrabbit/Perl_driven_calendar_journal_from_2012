<p>Just got back from ¿Ó∫Í and Carla's Nova byebye party, though she
quit working there a long time ago.  Maybe it was a Morag welcome back
party, cause Morag was there, too!  Big fun and big chowing by all
involved.  Cool to see Ali, Brett, Tony again..  Couple other teachers
were there whose names I didn't remember.  Didn't ask, either, cause
what's the point?</p>

<p>Remembered the names of some students: Aiko, Mamiko, Akina, Yutaka,
Haruna.  Remembered Tomoko's name, but not the other .. maybe Masae,
though I might be thinking of PB's Masae.</p>

<p>Akina and I exchanged digits and letters (my new term for email
addresses) and she told me that she works in the Diet, as in Japanese
government office, so I can get a tour if I contact her when I come
back!  Cool!</p>

<p>Morag received an awesome gift of a light with planetarium globe
around it, which was designed by her student!  Wow!  It's available
only in Japan so far, but he's hoping to market it in the US soon.  It
comes as a book/kit form, but he put hers together for her, although
it will be a bit of a trick to get it home!</p>

<p>At the end of the night, I gave my last Meet People.  Get into
adventures. card to Yutaka slash Nakako, both of whom had asked for my
contact info.  Nakako ended up with it and said she would send my addy
to everyone.</p>
