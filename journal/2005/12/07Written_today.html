<p>Today's blah blah blah about my adventure in Palestine:</p>

<pre>
On another occasion, my trip back from Nablus was different.  There
had just been an attack in West Bank, killing 3 Israelis.  One result
was for traffic to be stopped from going into Jerusalem.  I was in a
shared taxi with Palestinians going from Nablus to Qalandia.  However,
we kept being stopped at flying checkpoints that had been set up on
the highways.  At the time, I had no idea about the attack, and
wondered why we kept being stopped.

During the whole experience, I was most surprised by the Palestinians'
reaction to being stopped and turned around repeatedly for an hour and
a half at different checkpoints: none.  As we saw that we would be
stopped at a fourth checkpoint on the fourth highway we used to get
into the city, people started talking.  I have no idea what they were
saying, but the tone was like, "well, it looks like another
checkpoint." and "yeah; I wonder what we should do now."

Nothing like how I imagine I would have reacted, or how most Americans
would react: "what??  Whaddya mean we can't go through????  This is
the fourth !$!$!@$!@$!$ checkpoint and I've got to get through and you
can't stop us here and ...." and so on.

But, eventually we did get through, ironically at a checkpoint I had
been by before, but going the other direction.  It took 3 hours to get
from the main checkpoint outside Nablus to the main checkpoint on that
side of Jerusalem.  I was pretty angry at how long it had taken, so I
walked through the metal detector with my keys, phone, wallet, belt.
It beeped, but I didn't stop.  And no one tried to stop me.

There were plenty of soldiers who could have at least *said*
something.
