<p>I've had a pretty awesomely productive day, primarily focused on
reading GET / PB related material, and getting psyched up for the
voyage!!  I've finished my to-do list down through "Watch Star Wars
III" so I'll be doing that now.</p>

<p>I added that when Sam offered me the DVD which he rented, in
exchange for me returning it tomorrow before 10am.</p>

<p>At this point on, I just need to do a bit of research on my port
and optionally, some of the things we'll be discussing onboard!</p>

<p>I feel happy and well-prepared.</p>
