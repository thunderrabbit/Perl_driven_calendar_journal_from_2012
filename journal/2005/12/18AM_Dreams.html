<p>During the time I was semi-awake/asleep, I had a long series of
dreams, but don't remember but snippets:</p>

<p class="dream">I was on the second floor of a building as a guy
below me was getting some exercise by tossing a drum up in the air and
catching it.  He had to throw straight up because there wasn't much
space and wires (phone / electric) crisscrossed above him except for a
small gap.  I suggested that if he step up onto the roof between us,
he would have more space to throw.  He stepped up, and I moved up and
he was tossing the ball but not being very careful about catching it,
and let it fall, expecting the guy below him to throw or kick it up.
Even then he wouldn't move or try at all to catch it, and eventually
*I* caught it, though I hadn't even been expecting the ball to come
that high.  I walked over til I stood above the guy and dropped it
down to him and he missed it and it fell to the ground.</p>

<p class="dream">someone had rewritten the note I wrote to Sam on the
whiteboard downstairs, rewriting it so it took up less space.
Everything else had been erased.</p>
