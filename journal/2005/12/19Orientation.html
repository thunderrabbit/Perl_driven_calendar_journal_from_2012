<p>Today's orientation session included some not-as-exciting topics as
meeting the previous voyage teachers, including the computer network
and curriculum stuff, but we got through it alright and had a lovely
visit to <a href="http://benscafe.com">Ben's Cafe</a>, which features
free internet access, which Elizabeth, Petra and I scooped up
happily.</p>

<p>Petra was logged into her Orkut account, so I had her send me an
invitation!  Cool!  I've wanted one for a while, so I'm glad to have
finally gotten it!  I invited Fred and Dude, and maybe one more.</p>

<p>Walked back to the ryokan with Elizabeth (who was relying on my
sense of direction to get us back), and then used the internet signal
available in her room because my room was locked.  Turns out Maruan
had left the key downstairs with the guy, so I could have gotten
in.. Ah well.</p>

<p>Talked to Maruan and Nick a bit; Maruan got secret santa gifts
today, and then got a phone call so he left the room.  Nick and I
chatted some; he is from Melbourne and has a background in forestry.
He took a bus from Vancouver to Houston (three days), and was there
four days before flying to Mexico City, and living there a while.  He
was on the 46th voyage, I believe.</p>
