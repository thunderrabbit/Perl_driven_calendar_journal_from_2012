<p class="dream">I was not smoking, but holding a lit cigarette as I
went over to see Genki Man Dan, who was driving a small red sports car and
had called me over to it.  He was like, "can you see me?" and I ducked my
head into the passenger's side window and looked at the interior of
the car.. "where are you?" and he was like "here" and fogged up tieh
driver's side window with his breath.</p>

<p class="dream">I climbed into the car and put my lunch down on the
floorboard and crushed out the cigarette on the carpet, well before
it was 'finished' but I was finished with it, and I could feel its
heat on my fingers.</p>

<p class="dream">To Dan I was like, "Wow!  No I literally cannot see
you at all, but I can see tfog from your breath."  It was so literally
true!  I didn't ask him how he had done it; he had found a neat trick
or talent and I enjoyed haveing the challenge of determining how it
was possibly.</p>

<p class="dream">I left my lunch in the car as I started to walk
away, went back to where I had been talking to my boss, and realized
I forgot the lunch.  Ran back and flagged Dan down to stop him, and
ran up, joking accusing him of having made my sandwich invisible too,
keeping me from finding it.  Dan was still invisible, but on his cell
phone, though it was on the dashboard on speakerphone, not apparently
floating in midair.</p>

<p class="dream">I was riding TJ Bike to my umfriend's house, with the
understanding I could keep him there.  It became apparent from her
reaction that she was less than pleased witih it, so I asked
specifically, "can TJ Bike stay on your porch?" and she goes, "are you
going to come to my office with me, too?" in a snotty way.  I was
like, "I'm not going to stay here," and I rode off without another
word.  I rode back up the hill wondering where I could stay for the
night.</p>

<p class="dream">Quickly recognized I could likely find a place in a
parking garage next to a building exhaust vent for warmth.</p>

<p>then my alarm went off</p>
