<p class="date">7:05am SGT Friday 30 December 2005</p>

<p>Woke up naturally at 3:30am and then again at 6:am.  Made little
attempt to remember dreams, but just relaxed and read a chapter of
_Speaker for The Dead_.</p>

<p>Daniel is feeling better (went to bed feeling a bit ill last night)
and Carl is still crashed out.  I don't know what time he came
back.</p>

<p>We had our first time change last night; that affected the time I
woke up, I am sure.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying the character named Ender; he seems to have his shit
together.</p>

<p>Breakfast now.  Interviews start at 9am.  Many of the pictures of
students that Carl and I have look like mugshots; I'm sure the real
people will be much lovelier.</p>
