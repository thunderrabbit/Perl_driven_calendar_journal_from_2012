<p>Last night, Karen and I jetted from the orientation, and I used
her cell phone to tell 朋子 that I might be late meeting her in 品川
at TGI Friday's.  Karen and I got to the station and actually it
appeared I would be on time.</p>

<p>I debated between walking over the bridge and walking along the
sidewalk, and literally backtracked twice before I chose the sidewalk.
Waited for traffic before crossing the street and then while walking
up along the shops, I saw Rie from 49th and 52nd PB voyages!!!  She
and a friend were chatting over coffee-type beverages.  Jumped in
there and gave her a hug and invited her to join us after she was
done.  She declined; she was headed to Hiro.  Last hug, then zipped
over to TGIF to meet Tomoko, who was not there.</p>

<p>Crap.  My phone was quite dying after having been charged for four
days (my own silly fault; Petra had a charger, but I never actually
borrowed it from her) but I called /トモ and learned the awful
truth.  They were at TGI in 銀座.  Dammit.</p>

<p>Well, good thing Rie couldn't join me.  Well-embarassed for having
barely arrived on time at the *wrong* place, I walked back across a
bridge so she and her friend wouldn't see me during my blunder.</p>

<p>My phone was too dead to tell me which way was most efficient to
get to Ginza, so I made a guess as to which line would work best,
then (missed the first train that left, knowing an error going the
wrong direction is worse than missing a train as it's basically twice
the time to recover, and) talked to the guy on the platform who
confirmed it would have been the right train.  blah blah blah got to
Ginza, used a payphone to call Tomoko and she led me to TGIF.</p>

<p>We chatted and chowed and ate a rather tall dessert with three
plates: bite sized cakes, three sauces, and brazed/glazed fruits.  I
told the manager it would be better with a fourth plate of ice cream
after he asked how we enjoyed the meal.</p>

<p>To カラオケ and sang songs for an hour of Eminem and Prince and
some choices by Tomoko and Sumida..  Lovely fun.</p>

<p>When we got into the elevator, I was barely able to get all my bags
into the doors, and Tomoko was like, 「大丈夫？」 and I go 
「今からオケーです。」and the guys in the back of the elevator laughed.  My first
joke in Japanese that got a response from strangers!  Funny times.</p>
