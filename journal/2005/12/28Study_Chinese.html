<p>Met ¤Ò¤µ¤¨ at lunch today; she and her husband were pretty
talkative; he spoke English pretty well; she apparently speaks
Mandarin pretty well, so she and I will hook up an English-Chinese
exchange!</p>

<p>Their room is on the 7th floor near the front of the ship.</p>

<p>One of the three others sitting at the table said in Japanese that
she wanted to talk to me, but was nervous about not knowing English.
I was like, [naw naw it's all good, jack] and proceeded to pull out
Francois and told them the story, hoping that my being silly would put
her at ease...  She stopped listening and talked with someone else at
the table.  Funny.</p>
