<p>Amazingly, I was able to call the PB office on my phone during the
GET Orientation!  I looked down and it showed I had a signal, but I
didn't think it would actually work (could be just thinking it
recognized a non-usable signal or some such)... I called PB office and
they answered!  I was like, "I'm just testing my phone from the ship,"
but they didn't respond past that; I wonder if they could hear me, and
if the signal got interrupted by lack of radio waves or by a
hangup.</p>
