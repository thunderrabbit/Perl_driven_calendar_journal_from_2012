<p>I've been pretty sidetracked during the day today; I've basically
written a Rob Update after checking the list twice, plus written a few
emails.  My inbox is definitely not clear.  Oh, and I posted "<a
href="/wordpress/?p=51">Rafah Crossing by Serena</a>" on my journal.</p>

<p>Watched National Geographic show on Airplane Day, which was
riveting due to the story, if not the presentation, BUT had a
surprisingly abrupt ending, <em>just</em> as they were talking about
the plane heading toward the Pentagon.  I find this *very*
interesting, given that I believe the <a

was not hit by a passenger airliner</a>.</p>
