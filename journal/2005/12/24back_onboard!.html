<p>Just like they said, being back on board is like being back home.
Every staircase known like an old climbing buddy, and lots of the same
crew welcoming us back for another round.  Sabrina, Wu, Sasha, and
others others others whose names I don't remember or never knew...</p>

<p>Been helping load lots of stuff (*), and about to go upstairs to
scope the top deck view...  but it's COLD so I won't be up there
long.</p>

<p class="date">1:55am JST Sunday 25 December 2005</p>

<p>There's no smoking allowed in Hemmingway!  The horrible hall of
smoke has been condensed to one smoke ventilation machine!  I'm so
thrilled with this!!</p>

<p>(*) Tony and I were to meet at 4pm in Yokohama, but he was unable
to get there at that time due to such long distance traveled, etc.  He
called me a bit before 5pm, once I had already arrived at the
terminal, and got directions.</p>

<p>We helped get shiznit organized for GET, and I helped a human chain
tossing boxes for the convenience store up the steps from the 4th
floor to Broadway.  Enjoyed that pretty well, occasionally using only
one hand, rarely making jokes in Japanese.</p>

<p>Got to chat with Stacy while we chowed; he's been on like 9
voyages; lots of history in his brain that I'd like to explore.  Back
to work after food, and this time I worked a bit down on the pier, but
the wind felt quit nippy, so I went in to get my big coat and gloves.
After a bit, I felt bad for not having met Matt at 9pm, so I went up
to find him.</p>

<p>Found him on 6th floor, in a meeting with Joel, Yuuka, Sachie, and
Tony.</p>
