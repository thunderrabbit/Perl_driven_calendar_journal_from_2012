<p>Just chowed in Topaz Dining with several of the GET Ts (in our own
little clique; oops!) and now I'm about to go upstairs to Yacht Club
to get a bit of a snack.</p>

<p class="date">2:39pm</p>

<p>Talked briefly with Christina in Yacht Club; she asked after
Francois and specifically asked if he was clean.  I hadn't gotten to
talk to her after she washed Francois and returned him at the end of
last voyage.  Christina told me she would be leaving for vacation once
we reach Singapore, but assured me Genoveva (sp) would be staying for
the whole voyage, and I should keep an eye on her.  And Francois.</p>

<p>Christina is my favorite on the waitstaff; she usually works in
Topaz, and always seems to enjoy chatting up the passengers and
joking around with them as appropriate.</p>
