<p>I just want to record that I am healthy and happy on PB (primarily)
due to having lived in Millenium House for the past ten days.  Hitomi
suggested that I live there because the weather was scheduled to be
super cold at night, and if I were to live in a tent during this time,
I might start my second PB adventure with a sickness.</p>

<p>I wouldn't have likely stayed there except for one detail.  She
offered to pay for it.  I haven't properly been thankful, and I'd like
to super duper incredibly thank Hitomi for funding that.   And
chocolate.  And laundry.</p>
