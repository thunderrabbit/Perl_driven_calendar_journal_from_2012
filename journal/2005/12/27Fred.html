<p>This is the day I got up "early" and went to the gym and did
stairmaster (because both treadmills were in use) while keying an
email to Fred on my cellphone.  My knees got tired of the stairmaster
so I went to the (small) basketball court ("sports deck") and ran in
circles trying to make a line of water along its perimeter with wet
shoe prints.  There was water on about half of the court and the rest
was basically dry.  I had a visible line (though not solid) after
maybe 20-25 laps and then Fred called back!!</p>

<p>Reallllly great to talk to Fred today.  He had helped me with a
paypal transaction and told me how it went.  We had bounced some
emails back and forth about 12 hours previously and this morning I
wondered why we hadn't thought of voice communications..  Anyway, he
skyped me and we chewed through 7 Euros of skype time in 35 minutes
(expensive to call a cellphone in Japan, it seems) and then he called
me on his phone card a couple times, but the reception got pretty bad
and we ended up disconnected for several minutes so I just went
downstairs where the wind wasn't whippingly cold.</p>

<p>While waiting to see if he would call me back, about 4 emails from
him came through to my phone, so I read a time-condensed account of
the paypal progression from [wtf?] to "PWWWWWN3D!!!!!!!" the meaning
of which I have little idea.</p>

<p>I'm glad to get basically caught up a bit on his work and life and
stuff.</p>
