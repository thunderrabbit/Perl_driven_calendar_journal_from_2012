<p>Today I've been chewing through emails in my inbox... gotten from
about 110+ to 55.  Mathematical halving not intended.</p>

<p>Gonna wake up earlyish to get the TJ Bike portion of my stuff
packed and head out.</p>

<p>BUT, I am not heading out to the wild blue yonder.  Back to a
place known to some as MH....</p>
