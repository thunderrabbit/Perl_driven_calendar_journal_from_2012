<p>Last night around 9:30pm, after flossing and brushing my teeth, I
bundled myself up in my tent and headphones and watched Star Wars III
on my computer.  By not wearing my glasses, I got a full screen
surround sound experience, having the screen close enough to see
clearly.</p>

<p>After the movie, I just closed the computer and let sleep take
over.  Lovely.</p>
