<p>Tonight we had a holiday feast slash bible study here at Jesse's.
Kazue and I helped Jesse cook.  I chopped and she stirred.  Then I
mixed and she stirred.  Celery, hamburger, mashed potatoes, pasta
sauce.  Chicken and corn plus gravy...  quite a feast.</p>

<p>I slept for a decent part of the bible study part.  Talking about
how different people have come together by coming to Christ.  The
example on the video was the Jews and Gentiles, all coming together
worshipping Christ.  Something like that.</p>

<p>The dude was talking about Jews so much that I wondered if those
at the bible study believed themselves to be Jewish.  I don't think
so, considering we were wondering when Hanukkah started.</p>

<p>What I did figure out is why I enjoyed cooking with Kazue.  She has
the most perfectly cutest nose and high cheekbones in the planet.  And
she was quite outgoing and other good things.  She needed a blanket to
sit crosslegged wearing a skirt, so I zipped to get the quilt janette
made for me for her.</p>

<p>Didn't talk to her alllll that much, but may see her on Monday at
Michael's b-day party.</p>

<p>At the end of the evening, Jesse and Michael were trying to
convince her the importance of choosing Christianity over Buddhist
rituals that her family expects her to perform.</p>

<p>I mentally shook my head a lot.</p>

<p>At one point I offered, "it's easy; just get baptised after your
parents die!"</p>

<p>She goes, "what??"</p>

<p>Jesse was like, "he's not Christian."</p>

<p>I go, "yeah, I'll fill your head with all sorts of things these
guys don't want you to hear.  But it's your choice."</p>
