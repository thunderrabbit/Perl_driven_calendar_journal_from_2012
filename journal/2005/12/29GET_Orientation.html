<p>The GET Orientation went smashingly well; we pulled together the
nutty cobbler of performance pieces into one show smooth as
buttah.</p>

<p>I'm really glad to see Pepe having so much fun and really engaging
the passengers; he had been a bit concerned about a low level of
energy toward the Spanish classes.  I was like, "you get to make it
happen, yo."</p>

<p>Chowed lunch (on the early shift; oops) with リく and met やのママ、
大崎、さりー、and　五十嵐（いがらし）.  りく convinced 大崎 to sign
up for GET; I wonder if she can get a finder's fee!</p>
