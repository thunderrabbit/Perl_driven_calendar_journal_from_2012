<p>Welp, I'm in my new digs.  I'm back at Millenium House for 9
nights, not including those several nights I'll be out at PB
Orientation..  Hitomi suggested that instead of sleeping out in the
cold in my tent, I could sleep in Millenium House, with walls, a roof,
shower.  And a tent.</p>

<p>The price was right(!), so I accepted.</p>

<!-- 
she said she would pay for it!  Basically as atonement for having
slept here so many times when I was paying for it.

<p>Rode here today, with TJ Bike's four bags packed, plus the green
bag bungeed to the back.  He was a bit of a trick to steer through
narrow spaces at low speeds.  Whooshed down a couple of hills
though.</p>

<p>Talked to Anthony a bit.  I'm surprised he's not working now, but
it's been a while since I've been here..  I asked him what was the
biggest problem in Mombassa (he's from Kenya, but I don't remember
what city), and he said malaria.  Too hot and humid to stop it, he
assured me.</p>

<p>Elvis got my room ready, and now I'm in #19, in Jon's old room,
right next door to where I used to live.</p>

<p>Only bad thing: no wireless internet.</p>

<p>But I'll turn that into a good thing; I'm going to do something
I've not done in a long time.</p>
