<p>Now performing our first time change of the voyage:</p>

<p class="date">11:10pm SGT Thursday 29 December 2005</p>

<p>Today:</p>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>Talked with Petra about computer / network stuff and how to
present it to everyone.</p></li>

<li><p>Went through a bunch of stuff in GET Room 7... the 51st voyage
teachers had left a ton of stuff there.  Lisa and I grabbed a lot of
the food.</p></li>

<li><p>Went to dinner and inquired about vegetarian card.</p></li>

<li><p>Went to ___________'s lecture about Second Harvest, the
concept of which feeds people in Tokyo with food that would otherwise
be thrown away.</p>

<p>I left before the questions, because last voyage they were always
outrageously horrible, and I guessed they would be no better this
time.  Carla came out and said they had asked, "why were you drug
addicted at such an early age?" and "why did you have a child out of
wedlock?" and "when you lived in a cardboard box, what did you do when
it rained?"</p></li>

<li><p>Sat in the hall and waited for some/anyone to come say HI.
Francois is a good magnet for that.  Met a dude named æÂ∏∂ from
Okinawa.  He was super talkative in English.  Then met √“∑√ (§»§‚§®),
also from ≤≠∆Ï, and she was super talkative in Japanese, despite her
good fluency in English.  I got several new vocabulary words,
including [coincidence] and different kanji.  I drew her a map of the
US and she drew a map of Japan, and we described where we had been,
etc etc.  Good times.  Oh, and she taught me things about Japanese
kanji that no one had ever taught me before (or at least not in a way
that stuck): ø∑°°is the kanji for Œ©, Ã⁄, and axe, but I can't seem to
find that kanji now.  She taught me the name ≈‘∆ª…‹∏© in a way that I
will probably always be able to remember (the pronunciation, if not
the kanji); I never knew there were more than ∏© and ≈‘.</p>

<p>The conversation broke down due to lack of vocab when I tried to
explain we had Alan Nelson on the ship, talking about how the US
should pull out of Okinawa, but I didn't remember how he proposed to
give the Okinawans non-military based jobs.</p>

<p>We have both seen Hotel Hibiscus.</p></li>

<li><p>Said bye when the first midnight rolled around, and then went
downstairs.  Saw Stacy and reminded him about time change and he
looked *SO* happy for such good news.  Huge high five.  I hope he is
able to sleep beautifully.</p></li>
