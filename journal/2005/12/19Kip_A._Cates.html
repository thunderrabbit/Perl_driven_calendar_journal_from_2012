<p>Got a light speed, but informative and inspiring lecture from Kip
Cates, a man who went from dropping out of a French major after not
learning French after 6 years of study, going to see the world, and
recognizing a need for a broader method of teaching.. something beyond
just grammar and vocabulary, that taught language by using the
language to study world issues of importance, from easy stuff like
talking about flags and music to hard stuff of disease, peace and war.
It's called global education, and has been educating teachers about
how to teach in a global methodology, presenting not just the issues,
but getting the students talking about ways to solve the problems,
researching what thing *are* being done about them, and then taking
action into actually helping solve problems about which the students
have become passionate.</p>

<p>He suggested scoping

<p>I feel inspired to do far more than just teach classes onboard.
Wow.</p>

<p>He cited a cat named Edwin Reischauer:</p>

<blockquote>
We need a profound reshaping of education on if mankind is to
survive.  We are now facing grave difficulties that can only be
solved on a global scale.  Education is not moving rapidly enough to
provide the knowledge and attitudes essential for human survival.
</blockquote>

<p>That basically makes sense to me.</p>
