<p>The next morning I wrote in my TJ Bike diary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SLEEP won that race. I was able to sleep 4 hours without a tent,
but then got too cold in just my sleeping bag.  Did not use the tent
poles, just got in it like another bag.  It blocked the wind.  7:45am
now.  Ready to go.  24 km to Atami.  84 km done yesterday.</p>

<p>I'm in Atami now; I arrived at 10:12am, 23 hours and 1 minute after
my official leaving time.  I spent 30 minutes with my feet in the
public hot spring right outside the station; chatted with Kellie about
PB preparations and then went in search of a free wireless connection,
for I have foolishly not written down specifics about where we are
meeting.  From the email, I got the idea there was just one cafe in
the area, but there are plenty.</p>

<p>Haven't found an internet signal yet, but I did find an electrical
outlet in McDonald's where I chowed a chicken burger and salad and
orange juice and still find myself hungry.  I guess I need more food
than usual after riding 100km.</p>

<p>The last part of the trek along 135 included two rather steep hills
(fortunately with lovely steep downhills on the other side).  I
thanked the gods for free food and snagged a mikan from a tree before
a woman offered me one a bit later down the road.</p>

<p>Right after that was the first whoooshing downhill, and I whooshed
pretty quickly.  A couple times on curves with gravel sprinkled on the
edge; I thanked TJ Bike and the gods of friction and kept on zooming
down the hills.  Fantastic.</p>

<p>Right after the first zoom, I went by 真鶴駅　（まなづる駅）at
8:58am today.</p>
