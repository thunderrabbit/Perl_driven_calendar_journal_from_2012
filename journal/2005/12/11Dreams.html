<p class="dream">Walking through a wide tunnel type thing into an
amusement park where I was looking forward to riding coasters and
such, but the crowds seemed to be coming specifically OUT of the park.
I was told I had to turn around, and I felt the same sortof "why? this
is ridiculous!"  feeling as in Palestine, but then I saw Simon from my
old work and he was like "Rob, trust me, you have to go back," and I
could see he was on the edge of crying as he handed me what looked
like a spiked ball of a middle ages weapon.  I was like, "why are you
crying?" and he goes something like, "because of the bad news" and
proceeded to tell me there was a supervirus on the loose and these
balls being handed to people were basically bombs to kill ourselves if
we got the virus.  I accepted the story and the bomb at first, but
then I was like, "I don't need this; my death is up to god, not
myself" and went back to the parking lot to find my scooter.</p>

<p class="dream">I was delighted to find that janette had made me a
sandwich, and fashioned some celery and shredded carrots to look like
a boquet of flowers.  Perfect boquet - nothing wasted cause it's all
edible!</p>

<p class="dream">I ate the sandwich and flowers and read her note
which was short and sweet, and then</p>

<p>(due to dream chaos or I forgot something)</p>

<p class="dream">I was on a school bus with an old old woman driving.
She looked really old and frail, but she was chipper and genki and she
was like, "do you want to go to a beautiful mansion?"  and we were
like, "sure!"  and she took us, but it was locked, but she had the key
cause it was her house!  She said we could have the run of the place
and do whatever we liked.  It was dark, and I had to pee, but I
couldn't find the restroom so I peed out the window into the grass
below.  Went back to sleep and then woke up in the morning and had to
pee and ran to the same window, and because it was daytime I could see
a golden arc and then freaked to see that I was peeing out of a high
rise hotel in Acapulco with people all over the beach and on various
balconies that had a view of this window, etc.  Shit!!  I ducked down
and tried to find a place where I couldn't be seen, but then just
decided to deal with any reprecussions, and simply walked away.  I
realized that wasn't dealing with the situation very directly, and
then I realized it was a dream, and woke up.</p>
