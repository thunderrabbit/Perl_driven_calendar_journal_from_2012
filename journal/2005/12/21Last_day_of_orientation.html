<p>Had lunch with Maruan, Kellie, Elizabeth y Pepe at a Japanese curry
shop. Not sure how most people would describe it, but.</p>

<p>Walked back to the meeting place with Elizabeth; she's cool, and
wiser than most women her age (22).</p>

<p>We're outside in the sunshine and cool slight breeze checking
email and stuff on a beautifully free wireless signal.</p>

<p>I've been looking for someone to go to Karaoke with Tomoko and
Sumida, but have had little luck; too short notice, it seems.</p>

<p>After lunch there was not much more orientation left, but in four
different teams we presented ideas for open lessons.  Kellie, Mauran
and I did the advanced level, variants of "supposed to," a grammar we
kept using when talking about how we were supposed to have set up the
presentation.  After all the opens, I got to do about an hour long
portion, playing a Jeopardy(tm) style game to seal into people's minds
the random data about things related to the voyage and GET program.
Kellie called me Alex, and I tried with some success to keep the
eruptions of discussions under control, and overall we had a lovely
time.  Teams were reallly keen on winning, though no prizes were
involved, and Matt quickly erased the board and scores after the game
was over.</p>

<p>Yuuka presented a few points about scheduling over the next few
days and then we rocked outta there!</p>
