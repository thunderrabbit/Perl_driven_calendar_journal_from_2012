<p>I dropped overboard a plastic bottle with a note inside,
basically, "If you find this bottle, please email me!" then gave an
email address and a bottle number.  Bottle 2 went first, and I plan
to drop bottle 1 tonight.  They both say 30 December 2005, and both
say "near Taiwan" as the drop point.</p>

<p>I dropped the next bottle (labeled Bottle 1) in the brink around
10pm in this timezone.  Bedtime now.</p>
