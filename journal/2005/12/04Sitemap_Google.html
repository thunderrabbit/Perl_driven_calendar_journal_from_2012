<p>I was a bit late to Kellie's cause I started reading about google
sitemaps after checking google analytics for my site that said people
had searched for PB specifically on my domain.  About 460 pages come
up, all of which have been coverted, but googs hasn't done a deep
search again.  Apparently a sitemap can help google decide which
pages need to be crawled again.</p>

<p>Not sure how/if it all works exactly, but I was in the process of
downloading the python sitemap creator when I realized I had to leave
imeejiately or I'd be late.</p>

<p>I started looking into it and found that I need a later version of
python on my web server before I can run this python script.  I
contacted them and they said it was an old distribution and not being
updated.  But I could move my site to a new machine and have all the
latest and greatest.</p>

<p>So, besides hanging out with Keiko, I've been working on that
today.  But now (soon) I'm going to bed.</p>
