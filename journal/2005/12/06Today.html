<p>This morning I finalized the switchover of robnugen.com to the new
machine.  It seems everything is working fine.  Ironically, I was
unable to get the google-sitemap python script to work because I use
virtual URLs for the bulk of my site.</p>

<p>I worked on what I've begun calling the Executive Summary of my
Palestinian adventure, basically by summarizing my journal from that
time.</p>

<p>Today I wrote</p>

The Faisal Hostel is where I based most of my activities in the West
Bank.  It's located right across from Damascus Gate of the Old City in
Jerusalem.  I had arrived during Ramadan, meaning the Old City was
more crowded than usual as people went there to pray in the
evenings. One of my first nights in the hostel, several of us spent a
lot of time looking out the window, watching the activity of soldiers
running around and riding horses with flashing red and blue lights. It
was pretty neat, but a bit scary to wonder what they were all doing.

One day, Rami invited me to go to Nablus with some other PalVision
volunteers.  I was keen to visit new places, and looked forward to the
trip.  We planned to go on October 12th in the morning.  There was
some concern that we would not be able to come back that evening, if
we tried to leave too late.  Yom Kippur, a Jewish national holiday
would start, and it was possible the Israeli border police would
simply close the checkpoint outside Nablus.

No one said the checkpoint was scheduled to close during Yom Kippur,
but just warned that it could close, at the whim of the border police
and their holiday plans.

----------

In Nablus, we met several people from an NGO that partners with
PalVision.  We were given a tour of the Old City in Nablus.  It seemed
a lot like the old city of Jerusalem, but smaller and no Israeli
soldiers. Still plenty plenty of shops selling food, brushes, clothes,
electronics, phones, fans, foul, and everything else.

We were told about the recent history of violence in the city.

No soldiers were present at the time, but the evidence of violence was
clear.  Bullet holes in various stone walls, rubble filled lots where
houses had been, posters of "martyrs," Palestinians who had died
fighting for their own freedom.

One memorial looked a lot like a public phone box.  Previously in that
location had been a public phone which had been rigged with an
explosive.  A man picked up the phone to use it, and was killed by the
bomb.

----------

During the day we learned the checkpoint would be closed, so we left
Nablus early to 'escape' before they closed it.  There were many cars
lined up to get out, and hundreds of Palestinian men in a line.

We just used white privilege to get through the checkpoint at
Nablus. Though the Palestinians were trapped behind the barrier, we
just walked out through the in gate, briefly showed our passports to
the soldiers and got through.

The border would close in a couple hours for Yom Kippur, and stay
closed for 24 or 36 hours.

I wondered what action is appropriate.  Should I refuse to go through
unless they let everyone else through? Just wait in queue? Simply ask
why they can't go through???

Every Friday there is a demonstration near a village called Bil'in,
where a section of the separation barrier was being built.  In this
case the barrier is a fence, with tracer roads as described above.
The demonstration was described as a "game" by a man named Jason, who
has been there taking pictures every week for some months.  He had
been enough times to state with certainty there are 45 speed bumps in
the 20 kilometers between Ramallah and Bil'in.

I went to the Friday Demonstration in Bil'in three times during my
stay in the West Bank.  Two of those three times we encountered a
flying checkpoint (temporary blockade) set up by soldiers on the road
leading in to Bil'in from Ramallah.  They said it was "a closed
military zone," and would not let anyone but residents or people with
PRESS passes in.  Both times my group was stopped at the checkpoint,
we would turn around and go back about 1/4 mile, then simply walk
around the checkpoint.  One of those times we were able to get a ride
with some locals once we had walked around the checkpoint.

Once we arrived in the village we found basically the same set of
events each week: Palestinian villagers from Bil'in, along with
Israelis and other internationals sympathetic to the Palestinian cause
met around the mosque around noon.  With a different theme each week,
the group would begin walking to the site of the fence construction.

   Themes on days I was there:
      Carrying large black "snakes" to represent the wall
      Large scissors and cord to represent people being cut off from their land
      Playground equipment to allow children to play in the demonstration area

Villagers would chant in Arabic as they walked, and end up in a
standoff with soldiers who would be waiting at the top of the hill
where the road suddenly ends at the new fence-border.

The demonstration would be peaceful, and then invariably some
Palestinian youth would throw rocks (using slingshots) at the soldiers
as the demonstrators walked back home.  The soldiers would respond
with tear gas and rubber bullets, the resulting melee sometimes
resulting in hospitalization of demonstrators or rock throwers.

One of my friends was hit by a stone and had to be hospitalized for
over a week as his spleen had been ruptured.  I personally was hit by
a stone on my upper shoulder, thankfully where it did no damage.

One of the days was a bit different.  Demonstrators arrived earlier
than normal, and were able to lock themselves to the fence before
soldiers could drive up and begin pulling them off.  The locks were
not very effective, but served to make a point and got some good media
attention.

Other than that, it was the same game, and the fence kept being built.

<p>which isn't *all* that much for a day, but it's definitely faster
than I had been going before.</p>

<p>Also did the dishes and chowed some chow.  At one point I went
downstairs to the conveni with an exact idea of what I wanted to eat,
and they didn't have either item.  I wanted peanut chocolate and milk
pudding.  None of either.  Stunned.  But saved some money.</p>

<p>Right about now I'm going to go meet Satoko in ∆Ûª“∂Ã¿Ó°£</p>

<p class="date">11:06pm</p>

<p>It took 7 minutes to ride from Jesse's to Futakotamagawa
station.</p>

<p>Met Satoko and ate a bit at Kentucky Fried Chicken; we didn't talk
a whole lot, but chatted some about random stuff and about how cold it
is!  She invited me to a gig her band is playing near Musashi
Mizunokuchi this Sunday.  Showtimes are 1pm and 3pm.  I'll probably
choose ultimate instead cause I haven't been out there a single time
since Palestine.</p>

<p>Satoko walked me to TJ Bike, and then we walked her to the station.</p>
