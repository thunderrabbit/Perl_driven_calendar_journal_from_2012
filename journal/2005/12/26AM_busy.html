<p>We three (Carl, Dan and I) woke up at 7:00 and all three zipped
through the shower in succession, then charged upstairs for the 7:30
registration.  Went outside the ship to get our bags so they could be
scanned (a complete riot, considering all the luggage we brought on
already) and helped move Carl's big bag (he had surgery recently and
can't do heavy lifting), and turned in his passport because I thought
he had gone ahead, causing him great consternation because he had
actually gone back to look for his passport.  Whoo!  Great shenanigans
as we got that sorted out!</p>

<p>Now going upstairs and helping the passengers get their stuff
on...</p>

<p>Five hundred 「おはよございます」 and 450 passengers so far, and
I've been sent down to get suited up for the champagne pouring,
serving, toasting, departing extravaganza!</p>
