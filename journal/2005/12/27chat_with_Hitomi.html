<p>Hitomi is the last person I will likely talk to with this cell
phone.  I called her last thing as we were leaving Kobe, and I
(probably) won't have any more service; this phone will certainly be
cut off by the time I get back.</p>

<p>She laughed at my jokes, so I was glad to hear that; she didn't
seem so ¸µµ¤ the last time we spoke.  I'm sure I'll see her when we
get back to T-town.</p>
