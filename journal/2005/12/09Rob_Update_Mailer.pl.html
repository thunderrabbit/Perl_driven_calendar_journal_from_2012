<p>Today I have declared my rob_update_mailer done enough to transfer
all 191 names to the new database.  I even have a mechanism for making
opt-outs from the old list remove them from the new list.  It's a
manual one, but it should work; I don't expect many optouts from the
old list; they usually hit pretty quickly after I send out emails.</p>

<p>The new db has a way to let me specify (to a rough degree of
precision) how long until they should get the question, "are you sure
you want to keep receiving these messages?"  It amounts to an
equivalent of Angelique's mass-email cleansing line:</p>

<pre>If you no longer want to receive these messages, simply Do Nothing.</pre>

<p>or something like that.  My db keeps track of when they were added
(everyone was added today, but after this it will remember new people)
and until when they should not receive the This Is Your Last Message
warning.  It will also keep track of when they dropped off the list,
but doesn't remember if they dropped themselves or they fell off the
end of their 'subscription'</p>

<p>It allows opt-outs to be in English or Japanese, and could be
easily extended to other languages.  It specifically does *not* do
the list purge message in any language but English, because maybe the
person isn't enjoying the list because they can't read English well
enough.</p>

<p>That certainly happens for me and Japanese emails.  Sheesh.</p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with the code, and invite people to use it if
they want.</p>

<p>It's not the crystal clear perfection of an alpha release, but here
is the <a
