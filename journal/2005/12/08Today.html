<p>Gotten a great start on things today.  The living room is a rather
large neatly stacked mess.  I've designated several things to be given
away, including a NYPD T-shirt (given to me by Hitomi) because I think
of Airplane Day when I see NYPD T-shirts (and in my informal poll,
100% of the respondent said "9/11" when I asked him what he thought of
NYPD doing when he saw the shirt) and I don't care to encourage the
belief that Airplane Day was such a huger tragedy on the scale of
things.</p>

<p>Plus, it's gotten enough coverage already.</p>

<p>And I have plenty of other T-shirts.</p>
