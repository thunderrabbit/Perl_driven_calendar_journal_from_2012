<p class="dream">In Palestine again being charged 4.5 NIS instead of
3.5 NIS, but I was making like I didn't have enough to see if he would
lower the price, and as he was making change, I was like, "and it's
supposed to be 3.5 shekels" and he goes, "too many exchanges" and just
closed his hand around the money he had and walked up to his room.</p>

<p class="dream">I stood for a bit then went up as well and found him
and was all, "there were not 'too many exchanges' I know I shoulda
told you right away that it was 3.5, but I had to remember how much
it was last time I was here, oh about a WEEK ago, and it's 3.5."</p>

<p class="dream">He consented and gave the money back.</p>


<p class="dream">I had given a guy my cell phone and he gave me
Niveen's cell phone back and there was some confusion in my mind about
who had which cell phone and he was all, "you told me you would give
Niveen's back to her," and I was like, "oh yeah, I had forgotten" and
then Niveen and I had switched cell phones so I called my name on her
cell phone to reach her on my cell phone and she answered and I was
like, "where are you; I need to give you back your cell phone.." and I
ended up walking to find her but didn't really know where I was except
"near Texas" and had to cross a river that I thought was rather large,
but turned out to be really small according to the map and someone
said I was near "Oleander" and I found it spelled like "Ough
Leighandear" on the map and discovered the map was super detailed, and
I was already in Texas.  I was using a map with a scale of about 1
inch = 1 meter.</p>
