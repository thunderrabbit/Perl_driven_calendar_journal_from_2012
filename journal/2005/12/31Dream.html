<p class="dream">Situated in a parking garage on the 5th level, we
could see the elevator had no protective walls around it.  Anyone
could fall into its shaft, get injured or killed if it started to move
when they were getting on the elevator, or be injured or killed if
they tried to cross its path while it wasn't there.  The tube was
really long, but there was still a chance the elevator car would fly
by just at that time, because it enjoyed killing.</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't have to get on the elevator, so I just went
around it to the parking garage.  I looked back and saw it accelerate
away faster than the space ship ever could.</p>

<p class="dream">I could feel something about to fall down the shaft,
and I guessed it could/would be an arm, so I looked away.  Turns out
it was a piece of newspaper.</p>

<p class="dream">He shuddered at the thought of having to get onto the
elevator again.  "that machine is evil; it will kill someone again
soon."</p>

<p class="dream">"Sir, I must report that if you mount a light speed
attack quickly, you can minimize the risk involved in having such an
elevator onboard."</p>

<p class="dream">"I've been scanning your system for over an hour, and
I can't even find the elevator <em>exists</em>."</p>

<p class="dream">"Better safe than sorry, sir."</p>

I could feel something about to fall down the shaft, and I guessed it
could/wold be an arm, so I looked away.  Turns out it was a piece of

<p class="dream">All three toilets were blocked with shit completely
covering the surface of the water in large turds.  We weren't sure
how to get them cleared out, but running water in the sink seemed to
help one of them.</p>
