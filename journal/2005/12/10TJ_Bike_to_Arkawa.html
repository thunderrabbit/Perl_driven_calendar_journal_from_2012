<p>I'm joining Don's Half Fast Flash Mob, a group of cyclists who
ride a couple times weekly around Tokyo.  Things just lined up so I
have the time and they have the ride planned!</p>

<pre>
Only one ride planned for this weekend, for Saturday, out to the Arakawa. 55km. If the weather permits, we may extend to the golf
course garbage island, whence to Odaiba and possibly the ferry back. Up to 70km perhaps. But we'll play it by ear;

Grand Hyatt in Roppongi Hills
12 Noon; back by 5 or 6.
Make sure your head and tail lamps are working, as we'll undoubtedly return after dark.
</pre>

<p>I can get to the Grand Hyatt in under an hour, I believe.  Need to
get a new rear light; mine got lost during my Atami adventure!</p>

<p class="date">5:37pm JST Saturday 10 December 2005</p>

<p>Just got back.  72km ridden today.</p>

<p>I arrived at the Grand Hyatt in a slightly convoluted way, but
still got there ahead of schedule.  Dan was already there, with his
super racing bike, and then Don and Noriko arrived with their super
racing bikes and then John with his super cool spokes and Patrick and
Louis and Ray and one more name I've forgotten, all with their fly
rides. Many of them suggested ways I could lighten TJ Bike, and put on
some thinner wheels for street riding, but I'm pretty happy having to
work more to ride.  I want the muscles more than the speed up
hills.</p>

<p>Everyone agreed TJ Bike is a dandy fine bike, and compared him to
Alistair's bike, whose name I've forgotten.</p>

<p>We got started not long after noon, after Patrick took a picture
of John up on the rocks with his bike where we specifically are not
allowed to climb, and we joked about the police siren in the
city-noise background coming for him.</p>

<p>Soon after starting, I felt quite lost after we broke away from 246
on some streets I had never previously seen.  However, we ended up
making a pretty big arc around the Imperial Palace and then through
some tiny streets and then a big highway and then Arkawa River.</p>

<p>We stopped there for a bit and snacked, chatting about PB,
Palestine and legality of taking photos of people.  Patrick took a lot
of photos during our ride, often speeding up ahead, stopping, and
taking pictures of us as we rode by.</p>

<p>It was there that Ray asked why I was wearing a backpack if I had
all these panniers for bags.  I explained that I didn't have enough
stuff for two bags, and I didn't want to be off balance.  My answer
was half interrupted by someone who suggested, "just say 'fuckoff,
Ray!'"  Ray soon manifested some bunjee cords, supplied by Patrick and
_____, and we secured my backpack to the back bag thing on TJ
Bike.  Sweet!</p>

<p>From that point, we had a several kilometer stretch of self-paced
riding on the generally flat smooth surface along the river.  I rode
alone for a while, trying to get a good clip going, and using my
handlebar extension for the first time.  I often use them as handles,
but never for resting my arms.</p>

<p>We went to within viewing distance of the mouth of the Arkawa
River, then went over a huge beautiful bridge and then closer to the
mouth of the river where there's a pretty cool park area with families
and kites and other bicycles.</p>

<p>We stopped there for a snackaroo around 3pm, enjoying the weather
and slight poking banter.  I picked up a couple of their bikes; wow -
they are definitely light compared to TJ Bike.  But they don't have
cool names.  At least I don't think so.  Everyone was fed, watered and
emptied as necessary and we headed out further along the sidewalk and
basically made a loop around the park.  Stopped again at a restroom
and then began the journey back.</p>

<p>We went over Arkawa River on a different (taller) bridge, and
amazingly on the way down its steep slope, I barely got any speed at
all due to the impressive headwind.  We stopped after a bit at a
bicycle shop where most of them browsed frames and components, and I
bought a new Cat's Eye back light for TJ Bike.  It's way bigger,
brighter, and flashier than my previous one, and was basically within
my budget (3250 yen or so).  I thanked everyone for waiting after
putting the light on, and we continued heading back.  I was basically
completely lost until we got back to Roppongi, but the way back wasn't
*nearly* as long as the journey out to the park.</p>

<p>I chatted with Patrick the photographer during the ride, and he
gave me permission to post his pictures on my site; I'll do that as
soon as I get them.</p>
