<p>I've recognized a base reason I've had such trouble getting
pictures from this computer to my website: If I use the auto-thumbnail
creation thing, the filenames are 0.jpg, 1.jpg, 2.jpg etc etc etc when
I want them to have descriptive names.</p>

<p>Also, when I use the auto-thumbnailer, I end up changing the .html
files to .shtml files, and adding code to let them work with my
top-of-page navigation.</p>

<p>But when I give them descriptive names, I don't have a way to
automagically create a clickable thumbnail grid type thing.</p>

<p>Hitomi sent me some cash via paypal so I can buy her an underwater
camera case.  But my paypal account isn't set up to accept credit card
payments, and I don't want to because that would cost extra money, I
think even for bank payments, which just sucks big butts.  Hitomi was
having trouble getting a bank account set up on her paypal account, so
we were trying to get it figured out, but I couldn't log in to see
what she was seeing cause it would log her out and vice versa, and
it's a pain in the ass to type and talk on a cellphone, and all this
whiney blah blah bullshit, but.. in the end I'm just bummed that I'm
being so tightass with money.  fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p>Why can't I just accept the gift and be done with it?</p>
