<p>Rode TJ Bike to Kellie's today in 45 minutes.  Thought I might have
gone too far at one point, but hadn't.  Though the weather thing said
10 degrees C and 0% precipitation, I felt a few <em>flakes of
snow</em> on the way there!</p>

<p>A couple of zoomie downhill runs, but nothing like the long ones
near Odawara.</p>

<p>Kellie has made the most *amazing* set of cards for teaching
animals and animal parts.  I was living here at the time she started
working on them, so it's really cool to see them finished, and they
look so great!</p>

<p>We are watching Discovery Channel now, and I just scoped her port
orientation for Tahiti.  Incredible!!  She's got such a fabulous head
start on the voyage; great great great!</p>

<p>Fuck.  It's sprinkling.  And freezing cold.  Argh.  At least I
brought my rain gear thing.</p>

<p>Made it back to Jesse's in 47 minutes, including bringing TJ Bike
to the back balcony.</p>

<p>The rain wasn't so bad after all.</p>
