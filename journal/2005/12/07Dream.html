<p class="dream">On the school bus near Kathy Lane, sitting on the
right hand side of the bus about four seats from the front, and it was
my turn to get off next, so I moved up to the front and stood there,
but there was one more stop and I had to move for the kid in the front
seat to get by.  The bus driver got off at this stop to get my back
pack from the back of the bus, but it was too heavy for her to lift
all the way up to me.</p>

<p class="dream">Then it was my turn to get off at Kathy Lane and I
kept asking "what time tomorrow will you be here to pick us up?" and
the bus driver didn't answer, but was like, "actually, your stop is up
here," (at the corner) and I was all, "what?  well, what time will you
pick us up there?" and she still wouldn't answer, and in fact was not
stopping to let me off and was saying I would have to wait to get off
last cause she went by the stop and I was like, "just stop; it's going
to take me at least an hour to walk back" and she was like, "no it's
not; you'll be okay."</p>

<p class="dream">And just then a large safari cat began to run from
left to right across the street, and I was afraid we would hit it.  I
was like, "look out!  It's a leopard, no a cheetah, no a panther!" and
she goes, "it's a mountain lion" (which in my dream was not the same
as a panther)...  this animal was the shape of a cougar, but had the
markings of a cheetah.  It was in full run, but at the last moment,
did a full stop, and I could see its body crunch up like an accordion
as it tiried to stop..  The bus narrowly missed it, but definitely
missed it.  I got off to see the animal, and he panther was there and
I was crouching down to take his picture, keeping him well in my
camera frame as he ran underneath a fallen tree into another clearing.
I kept him in my view finder and had the shutter button pressed, but
the camera wouldn't take a photo for some reason.  Any of the photos
would have been great: they were of good lighting and full color with
dark brown trunk of the fallen tree and green ferns occassionally
obsuring parts of the tawny panther.</p>

<p class="dream">The panther turned into a cub as I was taking photos
and I pet him a little bit.  He was feisty, but only in a playful way,
and then there was another panther cub, who was a bit more growly, but
still got close enough that I could touch him some..  then there were
two more from the other directions, and I kept fearing the mom panther
would come up and just slice me to ribbons, but she never did.</p>

<p class="dream">But then this guy came up from the police academy and
showed off his new holster belt.  "guess who got a new belt??" he
asked me and showed off the drink tumbler, still in box, and attached
to the holster on his left side..  I gave him figh five and admired it
a bit and then woke up.</p>
