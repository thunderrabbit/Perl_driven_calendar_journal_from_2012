<p>During my shower I remembered a dream</p>

<p class="dream">Wende and I were hanging out and decided to get back
together and actually have a baby.  I was psyching myself up for it
mentally, then realized that was really impossible, and I should just
go with the flow.  I started to tell her something current instead of
worrying about the future, and showed her how my new lego robot
walked.  It had six legs and I was showing her how it alternately
moved two legs on one side and one leg on the other at a time and
moved forward.</p>

<p>Due to dream chaos (*), I couldn't show her because the legs kept
moving back to their original starting points, whether I tried to
draw them or use my hand to represent them.</p>

<p>(* dream chaos is a term I just made up to describe things that
change 'magically' in dreams, but could not change in reality (at
least very unlikely))</p>
