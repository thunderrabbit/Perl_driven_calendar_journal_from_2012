<p>I zonked out for about the first 30 minutes of the orientation,
telling about how to find our rooms and how to use the phones and
where to get seasick meds and stuff that I basically already
know..</p>

<p>Stayed awake after that by combing Kellie's hair with my fingers
(putting her to sleep; oops!) and then woke her up when they started
talking about kisen limit (not "kissing" but "kisen" which apparently
means time by which we must board the ship in ports) and made dimpled
designs on my hands and fingers by tightly wrapping them with a long
ball-chain nametag holder that someone had discarded.</p>

<p>There are a couple of repeating passengers on this voyage: Kenji
(for whom this will be his sixth voyage) and Rie is on her second
voyage, I believe.</p>
