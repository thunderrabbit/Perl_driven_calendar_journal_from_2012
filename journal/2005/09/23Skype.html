<p>A couple weeks ago, Jesse told me about a thing called <a
href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>.  He said it was super cheap and
super easy to make phone calls anywhere in the world.  He said he's
been talking for hours and barely paid anything at all.</p>

<p>I figured it couldn't hurt, and I had heard of Skype before, so I
downloaded it and installed, which took about 3 minutes total (I
didn't actually time it, but the installation, username selection, and
configuration was less than painless.  Completely easy, including
getting thunderrabbit as my username).</p>

<p>I called Jessie on his Skype account two feet away from me and we
laughed about it, but I actually had to be impressed because iChat
could not do the same thing: allow us to talk while we were actually
connected to the same hub.</p>

<p>Recently, I had need to call home urgently, but had no credit on my
phone card.  I remembered that Skype allowed calls to landline phones,
but I was on line far too slow to support VoIP.  But I figured it
couldn't hurt to buy some credit for next time, so I bought a 10 Euro
chunk of credit which is good for 180 days, I believe.</p>

<blockquote><p>((While I didn't like the idea of having a limit on the
amount of time I could use the credit, I assume I will have forgotten
about my concern in 6 months when it comes time to pay up again,
assuming I haven't used all my credit.  If I use all the credit, then
it's no sweat, and in some backwards logic kinda way, if I *don't* use
all the credit, then it will have been like paying 10 Euros for a 6
month pass to all the calls I want to make.))</p></blockquote>

<p>Later, when I was on a fast connection, I used it to make that
not-quite-so-urgent-anymore call.  The conversation was great and we
talked for 20 minutes on her cellphone in the US.  The whole
conversation cost 0.48 Euros, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Today, for fun, I called Fred for 25 minutes using Skype on my slow
connection, and its performance impressed me!  On this connection,
images download around 5kb/s, but Fred came through loudly and clearly
and I could ha rdly tell we were only paying fractions of pennies per
minute.</p>

<p>If we both talked at the same time, there was a bit of silence on
one end or the other, but I hardly noticed, and it certainly didn't
detract from the conversation.</p>

<p>Skype-to-Skype calls are (and always will be) free.  In this case,
me calling from my computer to my brother's landline in Texas, the
whole conversation cost around 0.50 Euros.</p>

<p>I hounded Fred until he said he would get Skype as well, so we can
chatter free of charge for hours.</p>

<p>There is apparently a party-line option where I can have up to 50
people on the same call.  I don't think I know 50 people who would be
interested, but this could certainly be interesting for some
updates-from-the-field type of situation where a reporter is in, say,
Palestine, and reporting back to a bunch of people at once.  Or for
network marketing rep who has a weekly pep rally with their
downline.</p>

<p>Get Skype.</p>
