<p>Hitomi and I are at ヨドバシカメラ using the foot massage machines.
They're okay, but the seat is a bit too short for me.</p>

<p>Before that, I was in a massaging recliner
for <em><b>forty-five</b></em> minutes, during which time I received
three different massage treatments, though I didn't particularly
notice any differences.  They all rolled balls up my back and
squooshed my footses and calves. After the first course, Hitomi
noticed my arms were supposed to be <em>inside</em> the arm rests,
where they got good squeezin's with air-filled bladders.</p>

<p>After the third round, during portions of which I was quite asleep,
Hitomi suggested we move.  I agreed (the sign in front of the chairs
requested that we only stay 15 minutes), and was surprised to find
fully 2/3rds of the chairs were full!  When we started, I was the only
person using any of the 14 chairs.</p>

<p>I wonder if they were inspired to try the chairs after seeing me
blissfully zonked out in one.  Hopefully one of those salarymen
enjoyed the experience to buy a chair for about 430,000 yen
($4300). That will pay for my 45 minutes.</p>
