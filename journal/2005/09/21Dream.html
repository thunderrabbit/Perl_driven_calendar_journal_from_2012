<p class=dream>I was on Pb's next voyage, and going to some of
the same places which now began to feel like home.  We were also
going to some new places: Nicaragua and elsewhere.</p>

<p class=dream>I was in the pool up on the 8th floor, but it was in a
room like in a hotel.  After I came down for dinner, a whole line of
people were going to the pool; it was like the line of Sneeches going
to get stars, but they were going to get in the pool, and then
leaving just as quickly.</p>

<p class=dream>I didn't understand why I wasn't aware of the
schedule, and hoped I wasn't missing anything.</p>
