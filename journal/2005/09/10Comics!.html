<p>Ryan North is a really cool guy.  He's been writing the incredible
<a href="http://qwantz.com">Dinosaur Comics</a> for years.  Maybe
centuries.</p>

<p>Ryan North is a humble man.  He knows he can't draw.  So the comic
image is always the same.</p>

<p>How does one take this to the next level of comical creativity??</p>

<p>Maybe we could use the *INTERNET* in this endeavor!</p>

<p>The result is <a href="http://whisperedapologies.com">Whispered
Apologies</a>, a comic where we create the comics without words and
Ryan and his gang add the words.</p>

<p>So I took some pics, cropped them and used </p>

<pre>
montage -geometry 640x480+10+10 -bordercolor white -label "" cartoon*.* rob_nugen1.jpg
</pre>

<p>to string them together.</p>

<p>Magic!</p>

<a href="/images/i_made/cartoon1/cartoon2-4.jpg"><img src="/images/i_made/cartoon1/thumbs/cartoon2-4.jpg" /></a>
</p>

<p>Then I wrote an email to Ryan that went something like this!!</p>

<font size=-1>Hey Ryan!<br>
<br>
Like some people, I also cannot draw.<br>
<br>
But I can take photos!<br>
<br>
And I can crop them!<br>

<br>
And stitch them together!<br>
<br>
But I cannot easily edit them.<br>
<br>
So there are no talk bubbles in my comic.<br>
<br>
But I hope you like it!<br>
<br>
I didn't spend too much time overthinking what conversation could be used.<br>
<br>
But I did spend too much time thinking about what image I should use for my portrait.<br>

<br>
I decided on this photo of Francois, a stuffed rabbit with whom I went scuba diving in Acapulco!<br>
