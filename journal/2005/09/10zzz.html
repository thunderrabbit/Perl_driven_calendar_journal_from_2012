<p>Today I worked pretty well and got a week worth of entries
uploaded.  Save for the pictures, but I will do that later.  If I can
finish a week per day, I can finish the rest of the trip in 10 days,
basically.  That will leave me enough time to put pictures on.  So,
this project is doable.</p>

<p>I researched and found I don't need a visa to enter Israel.  I
emailed a guy there to see what kinda clothes I should bring, and I
was going to ask him if I should bring TJ Bike in my next message,
but he hasn't replied to the first.</p>

<p>Supposed to meet Jesse tomorrow at 4:30 in Daikanyama for a pot
luck at his church.  Free food sounds fantastic.  I might even wear
contacts so I will feel more sociable.</p>
