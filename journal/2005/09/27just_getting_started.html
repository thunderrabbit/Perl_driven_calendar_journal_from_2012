<p>Wow.  I just walked home and am full of love and energy.  Something
about Star Wars, and the idea of choosing my fate and choosing the
non-dark side of the force (what color is it?)... Everything is
great.</p>

<p>Tonight I plan to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>contact Niveen</p></li>

<li><p>finish transcribing my tapes from P.B.</p></li>

<li><p>upload a shload of pictures (or get it started)</p></li>

<li><p>begin the process of finding out what I need in Palestine</p></li>

<li><p>mentally begin releasing the rest of my stuff</p></li>

<li><p>contact my credit card company to tell them fo sheezy I will
be in Palestine and not to kill my card for charges over there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, so far I have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>emailed Niveen and asked her questions</p></li>

<li><p><em><b>finished</b></em> transcribing my tapes from P.B.!!!!</p></li>

<li><p>contacted my credit card company to tell them fo sheezy I will
be in Palestine and not to kill my card for charges over there.</p>

<p>At the end of the call she was like, "okay, thank you for your call
and good luck [in Palestine]."</p></li>

<li><p>begun to upload a shload of pictures (or get it started)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that's enough for me for now, I think.</p>
