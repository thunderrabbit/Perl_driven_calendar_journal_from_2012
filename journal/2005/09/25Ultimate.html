<p>Big fun at ultimate today!  I arrived before anyone else, and lay
down on a bench, wondering if they would ever show up.  At one point I
looked up to see some non-Japanese people walking sorta toward the
field and assumed they must be ultimate players.  They walked past
where I was relaxing and I got up to see if in fact they were here for
ultimate and I suddenly saw they were headed to where all the ultimate
peeps had already started playing!</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<p>We enjoyed great play despite great wind from the typhoon.  I was
impressed by the incredible catching skills demonstrated by Julie, who
has been in Japan for a month or two, and plans to be here untl
December.  She played disc in university in Oregon, and is here now
studying Japanese.  Adam and Jason had some equally money catches as
well, but I must be a bit sexist; I wasn't as impressed.  A few people
came late: Koki, Sam, Adrien, Joanne.  They played supadupaly.</p>
