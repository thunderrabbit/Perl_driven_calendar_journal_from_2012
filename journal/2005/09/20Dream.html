<p class=dream>Back in time to the Roman Empire, I was in danger of
being caught as a spy trying to get into school, but I was actually
just fromthe future, so I had to blend in.  Brandt tried to just walk
in the door, but they knew that meant he was afraid to go up through
the entire spiral to get into the building and they caught him.  I
walked along the spiral all the way up, and saw a guy lose his shoe
but didn't know if I should grab it for him.  I didn't and soon enough
he was coming the other way and asked if I had taken it (cause he was
surprised at how far back he had come without finding it), but I was
like, "one more," cause he was almost there.</p>

<p class=dream>I reached the top and found a locker but wasn't sure
how to lock it or how to do something, but I just got ready slowly and
took mental notes from people around me.  I knew I was probably okay
when people started making jokes with me.</p>

<p class=dream>Some guy has a history book from the future and was
telling his friend how to sneak out of this situation safely.</p>
