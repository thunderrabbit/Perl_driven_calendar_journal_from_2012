<p>Went to Louise's house near Jiyugaoka around noon today and we
watched two movies: <em>Shawshank Redeption</em>, and <em>Galaxy
Quest</em>.  She and I had watched the first part of Shawshank several
months ago, at which time her roommate's DVD player chose to simply
stop, not even letting us eject the disc.</p>

<p>We watched it all the way through this time, though I didn't watch
the first fighting/rape scenes.  Good movie.  I'm glad she encouraged
me to see it.</p>

<p>For the second movie, I narrowed her selection down to three
possibilities: _Monster's Inc_, _Galaxy Quest_, or _Bourne Identity_.
She sorta turned down Monster's Inc, so I flipped a coin to choose
between the last two.</p>

<p>Oh! When I sat down to watch, I noticed a note written to me.  I
was all excited to read it,

<pre>
rob    i wanna squeal when i see you
you crazy cool boy with the biggest
and best heart.
</pre>

<p>I was like, <em>whoohoo!</em> and as I kept reading, it got more
and more familiar to me..  This is the note written to me by
Nicole!!</p>

<p>"How did you get Nicole's note to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I found it on the floor at the bar, and I figured I knew only
be one Rob who it could be..."</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>We didn't talk a whole lot during my visit; the movies kept my
attention fixed.  Louise worked on a bead necklace for a friend of
hers while we watched.  We talked a bit and it seems she plans to stay
in Tokyo for the foreseeable future, continuing to teach and work in
the theater (assistant directing and acting).</p>

<p>She wondered about my sanity and safety a bit for my plan to go to
Palestine.  I plan to be fine.</p>
