<p>I was like, "this is impossibly bad," which was supposed to mean
something like, "this is so bad that it couldn't be true."</p>

<p>But it continues to appear true.  I don't seem to have my power
supply.  I am sure I left it in P.B. office.  I guess I will see
Nat one more time before I go...</p>
