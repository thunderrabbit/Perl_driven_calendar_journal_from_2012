<p>Got a picture of some funniness in Kawasaki Station.  The weather
is nice so the glass paneled dome roof things are open.  The sun has a
direct view of the ticket machines, and its bright glare disallow
people from seeing what's on the screens without shade.  So, station
staff hold rather large cardboard shades to block the light.  Oh my
gosh what a job that would be.</p>

<p>We joked about how quickly I often try to go through the gates,
disallowing the ticket thing to read my card.  Should be able to run
through screaming...  IR tags could do it; not these silly close-up
magnetic ones.</p>
