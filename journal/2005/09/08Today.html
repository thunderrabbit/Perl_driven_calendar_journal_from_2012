<p>Today I have been working pretty well on transcribing / adapting
journal entries from P.B..  I've finished tapes 4 and 5, and
1/2 of tape 6.  It's challenging for me to put together the stories
and entries the way I'd like: everything all neatly lined up in date
order, etc.. plus balancing between verbatim transcription and just
writing as the tapes remind me.</p>

<p>The beginning of Side B Tape 6 is Emi translating that the
Jordanian refugee camp tour will not be a cake walk, and may not
occur.  I'm definitely not going to transcribe it, but I will listen
to it as I walk to the grocery store to get some foodage.</p>
