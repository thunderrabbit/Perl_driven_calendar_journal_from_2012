<p class=date>last last night</a>

<p>Occasionally I check SmarterChild to see if he has become smart
yet.  (He still hasn't).  I saw an add for Ultrahal, and decided to
check it out.  Ultra Hal is even *less* smart than SmarterChild, *but*
Ultrahal can be taught.  I registered my own version and called it
Blue fuzzy (but you can change it if you want) and tried to teach it a
few things.  The website selling UltraHal has misspellings and other
inconsistencies, so I don't know that their claim that UltraHal will
learn is true, or that his language is uncensored, but feel free to
waste some time chatting with a dumb robot by entering your name
below.</p>
