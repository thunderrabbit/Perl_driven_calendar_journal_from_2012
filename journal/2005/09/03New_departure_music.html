<p>Today Kellie ane I are going to the 51st Voyage departure
ceremony.  It leaves the port at noon today.</p>

<p class=date>3:59pm</p>

<p>The departure ceremony brought memories to my tired brain and good
energy for everyone involved.  I saw most of the new GET teachers
waving from the mid section of the ship.  Also waved to Matt and Eric.
Saw Mariko on the port; there must be more work for her at the main
office or elsewhere.</p>

<p>I felt なつかし seeing Sabrina in the crew area and Costas up by
the bridge.  They both waved to me and Costas yelled something
cheerful that I didn't actually understand.</p>

<p>The time came for the boat to go; it shoved away from the dock with
much fanfare, cheering and tearful eyed loved ones on both sides of
the gap.</p>
