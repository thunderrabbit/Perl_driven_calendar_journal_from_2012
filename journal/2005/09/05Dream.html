<p class=dream>"Last Christmas you pushed me onto the hearth; the very
next day I bit you this way."</p>

<p class=dream>I sang this song to Tammy after getting to see her for
Christmas and she pushed me down onto a pillow.  I was standing behind
either Wende or Katt or someone who was from a different country
and giving large bites to her shoulders.  We had made a joke like
"this is your diplomatic service for your country."</p>

<p class=dream>I was eating little Vienna sausages and found some dog
medicine that was supposed to be injected into the sausages and fed to
the dog.  I wanted to try it first so I chomped down and could feel it
burst with oily Vitamin E type interior.  I then spat it out so the
dog could have his medicine, but it was stuck and I realized I was
trying to spit out my mouthguard and woke up.</p>
