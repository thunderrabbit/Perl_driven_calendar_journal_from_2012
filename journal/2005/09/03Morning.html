<p class=date>8:42am JST Saturday 03 September 2005</p>

<p>The basic plan for today includes: waving happy goodbyes among an
excited, tearful crowd at P.B.'s 51st Voyage departure ceremony;
stopping by Millenium House to scoop up a box I left there (most of
the contents of which I have forgotten, so I hope I can release most
of it...) and seeing some of my peeps there; and attending a Japanese
shrine carrying festival in Jiyugaoka.</p>

<p>But first I'd like to get these few journal entries uploaded.</p>

<p class=date>9:01am</p>

<p>And by uploaded I mean uploaded to the right locations...</p>
