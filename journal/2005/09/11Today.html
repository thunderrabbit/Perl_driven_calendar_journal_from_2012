<p>"Today" I transcribed 4.5 days of P.B. journal entries (1
day I did a sorta half-assed job, I think the 26th or 27th of June)
though I had a goal of finishing 7 days.</p>

<p>I headed out to meet Jesse at 代官山駅 at 4:30 to attend a concert
and pot luck dinner at his church.  After the choir sang, the pastors
wife came on stage and said something like, "they might not be the
best choir, but they sure have a lot of spirit!"  !!!!!  what???  I
was really taken aback; that doesn't sound like particulary helpful
feedback!</p>

<p>Jesse and I were downstairs in the overflow room that was soon to
be a standing room only dining room.  A projector displayed live video
of what was happening onstage, but there was no audio until Jesse
strung a microphone cable from the AV booth upstairs.  Once it was
plugged in, I adjusted the volume on the mixing board downstairs.</p>

<p>Jesse didn't think there was enough food, so we walked to Subway
between 代官山 and 渋谷 stations.  He ordered four foot long
sandwiches, but they flat refused to put all four of them in one
container because they "wouldn't fit."  We received the container with
three sandwiches, then the one extra sandwich in its own bag.  We made
it fit.  It didn't even look 1/2 bad.</p>

<p>(I hypothesised they are not supposed to put four in one thing
because four of one thing is unlucky in Japan: the word for four in
Japanese is the same as the beginning sound of the word for death.
ooooh..  spooky.)</p>

<p>We headed back with our four sandwiches and Jesse got hit by a car
when he tried to cross the street.</p>

<p>Just kidding.</p>

<p>We headed back with our four sandwiches and waited til the end of
the concert when everyone started to pour out of the main hall to
chow.</p>

<p>Jesse and I happened to be right near the door when the pastor and
his wife came in.  We shook their hands and learned they had also
lived in Texas (15 years ago) before coming to Japan.  The pastor
goes, "when I came to Japan from Texas, the average IQ of both places
went up."</p>

<p><em>WHAT???????</em>  "what?"</p>

<p>He laughed it off and I remained stupified.  How could he possibly
say something so offensive?  Is there any way to take it other than a
racist comment on IQ?</p>

<p>Billy, who I know from Gaba also goes to that church, or at least
he was there tonight and knew a lot of people.  His sister Julie was
there, her student 真理 (まり), and Michael, Jesse's friend from Gaba.
We all went to TGI Friday's (and were joined by Julie's friend (and
super-tall 2-year-old baby Brian) whose name never attached itself in
my mind), where Billy paid for her dinner, my dinner and Julie's for
her birthday.  We got to share Julie's big birthday sundae and
everything.  (I ate most of it because everyone else stopped digging
in.)  Jesse paid for his own and 真理ちゃん's meals.</p>

<p>Michael didn't make it to dinner because he wanted to go play a 2
player networked video game.  Jesse and I went to see him after
dinner.  The game uses cards on a flat surface, and a screen to show
what's going on in the battle against the other player, who could be
anyone in Japan (or the rest of the high speed internet-connected
world).  The cards represent herds of soldiers with various skills,
and a computer chip in the card can tell exactly where the card is on
the board and its orientation.  Michael moved, wiggled, twisted the
cards around in competition with this other unknown player.  After a
few minutes he stated he was winning.  After a few more minutes (he
said, "that's losing music.  Oh well,") he lost.</p>

<p>I 95% had no idea what was going on, and 99% sure I will never
care to play this game.</p>

<p>Michael helped Jesse play, and he also lost.</p>

<p>Ah crap; I just got way sidetracked looking in the back doors of
peoples' websites on the server I use.  Didn't find anything
interesting.  Well, found some passwords, but the files hadn't been
touched since 2000.</p>

<p>After watching Jesse lose, I raced him downstairs (and he lost
again), and we beat Michael who used the elevator.  Michael ran toward
his apartment after we got off the train and I took off my shoes and
chased him and almost ate it but avoided being hit by a motorbike (by
outrunning it) and avoiding hitting a bicycle coming my way.</p>

<p>We played darts while drinking delicious cow piss, er, Calpis, and
I checked email then we played hackey sack and watched nearly two
episodes of Futurama (first two of season 4) that I hadn't seen
before.  So glad there are more to see!</p>

<p>Zipped to the train station to catch the last train back to
Kellie's house.  I might stay over at Jesse's soon.</p>
