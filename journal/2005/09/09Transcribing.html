<p>Today I have finished through June 16th, the night we left Jordan.
I feel like I'm making good progress, though there is a long way to
go.</p>

<p>Right now I'm going in search of some food.</p>

<p>Ate ロボやき with broccoli and cheese and little sliced sausages
and now I'm eating chocolate and soy milk.  Delicioso.</p>
