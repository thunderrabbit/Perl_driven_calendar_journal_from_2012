<p class=dream>I was wth Matt the Artist who offered to let me work
oon another exquisite corpse with him.  He had a base already, and I
could see exactly what I would do with it.  He then was like, but
firsty something something he wanted to show me, and I accidentally
stepped on some of his art he had layed out on the floor.  Emi was
like, "don't worry" and proceeded to lie down fully on the painting,
exposed her breasts and turned over to leave two boob prints on the
painting.  I tried to hide my shock and Matt and I left; I could tell
he was upset, but he didn't wantot say anything, so  was gong to tell
him about doing clearngs warrior style and I asked hm a short
question and he just spilled forth with all this unrelated stuff.  I
tried again, "how do you feel? e.g. sad, angry, happy" and he just
went off talking about all sorts of stuff until I woke up.</p>
