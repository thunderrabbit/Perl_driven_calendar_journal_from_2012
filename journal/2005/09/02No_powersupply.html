<p>A bit frustrated; I let myself be late to the point that I don't
have time to visit the Apple Store in Ginza and make it to meet
Tomoko on time.  Plus, I'm a bit irked that it will now cost *more*
to go back out from Kellie's on the bus and train.</p>

<p>I left Katt at Nikki's, but now that I realize I'm too late
to do the Apple thing, I shoulda just waited for her.  Furthermore,
Hitomi just called me and I was like "yarg; I will call you tomorrow;
leave me alone.."</p>

<p>Why am I letting all this get to me?</p>

<p>I'm feeling scared about never leaving Kellie's house and letting
all this shit get in my way.  I should just *not* me Tomoko, *not*
meet Katt, *not* meet Hitomi, and just buy the power supply and be
at Kellie's house and working on my transcription now.</p>

<p>And another frustrating thing is there is probably a store in
Shibuya that has a power supply, but I just don't know *where*..  Do
I?</p>
