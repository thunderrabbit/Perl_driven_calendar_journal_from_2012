<p>I don't actually know what time it is - only that it's late.  I got
a bit lost on the way from the station to Kellie's house; I hadn't
walked far enough, but thought I had walked too far.  Backtracked to
view a map at the conveni, and saw I had to unbacktrack to get back on
track.</p>

<p>This evening I spent with Katt talking about all sorts of
variants of the topic of our trip.  We had just chowed at TGI Fridays
with Tomoko and Sumidasan.  Katt was really great and funny and
ironically I was jealous of her as if she would take my friends, but
actually I was just in a depressed mood cause I was having to deal
with Hitomi as well.</p>
