Hey Everyone!

I must admit to being late with this final email from the amazing P.B. voyage
around the world.  I've been back in Japan since 30 August, and am somewhat settled at
my dear friend Kellie's house.  She's my friend from Gaba (my previous English
teaching job) who offered a space for me to keep TJ Bike.

The end of the trip was filled with activity: mostly cleaning, packing, and goodbye
parties, then a final mad rush to get all the departing passengers' luggage off the
boat in Yokohama.

During lunch on the second to last day, I handed Francois over to Christina, my
favorite Topaz Dining employee.  At the end of the meal, I asked for Francois back,
and she said, &#34;maybe later.&#34;

I inquired again at dinner that night, and she said simply, &#34;no,&#34; in her way that
means &#34;if you complain enough, yes.&#34;

The next day, the last day of the voyage, I went in for breakfast. &#34;Christina? 
Have you seen Francois?&#34;

&#34;Come back for lunch.  He will be here.&#34;

&#34;But I don't know if *I* will be here!&#34;  We had to be off the ship around 1pm; the
departure ceremony culminated at 2pm.  &#34;What time?&#34;

&#34;12:30.&#34;

Later that morning, while we GET Teachers were busy unloading scads of passenger
luggage from the ship, I saw Christina out of her uniform, headed out of the ship.

&#34;???&#34;  I didn't even formulate a query before she answered.

&#34;I gave him to David.&#34;

&#34;Who?&#34;  I tried to think of who she was talking about; I didn't know any Topaz
Dining employee named David.

&#34;The teacher.  David.&#34;

&#34;Oh!!  Dave!!&#34;  Dave lived across the hall from me for three months; I definitely
knew who she was talking about.

Christina left, and I haven't seen her since, but soon thereafter, Katt saw me
and was like, &#34;Dave gave me Francois,&#34; and gave me Francois.

I was like, &#34;thanks!&#34; when she handed him over.  I looked down and saw something
amazing.  Francois was clean!!!

Since we went scuba diving in Acapulco, Francois had a distinct tan, or more
accurately, a coating of dirt, which I had basically ignored. Christina is a rabbit
washing saint!

After watching the boat leave without us, I went to Shibuya, one of my favorite
places in Tokyo.  Every time I saw a Japanese person (which was a lot, considering
I am in Japan), I thought &#34;they must be from the boat,&#34; and tried to identify them.
After a full day of false alarms, I quit thinking I knew everyone I saw.

Except for one person: I happened to see my friend Olivia in the train station! 
How totally random to see her as we were each passing through.   We caught up
briefly on the past three months then continued on our respective ways.

Three goodbye parties and a week have passed.  I can safely say the trip is
complete.

A few people have asked me what's next.   I'm happy to report that I have stuck to
my plan (for once): and it's 90% certain that I'll be flying to Palestine (not the
one in Texas (sorry, Sara!), but in the middle east, in the middle of Israel).  I
have a flight booked for October 5th.  Just need to pay for the ticket and work out
arrival arrangements.

I'll be reporting to this same list my adventures in Palestine, so stay tuned or
click remove if you've had enough!

    With Love
      - Rob!
