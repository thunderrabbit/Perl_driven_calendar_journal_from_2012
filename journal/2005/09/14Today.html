<p>I have been back to transcribing.  I'm on tape 14 of 33 and have
found a big blank section.  I'm glad in a way; I'm sick of
transcribing so the faster these get done, the better.</p>

<p>Fuckaduck.  I just erased my entries from July 5th, using emacs, so
there is basically no chance of recovery.  I had already closed emacs
since they were written, so I couldn't even resave old buffers.</p>

<p>It was my day in Norway .. I had written about talking to Thomas
who worked in the internet cafe thing near the ship and described
Bergen as a city in an old fiord, and how I could see the curve
between the mountains that was made by the glacier.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.  I probably won't try to recover those files, unless
I'm feeling really genki about it later.</p>
