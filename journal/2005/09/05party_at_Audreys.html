<p>I got a call from ÃÒ»Ò today and since I had a pretty good start on
my journal, plus (with help from ¿ÎÈþ) I all but have my flight booked
to Palestine (and am feeling pretty good about going, if a bit
nervous), though I don't yet know doodle about visas nor much about
where I could stay, I decided I could afford the time to take a break,
so long as it required minimal funding.</p>

<p>We met in ¹Â¥Î¸ý station (ÉðÂ¢¹Â¥Î¸ý for her) and got bottomless
self serve drinks at Jonathon's (family style restaurant).</p>

<p>I called P.B. office to see if they had Eilat's email address
and if I could get work out there.  Talked to Audrey who invited me to
a party at her house tonight.  Cool!</p>

<p>We had big fun chowing and chatting..  Brandt, Allison, Natalie,
Greg, Nicole, Petra, Kanae, Emi, Matt, Audrey, Yuuka, and a couple
others I didn't previously know: Pirori, Caroline, Phil (and one
more).  Lots of cuddling because everyone is sad about everyone else
leaving; lots of discussion about how it's been coming back into
non-PB world..  Lots of vegetarian food and a bit of meat.</p>

<p>For a while, I talked to Natalie in the kitchen, talking about our
personal adventures.  I saw Petra look like she was leaving and when
she said she wasn't, I realized I should use her non-leaving status to
go talk to her instead of putting it off until she was actually
leaving.  Went into the other room and Petra napped with her head on
my leg while I listened to Allison talk about the latest in her
life.</p>

<p>Allison left, and Natalie sat next to me, and I totally wanted to
chomp on Natalie but I knew it would make things uncomfortable in the
long run, and my preference is to have a long friendship with her than
to have a short though intense sexship with her. For that reason I
made sure I made last train to go home tonight instead of stay
overnight in which case I would be hard pressed to keep my wits about
me (sorry to use a cliche), plus feel bad tomorrow for not getting an
early start on my journal after I specifically told ÃÒ»Ò it would be a
bit of a challenge to meet her tomorrow because I have so much shit to
do...</p>
