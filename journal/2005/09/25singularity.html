<pre>
The Singularity will represent the culmination of the merger of our
biological thinking and existence with our technology, resulting in a
world that is still human but that transcends our biological
roots. There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human
and machine or <em>between physical and virtual reality</em>. If you
wonder what will remain unequivocally human in such a world, it's
simply this quality: ours is the species that inherently seeks to
extend its physical and mental reach beyond current limitations.

<p>I added the emphasis above.  How can there be no distinction
between physical and virtual reality?</p>
