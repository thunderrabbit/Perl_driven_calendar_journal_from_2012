<p><b>YOU CAN'T BREAK OUR SPIRIT, YOU CAN'T STOP OUR DREAMS</b>
<br>by Palestinian and ISM volunteers</p>

<p>It was a chaotic day for villagers in Bil'in.
It began just before dawn with the rude
awakening of a military siege, and ended with
odors of tear gas, burning tires and the
arrest of a community leader of nonviolent
anti-occupation demonstrations.</p>

<p>Bil'in has become a flashpoint in the battle
between heavily armed Israeli soldiers and the
spreading movement among Palestinians to employ
nonviolent tactics against the occupation. Each
Friday at 1 p.m. villagers have employed dramatic
props, costumes and theatrics into their protests
of the theft of Palestinian land with the
construction of Israel's illegal annexation
barrier. The portion of the barrier being built
in Bil'in will cut off more than half the village's
agricultural land, setting it aside for likely
settlement expansion.</p>

<p>Last Friday, the military was humiliated by the
amount of news coverage that showed the brutality
soldiers inflict on villagers. Video footage,
photos and live coverage resulted in complaints
from Israeli Knesset members and an editorial in
Haaretz excoriating the military for the use of
excessive force. What the army learned from that
lesson: Continue attacking unarmed people, but
start earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Military vehicles sped into Bil'in at 5 a.m.
as soldiers announced through loudspeakers that
the area was "a closed military zone" and that a
curfew would be enforced. The army had by 6 a.m.
surrounded the home of Abdullah Abu Rahme, a
coordinator Bili'n's Popular Committee Against
the Wall. A section of his house is reserved for
the International Solidarity Movement's apartment.
Through bullhorns soldiers announced that all
Israelis and international activists must leave
the premises.</p>

<p>Abdullah responded by closing all the doors and
locking them. Then the army commander told Abdullah
he had 15 minutes to tell the internationals and
Israelis to leave. Hours later, the military
commander was saying, "OK, you have 15 more
minutes."</p>

<p>The demonstration wasn't set to start until
1 p.m., and at 7 a.m., it became obvious that
we had to come up with something delay the
inevitable use of violence by the Israeli
military while some of us prepared for the
day's action. The plan for this demonstration
was to take olive tree seedlings and attempt
to plant them along the path of the annexation
barrier.</p>

<p>As some people prepared the plants and made
signs and posters, a number of international
and Israeli activists went to the rooftops of
homes around the village and made percussion
instruments out on heaters and water tanks.
An old woman stood with a baby in one hand
banging the heater on her apartment roof with
an iron pipe as hard as she could.</p>

<p>In what was somewhat of a mood spoiler, the
military responded to the rhythm by lobbing
tear gas and sound bombs at Palestinians who
had started to defy the curfew order to protest
the treatment of visitors to the area. Within
a few minutes, a Palestinian man was shot in
the leg.</p>

<p>Soldiers also infringed on religious freedom in
the village, telling people at the mosque that
afternoon prayer would not be allowed.</p>

<p>Shortly before 10 am, we unfurled two huge banners
and a Palestinian flag and attached them to the top
of the apartment. The Israeli border police had
shown up with a huge prison wagon in tow, and we 20+
activists were still on the rooftops directly chants
and singing.</p>

<p>Around 10 a.m. the press began to arrive. As
journalists streamed into Abdullah's house and
up the stairs to the roof to take in the spectacle,
Israeli border police made their move to arrest a
Palestinian. Villagers had taken to the streets in
large numbers to protest the morning incursion.
Chanting and marching up various streets in the
neighborhood, they set up roadblocks of burning
tires to slow down the arrival of still more army
vehicles. Black plumes of smoke went up around the
village.</p>

<p>We tore down the steps to try to stop the arrest
of the Palestinian man. Within ten minutes the police
carted off five Israeli peace activists and three
internationals (all were released by late afternoon).
"They're trying to arrest everybody," said ISM
volunteer Greta Berlin. "Everybody's in a pile.
They've got everybody, they're throwing them all in
the paddy wagon now."</p>

<p>Mohammed Al Khateb, a coordinator with the Bil'in
Popular Committee Against the Wall, was beaten by
soldiers and has suffered some injuries.</p>

<p>"One of the soldiers who hadn't been here for a
while because of the Gaza disengagement found me,"
Al Khateb said. "He said `I haven't seen you in
quite a while' and 'some day I'm going to bash
your head in.'"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for the third time, Abdullah Abu Rahme
was arrested in Bil'in on Friday. During the
rounding up of activists, Abdullah was being
interviewed in front of his home by Egypt TV. In
the midst of the interview, soldiers grabbed Abdullah
and hauled him away. He was charged with breaking
curfew. He maintains he had permission to be in front
of his own house for the interview. A tear gas
canister would strike the Egypt TV van later. One of
their cameramen was injured and taken to a hospital
in Ramallah.</p>

<p>Abdullah was reportedly transported to Ofer Military
Prison, where he had served time previously for
participating in nonviolent protests of the wall.
Upon his release in July, Abdullah had signed
conditions not to join in rallies. At the time
of this arrest, he was not taking part in events
going on around him.</p>

<p>The detained activists were carted up to a hill
near the wall construction site. It's interesting
that soldiers work so hard to stop demonstrators
from reaching the area of land confiscation each
week, but will give them rides directly to the
site upon arrest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid the protests and chaos, those
planning to go ahead with afternoon prayers
made their way to the mosque.</p>

<p>Shortly before 1 p.m., those of us who hadn't been
detained decided to join the Palestinians and hold
the demonstration. We met in the front of the mosque,
facing soldiers, police, sound bombs, tear gas, and
rubber bullets. Many were injured, with scrapes, cuts,
bruises, and tear gas inhalation and were treated by
the Palestinian Red Crescent.</p>

<p>It was with tremendous relief that we looked up to see
50 Israeli activists coming through the olive trees
just after 1 p.m. They had walked for miles to get
there, and they immediately stood in front of the
soldiers began yelling at them.</p>

<p>By 3 p.m., over 150 Israelis had made it through
the checkpoints, and had joined the demonstration
in front of the mosque. Reportedly, another 200
were detained trying to get into Bil'in. 20 members
of the Holy Land Trust had also come from Beit Sahour.</p>

<p>They were joined by several members of the Palestinian
Authority parliament and Israeli Knesset who had been
invited by the Bil'in Popular Committee Against the Wall.
Many of them (A complete list of who was there will
be offered in a forthcoming post) spent a great deal of
time yelling at the soldiers, demanding to know why
they were preventing nonviolent resistance in the village.</p>

<p>With the arrival of a wave of Israelis and a number
of political officials, the soldiers began many
soldiers got in their jeeps and roared away as those
on foot backed away while throwing everything in their
arsenal. One woman from Spain was hit in the ankle
with a rubber bullet. Most of us avoided serious
injury as we inhaled large amounts tear gas.
Streaming from canisters flying all around us.</p>

<p>One 80-year-old Palestinian woman stepped out of her
house and threw a peach at a group of retreating
Israeli soldiers. They actually came to arrest her,
and, as they stood in front of her gate, she hit
them again with a water bottle. Those of us standing
with her shamed the soldiers into leaving.</p>

<p>Palestinians won this time. They broke the military
ordered curfew, they went to the mosque, and they
held the demonstration in spite of being told not
to move. Members of Palestinian and Israeli governments
were on hand to witness what life is like for people
in Bil'in.</p>

<p>This occupation will end some day, and the people of
Bil'in will go in the history books of Palestine as
examples of the power of nonviolent resistance against
terrible violence from the fourth largest military in
the world.</p>
