<p>I just found out about the <a
href="http://www.bringthemhomenowtour.org/">Bring Them Home Now
Tour</a>, a three-legged bus tour from Crawford, Texas to Washington
DC, which started on 31 August, and will arrive on 24 September in DC
for the anti-war conference in DC I wanted to go to.  I had blown off
the possibility of going to Texas and the conference, but now I see
there was a perfect way to do it...</p>

<p>It's a challenge for me to trust I am doing my own right thing by
transcribing my journal entries...  I do know, at least, since I have
made this choice, I should do it now, but just wanted to note that I'm
beginning to see examples of the universe supporting anything I
request.</p>
