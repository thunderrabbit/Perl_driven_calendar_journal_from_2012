<p>Kellie and I walked to the grocery store to get some foodage and
discovered significant rain flooding the streets!  We waited in vain
for it to subside, watching gushing gutters squirt water that slowly
rose toward the entrance of the store.  I was unimpressed when the
store security guard and some low level employee put down bags of
rocks in front of less than half of the encroaching line of water!
Hadn't they seen the levee in New Orleans??</p>

<p>I enjoyed watching the flooded creek, but didn't enjoy getting
wet.</p>
