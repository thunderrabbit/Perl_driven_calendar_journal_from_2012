<p><b>Tickets to Tel Aviv</b></p>

<pre>Hello, world!

In about 10 days I will be leaving Tokyo for Tel Aviv, and then making my way to
Jerusalem to join the 2005 Olive Harvest, hosted by the International Solidarity
Movement.  I believe I will become part of an 'international presence' to help
deter the Israeli soldiers from stopping the harvest.

From the ISM website (<a href="http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/oh2005/">http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/oh2005/</a>)

     The presence of internationals during harvest time has proven in the
     past to help limit and decrease the severity of attacks.  After a two-day
     training session, volunteers for the Olive Harvest Campaign will stay in
     Palestinian homes in West Bank communities and accompany Palestinian
     families to their olive groves to serve as witnesses to document and
     expose attacks by settlers — supported by the Israeli Army — on farmers
     and their families.

At this point, that's basically the limit of what I know about what things will be
like once I get there!

Before I leave, though, I need to get rid of a couple boxes of clothing.  I plan to
*not* overpack as I did on P.B.!!  (I'm surprised at how hard it is to find
places to donate clothes in Tokyo).

Speaking of which, I have nearly finished my journal entries from my P.B.
adventure.  I am basically done transcribing; I just need to add pictures to those
entries.

I also need to decide what to do with my beloved TJ Bike.  I'm not sure how long I
will be in Palestine, and therefore not sure if it will be worth bringing TJ Bike
with me.

Money is a big question mark right now, but I trust everything will come together
nicely.

Blessings to hurricane, typhoon and war torn places around the world, where people
are being forced to release their possessions and lives.

Blessings to Chesleigh who chose to release her own life.

Blessings to all.

     Love and Peace
     - Rob!
