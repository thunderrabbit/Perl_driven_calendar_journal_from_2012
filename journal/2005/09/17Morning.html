<p>How nice to wake up next to Natalie.  Fully dressed; have never
kissed, but I really like her.</p>

<p>Walked with her to Shinjuku, then took a quick trip to Takabakabaka
where she headed home (Audrey's) and I took the train back to Shibuya,
but got off in Harajuku because it's Saturday and I've heard that all
kinds of interesting outfits are worn near Harajuku station on the
weekends.</p>

<p>I didn't see more crazy outfits than I've ever seen before, but I
did see two perfectly dressed Lolita girls, complete with tall sole
boots and long socks and poofy dress with frills and little head piece
thing.</p>

<p>Walked through Yoyogi park, half expecting to see Greg or some
other GET-T, but did not.  Walked over the pedestrian bridge to NHK
park area where I heard some techno-dance beats bumpin' from the
little outdoor auditorium thing facing the flea market area.</p>

<p>I danced a gentle version of Rob's Crazy Dance for about 30 to 45
minutes.  I enjoyed having lots of space to do whatever, and used the
space and the tile pattern to my balance-dance enjoyment.  I danced
only on the thin white tile lines (about 7 inches wide) which were
about 5 feet long and spaced 4 feet apart.  Then another set was
about 6 feet away:</p>

<pre>
| | | | |           | = 7 inches by 5 feet

| | | | |

| | | | |
</pre>

<p>Except they were curved around the arc of the stage, something
like</p>

<pre>
\ \ \ \ \

 | | | | |

/ / / / /
</pre>

<p>but without so much curve.</p>

<p>I danced like that for quite a while, wondering if I could do it if
they were six inches off the ground, or six feet off the ground, and
how much it would matter psychologically if they were walls or just
tops (like in <em>Tron</em>).</p>

<p>Lots of that dance and then my internal alarm was like, "aight;
time to go," and I went.</p>

<p>On the train (Den-en-toshi line) to Kellie's house now.</p>
