<p class=dream>Reading TIME magazine I saw a 2-page layout
advertising 6 books for sale.  The books didn't seem like all that
amazing save that they were being pimped by TIME.  I could just
imagine the cash suddenly flowing in for these authors and I felt so
crushingly depressed that I have not written a book yet.  Then I felt
a wave of "get over it; just write a book," and I felt all better
then woke up gently.</p>

<p>Should I write about my adventures on P.B.?  Should I learn
Japanese then research and write the history of P.B.?</p>
