<p>Starbucks Coffee.</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me plug in my MAC and transcribe journal
entries.   I am allll most done.</p>

<p>Also here in Starbucks, thee girls are primping: one is putting on
mascara and eyeliner.  One is curling her hair with a battery operated
curling iron.  The third is facing away from me, so I can't see what
she is doing.  They're all chattering away at high speed.</p>

<p>Across the table from me there is a dude composing music with a
little miniature keyboard.  The woman next to me is doing her
homework.</p>

<p>Oh, the third primping girl is actually sending text messages on
her phone while talking with her friends.  Now the second one is
using the curling iron and the first is putting on lip gloss.</p>

<p>Tokyo is amazing.</p>

<p>I have just finished tape 31.  I have two more 90 minute tapes to
go, and then I'm done with transcription!!</p>

<p>After that I will work on getting images incorporated into my
journal (there are many on my site already so I won't have to upload
them again) and then I'll be done with this project!!</p>

<p>Then it will be time to seriously get ready (primarily just get
rid of my shit) for Palestine!!!!!</p>
