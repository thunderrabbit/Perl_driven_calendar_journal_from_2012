<p>I just found this <a
href="http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=news&cat=2&id=347993">short
article</a> about some people making a porn video in a cable car at
the World Expo in Japan.  Most hilarious is when they were caught (not
during the act), and the comments below the article on the site.</p>
