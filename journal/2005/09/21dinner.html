<p>On my way now to chow dinner with Tomoko and Sumidasan and
Hitomi.  I invited her to chow with us, and invitation she initially
declined, and then accepted.  I don't really know what her thinking
was, but ah well.</p>

<p>Dinner was nice; Tomoko told me about her latest business interest
and said she would pay me for time spent helping with her website.</p>
