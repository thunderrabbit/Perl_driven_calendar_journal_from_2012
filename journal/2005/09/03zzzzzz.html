自由ヶ丘 today.  It wasn't so bad in itself, but did we have to
*bounce* it??</p>

<p><img src="/images/travel/japan2005/September-ish/Mikoshi_break.jpg"
align=left> This is Kellie and I at one of the rest stops during the
evening.  The mikoshi consists of some sort of shrine (that's the best
word I have) mounted on a rather sturday framework of boards.  The
shrine is the red draped stuff, the gold thing on top, and white
lanterns on each corner, plus a car battery underneath to power the
lights in the lantern.  It was a couple hundred pounds, I'm guessing.
(not the battery; the whole thing).</p>

<p>We got the dark T-shirts beforehand, and drinks along the way.  I
don't know that I'd ever want to do it again; it killed my back and
shoulders.</p>

<p>I met 伊津美 (いづみ) and 靖子 (やすこ) after the last stop, where
we chowed やきそば (fried noodles) and watermelon and some grilled
beef.  They were super "interested" in me and all complimenting
everything.  I enjoyed the attention, but imagine it won't come to
anything.</p>

<p>Afterward, we went to a byebye party of a girl named Julie from
Gaba in Jiyugaoka.  She has been there two whole months, which
apparently is about the average for people lately.  I sat next to
Jesse and his friend Michael.  Jesse and I played hackey sack in the
hall for a bit, but quit before we got too hot.  Jesse didn't seem to
be his normal jovial crazy chatty self, but we didn't get a chance
to <em>talk</em>.  I will hang out with him sometime before I
leave.</p>

<p>I set up a movie screening for Shawshank Redemption with Louise at
noon on Wednesday.</p>
