<p>I'm headed out to Takabakabaka, probably for the night, but at
least for all we can eat all we can drink extravaganza at Gyro's Heros
in Takabakabaka.  This is the preferred location for P.B.
parties, it seems.  At least, gatherings hosted by Natalie.</p>

<p>Bigtime fun with many silly drunk people, not including myself, and
not including あつしさん, who offered me space in his room for
sleeping purposes around 2am.</p>

<p>Bahia, Alan, and Alan (sp) missed the last train and came back to
the party and then got the first train out.</p>

<p>I chatted with あつし a bit; he has lived in middle east and
learned Arabic in a month of immersion.  Fuckin' hell I wanna do
that.</p>
