<p class=dream>On P.B., we were sailing while aware a star was
going to go nova soon. when the explosion happened, some animals were
able to talk.  I climbed down the outside of the boat from the top
deck down into one of the lower decks.  For some reason I did not get
into trouble.</p>

<p class=dream>There was an explosion imminent, and we were all on the
ground with our faces down preparing to withstand the blast.  I was
flat scared and not sure what it would be like.  When it happened, I
could feel the heat and tell hair was burning around my face.  I
realized I hadn't taken one last inhalation before the blast actually
got to me so I was wondering if I would be better off breathing in
slowly, or if I could select a time where the flames wouldn't be so
bad and inhale quickly or if I could hold my breath until it was all
over.  I woke up when I needed to breathe for real.  (I was holding my
breath while asleep)</p>
