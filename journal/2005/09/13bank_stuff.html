<p>I didn't sleep but about 1 hour today, from around noon.  Around
4pm I went to the bank to pay for the tickets to Tel Aviv.  That went
smoothly (though the directions are all in Japanese on the ATM, so I
had to call for help), and then I asked them if they could help me
keep Yahoo BB! from charging me 4700 yen per month.  It's really shit
to lose that much money per month just cause I haven't been able to
tell them to stoppit.  I even got help from Shoko, but she was unable
to help.</p>

<p>But, as of today, there is 0 balance in the account.  Just let
them try to get money from it now.</p>

<p>ooooh are they going to cancel?  Oh no!  I only haven't used the
service in 17 months.</p>
