<p>Today is the last day I'll get to see Katt.  We went to the
apartment in New Zealand embassy where she is staying with her friend
Nikki.  Chowed a bit of foodage and listened to them chat.</p>

<p>I tried to record some of Katt's stories, because they are
always entertaining.</p>

<p>I can hardly believe this trip is coming to an end.</p>
