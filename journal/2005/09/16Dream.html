<p class=dream>Madonna went to a recordng studio in 1978 and became
famous for her professional sounding vocals; she was signed onto
Island records that year.</p>

<p class=dream>I was walking between the University of Houston campus,
where students were sliding around in the mud bog in the front of the
entrance, and Rice University campus, where students were building
scale models of parks and fields and other outdoor terrain.</p>

<p class=dream>There were some cut ups on each campus, but by far,
Rice was more focused on studies.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked past a cage on Rice campus and saw a woman
standing in chains at the back of the cage.  I was like, "are you
happy to be trapped?"  She goes "yeah, but if you could get me some
water, that would be great."  I was like, "who's your manager?" and
she gave me a name like, "Fred" so I turned around toward where all
the students were building their scale model things and yelled, "Fred!
Your talent needs some water!!"  She thanked me, and I went on my
way.</p>
