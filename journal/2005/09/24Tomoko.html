<p>When I got on the train in Shibuya, there was a woman wearing a
purple sweat suit type thing that showed off her midriff, which wasn't
all anorexic like some Japanese women, but still shown off, and
attracted my attention.</p>

<p>After the train left the station I was like, "woah" when she did a
pullup on the handle thing above the door!  Like, "woah!"</p>

<p>Like monkeys copying each other, I did some almost pullups on the
oh-shit handles behind her.</p>

<p>At one point, we caught each other's eyes and she smiled.
Woah.</p>

<p>This is quite rare in Japan.  For someone to smile at me on the
train, and for someone to do pullups on the train... Woah.  Maybe
people who are comfortable doing pull ups on the train are
comfortable smiling at strangers.</p>

<p>Then, I was further amazed when she spoke English to me and we
chatted about work and I briefed her on my travels and travel plans.
We got off the train in ∆Ûª“∂Ã¿Ó and chatted for a bit more while I
waited for the local train to arrive.  I invited her to play ultimate
with us tomorrow.  She has never played before, but she knows the
baseball fields next to which we play.  Interesting to see if she
shows up!</p>
