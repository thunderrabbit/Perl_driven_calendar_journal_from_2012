<p>Oops...  I forgot my dear step sister's name and for a few days
wondered how she felt about the hurricane named after her.  But her
name (I remembered suddenly) is Karina.</p>

<p>I attribute this mixup to 1) being out of touch for so long; 2)
being so close to Katt for so long. (3 P.B. months last like
3 dog months.)</p>

<p>From the mayor of Slidell, where my aunt's family lives:</p>

Hurricane Katrina Update 9-1-05

To the Citizens of Slidell,

I am urging you not to return to the City of Slidell at this time.
There was extensive flooding in the city, and the work crews, police,
and utility companies are working around the clock to restore
electricity, gas and water to our City.  The presence of more people
will only hinder their efforts.

Cleco has brought over 1,000 workers to the area, and they have
already begun the tedious process of cutting trees that have fallen
and/or been tangled up in power lines.  Their crews are working
throughout Slidell.  They expect the city's power to be fully restored
in 6 - 8 weeks.

City crews have begun cleaning the streets of debris and are working
to restore water to the area.  They are repairing many broken pipes in
the process.

The City of Slidell has not had the widespread looting problem as seen
in New Orleans and other areas.  We have had isolated incidents and
have arrested 8 people.  I have a zero tolerance policy for looters
and have instructed the police department to use deadly force if
necessary.

Police Chief Freddy Drennan is receiving assistance from 15 police
officers from other states to ensure the safety and security of our
City.  In addition, I have requested additional armed National Guard
troops to protect the City of Slidell.  We have issued a 9:00
p.m. curfew, but that is subject to change on my order.

Some schools did take on water, and we don't expect the schools to
reopen until October 1, at a minimum.

Again, I am telling residents to please stay out of the area.  The
work crews, utility companies, and police officers are making
significant progress to restore the city's water, gas, and
electricity.  If people begin to come back and traffic the streets,
they will only slow down the process.

Stay safe where you are.  There is no water, no electricity, no gas,
no food.  You cannot survive in Slidell as it is now.  I know this is
frustrating, but please give us the opportunity to fix this City.
Your homes and property are secure.  The Slidell Police and National
Guard troops will make sure of that.

Finally, all non-essential City of Slidell personnel are now on
administrative leave until called upon.  As soon as it is safe to come
home to Slidell, you are expected to report back to work.

Thank you and stay safe,
Mayor Ben Morris
