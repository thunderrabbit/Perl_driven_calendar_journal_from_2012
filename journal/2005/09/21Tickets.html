<p>Whoo!!  I got my tickets to Tel-Aviv today!  I'm excited and a bit
wondering how everything is going to connect, particulary regarding
money.  I'm about $200 short of what they suggest I have once I arrive
($100 per week) for my 5+ week adventure.  I trust everything will
work out nicely.  Feel free to send me cash via paypal.</p>
