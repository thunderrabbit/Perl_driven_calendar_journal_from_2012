<p>YAhooooooooo!!!!</p>

<p>I just talked to Matt who is in charge of selecting GET Teachers
for the 52nd Voyage, and he has invited me as a repeating
teacher!!</p>

<p>So so so awesome!</p>

<p>That means I will not be in Palestine for a super long time, but it
will be long enough (I imagine) to know if I want to go back.</p>

<p>I am definitely looking forward to seeing how my finances enjoy
this voyage - I haven't had a job in a long time, and it appears that
I'm a bit less than 1/2 done not having a job..</p>

<p>Trusting the universe; releasing the outcome... these are my jobs
now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Wowzas..  I haven't heard of many of the places to which we'll be
traveling!!  Wow wow wow!!</p>

<p>My estimated outlay for the next 5 months of volunteer work is
$2000 more than I seem to have in the bank..  Donations via paypal
are being accepted!!</p>

<p>I wonder if I could learn and make money as a dancer?</p>

<p>The interesting thing: it hasn't 100% hit me that I will be on the
voyage, or for some reason I don't quite believe it.  I walked with
Natalie and Yuuka to the other P.B. office and we saw Rie
there. ..  She asked me if I would be on the 52nd (she well) and I
didn't tell her yes, but I did tell her I am applying.</p>
