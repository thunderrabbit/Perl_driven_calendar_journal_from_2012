<p>I'm at Starbucks with Hitomi now.  While waiting for her to meet
me for the movie (which starts at 8:50pm, so there's plenty of time),
I sought a wireless internet access point I could use to download the
thumbnails of pictures I already have on my site.</p>

<p>Hitomi says:</p>

<pre>
こんにちは〜♪
今夜、路武とスターウォーズ3を観ます。
わっ！楽しみ(^^)
今、スターバックスで路武のピースボートの写真を選んでます。

<p>Good job to Hitomi typing that on my keyboard, which is differently
arranged than her keyboard, and differently labled than itself.  The
keys are labeled in dvorak layout, but I quit trying to type that way
about the time I got started transcribing at Kellie's early this
month.</p>

<p>Wow!  Hitomi has a cool little red BMW 1:32 scale remote control
model.  The remote control is built into a watch!</p>

<p>We've been digging through pictures on my computer, comparing them
to what is already on my site, to see which ones still need to be
uploaded.</p>

<p class=date>7:18pm</p>

<p>Just told Hitomi a bit about Chez jumping.  Showed pictures of my
old days back in the US, including two of Chez.</p>

<p>I started to tear up when I saw the pics.  I miss you guys so so
much.  I think I should put the pics on my site, if they're not there
already.</p>

<p>Time to chow and then scope the movie.</p>

<p>Went to Kawasaki BE for some cheap foodage with plenty of plastic
wrapped around it.  I wonder wonder wonder how much longer the world
will keep producing this much waste.</p>

<p>We're chillin' in TOHO cinemas now (9th floor of Kawasaki DICE
building), and I'm variously getting three wireless signals.  Two of
them require passwords, but the third does not.  However, it's not
consistent enough for me to actually get connected.  I would pay $50
or so for a handheld device that would tell me if I could get free
wireless broadband wherever it was.</p>

<p>$100 if it could give me username and passwords required for 15%
(*) of the password-protected networks it found.</p>

<p>(*) I figure that many systems use super-weak or even default
passwords.</p>
