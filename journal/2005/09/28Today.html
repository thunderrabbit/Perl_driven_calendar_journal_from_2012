<p>Pretty much have been online all day today.  I have been adding
images to my journal, and am between 1/3 and 1/2 finished.
Awesome!</p>
  
<p>I got to talk with Niveen today for about 40 minutes usink <a
href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>, which I now officially love more
than when I first loved it.</p>
  
<p>Due to a weird non-sorting issue with iPhoto, I (thought I) needed
a list of 3 digit numbers from 000 to 159.  I have wanted this type of
list before, and have written code in emacs to create such lists. I
looked for that code today, but couldn't find it.</p>
  
<p>So today I wrote (different) <a href="/wordpress/?p=10">emacs code
that creates a list from 000 to 999</a>.</p>
