<p>To fill in the blanks on <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date=2005/07/12#Eon">this</a>, I
entered "era" "period" and "epoch" into <a
href="http://labs.google.com/sets?hl=en&q1=era&q2=epoch&q3=period&q4=&q5=&btn=Large+Set">Google
Sets</a>, and it instantly came back with four items: "Period" "Era"
"Epoch" and "Eon" as the missing name.  Awesome!</p>

<p>I googled those words plus "holecine" [sic] and it asked if I meant
"holocene," which I assured it I did.</p>

<p>I found <a
href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/glossary/TimeScaleShort.html">a
short geologic timescale</a> in the results.  The long version has
lots of juicy details.  I knew about Pangaea, but I didn't know about
Rodinia!!!!</p>

<p>Okay, back to transcribing.</p>
