<p>I am still awake.  I have been on Jesse's really fast internet
connection uploading all my pictures to my webserver, optimizing them
on that server with ImageMagick (a utility I don't have on my
computer), then downloading them all back to my computer, and deleting
them off my webserver (because it doesn't have enough room to hold all
the pictures, even when they are optimized).</p>

<p>During most of this process, I have been uploading, optimizing,
downloading and deleting at the same time (to save time) in a total of
six different terminal windows (those four functions, plus a terminal
on my computer and on my server to monitor the progress on both ends).
All unix, all command line.</p>

<p>I really love unix and emacs.  I set up a macro in emacs that
optimizes a set of three directories at a time (each day contains
images, then two separate subdirectories for Original images (to roll
back changes) and Thumbnails).  However, I don't know how to put a
conditional in the macro, so it breaks if there aren't images in all
those directories.</p>
