<p>I met Aki and we had a super fabulous lesson.  Her English is
pretty good, just a bit slow speaking, but great comprehension.  She
asked me about me and the best parts of P.B. trip, and then
specifically why I had chosen to go to Palestine.  I was really
excited to explain, but I caught myself before I got too long winded:
"Do you want to work on listening, or on speaking?"  She goes, "I want
to work on speaking," so I was like, "okay, go," and then she quickly
changed her mind, "I want to work on listening," with an embarassed
smile.</p>

<p>I must interject here that this behavior came as quite a surprise
to me.  Most Japanese, from my experience would not have changed, for
probably one or two reasons: not wanting to conflict with the current
request, or not knowing how to phrase the new decision.</p>

<p>I gave her a high five for having broken the stereotype to which I had
grown accustomed, and then proceeded to blabber a short but thorough
version of how I chose to go to Palestine next month.</p>

<p>After that, she asked me what I did back in the US, and she seemed
really surprised slash ecstatic to hear I had been a programmer.
Like, <em>oh my gosh why is she so happy to hear that????</em>, but
then it came clear: she was having some issues at work with M$ Access.
Specifically, "what is a query?"</p>

<p>I explained query, but it turned out her question was more like,
"when writing queries, how do I describe the relationships between the
databases?", and I ended up teaching her about relational databases,
first normalization, a few simple queries and a more complex
query.</p>

<p>I layed out a full blown lesson for her, from the simplest 1 DB
query (which customers live in Tokyo?) using both a Query Wizard
(which I imagine exists in M$ Access approximately as I described it)
and in SQL.  Then I put together a more complex database as applies to
her situation at work, and I put in far too much repeated information,
and explained why: we don't want to update 1000 records with the same
update.</p>

<p>I split the database into two sections and had one more field to
go.  I asked her where it should go, and made sure she understood why
it should go there, and what would be the implications if it went
into the wrong place.</p>

<p>Then it was almost trivial to work through a query that related the
two databases together.  (The complication is one that I actually have
never had to solve; I should ask the internet about it.)</p>

<p>Suddenly, it was *midnight* and we needed to head back for last
trains.  Great lesson for three hours and I'll see her again next
week. Awesome!!</p>
