<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>I am back in Tokyo, living in Kellie's living room, after
having just recently finished sailing around the world in 100+ days on
P.B.'s 49th Global Voyage.</p></li>

<li><p>I am in email contact with Katt, though she kinda hacked
me off in her last email after I was like, "I haven't shagged anyone
cause I don't want to make things uncomfortable on PB."</p>

<p>She was like, "I'm glad you can think ahead, but I think you can
think of better reasons than that."</p>

<p>And my immediate reaction was like, "fuck off; that's a perfectly
fine reason," but I didn't write that to her, but pondered on it a
bit.  I think I'm more emotional than she is, so I chose an emotional
reason for not shagging, whereas another reason might be something
else.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not yet written/sold a book nor sold any artwork.  I've
not actually tried to do these things, either.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been in email contact with my bro, and sorta with my
mom.  Slight contact with my dad over the phone.  Interesting that I
am soon going to Palestine to tell the Israeli soldiers to chill out,
and my dad is married to a Jewish woman.</p></li>

<li><!-- p>Last night I successfully did not sleep with Satoko, --
  -- though I think she was interested in the prospect.</p --></li>

<li><p>I was just at Louise's house watching movies this morning.
About to go to Millenium House to chill with Jen and other peeps who
show up.</p></li>

<li><p>I have my tickets to Palestine reserved, with a 180 day open
return ticket.  I just need to pay before 20 September.</p></li>

<li><p>I have given up on learning Dvorak layout for a few reasons: 1)
it's incompatible with QWERTY layout, which means I'll have problems
when I need to switch to a friends' computer.  2) by not having to
move my fingers as far, they seem to become stiff even more quickly
than using QWERTY layout.  This seems like it could actually increase
repetitive motion damage</p></li>
