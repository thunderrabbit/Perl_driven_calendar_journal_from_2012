<p class=date>2am JST Tuesday 13 September 2005</p>

<p>Been hanging out with Jesse and Michael tonight.  I am here for
their supafast internet access.  We have played darts (I won,
actually) and watched some episodes of Futurama, Season 4.  Good
times.</p>

<p>Jesse gave me a present: a bus ticket he found with credit still on
it.  Awesome!</p>

<p>I'm going to stay up for a bit until this data transfer process is
finished.</p>
