<p>Yarg.  How embarassing to be gripped by indecision and fear of
talking to people or maybe fear of asking for help...</p>

<p>On the way to Kawasaki, I thought I was late and texted /е╚ет to
let her know.  Turns out I <em>wasn't</em> late, and even had enough
time to hit the restroom, barely.  I needed a place to hang my suit (I
am bringing it to her house for safe keeping while I'm in Palestine)
so I had to wait.  I kept thinking, "I could go ask someone if I can
leave my suit with them..." because there were a few vendors with
tables in the station lobby, and even one cat selling ties, so a suit
wouldn't even look too out of place.</p>

<p>But I kept waiting and then gave up cause I was about to miss the
train that would get me there on time.  Then I saw the
handicapped-access restroom and was like, "naw," and headed to the
train, and then was like, "yeh," and headed back to the restroom.</p>

<p>I hung my suit on one of the plentiful handles.</p>

<p>I missed the train by about 5 seconds.</p>

<p>Yarg.</p>
