<p>Holy shaiza!</p>

<p>For the first time in a long time, it looks like I will be able to
play ultimate today!  I have worked every weekend that I've lived in
Japan, with notably few exceptions.  Therefore I have never joined
the only ultmate group listed in Metropolis, which meets on Sundays
at 2:30pm.</p>

<p>It's funny that I'm wondering if I should introduce myself as
Wonderboy or as Rob......  I don't have either of my discs (which
were labeled WONDERBOY) because one was lost in Vietnam, and the
other I donated to the 51st voyage (in a "magnanimous" gesture of
reducing the amount of crap I'm lugging around).</p>

<p>Not that discs are crap, but.</p>

<p>Huge fun at ultimate.  Met a lot of cool peeps and then went to a
bit of a party afterward.  I enjoyed chatting with Koki and Ii and a
woman named Wakako, but she was drunk.  Koki is working hard at school
and work.  Ii is Chinese with really good English and Japanese to
boot.</p>

<p>Yesterday I headed out to ultimate around 12:45, having read on the
Outdoor Japan website some people saying "let's start at 1pm."
Walking from the station along the river, I saw a model being
photographed by about 15 guys with cameras.  I watched, curious to
know how *she* was chosen, and if I thought she was particularly cute
and BAM I stubbed my toe on a rock and kinda tripped, immediately
embarassed to have become the stereotypical chickless movie character
guy not watching where he was going while watching a girl and BAM.</p>

<p>I caught myself with little effort and wondered what the heck I
had hit.  Looked back and didn't see anything.  My toe hurt a bit
more than just a bump; I looked down to see a flap on my big toe
layed open.  About a centimeter in diameter.</p>

<p>Man.</p>

<p>I absolutely refused the idea of letting it stop me from playing
ultimate, but I didn't refuse the idea of borrowing some white tape to
cover it.  While walking beside baseball teams practicing, I humbly
interrupted one of the manager-looking guys and asked for "sports
tape," using Japanese pronunciation: "supotzu tapu," and showed my
toe.  True to Japanese helpfulness, he immediately sprang into action
and located their medical bag and produced two bandaids.</p>

<p>I thanked him and put them on, knowing they wouldn't last long.
Walked a while in search of the ultimate group as the bandaids quickly
started flapping off.  Saw two people playing disc and made one last
effort to get sports tape before I went out to play.  Talked to the
nearby manager and he produced one bandaid, which I used to sorta
cover the flappage.</p>

<p>Walked over to the couple playing disc, but they said they were
just playing alone and didn't know of any ultimate pickup game.
Hmmm.  Okay; fair enough; and I continued walking past that field in
search of ultimate.</p>

<p>Shortly, I heard someone shouting "hey!" more and more vigorously
so I turned around, quite sure no one could be shouting for me, and
quite surprised to find they were shouting for me.  It was the couple
I had seen playing frisbee.  They had come and tracked me down to say
that the ultimate frisbee guys had arrived at the same area they had
been playing before.</p>

<p>Wow.  I totally thanked these two guys for having gone out of their
way to find me; I definitely appreciate it.</p>

<p>Walked back to the ultimate field, where five people were
playing.  Looked down to see how my bandaids were holding out.  Still
going strong.  Walked across the field and looked down to find the
bandaids had completely escaped.  But the blood had stopped, and the
cut was filled with a fine blood stopping layer of dust, so it should
be no problem.</p>

<p>We tossed discs around for about an hour until we had enough people
to play four on four.  I showed Izumi how to more properly throw a
forehand and saw that Adam had quite a lot of ultimate experience, and
Hisa could do some cool disc spinning tricks on his fingers, and Ii
could catch quite well.</p>
