<p>I am far closer to done than before.  I have basically finished
all the writing part, and am just adding pictures to my P.B.
journal entries.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying my blog a bit more than when I first got it; I just
added Spam Karma 2 to it.  Yes wordpress and its plugins and themes
are really nice.</p>

<p>I'm en route to meet Hitomi, who has been quite sane and normal.
We saw Star Wars III together and then she was inspired to see IV, V
and VI.  We'll do that tonight.</p>

<p>I will probably crsh out there tonight and then rock straight in to
PB office tomorrow around noon to meet Matt, and discuss the option of
me going on 52nd voyage.</p>

<p>The good parts of the voyage: Matt is GET-Coordinator; it's a
southern hemisphere voyage; I'd be on P.B. again.</p>

<p>The bad points: it would be less likely for me to sail with
Katt again; I wouldn't have a lot of time in Palestine;

(therefore,) I wouldn't have much money.</p>
