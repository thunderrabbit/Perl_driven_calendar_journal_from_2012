<p>The party seems to be just warming up; Audrey, Brandt, Natalie

<p>Matt and Caroline are spewing scads of なつかしい British and Aussie TV /
movie trivia, most of which I've never heard before.  Natalie is
close to sleep, and I am just listening.</p>

<p>We are putting in a movie: "Me and Hair" or something like
that.</p>
