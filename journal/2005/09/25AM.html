<p>Last night and this morning I worked on my 404 processor, making it
look for files in my webspace with the same filename, so when it
emails me about the 404, it can tell me if there's anything
comparable.</p>

<p>I didn't work on transcribing today; I had hoped to finish the two
tapes before ultimate, but now it's time to go go go.</p>
