<p>Woah.  Star Wars III.  <a href="/wordpress/?p=7">Check it.</a></p>

<p>At the very end, Hitomi was like, "that's *it*??" before she
remembered there are three more movies to go.  She saw the first two
episodes this past week, but hasn't seen the real first three.</p>

<p>I just realized that the stuff I've written about Star Wars III
would be good for my blog.  It can hold my thoughts about external
stimuli and my journal can be my thoughts on internal stimuli.</p>

<p>I kinda hate "having a blog."  I always point out that I had my
journal before blog was a word when people say, "you have a blog,"
and I'm like, "actually it's a journal, and I've had it before blog
was a word."</p>

<p>But now, it appears, I have a blog.</p>
