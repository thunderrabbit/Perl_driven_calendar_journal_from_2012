and chatting at the Mexican restaurant below TGI Fridays (that must
have a forget-spell on its name because I never can remember it).
Walked to Harajuku station and down that one street to see all the
strange fashion.. Oh, that was fater we headed to the Apple Store to
see if they had any extra C keys layng around.  I lost mine in the
great Dvorak Switch of '05.</p>

<p>In Apple Store two guys were performing Japanese Reggae to "their
largest crowd ever," and we enjoyed their beats for about 20 minutes
until the show ended.</p>

<p>Then Harajuku where we were surprised to find basically all the
stores closed  at 10pm on a Friday...  Walked all the way down Aoyama
street back to Shibuya (fortunately I recognized that my sense of
direction was off and we asked a cop which way to go).  Once I knew
the answer, it became clear.</p>

that was still open.  Instead, we came across two guys in a small dirt
lot between huge brightly lit stores.  They had two chairs, a small
table, a computer and speakers, plus a projector showing images on the
brick wall behind them.</p>

<p>How incredibly cool!!</p>

<p>Walked into the back entrance of Shibuya (Mark), which I had never
previously done, and we *both* pushed on the fan looking things that
absolutely looked liike they should rotate.  We pushed at the same
time, and laughed as it didn't rotate; we both had exactly the same
response to the architecture.</p>

<p>Pirori got me
hot-chocolate-no-wait-scratch-that-vanilla-cream-frappucino at
Starbucks though they didn't have seating available for it was
beomcing apparent that we were running out of coffee shops, and they
all were disallowing seating.</p>

<p>We sat out in Hachiko Square away from most smokers while we
chatted and froze ourselves from the inside with our drinks.  Long
long hugs when it was time to go.</p>

<p>Then she headed through the gate and the card didn't work.  The
guy fixed it and more hugs and then she was off.</p>

<p>See ya soon, Pirori!</p>
