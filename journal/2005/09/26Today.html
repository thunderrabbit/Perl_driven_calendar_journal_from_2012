<p>Today I spent a lot of time on my computer.  First, I *nearly*
finished transcribing the final tape!!  I may do it now after I
finish this entry just to be *done* with it!!</p>

<p>I got sidetracked reading google.com/ig, which I have set up to
show me lots of tech news and stuff.  I sent a couple of articles to
Fred and Dude for our mutual comments.  Dude was like, "we need a blog
to talk about this stuff," and I was like, "I got a blog thing,"
(bbst), and then after a few emails, I was convinced to try out <a
href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a>, which I ended up <a
href="/wordpress">installing</a> on my site.  My basic idea is to put
commentary on URLs and crap on wordpress and keep my journal with day
to day adventures untouched.</a>
