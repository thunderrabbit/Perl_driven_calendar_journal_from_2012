ACTION ALERT: Call someone about this right now.

Dear all,

Andrew, the ISM media coordinator here,

It's 9 p.m. west coast U.S. time, later obviously back east. Here
in Palestine it's 7:05 a.m. and the Israeli military has launched
an invasion of the West Bank village of Bil'in that you've been
reading about so much as of late. The goal is to round up all
our international and Israeli activists before there's any media
attention at all.

Right now the home that has the ISM apartment is surrounded by
Israeli soliders and border police. People are trapped on the roof
and soldiers are getting ready to ram through the front door and
haul the lot of them off.

You're encouraged to contact the individuals and organizations
