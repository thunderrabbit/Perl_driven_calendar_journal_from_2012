<p>Hitomi and I are at the okonomiyaki place on 8th floor of Kawasaki
BE.  This place reminds me of Miki, who I would dearly love to see,
but seems to have changed her cellphone number.  She never had an
email address.</p>

<p>Lunch was fun; we joked around and pretty much had a good time.  I
didn't want to keep talking about variants of "what will you do with
all your stuff?" because I just don't know yet what I have at
Kellie's, nor what I need in Palestine.  Too many variables and not
enough data.</p>

<p>We laughed about how she often states the obvious and I always say
「本当だ」which I think means "wow, you're right!" but comes across
more like, "no duh."
