<p class=dream>In a classroom with a roller coaster, I rode the roller
coaster and was in the very last car, but no one had taken the time to
make sure I my seat belt had been fastened.  I nonchalantly asked
"which ride is this?"  just out of curiosity and they were like "the
blab blah blah" and I knew it had loops so I fastened my own seatbelt.
We went up and down and whooshed and I really leaned into the curves
and dips and found I could touch the ground and the glass cabinets in
the classroom with my hands and feet.  I took note of what parts of
the coaster would need to be changed to make it safe for the kids and
finished the ride and walked up to the teacher, who was scrubbing the
insided of a locker clean before the first day of school.

<p class=dream>In my mind, I was preparing to say something like "I
normally try to take on too much responsibility, but I don't have time
right now, so I'll just tell you what I found about the roller
coaster.."</p>

<p class=dream>But she preempted me like, "can you do me a favor?"
and told me where some meat loaf mix was and asked if I'd put together
some meat loaf for baking later.  She used the word backed instead of
baked as a jock (*) and I was like "??" and she assured me she did it
on purpose.  I realized could write an emal to Erika and say "right
bake at you!"  and she would get it, because she's the one who made
the joke first.</p>

<p>(*) I wrote jock unintentionally when I intended to write joke.</p>
