Rob.


Someone may have already contacted you in a better way than this. I don't
know how long it takes for you to get this, but you should call someone or
me asap.

Chez has committed suicide. From what I know, it happened today, Monday, in
the afternoon/evening.

Theres not a lot else to say. A memorial service at Horizon sometime in the
next week or two.

My number is 214.etc.etc.

Call me or email me and let me know you got this.

Thanks and with love,
Jackie

<p>Oh Chesleigh, you silly beautiful girl.  I had hoped to see you
again.  I wanted you to get beyond these angsty years.  I look forward
to seeing you next time around.</p>

Fuck.

Thank you for letting me know. You are the first to tell me.

I was hoping to see her again.

I don't know if I can get back for a memorial. I have the time but no funding.

Love and Light
- Rob
