<p>Matt from Pb called me!  He's in charge of the 52nd Voyage,
and I'm interested in going.  He asked if I can come in to the office
and have a chat with him, which I've arranged for Friday before I chow
dinner with ¤Ô¤í¤ê, a friend of Pb peeps via the 47th
voyage.</p>

<p>I'm sure he wouldn't have me come in if the answer was flat "no,"
so I am optimistic!!</p>

<p>The only bad thing about being on 52nd voyage is that would
probably reduce my chances of being on 53rd voyage, for which
Katt is applying.</p>
