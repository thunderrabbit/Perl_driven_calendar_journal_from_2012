<p>Today I met Kin for lunch in Shibuya.  We ate at my favorite
Mexican place (the one under TGI Fridays) and then walked toward
Harajuku station.  She was interested in Yoyogi park, so we hung out
there for a bit, next to the water fountains listening to one of her
CDs.</p>

<p>Kin wants to know the title and artist of a song with lyrics like</p>

riding bikes around Yoyogi park, and Greg recognized my Cambodia
shirt!!</p>

<p>Wow!  We played disc with Greg's Aerobee (disc, not ring) and then
I climbed a tree and we walked to Harajuku and then parted ways.  Greg
told us about Matt and Emi's house warming party tomorrow, so I will
be going to that.  Kin will probably as well.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh on the way out we saw a guy with a pet rabbit.  And a woman with a pet doberman.  The guy was not rescuing the rabbit.  Fortunately for the rabbit, the woman was holding back her dog.</p>

<p>I scoped out the Starbucks where Ayana and I used to study, but
they close at 10pm, and that won't be enough time to give a full hour
lesson if we are meeting at Hachiko at 9pm and then walk there.  I
looked for other places to meet and found Royal Host is open till 4am
and has a 370 yen drink bar, and then I found McDonald's even closer
to the station. I'm in that McDonald's near Shibuya station now, going
to transcribe until time to meet Aki at 9pm near Hachiko.</p>
