<p>Wow.  Okay, Jesse told me I could use his supafast internet
overnight tonight, so I got clean and got my stuff together and headed
to the bus stop.  I realized I had forgotten to bring cassette tapes
to continue transcribing, so I flipped my chapstick tube to see if I
should go back.  It said yes, but I knew consciously which way it
landed, so I flipped it again, with a bit mor spin.  It said yes
again, so I went back and grabbed two tapes and headed back to the bus
stop.  The bus arrived about 12 seconds after I did.  Really.</p>

<p>Ah crap.  The bus went to a different station than what I
expected.  Even though it's the same bus <em>number</em>, (01), it
went to Miyamaedaira station instead of Kajigaya station . I don't
understand what difference I was supposed to note n the bus.  Why
would the same bus stop have busses with the same number go to
different final destinations?</p>

<p>Fortunately, it dropped me off on the same tran line that I wanted
(just two stations back), so all is not wasted.  And I have a seat on
the train, so I can write this rant whle it's hot in my brain.  But
man, it sure is strange to wonder what the difference may have
been.</p>
