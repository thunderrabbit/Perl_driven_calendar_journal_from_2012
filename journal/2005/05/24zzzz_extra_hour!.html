<p>Yay!  We get an extra hour!  So actually</p>

<p class=date>11:37pm CST Tuesday 24 May 2005</p>

<p>CST = China Standard Time, I guess.</p>

<p>I'm just(!) over halfway done correcting my transcription of Alan's
lecture; I'm glad I was able to do it, and look forward to people
going "ooooh aaaah" when I distribute it.  I like that I can type
pretty quickly.</p>

<p>I hope I'm this excited about all our extra hours on this
voyage!</p>

<p>My GPS shows 842 kilometers to Hong Kong, and we're going 32
kilometers/hour.</p>
