<p>We've finished our second GET meeting thing, preparing for the
Orientation tomorrow plus GET interviews tomorrow and after Hong
Kong.</p>

<p>Hitomi said HI to me as I walked past the internet enabled
computers.  She said access was really slow and I witnessed the
computer logging off as she tried to run Gmail.  Not sure what the
issue was there.</p>
