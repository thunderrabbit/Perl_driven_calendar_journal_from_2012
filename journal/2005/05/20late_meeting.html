<p>Met Hitomi; she gave me stuff to carry (which I now suddenly
realize I left in a different room (on the boat) (in the GET
office)), and it was certainly not too much, especially given that it
was all stuff that I requested.</p>

<p>Walked around on the top deck with Kris leading me, Dave, Kim, and
Pat; we scoped various rooms and such.  Turns out the minimum price
for this voyage is 138,0000 yen (zeros are correct; they count in
10,000s here); some people pay like 2 or 3 million.  Holy crizap! </p>

<p>There is a netted basketball area where we can play with my
frisbees, and the pools are filled daily if we're in clean-ish sea
water, so they are empty now.</p>

<p>Ikumi texted me to see if I am on the boat so I got Pat to take a
picture of me with a life ring TSS THE TOPAZ.  Awesome.  I couldn't
write back to her response cause we had a meeting at 11pm to 12am.
Ugh; I was falling asleep bigtime.</p>

<p>Met Chika who is part of the CIQ (?) team, in charge of passports
and stuff.  I am bunking with Sean, Shinji and no one else in a four
person room.  Cool!</p>
