<p>Saw a firetruck on its side, blocking 2.5 lanes of traffic (2 lanes
each direction), so we're an hour late, but we've got a (fucking
tight) suit for me and ready to go over my test.</p>

<p class=date>12:09pm</p>

<p>Aced the first two quizzes, and then squeezed into my 3mm(?) wet
suit.</p>

<p>Pre dive check and then in the water discovered my mask wasn't as
well fitted as I thought.  It kept leaking and freaking me out even
just while surface swimming with snorkel.  Switched masks with Chris
and was much better.  No leakage.  He said it's because of my
moustache. I trimmed it this AM but not full shave.  No Abe Lincoln
beard for me.</p>

<p>Went for the regulator.  Went for the scuba.  Underwater all the
way, but I didn't feel like I could clear my ears.  Chris couldn't
sink cause he's using his new dry suit.  We came out of the water
cause he couldn't pee, cause he's using his new dry suit.</p>

<p class=date>1:52pm</p>

<p>Back into the water, this time, we got down to 2.5 meters to kneel
and practice mask clearing, cramp removal, and exchanging regulators
and stuff.</p>

<p>Stayed under for about 30+ minutes.</p>

<p class=date>4:31pm</p>

<p>Well, if one counts the rule that 20 minutes in the water counts as
a dive, then I dove again.  But I couldn't get down below the surface
cause it just killed my ears.  Or, it hurt my ears enough that they
would rather be on a soft couch watching bad TV.</p>

<p>In order to not have eardrum busters, I had to abort the dive.</p>

<p>I must say I'm bummed out; I wanted to be like <em>booyah</em> and
zoom through all the skills; I basically trusted my regulator and was
breathing through it while trying all sorts of sinushenanigans to get
my sinuses to clear.  Couldn't do it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>On the way home, through an electronic bullhorn as part of his car,
a cop yelled at Chris to slow down.  Better than getting a ticket.</p>

<p>Man, I am tired.</p>

<p class=date>5:45pm JST Monday 09 May 2005</p>

<p>Chris indicated that I may get headaches (from holding my breath),
jaw aches (from biting down on the regulator (I did this today and
said he'll need to get an Alligator Regulator)), diarrhea (from
decompression), etc as I continue my dive career.</p>

<p>Very positive thinking he has; I'm not sure if I'll get past this
ear ache issue.</p>
