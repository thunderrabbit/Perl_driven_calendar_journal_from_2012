<p class=date>4:29pm JST Sunday 01 May 2005</p>

<p>Work was pretty busy today, relative to recent weeks, but not
relative to the fall.  Jen required a great deal of rest after an all
night adventure with Katrina to an Orthodox Russian church ceremony
around 11pm (?) and then drinks in Roppongi for the rest of the
night.</p>

<p>For some reason our quintarks didn't line up correctly, but I'm
not sure why.</p>
