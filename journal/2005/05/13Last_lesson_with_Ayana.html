<p>My last lesson with Ayana was nice.  She bought me a chocolate
chunk scone and we yammered a bit about PB.  She checked all
my homework, most of which was perfect, and then we practiced a new
grammar that I thought was difficult last night (when I did my
homework), but is actually not so bad.</p>

<p>She asked me to write a reference letter for her if I have time.  I
can do that.</p>

Ayana has been teaching me Japanese consistently every week for two
years.  Even in my darkest dreariest days of loathing Japanese and
the idea of studying, she has supported me with understanding and
patience.  She allows me to direct the lesson if I have outside
materials to work on
