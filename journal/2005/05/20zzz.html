and open.  I took pictures of the mechanism; I'm glad that it's right
by our room; I like to be friends with a door that is so dramatically
important.  When this door closes, it closes.  Very slowly, and very
strongly.</p>

<p>Four girls were in a small room and three boys were in a big room,
so they were asked to switch.  Three girls went over and Angie, the
fourth girl, discovered that her bed was broken.  So she's sleeping in
the boys' room tonight.  David, Pat maybe and I forgot.  Gosh I'm
tired.</p>

<p>Oh, and though I didn't get any pictures yet, I can pee in the
toilet, take a shower, and brush my teeth, all at the same time.
While standing in the shower, toilet and bathroom sink are adjacent,
just 90 degrees away from each other.</p>

<p>Okay, bedtime.  My alarm is set for 7am I think.  Hopefully 7:30.
AM meeting at 7:50.  Eek!</p>

<p>I'm on PB!!!</p>

<p>Oh, super PS: I'm looking for information on outer space: types of
stars, galaxies, black holes, light speed, stellar and interstellar
distances, and a wormhole or two.  I have the information from <a
href="http://thenineplanets.org">The Nine Planets</a>, a fantastic
website for our solar system, but not for stellar, galactic space.  If
you have any good links, please <a
