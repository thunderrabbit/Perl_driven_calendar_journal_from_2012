<p>Busy busy day today, but got all the interviews done and sorted
the pages afterward; I think the technique worked weller than it did
last voyage; I'm glad for the wisdom of the seasoned voyagers...</p>

<p>GET meeting and then Port Orientation for Da Nang Vietnam.  We'll
get to go on a tour led by Ley Ly Hayslip!!!  She's a Vietnamese
woman who wrote the book on which Heaven and Earth was based.
(That's Oliver Stone's movie that we watched a couple nights ago.)</p>

<p>Kicked the soccer ball around a bit with Shawn, Dave and Greg and
a Japanese guy I've not met before.  I played barefoot and got my
nail bent back a bit, but it's all goood.</p>

<p>Chowed dinner and now we are gathering for Alan Nelson and Ley Ly
Hayslip's speech thing, which I intend to transcribe.</p>
