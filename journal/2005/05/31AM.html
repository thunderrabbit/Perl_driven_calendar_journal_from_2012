<p>I got one sleep cycle last night for sleeping, and we lost one hour
due to time zone change; we're going Singapore, and are 646 kilometers
away, heading SxSW. (Heading 207OT, Bearing 216OT, though I don't know
the difference between Heading and Bearing, and I don't know what OT
means or how it's normally typed.)</p>

<p>Ate breakfast this morning with Aki, Yui, and Megu.  I taught Aki a
bit of English: "My name is Aki; I am from Yokohama; I am a nurse; I
like watching baseball games; I go to baseball games 3 or 4 times a
year."  I had met Yui before.  She reminds me of Mai (I think is her
name), a student from Gaba.</p>

<p>They helped me read a paragraph from the onboard Japanese
newsletter.  The Singapore students will be giving a lecture.  Reading
this newsletter in Japanese everyday will certainly help my Japanese.
I read 「行います」 ("okonaimasu") as 「行きます」("ikimasu"), but
they have different (opposite?) meanings and the (same) kanji has a
different pronunciation in these two cases.</p>

<p>Now I'm working on my curriculums and class lessons in the
sunshine bar.</p>
