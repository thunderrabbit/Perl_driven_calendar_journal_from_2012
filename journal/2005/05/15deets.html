<p>This is not details, necessarily, but kinda the structure of PB as
I am beginning to understand it.</p>

<p>Three linked circles: PB: the NGO/NPO, and the
travel agency that actually books the ship and tours, and GET: the
English teaching part of it.  PB needs JG because as a
non-profit, they are not allowed to book tours.  JG needs PB
for customer stream.  GET is added on as a benefit to the participants
to help use English as a tool for global communication.</p>

<p>PB's core idea is that if people can become personally
invested in other countries, we will be more like to stop our
governments from bombing those countries, and more likely to read
stories in the newspaper when those countries are featured.</p>

<p>What better way than to go meet the people who live there?</p>
