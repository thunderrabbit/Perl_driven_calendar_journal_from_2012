<p>Met the other Bulgarian girl who is super cute in the Topaz
Dining Room today.  Her name is Slavena.  So it's Kremena and
Slavena.  Slavena told me how to say thankyou in Bulgarian, cause I
said it in Russian and she was like, "that is Russian" and she told
me I could say "blogodaria" in Bulgarian.</p>

<p>We're about to go to the second half of the GET meeting today.</p>

<p>The wind is blowing faster than the ship today, so the smoke is
blowing forward.  The waves are going just a bit faster than the
ship.  They aren't huge, but good decent size, like an order of
magnitude bigger than what we see near Galveston; like 10 meter wave
length and amplitude of a couple of meters.</p>
