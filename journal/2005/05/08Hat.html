<p>On the way home this morning I stopped by a bus barn and asked them
about the hat I think I left on a bus on Friday night.  They called
the bus barn where I was and that barn has a hat that seems to fit the
description.  <! It was good timing for Satoko to be walking me to the
train station; she was able to interpret for me. >

<p>I should be able to get it tonight.</p>

<p>Got my hat!  Two women at the train station helped me by calling
and drawing a map to the bus barn where my hat had been taken.  They
conferred with the train station guy who got the phone number and
tried to print a map from the internet.  He was unable to do that so
they sketched out a map.  This is an example of something I appreciate
about Japan.</p>
