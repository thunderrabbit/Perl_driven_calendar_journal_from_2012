<p>Today was my last day at OM.  I've really had fun hanging out with
Jen without OM there; we sing and joke and read / write lots of emails
and such.  Today we played the Question Game and other days we've
played other games (usually involving questions "What would you do..."
and "Who would you do..." etc.  We hold everything together while OM
imagines he's helping slash doing something worthwhile by dialing in
from the Philippines.  We are so funny!</p>

<p>"How do you spell Philipeans?" I asked as I typed the above in
various combinations.  She whipped out a frequent flyer card or
something and showed me "Philippine."</p>

<p>"Oh, I want 'Philippines' not 'Philippine'..."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I have no idea, then."</p>

<p>We sing variants of Humphrey B Bear lyrics to the tune of the FOX
world temperature map music when the US goes to commercials and we
don't have to watch them.</p>

<p>We continue to jokingly say The Pope Died as if he really did, and
mock with earnest all the dramaticized "news" on FOX.</p>

<p>We sometimes randomly burst into dance or finish each other's
sentences and constantly amaze ourselves with such incredible
humor.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine if I bought a $50 train card and then lost it?"</p>

<p>.. [thinking carefully] .. "oh man, that would <em>suck</em>."</p>

<p>We think of small things we could do that would annoy, disturb, or
freak out OM.  We make sure he believes Jen has been helping me do the
quintark exchanges.  We also hope he never reads my website.</p>

<p>She set up a filing system to help hold the ship together and we
got everything organized for his return during the week, practicing
answering the questions we imagine he'll ask, just so she has a chance
of defending how things have changed a bit in his couple month
absence.  Like we set the printers to output to the top instead of to
the back, and we made a filing system instead of leaving papers in a
huge pile on the desk.</p>

<p>I did a cartwheel on my way back from the last quintark transfer.</p>

<p>I'm leaving Japan soon.</p>
