<p>Been working on my rob_update_mailer.pl mostly since 10am.  I also
did a bit to write some <a href="/copyright.html">copyright</a> stuff
for my journal and code.  Incorporated that into <a
href="/cgi-local/source_viewer.pl">source_viewer.pl</a> and into <a
href="/cgi-local/source_viewer.pl?file=allowSource.pl">allowSource.pl</a>.</p>

<p>Going to Kellie's house now (or really soon) to figure out how to
ride TJ Bike there on Sunday, and to clean a space for him to relax
during my PB adventure.</p>

<p>Good deal; we've cleaned off the balcony (and by we, I mostly mean
she) and I got to watch Meagan on Discovery Channel as she video
travelogued all along the Gold Coast of OZ.  Awesome.  And she's
really really cute!</p>

<p>Interesting that Meagan is also the name of the really really cute
girl who was(?) on Screensavers.</p>

<p>We're watching Discovery Channel's thing on People -versus- Ocean,
with all these references to how people are battling the ocean for
their spot of land on the shore.  I'm like, "look.  The ocean is
bigger than you.  If the ocean wants your land, it will obtain."</p>

<p>Seawalls (like in Galveston) stay intact, but the beach in front of
the seawalls erode until there's no beach.  This is bad news for beach
bums and for sea turtles who are loyal to their birthplaces over years
and years.</p>

<p>Kellie made a lovely lunch for us: baked tuna sandwiches and
lovely salad.</p>
