<p>Jen's teaching job at the school Katrina found is pretty
cruisey.  I taught a grand total of 60 minutes (though I was there 4
hours (except for when I went out for a walk between my two classes)
from 4 to 8) and got paid 10,000 yen.  Nice.</p>

<p>Nearly as good as OM.</p>

<p>The second class was a bit rambunctious, not listening to the
answers other students were giving, so I gave a pop quiz to see who
could answer what one of the students had answered.  The one student
who could got a cash reward from my wallet.  150 yen.  Enough for a
drink.</p>
