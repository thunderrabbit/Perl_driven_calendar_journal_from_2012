Oh man Anette is hilarious!!!!!!!  She was like "why do I need this
(translation radio)?"

And ten minutes later I thought of the perfect answer: "Cause Alan
and Ley Ly will be speaking Japanese!!"

I told her my perfect answer and we had a good laugh.  Then she goes,
"I know why it took you so long to think of that funny answer: someone
had to translate it,  but you didn't have one of these!!!"

"I also want a transcription of that.."

bang; already done.

Le Ly Hayslip

Good evening.  I'm so nervous, so um my partner Alan was supposed to
sing first, but he's so chicken now that I'm going to sing first and
he will sing after me.

So if I knew I would have to sing, I wouldn't have eaten first.  I'm
too full so maybe I won't have enough air to sing.  I wrote this song
for Heave and Earth movie.  If you watch the movie, the actor who
played me will sing the song for you, but she's not heere now, so
I'll sing it for you.

It's a very sad song about a girl who left the village because of the
war.  When she returned, everything was destroyed except the
foundation of the house and athe coconut tree.  Because she saw so
much sadness from the war, she created the song to get all her
feelings out.  It's my story, but it's the whole ____ of Vietnam.


<p class=date>8:58pm</p>

The book was much more powerful than the movie for Alan because ther
was so much more detail in it.  I wanted to meet her, but I didn't
think that could ever happen.  It's like a dream for me now to be
sitting next to her now.

(( questions are being asked in Japanese, but I'm not hearing the
translations.

From 1950 to 1954 was the war between Vietnam and France.

(( I missed the rest of the answer; sorry ))

LL from 1954 to 1963; the first ten years, even though we were very
poor, it was a happy time for me working in the rice paddies with my
family.

But then when Alan came to visit my village in 1963; everything went
upside down.  Fom 1963 to 1970, my village became refugees, and I am
one of the refugees.

I left Vietnam in 1970 and have been back and forth since then to help Vietnam.

AN in 1965; I joined the US Marine Corp.  In June 1966 I was sent to
the Vietnam war.  During the time I was sent to the Vietnam war, I din't even
know where Vietnam was.  We Americans were told the Vietnamese people were
figting for democracy and the communists were trying to take over
their country.

Some of you remember the propoganda of the domino theory that if one
SE Asian country became Communist, all of them would be come
Communist.

But as an 18 year old, I had no idea of the history of Vietnam; I had no
idea that the Vietnamese people had done nothing to the African American
people; had not enslaved us, so we went and attacked the Vietnamese people.

Because I was poor, because I was AA, I spent my whole 13 month tour
in Vietnam in the jungle shooting and killing the people.  So as we learnt
after the Vietnam war, the Vietnam war was started on lies, just like the Iraqi
war has been started on lies.

Because of the lies of the American govt _____ Vietnamese lost their lives
and _____ Americans lost their lives.

58000 US   

this truly was a tragedy of the Vietnam war.

Question:  You said you fought for 13 months in Vietnam, then as you said,
the Vietnam war was very wrong.  How do the US people feel when you came
back to the US.  How did peple think about you.

AN When I returned back to US after Vietnam; at first peole supported the
war, but then as the years went on people began to realize it was a
great mistake.

And one of the things that upset me badly after the Vietnam war, the
average American, including my family members didn't know that every
moment every day Vietnamese people were dying.



When I returned home from the war, I wanted to tell my friends about
the truth of the war, but I was suffering from a disease called Ppost
Traumatic STress Disorder, so I coudl not.

When I was in the Vietnam war, in the jungle, I only wanted to return home
alive, but when I got home, I was so unhappy that I  wished many
times that I had been killed.

It always seemd to me that the US people dinot care how many Vietnamese
people were killed; it was only when American troops came back dead
that the opinion of the war changed.

It wa during this time that I hated my country and hated myself.


Q: IThe Americans didn't care how many people were killed in the war,
but Le Ly married a

LL The Vietnamese called it the American war.  We fought it for Vietnamese
independence in our country.We fought 100 years agains teh French and
Japanese.  We wanted to rebuild for our families and were not looking
for another war with the US.

My familie was a revolutionary famly.  We thought it shuld be wone
country, not divided between North and South.

The war caused 2,000,000 Vietnamese casualties, 3,000,000 wounded and
300,000 MIA.

People like myself in the countryside had no idea why the Americans
wanted to destroy our villages, rape our woemn and torture our men.

After 1970s I married an American and moved to the US.  The culture
shock was one thing, but the most shocking was that the Americans saw
Vietnamese as not human, as gookes, as something that did not deserve to
live.


Everytime the news showed Vietnamese killed Americans, my American
families looked at me and said "what a shame that gooks killed our
people; we should go over there and kill all the gooks and in the
war."

Everytime they saw the Vietnamese killing other Vietnamese, they said "It's so
shameful that you are killing each ohter."

So the average US citizen had no idea why the US was in Vietnam, what they
were fighting for, and why they were killing Vietnam.  The Vietnam were only
defending ourselves; it doesn't make any sense.

That is why I had to write the books to explain to the American
people what we had to do to survive the war.

Questions: Americans called Vietnam gooks; 

the Americans made up the name Viet Cong; we don't know about the
communists.  We only knew we were fighting against people who were
invading our country and brainwashing us with something we don't
understand.


So now from what they talked about, they don' t know why the Us was
in Vietnam.  The US sent 2,000,000 soldiers, but they didn't know why they
were there; they just wanted to

If I were you, Le Ly, and my family and friends were killed, how can
you have this dialgogue with Alan and think about the future?

Budda teaches that if we forgive our enemy and bring him into your
livfe as your best friend, that is the only way to solve the problem.


We believe we are the vitime; we did not ask American for war.  The
US came and built up their own bad karma.  We can only love them and
forgive them for what they are and did.

AN: I agree with you completely: I remember in Vietnam asking my commander
how can we tell the good Vietnamese from those who are communist?

Our commanders told us that when we attacked the villages; if the people run, then
they are communists and we should shoot them.  One thing that you
should know about American is that it's a very racist country.  The
only true Americans are white.  And we should remember the history
because during the Korean war, they were not defeated, and they did
not win.  But n the Vietnam war, the US was defeated by little brown peole
with no nuclear weapons and no huge artillery; it was too much for
the Americans to accept.

And the war that American took to Vietnamese people had a very strong
sense of religion: the Christians against the Buddhists.

You say the Americans are Christian, and the Vietnamese were Buddhist;
something challenge to Buddhist; this is an irony the US tried to
fight the British; Le Ly said he forgive the because she is Buddist

Alan, do you feel guilty?

When I first came home forom Vietnam, of couse I felt guilty, soldiers are
trined to kill other soldiers, but in Vietnam, we killed more eldery,
children, women, sick peopee old people, hospitals,; it really showed
the US government attitude toward the Vietnamese people.

It was amazing to me how I was tricked and fooled into thinking the
Vietnamese peole were my enemies.

So more than feeling uilty, I was angry at myself and my governemtn
for their cruel polies and destroying other peoples homes and
property.

And so as i thik back on when i came home, there was a gret feelin of
guilt and regret; a great feeling of pan that I was kiling my
brothers and sisters.

And for me the challenge was to forgive myself.

And once I was able to come to grips and forgive myself, I knew I had
to work to tell the story of my Vietnam experience.

So on behalf on all the Vietnamese people who died and cannot tell their
stories; it is all our soldiers' duty to share the story and
hopefully we can learn that war and violence will never bring us
peace.

I have talked to many veterans who were so sick ; they were homeless
and useless. the Vietnamese were the ones who helped the soldiers who were
not welcome in their own country. (!!!)

The government had no use for them anymore.

But for he Americans it's very different.  Vietnam is still an open
painful wound for America.  That is why we countinue to have war;
that's why we continue to destroy other peples countries, because we
have not learned the lesson from Vietnam.

LL  not only Buddhist, bu we thought from our childhood that we are
very poor and we just wanted to live in our own family of human kinda
an accept people into our family.  It's not just Buddism, but Daosim,
and Confuscianism and our family thought the same tthing.

Alsofor onver 4000 years of culture; though we were poor and at war,
we had wisom very deep.  We have culture.  American has no culture
but hot dogs and how to make money.  We serve our motherland, and
that is the difference.

As Vietnamese we fought for our cost and our motherland and our ancestors
graveyards.  We fought against those who sold weapsons to make
profits and become wealthy due to tehe war in Vietnam.

For the next two days you will see the Vietnam people are very friendly,
and have no hatred; we are innocent and.

the guilt and shame is punishment enough; we are able to move on and
not cry about it.

I agree wholehearted ly as an American citizen.  I've always felt I
had to prove I was an American; we have to prove our citizenship eery
day, along with Vietnamese American, Chinese American..  My name is alan
Nelson, but Nelson is not really my last name.

Nelson is the name of the slave owners who owned my ancestors.  I
didn't realize the importance of this until I gave a lecture in
Okinawa.  The Okinawan children started to cry when they heard this.
When I asked m interpretor why they were crying; in Okinawans worship
their ancestors, so if you don't know your last name, how can you
worship your ancestors?

One of the reasons I enjoy coming to Japan is that here you have a
long old culture; must longer than in America.  In America we don't
have a culture.  Our culture is cheeseburgers and guns.

But I also want to tell you there are hundreds of thousands of
Americans like me who will fight for democrcay and have sensitivity
to others who are not like us.

We try to folow the examle f men like MLKJr; who changed A without
guns and violence; he changed A with something called nonviolence.

So as an An, I cam very embarassed, but I cannot run away, and I will
never give up on that promise.

As a Vietnamese living in A for 25 years, A is a good country for
opportunity.  It gave me a voice and a name.  It is good for people
who are looking for a change; who want to do somethinf ro this world.

Because the US is so big, they don't have to travel out of their
country; the Mexicans and Asians are moving in and Americans will be
the minority.  That is the price they pay for their injustice.

Some Asian countries cannot reconcile; what is missing?

In 1986 I went back to Vietnam.  In those days there was no relationship
between Vietnam and US .  That is why I had to stand up.  Thought I was
condemned by both sides; I had to try had to build the briges between
the two nations.After the books came out in 1989 , I established a
nonprofit organization to develop a dialog between Vietnam and American.
It's now the 10 year anniversary that Vn and US have had relations.

I think that when countries have a war, it's like a husband and
wife.  It's often the children who bring them back together.  But the
parents have to be humble to make love and support each other again.
That is what needs to be done in many countries around the world.


AN: I agree; I think reconciliation is the first step toward justice.

I norder to reconcile with a country or former enemy, you must be
honest and truthful about he crimes you have committed.  You must
list each thing you did; each village that was destroyed; each person
that was killed.  Each person deserves  reconciliation; no matter the
cost; the freedom and peace and trust is worth the price.

As an American Marine; I worked for the government.  I did their work,
and I do not trust the government.  But I do trust the people of the
world.  It's imperitave that the American citizens insit the
government gives full compensation to everytone who has been hurt in
prior wars.

So we have to realize our governments do a lot of communicateing, and
we must do a lot of communicating.  I had a young student ask me how I
could play with Vietnam chilfren when they were my enemies.

But I had learnt at that point the Vietnamese people were not my enemies.
The US government awas my enemy to brainwash me and send me wehre I
did not belong; I have felt more frienship with the Vietnamese where there
is no racism.

So it's very important that the citizens of Japan be the voices of
the comfort women.  It is the Aerican's duty to raise our voices to
speak for those were were hurt my agent orang enad insist eht
government pays for its wroings.



LL: The US fought in Vietnam between Christian and Buddhist.  Now US is
fighting in Iraq between Christian and Muslim.  Why  not step in
earlier this time to stop the Americans fighting in Iraq before
2,000,000 Iraqi are killed.


What's going on in Iraq now is the same as in Vietnam in 1960.  I think the
US people see the history repeating itself.  due to the Us.  It could
happen here in Japan; someone like Bush can do a lot of damage.  It's
been 30 years since the Vietnam war ended, but it is still not over;
people are killed by mines and agent orange even to this day.
Question from audience.  Having listened to your story; I realize the
tragedy.  Japan actually made money from the war; it hursts my
heart.  What do Vietnam people think of Japanese people

What was Japans role in Vietnam war.

In WW2, Japan invaded SE Asian counties, so sme people feel the anti
Japese education has been propogated in Asia; is there any anti US US
education?

Le Ly's family is Buddist, so you are educated about Buddism, so Mr
Nelson,   what do you Nelson think about religion I'm concerned about
the future, specifically Article Nine, when you were in Vietnam, you were leading an
idea of communism; it's not Article Nine, but we are losing Japanese culture.
Why can't a women be emporer, but I am concerned about changing the
constitution; what can we do to resist the govt short of rebelling:
how do we keep Article Nine.

LL: Vietnamese think Japanese  were very cruel to them, but there is no feeling
past that.

LL China had tried to invade Vietnam for 1000 years. France for 100
years.  the Us as just another war.  We were poor, but we kne we
loved our motherland.  We could not protest except via non violence.

AN: I think religion plays a big part and is being manipulated by the
media and George Bush.  In the US now we have Right Wing Christians
who support GWB's policies.  This is not different than Muslims who
believe the same thing.  In many ways both of our religions have been
stolen from us by right wing fanatics.


So if we research very carefully we se Islam and d Christianity are
religions of peace.  It's important that we take back our religions
from these fanatics.

This is one of the reasons I consider myself a Chritian Muslim
Buddihst.

the reality is that there is no difference bwetween GWB, Hussein and
Bin Laden; they all believe in war.

We can't wait until a milion peple are killed.  Not only as A' and
J's; we have to take a stand as people in the orld.  We must put war
in the museums where it belongs.

As I travel around as the Christian, I know the procedures to pray
properly in mosques and temples.  God is everywhere, no matter what
the religion.

We must stand up now to save the lives of Iraqi and Afghan people.  We
must send a message to our govt that we will not support war anymore.

How can we protect Article Nine?

I thought if man can send a man to the moon, why can't we solve the
problems on earth?  We people have the right to accept or reject govt
policy.  If we citizens should demand change.  We do not have freedom
and a well educated system in Vietnam.  In Japan, you are well educated and
are able to stand up for what is right for your people.

AN: I think it's going to be hard work for Japanese people .  I think Japanese
peple must start educating their friends and neighbors; you need a
national movement to sent a message to the Diet.  It's not just Article Nine
for you; it is for everyone on the planet.  It is futureistic and we
need to do away with war and violence..
