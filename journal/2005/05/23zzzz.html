<p>Wrote a postcard to janette, after buying all 9 cards that were
available at the store.  Just transcribed all that I recorded today.
Soon after I talked to Kanae, Petra asked me if things were all good
and I told her about my choice to not talk to cool people so that I
don't have to be all stinky.  She supported me and offered to be a
listening ear whenever I like.</p>

<p>Got some good work done on my Curriculum for the first couple
days.</p>

<p>Also met Koki, Tama and Janus (nicknamed after tennis racket
brand) by the daily updated map.</p>
