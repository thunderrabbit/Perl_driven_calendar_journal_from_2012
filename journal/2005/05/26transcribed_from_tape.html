<p>(We get to set our clocks back again tonight!)</p>

<p class=date>8:58am CST Thursday 26 May 2005 (Hong Kong Day)</p>

<p>We're in Hong Kong!  It was really weird to look outside and see...</p>

<p>A Building! outside the ship and not like water and waves and
nothing.  And we ain't movin'.. it's like "hey man, why are we
stopped?"  Oh, I remember - "we're in Hong Kong!"</p>

<p>So that's kinda weird, but..</p>

<p>Went outside and I was like "I'm in Hong Kong!" and I was thinkin'
to myself, "hey the shops are closed; it's a holiday.  I should write
that down."  Then I'm like, "I can record it!" but, I didn't have my
recorder, so I had to go back and get it, and for some strange reason
I had to actually pause and think, "okay, get back on the boat;
you'll be really upset if you don't go get it."</p>

<p>So now, I can walk through this hallway and be like, "hey the
shops are closed!"</p>

<p>I was even smart enough to bring an extra tape, though I wasn't
smart enough to bring an extra battery.  But, we're in Hong Kong!  Can
buy new batteries.  Changed US$20 to HK$150 and they say an internet
cafe is about HK$20, and I'm like "that's enough for me"</p>

<p>I'm gonna take Star Ferry to get outta here.  I found Shawn; we're
trying to escape this shopping mall.  We're docked right next to a
huge shopping mall.  I'm lost; Shawn is lost; both sides of this
hallway are filled with kids' toys.. 5, 6, 7, 9, 5000 kids clothes and
toy stores, and I'm like, "c'mon jack; there's adults here too," but
everything is closed so it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>There are benches shaped like giant fish with no faces on the
ground; everything is clean and white, and here is an information
desk.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I switched into shorts and not pants because it's not raining,
just overcast, and it's definitely not cold.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Shawn and I are on the ferry and it's rockin' and we're rockin'
like rock stars....  I said something funny in front of Shawn, which
is good; I'm trying to catch up with him.  Shawn took a picture of me
and Colleen's rabbit in Hong Kong.</p>

<p class=date>9:25am</p>

<p>We're in Hong Kong, and we're not off the ferry yet, but I'm out
of video tape; d'oh!</p>

<p>It's 3 dollars to send a postcard from Hong Kong.  And I'm mean 3
HK dollars.  I don't know the exchange rate.  I've decided I don't
care about exchange rates.</p>

<p class=date>9:57am</p>

<p>The sign that says "ESCALATOR LINK ALLEY" is fully as tall as I
am.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I think I've found the 800 meter escalator, but, if it is this,
then it's more of a moving sidewalk than an escalator, so I won't be
*as* impressed, but it will still be alright.</p>

<p>It keeps on going.... no it stops!  That's not 800 meters!  Piece
of crap.  Ah well; whateva.</p>

<p class=date>10:19am</p>

<p>I just made it to the top of the escalators, but it's not one big
escalator.  Certainly 800 meters long; it's an 800 meter *set* of
escalators, but it's not one escalator by any stretch.</p>

<p class=date>11:11am</p>

<p>Kinda frustrating; I walked up and down the escalators, came down
to the shopping arcade and bought a thing and a drink for HK$50
(fifty dollars!  haha) but I couldn't get online there.</p>

<p class=date>12:06pm</p>

<p>I'm in a Starbucks now.  I tried another coffee shop, but they had
the same ISP as the first one, so I fired them, and went to Starbucks.
Starbucks had the same ISP as both of them, so I sought something
else.</p>

<p class=date>12:58pm</p>

<p>Got wireless access for free at a computer store in Hong Kong.
My journal entries are uploaded.  I was checking a bit of Gmail, but
then my battery died; I took that as a sign that I was done.</p>

<p>I found some royalty free images (30+ gigs) for several HK$, (like
1400) and I was like "wow" but didn't buy any since my budget had
started at HK$150.  Thought about telling Matt so he could buy it for
GET materials.</p>

<p class=date>1:00pm</p>

<p>If this is the 27th, this must be Hong Kong.  I just bought some
Star Wars branded M&amp;M's with "I sense much hunger in you" and
"Luke, I am your peanut."</p>

<p class=date>3:17pm</p>

<p>I just paid HK$10 to get these two photos of me pulling a rickshaw
with no one in it.</p>

<p class=date>4:30pm</p>

<p>I just spent HK$23 on Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough
ice cream cone.  It was supposed to be HK$25, but the girl gave it to
me even so.  I wonder if she didn't rang it up.  Good for her.</p>

<p class=date>7:12pm</p>

<p>Just ate dinner in the Topaz Room.  I have to be on the boat in 1
hour and 15 minutes.  Until that time I can be off the boat, or on
the boat.</p>

<p>I can't tell if my plants are growing, but now I've been to Hong
Kong..  I know the shape of .. kindof the shape of Kowloon, and the
shape of Hong Kong island..  basically a lump and an oval, but it's a
start....  Before today I didn't know shit about shit.  Now I know poo
about kaka.</p>

<p>Right now I'm laying on Shawn's bed but he's not here so he
doesn't know.  It's a secret!</p>
