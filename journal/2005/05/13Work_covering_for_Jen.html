<p>First lesson today was pretty good.  I had a more extendable lesson
that focused on one topic: animals.  Starting with vocabulary of dog
and cat and asking do you have a dog / do you have a cat, then
expanding to "pet" and do you want a pet?

<p>Then when it was fill in the remaining time, I did a fill in the
blank of animals and body parts, starting with a tail that I forgot to
draw on the horse.</p>

<p>Second lesson was even better than the first.  The students were
fewer and more responsive as a whole.  Plus, not many of them stalled
due to lack of paying attention.</p>

<p>Last lesson was the best ever.  This is the class that last time
was so inattentive that I resorted to paying money at the very end to
the one student who could prove she had been listening.  This time,
however, I was running out of material at the end because they were so
attentive so I figure out a game.  I thought of an animal.  Taught
them the grammar "does it have ______?"  and they tried to guess what
it had and didn't have and I told them yes or no until they guessed.
Fish and Giraffe.</p>
