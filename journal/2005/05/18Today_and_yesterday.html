<p>Yesterday I researched Port Said some, and got stuck when I
couldn't find a map of the city.  Anywhere.  I looked for five hours,
and I'm not the least knowledgeable internet user that I know.  After
I translated "Port Said map" to Arabic and searched using variants of
the resulting symbols, but still found nothing, I knew it was time to
stop.</p>

<p>Today I put together some <a
href="/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date=2005/07/28#About_Panama_Canal">information</a>
on the Panama Canal, Cristobal and Balboa.  We may dock at Cristobal
or Balboa (or neither), depending on traffic.  I don't care if we
don't stop there; all accounts say going through the canal is the most
interesting.</p>

<p>Jen searched for a Port Said map for me today.  She searched for
about five minutes before determining it was impossible.</p>

<p>Also today I bought rechargeable batteries AAA and AA (four each)
and looked for voice recorders, but they had none at PC Depot.</p>

<p>Exchanged money into US dollars: 66,??? yen =&gt; US$600 in
smallish bills.  Automatic machine to do it.  Pretty cool system,
though I think a tad expensive.</p>

<p>Sold a carton of soy milk to Shoko (who went with me yesterday to
show me where to buy them for 100 yen; I bought two) after I haven't
used either of mine, with only 18 hours to go in this house.  She said
the price went up at the grocery today, but I gave her the discount
price.</p>

<p>Shoko wrote to Yahoo!BB to tell them cats to cancel my bank drafts.
She thinks it will be a pain in the arse, but we'll see what
happens.</p>

<p>Now it's time to clean my room.  I took my two suits (expensive
one I bought in LA, and the one Tim Harrington gave me when he left
Tsunashima) to the cleaners with the intention that they will stay
there safely for 3 months.  I hope it works.  I didn't tell the guy
cause I thought it would be too much trouble to explain.</p>

<p>Gave my hard shiny black shoes (that I bought in LA) to Mark, cause
they don't fit me and it would be a shame to toss expensive shoes.
They fit him perfectly.</p>

<p>Got a box from the courier place on the corner (the one with my
favorite logo in Japan: mama cat carrying kitten) to put the last of
my junk in.</p>

<p>okay go go go</p>

<p class=date>7:00pm</p>

<p>Making some progress.  I showered, then washed and packed all my
toiletries.  For tonight / tomorrow night, and then for on the boat.
Put the Hong Kong 2 dollar coin in my wallet that Daniel (Edwards)
gave me.  I'm goin' to Hong Kong so I'll be able to spend it!</p>

<p class=date>9:22pm</p>

<p>Hitomi arrived.  She's not being talkative.</p>

<p class=date>10:29pm JST Wednesday 18 May 2005</p>

<p>Just took an hour break to make Roboyaki.  Hitomi came down to help
and she started talking.  Matteo bought me three bottle of various
sports drinks cause he didn't know which is my favorite!  Ikumi
brought me three things of chocolate, milk pudding, and some chips!
Whoooo!</p>

<p>I'm going to pack for 30 minutes then go down and chat.</p>

<p class=date>11:49pm</p>

<p>Progress is good.  Clothes are in the dryer.  Ikumi offered to keep
my skates, helmet and pads.  (Where are my (huge) Pro Designed knee
pads?)  The box that Elvis offered to keep is basically done.
Suitcase that Jimmy loaned me is basically done.  Just gotta toss
trash-boxes and bags into the hall where hopefully Aaron can use
them.</p>
