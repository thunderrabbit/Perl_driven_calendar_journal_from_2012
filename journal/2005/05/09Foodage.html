<p>Headed home now.  I wrote to Hitomi that I'm super hungry, but then
revised that; my stomach is feeling.... tight maybe.  Poopy maybe.  I
dunno how much that is from what Chris said, vs what would have
happened otherwise.</p>

<p>I requested vegetables for dinner.</p>

<p>Hitomi and Shoko have been tanning today.  I imagine she means Cute
Shoko (as opposed to Wrestleable Shoko).</p>

<p>Tonight I'll likely finish my Rob Update Mailer enough that I'll
send a real live Rob Update to all my peeps.  I'm really happy with
it; it will archive the email, allow opt-outs in Japanese and
English, and archive it in my journal.  Money.</p>
