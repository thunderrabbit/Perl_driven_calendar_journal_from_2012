<p>Today has been pretty relaxed; I spent a lot of time watching
water; the waes are quite gentle todday, though the ship as a whole
is rocking.  I wrote six postcards to 7 people, and  we had a couple
of meetings for GET and the Hong Kong orientation.</p>

<p>Oh! We had four interviews today; which laste only an hour total,
but were the culmination of a lot of effort to coordinate all the
questions and how we would score/rate the responses.  We basically
are doing the tricky task of quantifying peoples' language ability,
which spans a huge range of aspects and personalities and the like.</p>

<p>Anyway, we think we have a pretty workable model.</p>

<p>I got the Bulgarian sisters mixed up today.  I thought Slavena had
taught me how to say good morning, but it was Kremena.  I think I can
tell them apart now, but I'm not sure.  I'd definitely like to get a
picture with them each/both.</p>

<p>Oh, so anyway, I saw Kremena and she was like "do you remember?"
and I'm like "rember what?" thinking I hadn't even seen her today.</p>
