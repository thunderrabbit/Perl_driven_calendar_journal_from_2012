<p>So far today it's been pretty busy, but the beginning inital crazy
week is nearly over.  Maybe it is over, if one counts the rest of the
day as not crazy.  We had the GET Open House, where we divided the
students into what will likely be their classes, and showed them
around the ship a bit.  I felt a bit childish as I didn't have the
instructions given to each leader so I ended up following Greg, and
not being my own little group.  I heard that we were going to be in
one big group but we were also going to be in little subgroups.  The
good things I did were lead good group games (thanks to YRUU and _New
Games For The Whole Family_ book) and get back to the room on
time.</p>

<p>After that we scoped our class rosters and shuffled a couple
students around according to who seemed to fit better in other places,
とか いろいろ, and that was a pretty easy process.  I flipped a coin
because I trust the universe to choose better classes than I could
(basically split 10 people who I've only vaguely met into 2 groups),
though I gave myself veto rights.  I have class Q and class R, and on
our first class day I plan to have us make up team/class names and
play lots of name games.  I'd like to help our classes bond tightly
together.  Similar to my men's group, but I'm open to it being less
intense.</p>

<p>Right now I've got iPhoto open in the background, and would like to
integrate photos in with my journal entries, and have a program in
mind to help write the HTML code for that, but I'm resisting and going
to work on my first two class lesson plans.</p>

<p class=note>(pm JST Wednesday 28 September 2005: and I didn't
actually start that process until today.)</p>
