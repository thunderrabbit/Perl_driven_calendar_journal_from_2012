<p>Headed back to the apartment.  Elvis called me; I had forgotten to
leave him my apartment key.  Further, he pointed out that I had left
some crap that would not likely be useful to anyone.  The four
knotboards that I tried to sell on Yahoo Auction.  They didn't sell.
Now I gotta eaither pay to get rid of them or illicitly discard them
somewhere... It would be a shame to just toss them.  I could
conceivably bring them to Pb in a taxi; they are nautically
inclined, but I dunno if they could be sold or useful or what.</p>

<p>I sorta think they could be used.  If I can reach Audrey, I'll ask
her what she thinks.</p>

<p>Okay; I called Ikumi; she will hold the two bigger knotboards.  I
will carry the other two to the boat tonight.</p>

<p>Gotta go talk to Elvis now, and then I'm meeting Hitomi near the
boat to take some of my stuff on that she bought for me recently.
CDs and such.  Aight, peace out!</p>
