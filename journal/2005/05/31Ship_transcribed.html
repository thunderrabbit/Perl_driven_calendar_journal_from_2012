<p class=date>8:20am ICT day after Vietnam</p>

<p>This is the second time I've set my clock 12 hours off; I should
have set it to 23, but I set it to 11.  D'oh!</p>

<p class=date>12:01pm</p>

<p>Just finished the GET Open House, which went pretty well, planned
so fabulously by Kim, Angie, and Kris.  I was realllllly impressed
with how well Kim MCed it, and super suprised at how suprised Kim was
that I thought she was so awesome!  Dude - she was *money*.  Not using
too advanced English, not patronizing, super genki, super awesome!!
She was like, "really?  really?"  as I told her how impressed I
was...  She was great!</p>

<p>I kinda shot myself in the proverbial foot by not having my own
copy of the directions for what we were supposed to do in the
different stations, so I ended up following Greg's group around.  I
felt a bit embarassed, but I've released it.</p>

<p>Next = lunch.</p>

<p class=date>1:20am SGT Tuesday 31 May 2005</p>

<p>We lost an hour this night/morning.  20 minutes ago it went from
midnight to 1am.  I was like, "ah shit; I forgot!"  People are still
partying up in the Sports Bar, and I'm done.</p>

<p>At the dance, lots of ROB's Crazy Dance was done, filmed,
photographed, taught...  I am really happy to say Ikuko was shy at
first, but after I taught her the seaweed dance, she blossomed.</p>

<p>Audrey put a sticker on my chest: "I AM VERY CRAZY!!"</p>

<p>Near the end of the night, I felt myself being more flirtatious
with the girls, especially Kanae.. tall, serene, nice.... I could tell
I was too tired for my own good when I was like, "smoking's not such a
bad thing...."</p>

<p class=date>2:07pm SGT Tuesday 31 May 2005</p>

<p>We will arrive in Singapore tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today I spent a long time on my lesson plan; trying to get the shit
sorted out: I'd like a way to have the time/date for each of my
classes so they know when pages were received, but it's making it a
real headache to maintain 2 copies of each for each class.</p>

<p>About to go jump in the pool cause a coin toss between pool time
and lesson preparation time said "pool time"</p>


<p class=date>7:15pm SGT Tuesday 31 May 2005</p>

<p>Just met Kayo, who has little shaker ball things as musical
instruments from Africa.  I tried it out and was vaguely able to do it
but not for an extended period of time.  Then I met a woman named Rie
who has the same name as my first Japanase friend, who was named
Rie.</p>

<p>She was too embarassed to play trumpet in front of people, so I was
like, "just play poorly and they'll leave, then you can play well."
She laughed.  I left so as not to be one of the people in front of
which she didn't want to play.</p>

<p class=date>1:25am SGT Wednesday 01 June 2005</p>

<p>There's still music going on upstairs at the rave on the top top
top deck.  Super big dancing last night and big dancing at the
beginning of this night.  Then lay down on tatami to watch the stars.
They're beautiful, but not the best I've seen (my dad's house in
winter was better (and colder)).</p>

<p>The rave was going on and then the power went ______ flat, and then
we spent a few minutes in quiet, during which time I talked to a woman
who tried to karate me, but I was able to block most of her stuff,
plus she is really little.  Crap I can't think of her name.  She's
from Nagoya I think - May Taho, but I think that was another woman who
came up to me.  Taho, if I understand correctly, is in one of my GET
classes (which haven't started yet).</p>

<p>I told Nicole how stars create heavy atoms and how we are all made
of starstuff and I told her about black holes and neutron stars.</p>

<p>I met Hitomi's friend Enty, but her real name is Yuko or something,
but Enty is her nickname.</p>

<p>Walked to the front of the boat where several people were checking
out the stars.  Kim showed me the Southern Cross and Vega and other
things, like the crown of something, and it was neat.</p>

<p>I can feel myself, not falling for Kim, but I like her.  She's just
a tall pretty girl who's nice and it's nice.</p>

<p class=date>10:17am SGT Wednesday 01 June 2005</p>

<p>I'm now caught up with my transcriptions.  Two tapes down.  15 or
so Ports to go.</p>
