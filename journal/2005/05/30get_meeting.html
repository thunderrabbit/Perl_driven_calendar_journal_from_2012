<p>GET meeting was not the best fun ever.  I lost a contact in the
pool and figured I could get along fine with just one eyeball able to
see clearly.  I basically did, and I'm basically just being down on
myself right now, but I have a fear that I'm not "keeping up with" all
the details given out in the meetings.  My mind locks onto one thing
or gets sidetracked and because Audrey is super genki she talks
reallllly fast and when my brain comes back 30 seconds later,
important details have flown by.</p>

<p>I'm going to try something: get an extra copy of the meeting agenda
(one copy is printed just before each meeting) and see if that helps.
I can imagine that I won't keep that up indefinitely; maybe I can
bring up that I learn better visually.</p>

<p>After the GET meeting, Matt inquired about me having a GET binder,
which turns out are only for the students.  I thought it would be good
for me to have a copy of what the students have, especially given that
we will be creating a custom curriculum for each class.</p>

<p>It's not a huge big deal; I just need to use the binder I brought
or get another one and start a new filing system.</p>

<p>I'm good at making filing systems.</p>

<p>I'm feeling myself need a bit of alone time, which is a bit tricky
to get on a crowded cruise ship.</p>

<p>A good thing is that we are just about over the craziness; there is
one more party tonight and then we'll be more into a stable
schedule.</p>
