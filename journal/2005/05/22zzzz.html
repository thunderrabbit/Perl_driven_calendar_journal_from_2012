<p>Last night I didn't really go into the party; it was too crowded
and smokey.  I definitely feel myself attracted to Kanae.  Eek.
Don't need any of that business on the ship.</p>

<p>Talked to Mariko for a while in the GET Office.  I've noticed
something: the previously-voyaged GET Teachers use that office as the
office, and we are in a transition to use the downstairs area as an
office.  Kinda; at least it's in my mind that we are better off moving
everything downstairs, but there's a pretty decent library in the 6th
floor GET Office and the 5th floor "new office" is still a classroom,
cause there's simply no more space to move passengers off that
floor.</p>

<p>I'm amazed to hear that Mariko isn't native English speaker.  She
speaks perfectly as far as I'm concerned, but when she speaks
Japanese, she speaks far more quickly.</p>
