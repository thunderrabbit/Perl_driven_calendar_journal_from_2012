<p class=date>2pm Sunday 22 May 2005</p>

<p>We're in Kobe, going to show our boarding card to the staff; some
kinda visa thing.  I just looked up on my bed, and my stuff
is <em>folded</em>; janette's quilt is <em>folded</em>; my jammie
jams (that Gail sent me) are <em>folded</em>.  I'm like, "<b>I</b>
didn't fold them! hahahahahahaahahhaa oh man."</p>

<p class=date>2:09pm</p>

<p>We're going to be interviewed here in the customs area of Kobe.
Shawn thinks someone is angry about something, but I don't know</p>

<p class=note>What are you doing?</p>

<p>It's my journal.  ("Shhhh!  Don't write on the page!")</p>

<p class=note>Dammit!</p>

<p class=note>HI Rob!</p>

<p>Maryann, stoppit; you're writing all over the journal; quit!</p>

<p class=note>It'sa pretty smart idea.</p>

<p>Thanks!  But then I have to transcribe it all and it takes a fuckin'
long time.</p>

<p class=note>Are you going to transcribe this part?</p>

<p>Yea-maybe.</p>

<p class=note>What if I start talking really fast and then you can't
transcribe it all and then that's going to drive you nuts and then ahhhhh.</p>

<p>So I'll wait for five minutes while I transcribe all that.  So
we're in the immigrationg area and there's some kind of confusion, but
we're going to get interviewed(?) and then get back on the boat.  wow.
I'm glad I'm not in charge of this shit.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Crap.  I'm falling asleep as I try to transcribe.  It should be
easy, but it's not.  I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>They just took my gaijin card!  I've had that card for two years,
and since my visa will expire when I'm away, they asked for my card.
No explanation, no warning, just bang.  No more card.  Good thing
I've already sent my first one to janette (when I lost my wallet back
in 2003).</p>

<p>So I'm like, "byebye gaijin card.."</p>

<p>When I get back, I'll be just a visitor, not a worker bee.</p>

<p class=date>4:15pm</p>

<p>We've just loaded the passengers; there were lots more boxes this
time, as if they didn't presend their luggage.  I'm about to take a
shower and get suited up.</p>

<p class=date>4:26pm</p>

<p>I've just taken a shower; from now the plan is to leave Kobe at 5,
and I <em>hope</em> to remember to check my GPS and see how close to
Kobe I intered the coordinates, which will give me a clue as to if
the others are correct.</p>

<p>So now I will be giving champagne to the passengers and say "カンパ
イまで小尾待って下さいませ" which means "don't drink the shit up, dawg
until we say ... cheers" (but in Japanese they say cheers)</p>

<p>Then after that I'm sure we'll have another two meetings to be
presented to the passengers.  On the way in today I met Chiomi and
Shun.  That's all the names I remember; not very good, but oh
well.</p>

<p class=date>4:45pm</p>

<p>Grabbing my phone to let a guy call his family.</p>

<p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p>My coordinates were 1.5 km from where we parked.</p>

<p>I let Sandy use my phone; it was cool to let him be able to do that.</p>

<p>I watched the tug boat pull us sideways; like it was pulling one
end of the boat 90 degrees from the direction it normally goes, and it
was pulling this giant rope taut out of the water, like a fucking
heavy rope, probably six inches in diameter; huge.  Pulled it tight
out of the water.  Amazing.</p>

<p>People are coming downstairs now.</p>

<p class=date>5:50pm</p>

<p>I'm on the back of the boat; I called Jen and Jesse and talked to
them a little bit.  Couldn't call Rich, but I emailed his ketai; I
don't have his phone number.  I'm looking at the back:</p>

<p>My other favorite thing about the boat is watching water boil up
behind the boat; I think as the propellers are turning , they are
pushing water (back and) radially, I guess in all directions, so I
don't really know how to explain it, but there are definite lumps of
water that roil upward in one specific spot (relative to the boat) I
don't really know how to explain what would be the physics behind it;
a video would be good.</p>

<p>We saw a container ship across the way and Greg said "hey look at
that" and I looked for a while and then was like, "hey!  That's my
grandmothers's ship!  She shouldn't be here now; she's behind
schedule!"  ahahah good joke.  Gotta go to meeting at 6:00; bye.</p>

<p class=date>7:48pm</p>

<p>We just had our meeting and then I copied some things for Audrey
and then wrote my ideas for a network system for our little group
working on computer stuff.</p>
