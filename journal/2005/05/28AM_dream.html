<p class=dream>When I was a new freshman at Rice University, my
washing machine wasn't working.  I put in my clothes and my quarters
and water ran for a bit but then it stopped before it filled.  I
loaded the washing machine onto the elevator, took it to the
maintenence office in the next building, which was attached to this
building and just labeled inside the hallway which building was which.
Old but working lights and equipment showed the way and the sign
indicated which building.  The maintenence office was right next to
the corner of the building and the elevator door on the opposite side
of the elevator opend and I rolled the washing machine out to the
office.  I was like, "excuse me sir?" and I heard a woman's voice,
"Oh, I'm sorry ma'am?  My washing machine has broken, and I brought it
down here.  I had put the clothes in and the money and water began to
run"</p>

<p class=dream>"Did you have it plugged in?" she interruptedme.  "Did
you put money in it?"</p>

<p class=dream>"Yes, I just said that.." and I could tell she wasn't
listening.  I confronted her on it and we escalated to a fight pretty
quickly.  "I know you don't care about me just because I'm a freshmen
and I'm new around here and I know you want to tell me to fuck off..."
I told her in a basically normal voice.</p>

<p class=dream>"Good; yes I do"</p>

<p class=dream>I got pissed.  "You better fuckin' write that down that
you want me to fuck off; you don't say 'good', you fucking bitch; this
is your fucking job and just because you have all the control doesn't
make it appropriate for you to just piss all over your customers!"</p>

<p class=dream>She ignored me and walked away then turned around and
mouthed the words, "go the fu uuck back home" and tried to make it
difficult for me to know what she said, and I was like, "I *am* home!
fuck you!  I fucking live in this town."</p>

<p class=dream>Her friend came up to me and was like, "you better
leave" and I was like, "aight" and I got my stuff out of the washer
and was like "you can keep the fucking washing machine; fuck you!"</p>

<p class=dream>I got all my stuff and then her friend came up and I
was about to head out when the maintenence guys came to look at the
machine.  To the woman with whom I had been fighting I was like, "you
called them?" and she goes, "yes" and I hugged her like 'thank you so
much!' and added 'You know, I am older than you' and she was like,
"yeah; I looked it up while we were fighting."</p>

<p class=dream>and we embraced and hugged and even kissed on the
cheeks a bit with promises to make up more later.</p>

<p class=dream>I began to tell the maintenance guys the story of what
I had done and they were listening (no hangups about freshmen; just
doing their job) and I woke up.</p>
