<p class=dream>I was complaining about the US government to some guys,
including Seth from Gaba and the US President came up to hear our
concerns, and to play chess with Seth (except it was a card game),
which they did weekly.  For a moment I was like, "hey nice to meet
you," but then quickly began telling him how I perceived his foreign
policy as designed to make money for all his homeboys, and not good
for the world at large.</p>

<p class=dream>A news story interrupted my soliloquy, but much to my
surprise, the President was still there and willing to listen after
the news story was over.  He was writing a response to me, which I
thought was really cool, but then I saw he was just pointing me to
websites that had already been written.  He encouraged me to read them
and then contact him again if I had any questions.</p>
