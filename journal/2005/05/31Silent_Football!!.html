<p>We just played Silent Football during dinner!!  This is the first
real game that I've played on PB, and the first real game I've
played since Jennifer, Olivia, Lubo(?) and I played by ghetto river in
Tsunashima!!  Everyone enjoyed the game and even Maryann, who didn't
want to play at first, joined the fun!  So so so awesome!!</p>
