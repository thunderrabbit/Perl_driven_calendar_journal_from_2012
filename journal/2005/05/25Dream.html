<p class=dream>A woman was trying to clean a record that was quie
covered in dus.  she was brushing it radially, and I explained to her
that she should clean it with non-radial strokes; she should follow
along the grroves as we were taught in KTRU  The woman was pouring
window cleaner on the record, and I was like, "don't get it wet"
although I knew it would be okay if she dried it properly.  She
poured more window cleaner on the record to spite me.</p>

<p class=dream>I walked awayand went over to Joel and Brandt, maybe to
tell them what happened.  They were like, "oh; okay; we wil take care
of it."</p>

<p class=dream>Then I was walking through a field and a guy came up to
me, "hey Rob I'd like to ask you something" and he took me toward a
secluded area and I was like, "hthis isn't a question; he's about to
yell at me" and he said I was in trouble for hitting two people and I
was like, "Stop right there, or I'll give you a bloody nose" and he ran
away and I chased hin until I caught thhim and was like, "you have
been lying to me or you have been given false information."</p>

<p class=dream>And he eventually came to acept he was given false
information.  We were okay again and about to walk back when I
realized I had left my camera in its case in the huge grassy field, so
I went out to get it.  While I was walking, a woman came up to me and
she was all, "can I carry your camera?" and I was like, "no way; first
you have to prove you are on my sie. What is something that only a
good team eprson would know?"  and the girl behind her, who was part
of PB, like one of the passengers, was whispering answers.  I was
like, "you have already proven that you can't be trusted; don't prove
it even more."</p>
