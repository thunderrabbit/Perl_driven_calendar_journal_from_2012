<p>I've just noticed that my tape player stops recording
occassionally.  Shawn and I are about to play soccer.  I met one of
the Russian (?) girls, Kremena (Shawn says "Creamy") down in the Topaz
Dining Room, I was like, "HI, what's yer name?" and she goes "Kremena"
in her lovely accent and when I was like, "I'm Rob," she goes, "I
know."</p>

<p>I'm like, "wha? how do you know?"</p>

<p>"I know what I want to know."</p>

<p>Oh shit!  She's a russian spy!  So, Kremena knows my name
already.</p>

<p>I'm going to go get in the pool; I have to be in my
suit/tie/jacket at 10:45.</p>

<p class=date>10:31am</p>

<p>I've done it; I'm wearing my suit.  I've even taken a shower.  I
am dressed to the tens.</p>

<p class=date>10:53am</p>

<p>Things are getting a bit more hectic.  We're about to be
introduced to the Kobe passengers.</p>

<p class=date>11:45am</p>

<p>Complete chaos as we're practicing this "Don't Worry; GET Happy"
song to the tune of "Don't Worry; Be Happy" There are like five
leaders of the group; it's craziness.  We're practicing in the club
called Sunshine Bar, which overlooks the pool(s).</p>

<p class=date>1:06pm</p>

<p>Just listened to Alan Nelson speak on Alternativess to Violence
Workshop.  The good thing is that I've heard most of that stuff from
my Mens' group.</p>

<p class=date>1:18am</p>

<p>I thought people were behind me, but jacket </p>

<p>Oops; I'm getting tired; that sentence makes no sense.</p>

<p class=date>2:02pm</p>

<p>Anette Cox gave me a couple books I should read.  _Democracy Now_
and something else.</p>

<p class=date>3:45am</p>

<p>Just had our life preserver wearing party, including getting to
see what the t</p>

<p class=date>3:50pm</p>

<p>I'm feeling fearful that I'm not going to be aware of what's going
on around the boat.  Petra, Greg and ____ have met; I have a fear
that I don't know what's going on.  I'm like "what should I do?"
which is all tied in with issues about what I should do for myself;
knowing where to look.</p>

<p>Kristen (not here) said "I'm looking forward to you making a
decision for yourself."  She was so mad when she got my email looking
for advice.  She wants me too look inside myself and I'm like "fuck
you" but I see that she is onto something.</p>

<p class=date>6:45pm</p>

<p>I just met Mariko (with braces and a tiara) and Keiko and Mimo
(all from Chiba and 23, 24, and 18 years old, respectively).  Mariko
is cute, but it's just the braces.</p>

<p class=date>7:?pm</p>

<p>Because I don't want to be in the smokey Hemmingway Lounge, I am
choosing to miss out on some conversation with fun people.  and cute
girls.</p>

<p>Kanae recovered my pen after I dropped it.</p>
