<p>This is the second time I've heard a history of PB.  First
was Stacy's history; he told us we should listen to the story 20 times
on this voyage.</p>

<p>These are notes on the 22 year history of PB, as spoken in
Japanese by Tetsu (director of this voyage) and ____ (director of
previous voyage (or few)) and realtime translated to English by Joel,
and sentences type using notes written by me during the lecture.</p>

<p>In 1983 there was a Korean airline explosion.  People thought
Korea was the heart of communism.</p>

<p>Textbooks in Japan ignored atrocities done by Japan in wars.</p>

<p>People mostly wanted to see the world.</p>

<p>PB took 300 people to Guam and Saipan.  They advertised
themselves as the New Generation of people.</p>

<p>1st through 9th cruiss were around Asia only, looking at past
wars.</p>

<p>In 1990 was the first world cruise.  In 1983 there were lots of
Peacenicks ; the feel of PB was different due to different world
circumstances.</p>

<p>International Exchange means different things.  I think it'swhen
people make an effort to understand ecother; this changes perceptions.</p>

<p>PB wants to encourage peoples' awareness of other countries.
Friendship sis easy enough, but creating something meaningful
requires moe depth of knowledge; knowing more about a country helps
that connection, thatfore hlpes creation.</p>

<p>We can't just eact the weets then leave; that's notexchange.</p>

<p>When the leader of PB found out that Etreria, a new country with
independence from Ethiopia couldn't afford to sed its atheletes to
the Olympics, he helped raise money for them.</p>

<p>There were big challenges to get past IOC constitution.</p>

<p>Winner of the Etreetrian (sp) bike race (qualifying race) ate shit
at the very very end of the race after winning the race he hit his
brakes and went up on front wheel like whoooo then splat attack.
Holy shit I was like, "oh God" out loud when I saw the footage.  Huge
life change in 1 second.  Nightmare.  I suspect it was a shitty bike
with brakes that locked up; they were all amazed later when they saw
the lightweight bikes PB donated.</p>

<p>In the 1990s there was one world cruise per year.</p>

<p>Pb created a daily newspaper for peple in Kobe after the
Kansai earthquake; they asked what people needed to know: where to
get food; where to get water; where to get clean.  It's important to
ask what people need, cause we can volunteer what they don't want and
it's not effective.  We go to the countries to try to understand what
will be helpful for people.</p>

<p>On this voyage, we have _______ and _______ from Iraq; they risked
their lives to come and talk to us.  Anything that draws attention to
them risks their lives</p>

<p>Alan Nelson is a Vietnam war veteran who felt terrible about what
he had done in the war, and spent years preaching people to people.
This is his first trip back to Vietnam since the war ended.</p>
