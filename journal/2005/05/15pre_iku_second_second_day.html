<p>The second day was less intense than yesterday.  Although it's not
"finished," we have finished all of the brain-engaging stuff.  All
that's left now is chill out for 2 hours and then have a party!!
Party participants will include anyone who is going to be on the
voyage and any of their friends.  It's a fund-raising event as
well.</p>

<p>I've appreciated the balance between lecture type stuff and
interactive game type stuff.. We even made a lecture interactive by
having everyone in the group read a little bit.  Nicole (I think) got
to read a single section name and single sentence.  Something like,
"Salary: this is an unpaid position."</p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to a new part of GET (Global English
Teaching): computers in the classrooms.  No internet access, but they
will be networked and we will be able to create ad edit teaching
materials for our lessons as needed.  I enjoy creating new structures
so that will be fun.</p>

<p>Kim, Angie and I with Hiromi (a CC) are excited about doing a two
part star gazing thing: part one is a lecture on star formation and
our solar system plus galaxies and our Milky Way (I know this stuff
and will download some materials), and then the other is actual gazing
(Kim knows Greek star mythology; she and Angie both have star
charts).</p>

<p>I'm hoping to hook up some Silent Football workshops and some Crazy
ROB Dance workshops (I've been working on my intro: "Dance is Life,
and i just dance things I do in life.  Like the shopping cart dance,
or the put on clothes dance, or the stand there dance..") and Hiromi
suggested this would be really good because lots of Japanese people
say they don't know how to dance.  I also don't know how, but I still
dance.</p>

<p>The energy is really high and people are really excited and
outgoing and happy and genki.  Awesome awesome awesome.</p>
