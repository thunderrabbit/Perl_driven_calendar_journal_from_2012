<p>I gooshed into the pool during our 45 minute break; that's one
beautiful thing about PB; everything is close.  I leave my
room (3rd floor), go up one floor to the dining room.  Go up one more
to GET (*) Street (where we have our GET classes).  Go up up to the
top and the pool is right there.  Towels are available next to the
pool.  We're on a cruise ship and I'm loving it! </p>

<p>(*) GET = Global English/Espanol Training (sorry no tilde)</p>

<p>Carissa is supposed to be here in 2 minutes so we can start our
first student.</p>
