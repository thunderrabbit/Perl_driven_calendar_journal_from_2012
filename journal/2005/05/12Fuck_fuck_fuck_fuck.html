<p>I told Hitomi that Satoko had mentioned interest in Mimi Bike,
before Satoko knew I had given Mimi Bike to Hitomi because Hitomi paid
to break her (Mimi Bike) out of jail after she (Mimi Bike) got towed.
Hitomi got mad and I was like, "don't fucking do this" and she was
like, "why are you always talking about Satoko?" and I'm like, "I'm
fucking not."  I had mentioned her name before today cause we are
going out to eat tonight, but these were rare and unrelated (?)
utterances of her name.  Plus, who fucking cares?</p>

<p>I got pissed at all of Hitomi's shit in my room plus all of my shit
in my room plus trying to talk to Hitomi about this fucked up
situation and I'm like "get all your shit out of here" and she's like,
"it's impossible" and I'm like, "well take just 1 thing out of here.
Then come back and take another thing."  And I wanted to throw the
chair through the window but instead just ripped some of its side
panel off.  My God how am I going to survive with people all around me
all the time on PB?</p>

<p>It will be like, "give me some peace and quiet you mother fuckers
boat," as I throw people off the boat.  Argh.  This is so fucked
up.</p>
