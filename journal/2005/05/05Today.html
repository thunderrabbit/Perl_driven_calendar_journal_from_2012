<p>Mostly all day yesterday and today I've been working on my Rob
Updates email thing.  It's basically finished; I just need to have it
write the updates to my journal directory as well as my Rob Updates
directory.</p>

<p>Jesse came over tonight for a bit of HSJ after chatting and playing
Marble Blast.  I may have convinced him to buy it: less than the
income from an hour of teaching English in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I didn't go out with Jade/Sam/Jen/Ikumi to Daikainyama for some
rave-like thing in a bar setting.  Jade said it was relatively cool.
Jen and Ikumi hung out with Rikiramen for a couple hours selling /
cooking ramen and being silly.  I definitely like that about Jen.  I'd
love to be so genki that I could befriend street vendors that way.  I
can be that genki, but too worried about how people might respond.</p>

<p>Traded contact info with Anthony from Kenya.  He works really
hard; I hope/trust it will benefit him generously.</p>
