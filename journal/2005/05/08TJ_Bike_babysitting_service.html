<p>Rode TJ Bike to Kellie's house today, by way of her station where
the two women helped me retrieve my hat, and by way of the bus
station, where I retrieved my hat, which, ironically, was basically on
the way from my house to her house, though I didn't go that way.  It
could have been on the way.</p>

<p>I used my GPS to get to her station and to her house.  That made
it *reallllllly* easy.</p>

<p>Kellie made foodage for us; chicken fajitas with baked corn chips
instead of non-existant-in-Japan taco shells.  I brought cheese, but
it was the wrong type.  I thought it said チェダー　チーズ but it said
チーズ & チーズ.  Damn.  It was gouda and cheddar mixed instead of
cheddar.  Silly rabbit.</p>

<p>We chowed and then I carefully archived TJ Bike on her back porch,
locking him to the thing and to himself, then putting his bags and
stuff into a big storage box and lining it was plastic and a wrapper,
then putting the lid on that, wiring a blue tarp over TJ Bike and the
storage box, then putting a box on the box and blessing him and it's
all good.</p>
