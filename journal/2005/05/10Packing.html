<p>Argh.</p>

<p>I had a box packed for Fred, that included a lot of books, but then
I wanted to go through it piece by piece and identify everything and
now I've got two boxes, each not full enough to send, but too full to
combine, plus other tapes that I can't identify completely, plus other
stuff I'm supposed to send to Frank in New York and all these projects
in my head, none of them quite important enough to do.</p>

<p>Gotta go teach some lessons in a few hours, covering for Jen.
Those few hours are going to fly by I think.  Gotta get ready now
(shave and eat).</p>
