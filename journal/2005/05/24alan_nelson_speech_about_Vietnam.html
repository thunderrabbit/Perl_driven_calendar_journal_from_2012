<p>Sitting by 時子 (ときこ (call me "Toko")) from Saitama at Alan
Nelson's lecture on the Vietnam war.  Toko's English is really good.
She asked me if I am a GOT teacher, and I'm like, "I'm a GET teacher,
but after the voyage I will be a GOT teacher."</p>

<p>I'm on the perimeter of this lecture hall; I can't really see the
video of war machinery destroying all in its path.  Nightmare.</p>

<p>"You are writing everything?" asks Toko.</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>こんにちは</p>

<p>I'd like to start the lecture this evening with a song, and the
song is Amazing Grace.  This song is dedicated to all the human
beings who have lost their lives in the Iraqi war.  And this song is
also dedicated to all the human beings who have lost their lives in
wars in Africa.  Millions of Africans have lost their lives.</p>

<p>I will do this song in African American gospel style.</p>

<p>One of the things I've done as an American, I have been travelling
around Japan since 1996, and I have often wondered why there are still
so many American military bases in Japan.  And I think mainland
Japanese think American military troops are here to protect Japanese.
But the American soldiers and the American military bases are not here
to protect Japanese people.  The American military is here to control
your government.</p>

<p>So here in Japan you do not really have a democracy; your
government is really a puppet government.  You do not really have a
Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister of Japan is really the Governor of
Japan.  You have a President.  And your President's name is George W.
Bush.  And so when you're angry, it does no good to go to the Diet in
Japan to protest; you have to go to Washington and protest with the
rest of us Americans.</p>

<p>Japan is part of the new American Empire.</p>

<p>About 8 years ago I had the opportunity to visit the atomic bomb
museums in Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  And when I visited the atomic bomb
museums, I realized that my country, the United States of America is
the king of terrorists.  America has taught the whole world how to be
terrorists. Because I realized when I went to the museums, that
America dropped the bombs on women, children and elderly people.</p>

<p>America dropped nuclear bombs on hospitals, schools, and peoples'
homes.  So America is in no position to call anyone a terrorist.  But
then again America has a history of terrorist behavior.  If you read
the history books of America, it will tell you that the Europeans came
to America and the first thing they did was slaughter millions of
native americans and take their land.</p>

<p>And then after stealing the native american lands they went to
Africa and kidnapped millions of my ancestors and for 400 years they
used them as slaves.  So America has a long history of terrorising
people.</p>

<p>So it's very important for the mainland Japanese people to realize
you are an occupied country.  You're occupied the same way the Iraqi
people are occupied, but the Iraqi peoepe are fighting for their
freedom.  You are paying for your occupation with your tax money.</p>

<p>So I think it's very important for you to know this because here in
mainland Japan you don't see the occupation troops.  But go and visit
Okinawa, and if you talk to the Okinawan people, you will find they
know you are occupied because all the American troops are stationed in
Okinawa.  I know that you know America is very rich and powerful, and
America <em>is</em> very rich and very powerful.  But if I could take
all of you to America, I will show you the real America, the America
of poverty.</p>

<p>I know here in Japan you are very aware of homeless men.  In
America not only do we have homeless men, but we have homeless women
and children.  They sleep in the streets and parks in America.  I have
traveled to many places in mainland Japan, from Hokkaido to Okinawa; I
have crisscrossed your country.  In Japan you do have poor areas, but
you do not have the slums and ghettos that we have in America.</p>

<p>I was raised in the slums and ghettos in Brooklyn, New York.  And
in these communities there is always lots of violence and
unemployement and alcoholism.</p>

<p>So in 1965 I dropped out of high school and I joined the United
States Marine Corps.  I was very happy and very proud to be a Marine.
And I remember going home to tell my mother I had joined the United
States Marine Corps, and I thought she would be very proud of me, and
would be happy that she had one less mouth to feed, but she was very
angry.  She even sat down and started to cry.</p>

<p>But to me my mother just didn't understand that I was tired of
being poor and the United States Marine Corps offered me many
opportunities that my mother could not.</p>

<p>And this is something that I hope you remember.  When you see the
American military in Okinawa, and when you see the American military
in Iraq, know that they do not come from the middle class of America.
They come form the poor families.  They come from the working class
families. They come from the slums and ghettos.  They come to the
military because there are no other opportunities for them.</p>

<p>And it's the same thing for the Japanese Self Defense Force
soldiers.  The Japanese Self Defense Force soldiers do not come from
the rich families in Japan. They come from the poor families in Japan.
The rich and powerful: their children never join the military; their
children travel the world and attend private universities around the
world and never have to face the horrors of war.</p>

<p>Koizumi was quick to send other families' children to war, but not
his own children.  The Prime Minister of Japan: his son is very safe
in Tokyo selling beer.  It is always the poor chilren of every country
that find themselves on the battlefields killing each other.</p>

<p>But I don't think that people really realize how brutal the
training is to be a Marine.  The first thing they teach you in the
military on the very first day, they teach you to keep your mouth
shut.</p>

<p>As educators, and as teachers, and as parents, I know you try very
hard to get your students and your children to use their minds, but in
the military there is no thinking.  In the military they teach you
every day you are not there to think.  They tell you we will do the
thinking and you will follow orders.  In training you wake up very
early in the morning, always before the sun has risen. and you run
many miles and do a great amount of physical exercise.</p>

<p>You have to attend many classes, and in these classes they teach
you how to take care of your weapons.  You learn how to take care of
your rifle, and how to take it apart and how to keep it clean.  you
learn how to throw hand grenades and how to use high explosives.  And
you attend a class called Hand to Hand combat, and in this class they
teach you how to kill your enemies with your bare hands.</p>

<p>The governments in Japan and America love to call their soliders
Peace Keepers, but in the military, you don't learn anything about
peace.  You only learn how to kill.  If you visit any military base on
Okinawa, you will see the soldiers are not reading books written by
Mahatma Ghandi or Martin Luther King; they are reading books on war
and how to kill their enemies.</p>

<p>There were over 40 men in my battalion and they were all between 18
and 19 years old. And during our training they would ask us what we
wanted to do.  We would say "kill" and they would say "I can't hear
you," and we would shout "Kill!"  and they would say "I can't hear
you" and we would shout a the top of our voices "KILL" and then we
would growl like lions.  That is what it means to go into combat. You
will kill and maybe you will die.</p>

<p>After my training was over in America, I was informed I was going
to Vietnam war and I was very happy to know I was going to war.  But
on the way to Vietnam we stopped off on a little island off the coast
a Japan.  That island was called Okinawa.  I was stationed at camp
Hansen (sp).  Camp Hansen is in Kentown (sp).  During the day we would
go into the mountains and practice war.  This training was very
different than what we used in America.  We used live ammunition and
helicopters.  We were trained how to surround villages and not let the
people escape.</p>

<p>Everything about the training in Okinawa was different.  Even the
targets we used to practice shooting our rifles changed in Okinawa.</p>

<p>In America, they tought us to shoot our rifles on a target that
looked like this: (drawn bulls eye).  This target is called the Bulls
Eye Target.  The idea of this target is to shoot the bullets into the
middle of this target.</p>

<p>So I would like everyone in this audience to take your hand and aim
and shoot at this target.  At 200 meters away, your bullets will hit
the target like this (scattered).  But this is not good shooting,
because they are all spread out on the target.  So the miltiary
teaches how to bring all the bullets to one part.  This is called
grouping.  Then they teach you how to move the whole group to the
bullseye.</p>

<p>And then when I got to Okinawa, the target changed.  The new target
looked like this: (human silouette).  What is this shape supposed to
be?  Yes, it represents the image of a human being.</p>

<p>So once again take your hand and shoot this target.  We are taught
to shoot the bullseye, so where do you thnk we are going to shoot
human beings?  If you think in the head, please raise your hand.</p>

<p>(20%)</p>

<p>Shoulder? (1%) Arm? (1%) Leg? (10%) Heart? (60%)</p>

<p>Now at this point of the lecture we are going to talk about real
war.  In real war you cannot shoot at your enemy and miss.  Because in
real war the enemy doesn't know where you are until you shoot your
weapon.  And this is why the miltary soldiers wear camoflauge
clothing.  In the military they teach you to put bushes on your body
so you blend into the environment.  So in real war, if you shoot your
enemy and miss, your enemy will kill you because they know where you
are.</p>

<p>So all the people who think head please raise your hand.  I'm very
sorry to tell you that all of you are dead.  The head is the smallest
part of the body.  And if you shoot at the head you will miss and the
enemy will kill you.</p>

<p>Everyone who said leg, please raise your hand.  All you people are
dead also.  The military does not teach you to wound the enemy.  The
miltary teach you to kill the enemy.</p>

<p>Everyone who said heart, please raise your hand.  You people watch
too many movies.  The heart is a very small part of the body.  Most
people say heart and I know why you say heart.  You say heart because
you are very kind and merciful.  Because if you shoot someone in the
heart they will die instantly with no pain nor suffering.  But real
war is not about being kind and merciful.  We Marines and other
soldiers are trained to shoot here (groin).  If you shoot here, your
bullets will land here (stomach), and remember grouping so it's not
one bullet, it's 5, 6, or 7 bullets in the middle of stomach.</p>

<p>You do not die instantly from this wound, and I saw many of my
friends, 18 and 19 year old boys die from this wound in Vietnam.  You
last many hours screaming and crying before you die.</p>

<p>So you can take a look at this, and you can see that war is
absolutely brutal.  After my training was over in Okinawa, we finally
shipped out the Vietnam; I was so excited that I could not seep at
night.  I was not afraid to go to war, because as a boy, I saw many
movies about war.  And in the movies there's always the handsome
heroes.  And in the movies, there is always beautiful music in the
background.  And in the movies the hero always killed his enemy with
honor, face to face. And in the movies the handsome heroes always
saves the women and children.</p>

<p>But I've spent 13 months in the jungles of Vietnam, and I've
watched many Vietnamese soldiers die.  And the first thing I learnd in
the jungles of Vietnam was that real war is not what you see in the
movies.  In real war, there's no handsome hero.  In real war, there is
no beautiful music in the background.  In real war, there is no honor.
In real war, no one saves the women and children.  In real war, women
and children have to save themselves.  And in real war you kill your
enemy any way you can.</p>

<p>If your enemy is sleeping, you don't wake him up and let him get
his gun.  You kill your enemy while he is sleeping.  If your enemy is
eating, you don't wait for him to finish.  You kill your enemy while
he is eating.  If your enemy is using the toilet, you don't wait for
him to finish.  You kill your enemy while he is at his toilet.</p>

<p>And the people who suffer the most in war is always the women,
children and old people.  When we attacked the villages, the men would
would all grab their guns and run into the jungle.  And the women
would all grab their children and run into the jungle.</p>

<p>After we killed the men, we would go into the jungle to find where
the women and children were hiding.  It was always easy to find the
women and children's hiding place, because after 3, 4, 5 days of no
water and no rice the children would be screaming of hunger pains.  So
we would go deep into the jungle and stand still and listen, so we
could go to the women and children's hiding place.</p>

<p>Old people are too old to run from machine guns and helicopters.
Many of the old people are too old to keep up with the women and
children.  And I've seen the women and children wait and stop in the
jungle and the old people would say "go on!  go on! we will catch up,"
but we would find them in the jungle dead and dying alone.</p>

<p>Now these are the scenes that you will not see in the movies.</p>

<p>And these are the scenes you will not see on the evening news.</p>

<p>After we attack the villages, we have to clean up the battlefield,
which means you have to gather up the dead people so you can count
them.  So we bring all the dead people into the village and we
separate them all into piles.  The men we throw into one pile.  The
women we throw into another pile.  The children we throw into another
pile.  If the bodies are missing parts: heads, arms, or legs, you have
to go find these parts and put them with the bodies.</p>

<p>When we attack the villages, there are two types of people who are
left in the village, the dead and the dying.  Many people who were
dying would crawl out of the village into the jungle to die, and we
Marines had to go into the jungle to find where they died.  There are
two ways of finding the dead people in the jungle.  The first way is
to go into the jungle, stand still and listen for the flies.</p>

<p>If you follow the sound of the flies, the flies will always lead
you to dead bodies.  The second way to find dead people is to go into
the jungle and start smelling with your nose.  Soon you will smell the
smell of decomposing, rotting bodies.</p>

<p>The smell of decomposing, rotting bodies is so powerful it will
make food jump out of your mouth.  It will make your eyes water and
your nose run. It will make your body weak.  This is the smell I will
never forget because this is the smell of war.</p>

<p>There are many good movies about war, movies such as Platoon and
Saving Private Ryan, but these movies are not real war because in
movies there is no smell.  When people go to see movies, you buy
popcorn and candy and soda.  But if they could make a movie that
smelled like real war, you would not be able to eat your popcorn and
you would never go to see another war movie again.</p>

<p>The smell of real war is the smell of decomposing, rotting bodies.
The smell of real war is the smell of burning bodies.  It is the smell
of blood and the smell of gunpowder.</p>

<p>After we find the women and children we bring them back to the
village and they see the piles of dead bodies.  And I've seen the
little children run to the pile of dead women, and grab onto their
loved ones, screaming and crying.</p>

<p>And I've seen the Vietnamese women pulling their children from the
dead bodies, but the children would hold tight, refusing to let go of
their dead mothers.</p>

<p>And the old people would go from pile to pile identifying their
family members and they would collapse, wailing and crying, realizing
there is no one left of their families.</p>

<p>Many people ask me what happened to me in Vietnam that opened my
eyes to the horror of war.  There are many things that I saw that no
one should ever see, but there is one thing that really opened my eyes
to the horror of war.</p>

<p>My Marine company was going through a village when we were attacked
by Vietnamese soldiers.  Many of my friends were wounded and many ran
around looking for places of safety.  I ran behind a Vietnamese
persons house and I went down into their family bunker.  The
Vietnamese people always built bunkers behind their homes. This is
where they would take their famlies when the Americans would begin to
bomb their villages.</p>

<p>But once I got down inside the bunker, I ralized there was someone
in there with me.  It was a 15 or 16 year old Vietnamese girl.  And I
was surprised that when she looked into my face, she looked at me like
I was a monster, but for some reason, even though she was terrified,
she was unable to run away.  I couldn't understand what was wrong with
her.  She was breathing very hard and in great pain, so I crawled over
to her, and I realized she was naked from the waist down.</p>

<p>I couldn't understand what was wrong with her.  She kept breathing
hard, and I looked between her legs and I saw the head of a baby, but
at the time I didn't realize it was a baby.</p>

<p>I didn't know what was happening to this girl or how to help her,
because in the Marines they didn't teach me how to bring life into
this world.  In the Marines, they only taught me how to kill.</p>

<p>The girl started to push very hard, so I put my hands between her
legs and to my shock and suprise a baby came out of her body and into
my hands.  The baby was covered with afterbirth and steam was rising
from its body. The girl snatched her baby from my hands, she bit the
umbilical cord with her teeth, wrapped the baby in black rags and ran
into the jungle.</p>

<p>At first, I couldn't believe I had witnessed such a thing, but I
looked at my hands and I still had the afterbirth from the baby.  When
I came out of the bunker, I was a different person.  My friends kept
asking me what was wrong, but I never told them about this girl and
her baby.</p>

<p>For me this was a very important moment, because by seeing the baby
being born, I realized the Vietnamese people were human beings.  And
this was very important because through all my training they never
called the Vietnamese people human beings.  They called the Vietnamese
people 'gooks' and 'slant eyes,' and 'commnist,' and we began to
believe they were not human.</p>

<p>And this is something that I hope you remember, because this is
what all governments do.  They dehumanize the humans they send their
soldiers to kill.</p>

<p>During WW2, America dropped two nuclear bombs on two major cities
in Jaapn: Nagasaki and Hiroshima. To the American soldiers, they were
not dropping nuclear bombs on human beings; they were dropping nuclear
bombs on 'Japs' and they were the same as rats: not human.</p>

<p>And during WW2, Japanese Imperial soldiers captured and killed many
thousands of American and British soldiers, because to the Japanese
Imperial soldiers, the American and British soldiers were not
humans. They were devils.</p>

<p>And even today, the American military is calling people in Iraq
'sand monkeys,' not humans.</p>

<p>After seeing that baby being born, I went out of my way to make
friends with the Vietnamese women. and children. And whenever the
Vietnamese mothers would ask me for food, medicane, and blankets, I
would steal these things from the American miltiary base and give it
to the women and children.</p>

<p>But the Vietnam war is not the first time these things have happend
on this planet.  These things happen in every war on this planet.
These things are happening right now.  In places like Palestine,
Afghanistan, Iraq, the Sudan, and many places in Europe. The things I
have told you about happend on the little island of Okinawa.  During
WW2, the most horrifying land battle took place on the little island
of Okinawa.  Over 200,000 Okinawan people were killed: men women and
children.  And during the battle of Okinawa, Okinawan women gave birth
to babies in caves, and along roads and river banks.  This was the
most horrifying time in the history of the Okinawan people.  But for
the Okinawan people, the war is not over yet, because the American
military still occupies their island.</p>

<p>As you all reammber in 1995, there was a terrible rape of a 12 year
old Okinawan girl by American military soldiers.  But this was not the
first time a young woman was raped in Okinawa.  Thousands of young
women have been raped, but most are unreported because of the shame
factor.</p>

<p>Since the end of WW2, thousands of Okinawan people have been killed
or cripped or injured beacuse of car accidents caused by the American
solderis in Okinawa.</p>

<p>I am very worried about the children of Okinawa because they are
surrounded every day by violence.</p>

<p>I have been coming to Okinawa since 1995; I have protested against
the American military bases in Okinawa.  I want all of the Americans
to go home to America where they belong.  As an American I want all
the American military bases in Japan to be closed.  WW2 is over and it
is time for the end of the occupation in Japan.</p>

<p>When I came to Japan in 1996, a Japan peace activist gave me a copy
of your constitution.  When I read the Article Nine of your
constituion, I couldn't believe what I was reading.  I thought I was
reading something written by Mahatma Ghandi or Martin Luther King Jr.
I thought only Ghandi or Martin Luther King Jr could have written such
a beautiful thing to live by.</p>

<p>The Article Nine of your constitution is more powerful than any
nuclear weapon.  The Article Nine of your constitution is more
powerful than any army.  As I look into the faces of your children,
and into your faces, I see something beautiful; you don't know war,
and this is the power of your Article Nine.</p>

<p>As I look into the faces of the young Japan students here, I
realize their fathers have not gone to war.  I realize their brothers
and their uncles have not gone to war. That is the beauty of Article
Nine, It has saved them from the misery of war.</p>

<p>It is important to realize that every major country knows war.  My
children in America know war. The British know war.  The Germans, the
Australians, the Chinese; all their children know war.  But you don't
know war.  Article Nine has saved you from the suffering and the
horror and the misery of war.</p>

<p>I wish that every nation on this planet had an Article Nine.  The
world needs Article Nine.  but as you all know there are politicians
in Japan working very hard to remove Article Nine from your
constitution.  And you must never let Article Nine be removed.
Because the Article Nine of your constitution is not just important
for the Japanese people.  The Article Nine of your constitution is
important for every human on the planet.</p>

<p>Article Nine has stood and protected you.  Now it is time for you
to stand and protect Article Nine.</p>

<p>And please remember that world peace does not start in America.
And world peace does not start at the United Nations.  And world peace
does not start in Europe.  World peace starts right here in this room
with each and every one of us.</p>

<p>So I would like to thank the PB staff for organizing this
lecture, and I would like to thank all of you for coming to listen to
my story.  Thank you.</p>

<p>(awesome clapping)</p>

<p>OK. Now, what we have to do is sing a song. I have to sing a song
because I am still in Vietnam.  And I think some of you are still in
Vietnam.</p>

<p>Sometimes when slaves were able to escape, the slaves had to run
away, but they had to forget everything about their past. So they
would leave their pain by the riverside.  So in this song, we say I am
going to lay down my violence down by the riverside; I'm going to lay
down my hatred down by the riverside. I ain't going to study war no
more.</p>
