Dear Rob

I work in London for the British Council, a charity that promotes
education world-wide.  I subedit an educational intercultural
newsletter called 'Thresholds'.  The next issue will include an
article about Japanese culture.

In my research on-line, I came across your website and your wonderful
photo of the Hachiko dog statue (photo number 1436):

I was wondering, if you hold the copyright, whether you would give us
permission to use it in our newsletter?  A low resolution version of
the magazine also appears in a web archive.

If you're happy to give us permission, please let me know how you
would like to be credited for it.  I'd of course send you some copies
of the newsletter for you to keep.

I very much look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

Ginny

HI Ginny

You may definitely use the image of Hachiko.  I did take the photo
myself, so I guess I hold the copyright.   I'm glad you like it!  I
had almost decided to go home because it was so chilly that day.

The highest resolution image is this one

A copy of the newsletter is definitely appreciated!  Please send it to

Rob's Hachiko Photo Included
(janette's address)

The weird name on top will keep me (janette) from tossing the
newsletter as junk mail.

  Thanks!

Hi Rob

Thanks for getting back so quickly and for letting us use the great
photo Hachiko.  It does look very cold!

I look forward to sending you the newsletter in July (we go to print
in June.)

With best wishes from London.

Ginny
