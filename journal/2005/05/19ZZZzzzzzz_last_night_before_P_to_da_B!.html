<p>So; this is it.  The last night before I'm on PB for 100
some odd days!  I got my (Jimmy's) big suitcase home without
incident, dropped off my big box to Elvis' room and got my deposit
money and prorated (?) rent back, and said HI / bye to Marky Mark,
Ikumi, Shoko, and Anthony.  Hitomi cooked the remainder of the food
that was in my fridge (eggs, sausage, noodles, etc) as I talked to
Mark.</p>

<p>I'm defiitely getting the feeling of "too tired; just finishe" like
don't orry about details; just get some shit done.</p>

<p class=date>2:31am</p>

<p>Awake again; got pictures of my byebye note to everyone.  Hitomi
determined I need to leave here at 9am to get to the ship on time
(10am).</p>

<p>But, I can't get them online cause all the transfer cables have
already been packed and sent to the ship.</p>
