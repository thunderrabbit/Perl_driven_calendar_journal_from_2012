<p>We are definitely not in Hong Kong.  We look outside; bang it's
beautiful - mountains and real calm sea and the coolest thing is the
guys are using the lifeboats and scaffolding down the side of the
ship to scrape paint!  It's awesome!</p>

<p>They're playing music off one side of the boat, the landing side,
and a bunch of busses and loud-ass music.  It's beautiful.</p>

<p>On the other side of the boat</p>

<p>It's overcast today.  Not much going on this side of the boat.  No
greeting party; wide open spaces and lovely mountains and sea with
little bobbing boats dotting the water.</p>

Kim. Dude - Vietnam is beautiful.  And poor.  After hearing the story
of 1000s of years of war; it's fucked up, but that's what it is.
Right now we've got hills and banana trees on the left side and the
sea on our right.  People walking around with triangle hats.  This
road is two well-paved lanes each direction leading to and from the
port.  We all got a triangle hat.</p>

<p>There's construction happening among dilapidated buildings,
including a house with walls made of straw mats.  These roads are less
than 8 years old.  Because Danang is on the sea and has four beaches,
Americans come here and bring their money; this is the wealthiest city
in Vietnam, and it looks like hell.  Dude.  It fuckin' looks like
hell.</p>

<p>There are no crosswalks nor traffic lights, but plenty of bicycles
and pedestrians and motorcycles.</p>

<p>Most men are wearing baseball hats with no logo and women wear
either triangle hats, baseball hats, or gilligan hats.</p>

<p class=date>4:09pm</p>

<p>We've just rolled onto a much smaller road that's paved but only 1
lane, but with two lanes of traffic and myriad motorbikes.  There's
trees mixed with rusty dirty small one-room buildings all smushed
together and whitewashed colors.  Lots of greenery all tucked
inside.</p>

<p>Kim goes, "I guess I can de-ID myself."  awesome.</p>

<p>Like in Costa Rica, big trucks are rolling around on various sides
of the road, all honky and menacing.</p>

<p>There are some really intricate painted tiles that would work well
in a super high dollar house, across the street from plastic animals
balloons.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Try to play charades and explain "reincarnation."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We've been going for an hour + and have not seen a single traffic
light.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There's a tower made of stacked rings and columns going up through
it.</p>

<p>Stunning orange flowers on this tree.</p>

<p class=date>11:01am</p>

<p>Gotta be back in one hour.</p>

<p class=date>11:19am</p>

<p>Got lost from the group while being sold sunglasses, then Brandt
found me.  We waited for a while for some foodage at this little
restaurant while some kids worked hard to sell us postcards and
stuff.  We got several pictures of them.  They're funny.</p>

<p>I wanna come back to Vietnam fo sheezy; Hong Kong can fuck off,
but Vietnam is cool.</p>

here.</p>

veranda and ceiling fans and 51 seats around three long tables.  I'm
eating with my new set of chopsticks.  Awright.</p>

<p>Adi, Carissa, Matt, Nat and I are here at this table.</p>

<p class=date>1:34pm</p>

<p>Just ordered some sandals from somewhere, to be picked up at 7pm.</p>

<p>The girls are in a dress shop getting measured for dresses, and the
woman isn't writing down the measurements.  Hips, waist, shoulders,
etc etc... And now she just did Natalie and never wrote down Carissa's
numbers.</p>

align="left" /></a> We're bouncing along a paved single lane thing
between rice fields, passing bikes and an <em>ox</em>; this is soooo
amazing!  It's like a clubhouse; we had to squeeze through this little
street to get here and everything is made of bamboo..  We're at a
little elementary school.  Matt got here ahead of us by taking a
motorcycle.</p>

<p class=date>4:06pm</p>

<p>The ceremony is over; I recorded a lot of it on video.  The
ceremony is over and the kids are lined up (and have been for over an
hour, without moving!!) and receiving gifts, no fighting or fussing;
just super well-behaved.  I'm impressed.</p>

<p>We did a short singing English lesson: "Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes.."</p>

<p class=date>6:38pm</p>

<p>Fantastic day today; the kids were shy at first
and then they genkied up; Greg went swimming in the river; Brandt, Pat
and I (separately) spun around on the merry-go-round; we taught the
kids some English and they were really funny; we tried some new
fruits, including some I had only seen in Hawaii, and another I hadn't
seen until now: jack fruit.  In Vietnamese, michi, I think.  They look
like banana peels.  I love them.  Maryann says they look like yellow
bell peppers.</p>

<p>The traffic is just nutso.  The only rule is "stay toward the
right, kinda" and "use your horn as much as possible."  Maryann saw
five people and a dog on a motorcycle.</p>

<p>Dave is singing 'the wheels on the bus' - this is
just <em>amazing!!</em></p>

<p>We all agree we could live in Vietnam easily.</p>

<p>The driver put on Deep Purple "Smoke on the Water" and Dave busted
out with "Wheels on the Bus" lyrics!! so funny!!!</p>

<p>We are all on top of life.  Fantastic.  I love this group.</p>

<p>And I don't mean Deep Purple.</p>

/></a> We've got the penthouse in the hotel.  Just picked up my new
sandals for 95,000 dong.  Awesome.  Heading back to the hotel now.
Blue straps on top cause I like blue.</p>

can't speak English very well, but she is really doing well.  She's
awesome and really trying hard.</p>

<p>She says she'll remember us if we come back in 1 year, 3 years, 5
years.. she'll remember.  I basically attribute that to clarity of
life or clarity of mind; not being worried about what's on MTV
tomorrow night.</p>

<p>Bau new ting = how much is it? in Vietnamese.</p>

<p class=date>12:53am Sunday 29 May 2005</p>

<p>Back in my room in Hoi An.  Bedtime.  Someone (named Ï©Éð) forgot to
bring clean clothes for me to wear.</p>

<p>I'm tired as anything.</p>

<p>We rode motorbikes back to the hotel from Down By The River cafe.
I enjoyed riding behind Yoshika, and I was like "mmmm, girl" because
I'm tired; I don't know her from anyone, though now I know her name
because Nicole told me in exchange for a free pass on the eye contact
game. (plus another for Maiko's name)</p>

<p>Bike guy charged far too much for the bike ride back.</p>

<p class=date>1:16am</p>

<p>I fell asleep while sitting on the toilet.  haha</p>

<p>I almost crashed getting out of the tub; the floor of the bathroom
is lower than the floor of the tub.  It would have been quite
disastrous; blood and incapacitating injuries, I am sure.</p>
