And Away We Went!  Right at noon.  Like within a minute (and I set
my watch to the atomic clocks online) we left.  We had passed out cups
with champagne after helping people carry on luggage after getting our
own luggage onboard after having our meeting this morning.</p>

<p>While helping people with their luggage, we were all like, "good
morning!"  "good morning" in Japanese to everyone, and for a moment, I
recognized the value of Tatamae (the outward appearance): it feels
good to see everyone genki, even if we're not 100% genki ourselves.
So if we are all appearing genki, it helps other people feel
genki. Hmmmm.</p>

<p>As we pulled away, I started to cry.  I was surprised and haven't
really pinned down reaons; happy to escape Japan; happy that I'm on
PB; sad to leave Japan; scared about the future?  Mostly the
first two I think.</p>

<p>Hitomi said HI to me a couple times and I haven't been seeking her
out, but I have introduced her when she's come up to me.</p>

<p>Had a lovely basic lunch (curry rice and shredded lettuce and
tomato slice salad) on the back deck.  Nice.</p>

<p>About to go to Broadway for our 2pm meeting.</p>

<p>Still have not sorted out my stuff in my room.</p>
