<p>Super duper uper uber fun tonight at the PB Pre 49th Voyage
Fundraising Party Fiesta!  Some great performances by Angie on Korean
drum, Alison and David on vocals and guitar, two Japanese hip hop
girls who could really shake it, two Japanese belly dancers who
could <em><b>really</b></em> shake it, and one guy on acoustic guitar
who played a couple of Mexican anti-(Vietnam)-war songs.  During his
performance (after some big time dancing on my butt while watching the
aforementioned four women) I sat uprightly in a meditative pose
blessing the universe and broadcasting peace to the universe.  Instead
of clapping cheeringly like everyone else, I did a soft hand-rubbing
'clap' that I learned in my original YRUU days.</p>

<p>"If something pleases you, rub your hands together like this to
show your appreciation.  This allows us to maintain the serene
space."</p>

<p>All kinds of crazy dancing, mimicking the belly dancers as best I
could, doinga funky funk dance when the music called for it, heavy
throw-down head bobbing air drums when the hip hop girls did they
thang, super soaking sweaty in my THE MONKEY ROCKS shirt given to me
by beautiful Sallyally in Calicali.</p>

<p>I danced with an obaasan who was
super genki and danced with most of the boys, and I tried to entice a
couple of ojiisan onto the dance floor, teaching one how to dance with
just a clap and then single step out, single step back.</p>

<p>Kris asked me about some twirling move I did, and I was like, "I
don't know how I did it.  I dance by turning my brain OFF."  Showed
her my first-ever dance, taught to me by Christina Branum(-Martin):
the seaweed dance.  Feet don't move.  Just slowly sway the arms.</p>

<p>I had my feet together and Kris posed the very good question,
"what if you lose your balance?"</p>

<p>I spaced my feet wider apart.  "Then you did a big seaweed dance,"
with the same swaying arms, but feet wider apart.</p>

<p>That gave me an idea.  "and then you do 'big seaweed'" (step out)
"'little seaweed.'" (step in) "'big seaweed'" (step out) "'little
seaweed.'" (step in) "and they're not worried about where their feet
are, they're just doing big seaweed, little seaweed, and they're
dancing without even thinking about it." referring to dance students
who Angie and Kris (?) said were too shy to dance.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter, I was approached by a woman who was basically
like, "my son loves monkeys.  Can I buy your shirt?" and I was
thinking <em>holy crap; how often does one get asked <b>this</b>
question?</em> and I didn't quite believe her so I asked a question or
something and she seemed pretty serious, but then I was like, "but if
I sell you my shirt, I won't have a shirt to wear!" and she was like,
"I'll see what I can do about that," and two seconds later a man came
up offering to trade shirts with me.</p>

<p>I was like, "okay; I'll let you have it for a donation to the
charity box," referring to the box into which everyone had put 1000
yen upon entering the party.  (This money will go to Sri Lanka where
people along the road from Columbo to Gaul (sp) are still living in
tents and occasional shacks (during monsoon season now) after the
tsunami in December.)  She was like, "oh of course!" and pulled out
5000 yen, which is the actual number I had in mind but didn't say
because I just didn't.</p>

<p>And that's how I traded my (Sally's) sweaty THE MONKEY ROCKS shirt
for a clean white T-shirt and got 5000 (US $50) donated to Sri
Lanka.</p>

<p>Thank you Sally!  Thank you Jill!  Thank you Rock Monkey!</p>
