<p>It's beautiful; nice hard breeze and super sunny with a few clouds
and everyone is out by the pool.  We just had some interviews and for
the last two students I wrote "money" cause they were money.  I'm
about to jump in the pool; awrigh.</p>

<p class=date>11:30am</p>

<p>Had big fun in the pool; floating around all in the sloshing water
like "whoohoooooo" with all the waves waving around cause it was a
wave pool with the waves.  great fun!  Tossed the Pooh pool ball
around with a man and woman in the pool.  great fun!  Submerged my GPS
and found that it couldn't receive a signal from underwater, though it
is submergeable.</p>

<p class=date>3pm</p>

<p>We're in a sorting meeting now.  Wrote a postcard to Captain Su and
kicked the soccer ball around with Shawn.</p>

<p>The sorting meeting is where we basically have 170 student files
and need to sort them in order of ability.  The basic technique is/was
to use a bubble sort given 13 sets of 12 sorted pages.  Take the top
and bottom couple from each set and compare them to the adjacent sets.
Two people are working on each set at a time.  It worked pretty well.
Almost certainly as well as anything I could come up with.  I imagined
a merge sort, bringing together one sorted set of 12 pages at a
time.</p>

<p class=date>5:08pm</p>

<p>We just finished the sorting.  Nat(alie) is finishing some final
cleansing in the office and I'm encouraging her to not work so hard.
We've all done great work today, and it's really great to have such a
great team!</p>

<p class=date>7:09pm</p>

<p>Gonna go kick the soccer ball around with Shawn and some peeps.
Just had a GET meeting.  I've confirmed that I'm really good at
visual learning and being distracted during audio learning.</p>

<p>I'm a bit behind in typing up these typings.</p>
