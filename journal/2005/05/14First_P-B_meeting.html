<p>Chillin' now with Dave and Nat (Auds just vamoosed mid-sentence)
while Nicole is zonked on the other side of the room.  Dave and Nat
seem to have had a few more tasty beverages than other people.</p>

8000 dollars which allowed some village to build a bridge from point A
to point B.  They sent her pictures and the whole bit.  She says she's
raised 30,000 other dollars, but didn't specify where it went.</p>
