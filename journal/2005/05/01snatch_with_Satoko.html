<p>Watched Snatch with Satoko tonight after we found nothing worth
watching at Cinecitta nor Toho cinema in Kawasaki.  Rented a VHS from
Tsutaya on my card so I hope she takes it back on time.  She wanted
VHS so she could watch it again; I told her the language may be hard
to follow, especially Mickey's.</p>
