Awesome supa fun meeting today getting mo' ready for the voyage
and meeting several members of the 48th Voyage teaching team.  We
sang songs to them and they did for us (that was the closing of
our meeting) after we had some meeting stuff on getting prepared to
teach on the boat.  I notice that we had lots of meetings.  At the
end we were talking casually and one of the guys said that there are
far too many meetings (Japanese style)and that we should simpley not
take anything too seriously; just enjoy the voyage.  Anothe guy was
like, "you'll wonder wtf it's all about; is this a PB, or a
cruise ship?" he determined that it was a cruise ship with a small
bit of PB in it.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>I met Paige near the end cause she looked familiar to me, and
seemed like a cool girl either way, but she didn't think we had met.
She'll be going to gradu school in Italy hopefully in October; she's
just wating to find out now.</p>

<p>While Kim and I walked to lunch a woman asked me if I was single
or if Kim was my girlfriend.  I said. "not yet" and then covered my
mouth like, "did I say that?" but she didn't look surprised.  She's
tall and nice.  What in the world am I thinking?</p>

<p>Oh, one cool thing: there's a guy named Asam (maybe) who is from
Port Said, and can give us all the details about the cool places to
go.  He works in the restaurant, and is the tallest guy on the
boat.</p>

<p>The teachers were like, "you'll see the pyramids, and that's all
I'm saying."</p>

<p>I think it's going to be gooooood.</p>
