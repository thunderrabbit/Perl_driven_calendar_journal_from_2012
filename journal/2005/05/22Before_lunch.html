<p>I just met Nicholas; I talked to him yesterday looking over the
sea; he was looking for Greek radio stations with his litte radio.
Today he says he found a sports game last night.  I showed him my GPS
and he said he wants to get one.</p>

<p>Met a  woman named Hana by the daily-updated map (paper with lines
drawn on it) she had salty white and brown hair.  She's from Nagoya.
She's cute.</p>

<p>Met Hiruta at the GO tables.</p>

<p>There's a dude on the dock who was playing on the dock, with amps
behind him; we yelled ARIGATO! and he waved back.  Awesome.  Couldn't
get a picture cause he was just too far away, but his music carried
beautifully.</p>
