<p class=date>1:36am JST Sunday 22 May 2005</p>

<p>Just met / hung out with Kanae in the hall by my room.  I had
brought</p>

<ol>
<li>my computer
<li>its power supply
<li>peanut/chocolate candy
<li>my camelback
<li>my tape player
<li>my headphones
</li>

<p>out into the hallway with the plan of eating the cocolate,
listening to the cassette tape that I've been recording on this
evening and transcribing it.</p>

<p>Kanae was wandering about in the hall and she said HI.  Her English
is really good; she's a CC (CC in our world means Communication
Coordinator, and in the rest of the world would be called Interpreter
or Translator) from Chiba, though she's originally from Okinama.</p>

<p class=date>1:50am</p>

<p>man I'm realllly tired; falling alseep during this entry.</p>

<p>We talked about politics some after one of us mentioned the status
of US politics.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>didn't get any audio transcption done, but.</p>

<p>I am so tired.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed the next day:)</p>

<p>The big door by my room is locked, and I tried opening it with the
handle/switch thing to open the door and it was like
"WAAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!"  Plus a Bell like
"RIRIRRIRIRRIRIRIRIRIIRRIRIRIRI" and I was like, shit! and turned it
off really quickly; I had hoped it would be like "vvvvvvvvvvvv" and be
all quiet.</p>

<p>After that is when I talked to Kanae and never transcribed this.
Well haven't yet.  hadn't yet.</p>

<p>The thing I like best is watching the water get smushed out of the
way by the front of the boat.  It's awesome and makes a wave that
crests like awesomely.</p>

<p class=note>a furrow</p>

<p>Shawn says it's a furrow, and says he doesn't say that, but that's
what it is.</p>

<p class=date>2:40am</p>

<p>I am using janette's quilt tonight.</p>

<p>(recorded three times to make sure it got recorded)</p>
