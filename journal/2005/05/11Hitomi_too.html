<p>Oh my.</p>

<p>Hitomi has just informed me that she too will be on PB.</p>

<p>She says she wants to have happy times together before I leave
(escape) Japan.</p>

<p>I recognize a great deal of my hesitation lies in that I was
looking forward to having no girlfriend.  Kindof a geographically
imposed breakup.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have trouble enough keeping my own life lined up that I don't
want to work on a relationship.  I collapse myself into the
relationship too easily.</p>

<p>Why are we doing this to each other?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Why did she act so crazy a couple weeks ago like I was leaving
soon?  She says she told me in late March that she was going on PB
too, but I didn't believe her cause it's really fucking expensive,
she had been joking about going in my suitcase (and everyone makes
that joke once or twice), and she didn't say, "I really mean it.  I'm
going on PB."  For 6 weeks she didn't say that.</p>

<p>What other karma do we need to work out?</p>
