<pre>The symlink works.  The indexing works.  The opt-out works.

The last thing is to write the file to my ~/journal/yyyy/mm/
directory.  I mucked up the filename before, but now I think it's
right, BUT

the directory is mode 700 or maybe even 600, and all the files are 600.  I dunno if
I can write to that directory.

Let's see.
