eat at 6pm in the Topaz Room, then see if I want to go back out.
We've got to be back on the boat at 8:30.  Even though the boat will
not leave until 11pm, it will be a problem if I come at 8:31.</p>

<p>Basically my stuff will be removed from my room and given to me at
the port.</p>

<p>If I'm not available at all, my stuff will be left on the port.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>I'm on the boat already.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

streets of wherever I was on Hong Kong island.  I basically wanted to
see the World's Longest Escalator, which turned out to be a big load
of hooey.  It's not an escalator 800 meters long, it's a set of
escalators, not even all connected, possibly 800 meters total.  I
wasn't really impressed with the false advertising, but I did get a
good picture at the top of the escalator.  There's a phone booth
across the street, and my rabbit needed to make a quick phone
call.</p>

<p>Colleenie Beanie gave me this rabbit for Easter in 2003.  I hung
him on the wall for 2 years and then when it was time to go on PB, he
said he wanted to go, too.  He hasn't told me his name yet.</p>

(Toyo) to find some foodage, but I came back early since it was so
close to the deadline.  Saw Kim while I was talking to the Dr from
Iraq.  I told her about Ben & Jerry's and she bought me an ice
cream!!!  We hung out on the front deck; she told me the story of Ursa
Major and Ursa Minor.  Hitomi came up and chatted with me as we left
the port.  Showed me her new camera.</p>

pleasure of posing in front of his taxi.  Damn if I ain't putting it
on my site.</p>
