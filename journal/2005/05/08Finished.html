<p>I'm basically finished with my rob_update mailer.  The final touch
was allowing me to remove names from the list.  I'd like to add a bit
of functionality to sort that list by name or by email, but right now
it just prints the names in order of retrieval from the database.</p>

<p>Today during OM I added the ability for it to write English or
Japanese text (for the removal link) depending on the preferred
language of the recipient.</p>

<p>Still haven't added a sorting ability to the remove thing.</p>
