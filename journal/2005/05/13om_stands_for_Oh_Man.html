<p>Uh oh.  Jen just called me; she's stuck in Saipan because the
flight was cancelled... so she won't be able to fly out tonight to be
at OM tomorrow.  OM is going to flip.</p>

<p>And I don't mean a flip of joy.</p>

<p>Yikes stripes!</p>

<p>I just reached OM and let him know.  He didn't seem to mussed; I
hope he continues to feel easy about everything.</p>
