<p>Right now I'm on the Front Row of the theater to watch Steel
Magnolias (which I keep spelling as "Stell") starring Louise as the
character Julia Roberts played in the movie.  Louise is from
Brisbane, and she's gotta do a southern belle accent.  I look forward
to it.  I hope to be impressed; I 've never heard her try it.</p>

<p>Intermission.</p>

<p>Louise's accent is pretty good, thought i can hear her voice on
occassions when she speaks too quickly or her charcter gets too
excited.  But on other occassions she speaks quickly and keeps it.</p>

<p>Must be quite a trick to learn a new accent.  Especially OZ to Belle.</p>

<p>I didn't notice when she began to have her insulin shock; that
scene really grabbed me; I was like, "Louise!!!  Are you okay?"  (in
my head.)</p>

<p>The last scene I assume will be shorter than the first two.  They
are presumably changing the set now; it's been in the beauty salon
for the first two:  pre Shelby's wedding and Christmas with Shelby 3
months preggers.</p>

<p>A couple of times, when the grouchy woman was ranting, Louise
seemed to laugh beyond what her character should.  I wonder if she
was close to breaking character.  She didn't make any noises, but she
seemed close to like busting out laughing.</p>

<p class=date>9:36pm</p>

<p>A couple of words: "thing" "thing" and "that" plus something after
the cranky woman said something.  These were in the third scene.</p>

<p>Final scene is next; this is lasting longer than I thought; I hope
I can get my bag okay.</p>
