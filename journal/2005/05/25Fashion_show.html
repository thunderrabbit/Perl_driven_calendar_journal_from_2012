<p>I hope I can get some pictures from the fashion show; I have a few
from behind stage, but not from onstage, er.. taken of us on
stage.</p>

<p>It has been super fun with dancing and singing and craziness.  I,
for example, am wearing a vest and mardis gras mask and orange afro
with skulls in it.</p>

<p>It's hot.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where we are allowed to go at this point; some people
are splitting; I think it's cool if we jet, but I'm not sure what's
next after this.</p>
