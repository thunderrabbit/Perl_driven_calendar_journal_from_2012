<p>My understanding was that Hitomi planned to come over tonight, but
I haven't heard from her yet.  It seems strange; we had been emailing
back and forth, testing my Rob Update Mailer's ability to send
Japanese remove-me text, but then no contact from her.</p>

<p>I did take a nap this afternoon, during which I had my phone off,
so she could have called me and gotten no response.  I'd be surprised
if that kept her from coming over though.</p>

<p>I was right.  She just called and will be over in a bit.</p>
