<p>Went to PB office today to halp Matt with the GET
Guidebook.  I didn't do too much; just grabbed a few pictures of food
from online and some info on Rosa Parks and Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>Chowed a bit of lunch with him in the park and he helped me get a
bit more oriented around PB stuff.</p>

<p>Oh man, I researched Petra today.  That's the name of (one of the
GET teachers on 49th and) the area in Jordan where the end of Indiana
Jones Last Crusade was.  Awesome.</p>
