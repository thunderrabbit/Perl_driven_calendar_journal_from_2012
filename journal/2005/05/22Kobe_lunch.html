<p>I have recorded about 15 minutes (at most) to my tape, but it looks
like it will be a challenge to keep up with transcription.</p>

<p>In Kobe now; have had a meeting about computer stuff.</p>

<p>Everyone is still on the boat; we must get-off and on for visa
stuff, but not go far from the boat.</p>

<p>We'll be helping load passengers again today I think.</p>

<p>I met Satoshi today, a soccer-bud with Masahito, the super genki
crazed hair high school age lookin' guy.</p>
