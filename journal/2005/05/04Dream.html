<p class=dream>A friend of mine and I were in a car in a parking lot.
A limosuine pulled up beside us and another nice car pulled up on the
other side of us.  A guy got out of the limo (not the driver) and went
over to the other car. Ah; these cars ae together, I remarked.  My
friend gout of of our truck and got into the white limo on the left
where the guy's wife was (with the guy on the other side) and my
friend opened the limo door.  the guy was in an optimistic mood,
having just gotten married, so he didn't figure someone was trying to
mess with him, so he was like, "what are you doing?" and my friend
didn't respond, but pulled out the red wine bottle and popped it open,
and I was like, "what are you doing???" and he still didn't respond,
but then got into the limo and started to back up to move it to the
other side of our truck, but he was drunk so he immediately scratched
the limo against our open door and I ran over to stop him, but he was
in our truck now and backing that up, which was really bad news cause
not only was he drunk, but he didn't even have a license for this size
truck, which he promptly backed into a taxi on the far side of the
parking lot.  I ran over to the moving truck and he had locked the
door and wouldn't open it for me, thinking that he was still properly
doing everyone a favor, so with some difficulty I opened the door with
the key and got in and grabbed the key out of the ignition and
crunched down on the parking brake to stop the madness.</p>


<p class=dream>Onlookers were thankful and I woke up.</p>

<p>Interesting that I don't know who my friend was besides male, and a
close friend who likes to drink.  Maybe Dan.  Be careful, mate!</p>
