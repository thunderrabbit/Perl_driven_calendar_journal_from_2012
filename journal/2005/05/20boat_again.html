<p>Okay.  Now I'm headed back to the boat.  this time not standing at
the front, looking eagerly into the future down the tracks.  This
won't be my last time on this train; I'll be back.  Back again.
Guess who's going to be back, tell a friend.</p>

<p>Wait.</p>

<p>Okay, so I'll be back and this is not the end of an era so much as
the transition from one era to another, putting the first one on hold
with the option to come back or not.  I'm not-burning bridges in my
wake.</p>

<p>I've got things sorted with Elvis.  Gave him my extra key as a
makeup.  I used Warrior techniques, but not the exact language; I
used what language I thought he would understand better.</p>

<p>Why such detail?   Got to catch the next (faster) train.</p>
