<p>Time for bed.  Gotta brush my teef and... maybe write a postcard.
I'm choosing to not take my computer tomorrow, but I will take my tape
recorder, and maybe video recorder, and definitely camera.  Now I've
decided to bring my waterproof camera case just in case.</p>

<p>Going to write some postcards now.</p>
