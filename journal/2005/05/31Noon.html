<p>Argh.  Kinda frustrating; I can't figure out how to keep my editor
from formatting the dates in a way I don't like.  I've resorted to
using "Saturday.04.June 2005" so it won't interpret it as a date and
convert it to "06/04/05" format, which I loathe.  Worst date format
ever.</p>

<p>I've spent a pretty long time on this, like 4 hours.  Now I'm at
the point where it's not optimal, but okay enough that I can accept
it.  But now I've got to write up some sheets for each of my students,
including a genki note which I'm not really in the mood to write.</p>
