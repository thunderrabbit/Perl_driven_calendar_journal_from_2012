<p>Holy cow ooooooops!!!  Audrey (oh my god) called me as I was just
arriving at this trin station (not too far from Takabakabaka, but)
saying that I had left my suit case there, and I was like, "yeah" and
when was I going to pick it up?</p>

<p>Crap.</p>

<p>I thought it was going to be brought to te ship from the office.
Crap crap.  turns out that I should be able to get it from the PB
office after the play.  People will likely be up there late, though
she will not.  I also need to get a map to the ship, cause as of yet,
(I realize) I don't know fo sho where it is.</p>

<p>I want to reward Audrey somehow for covering for me; I woulda been
less one suitcase.  It's interesting; I was thinking about its well
being as I headed toward the station; realizing I was walking into the
unknown without it; I might never see it again.  I was okay with that.
And it came back to me.  Awesome.</p>
