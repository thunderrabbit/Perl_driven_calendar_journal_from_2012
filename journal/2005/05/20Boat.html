Teachers: From left to right: Nicole, Kim, Angie, Kris, Maryann,
Carissa, and Natalie (asleep).</p>

<p>We've just chowed lunch out on the short-grass covered hill on
what Kim suggests feels like an island.  We're on the port
overlooking the boat.  I'm all snotty nosed cause I think the
interior of the boat is dusty.  Uh oh.</p>

<p>Met Katrina (from Poland) and Amelia (from Bulgaria), bar staff
onboard.  I felt an inch of seasick(?) inside the boat; combination
of tight space and a bit of rocking.  Carissa seems to be quite
sensitive to the rocking.</p>

<p>There are 8 levels on the boat (I think), including the upper deck.
The lower decks don't always have openings for fresh air, which is why
a couple of guys were like, "don't forget to go outside."</p>

<p>It's like living in an enclosed city, protected from the elements
outside, trapped with the elements inside.</p>

<p>Gotta go back in soon.  Maybe to teach.</p>
