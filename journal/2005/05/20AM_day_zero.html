Took several pictures of me with my bags and Millenium House and a
couple of shots while on the train, mostly of Motosumiyoshi station
construction.  Arrived well on-time to this beautiful port building
where the key design point was "no vertical lines" combined with "no
visible support system"</p>

<p>I've been here before, but it was quieter, and random strangers
didn't say Good Morning to me.</p>

<p>Oh oh oh, coming up to the building, I saw the ship, and it looked
different than I thought: older and squatter, maybe.  Took some pix
and continued, then saw OUR boat, or what I thought must be our boat
could I could see CE on the smoke stack which would be the end of
"PEACE"...</p>

ours.  Got a few shots of The Topaz, my new home for the next three months.</p>

<p>An elderly Japanese guy took a shot of me with the boat.</p>

<p>Waved HI to the guys working busily on the bow; they waved "hello"
back, and I said I would see them in an hour.</p>

<p>Ah; now I can see the group headed into the building.  Genki up!!</p>
