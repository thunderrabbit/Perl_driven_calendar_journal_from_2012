<p>My basic ideas toward our new networked computers:</p>

<pre>
* System allows GET teachers to use/develop lessons plans and
  curriculae for GET classes on PB voyages

* Allow teachers to quickly grab useable documents

* Allow teachers to make edits to documents
  - Must track version changes
    . could be Wiki
    . could be CVS
  - How do we choose which files are used as default?

* Give each teacher his/her own workspace for stuff in progress
  - will be backed up daily on the ship
  - this will be wiped clean after each voyage

* Backup system:
  - monkey friendly (a monkey could do it)
    . maybe just put in a blank CD every day
    . if it's a CD-RW that could be done weekly
  - should backup user changes daily
  - backup (ghost) entire system after each voyage (so we can)
  - maintain a copy of library on disk in case of server failure on voyage

* Should allow for computer failures (Google mentality)
