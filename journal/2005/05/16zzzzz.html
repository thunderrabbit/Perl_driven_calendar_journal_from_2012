<p>Tonight upon arrival home, I hung out with Jim, Jackie, Mark, Jen,
Sam out around the table where we chatted, played The Jackie Purdy
Game and an unnamed movie game, various linking games of who starred
with who in what movies?</p>

<p>Jen told me quite dramatically how she felt about my recent stalker
news and I basically agreed but have given it up to the heavens.</p>

<p>Hung out with Jen and Ikumi in the main room for more chatting,
mostly listening to Jen's stories of Saipan.  Ikumi insisted that I
use real milk for the Fruity pudding stuff (and she was definitely
right; it works better than soy milk) and we chowed all that (and by
we I mean mostly me) and mango pudding and chocolate and then Hitomi
came home and I had more chocolate and orange juice.</p>

<p>Now Hitomi and I may talk; she may be asleep.  I told her I didn't
want to talk earlier; I think that put her off.</p>
