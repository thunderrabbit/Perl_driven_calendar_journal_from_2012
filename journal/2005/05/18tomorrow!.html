<p><b>tomorrow!</b></p>

<pre>Well, I'm still working the kinks out of this email thing; I'm still red with
embarassment about the last email that for all I know went out to everyone. 
Instead of adding an email to the list, I sent an email to the list.  D'oh!

But, tonight is basically the last night before I embark on PB!!  I've
gotten all my junk packed, all my junk almost stored, and all I need to do now is
throw away a few final items from my room.  Things are looking up!

Tomorrow we have the Handover Meeting from the last voyage teaching team to this
voyage teaching team.  Then I'll go see Steele Magnolias starring my friend Louise
as the woman who was played by Julia Roberts, and *then* wake up early and go get
on the boat!   I'll actually be teaching on Friday - some sample lessons and then
we leave on Saturday.

I don't know if I'll be able to get off the boat Friday night to say BYE to people
who come to Yokohama Port.

Internet access will be sporadic; I plan to write journal entries locally and then
upload them when I get to a cafe.

Everyone be well!  I will as well.

    Bon Voyage!
      - Rob!
