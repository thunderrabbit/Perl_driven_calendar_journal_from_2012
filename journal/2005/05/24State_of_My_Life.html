<h1>State Of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>I don't know how long it's been since I've written one of
these.</p></li>

<li><p>I never got to see Muscle Musical which was playing around the
time we left.  Shawn (maybe) said it was really good.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm on PB's 49th Global Voyage around the world; we
have just gotten started: have seen Kobe so far, and tomorrow we'll
be in Hong Kong.</p></li>

<li><p>We're having some nice gentle rolling today.  I don't know how
to quantify it, but they are big enough to feel and enjoy, but not so
big that things are moving around on their own.</p>

<p>The sky is overcast, but not dark, though there are a few dark
spots of clouds around.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't seen any 'wild animals.'</p></li>

<li><p>We have not met our students yet; we've been organizing ways
to sort students and get them into useful classes.  Similar levels,
good class dynamics; that kinda thing.</p></li>

<li><p>I've met several peeps, but haven't had any rally-calibre
conversations so far (we've been too busy).  Close: with Annete Cox, a
seminary something something who is looking at an overview of
religions, not really getting *into* the religions.  She's married to
a guy named Alan Nelson, who is one of our guest speakers. Oh that
reminds me I want to transcribe some of the notes I took in his
lecture.  There will be a lot of lectures.</p></li>

<li><p>My roommates are Shawn and Shinji (a CC).  Shawn is really
funny.  I have a little bit of dirt that I bought and poured water
on.  No visible growth yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm using janette's quilt and Gail's jammie jams every
night.</p></li>

<li><p>I've met Slavena and Kremena, but I can't instantly tell them
apart yet.</p>

<p>I learned how to say blogodaria today.  "Thank you" in
Bulgarian.</p></li>
