I am now certified for Open Water Diving!  I think that means I
can go down to 18 meters, so long as I have a diving buddy and a
supervisor type person.</p>

<p>Today Chris and I did three dives, and I was much more effectively
able to descend; I used a combination of trying over a longer period
of time to equalize, allowing a bit more pain to be 'okay' and just
relaxing into the experience.</p>

<p>We got down as far as 10.1 meters I think, and that's where we did
the bulk of the little skills, like fin pivot and hovering and mask
removal and nose blowing.</p>

<p>That last one was my own little addition during the mask removal.
When I went to put the mask back on, I could feel my nose wasn't clear
and wouldn't be too happy with mask clearing, so I gave both nostrils
a good honk before replacing my mask.  Chris seemed pretty impressed,
suggesting we add that as a new skill to certification.</p>

<p>We didn't get out to the Nebukawa train station sign (an earthquake
sent the train station tumbling from the mountain into the sea, and
the sign is still intact (painted each season by the local dive shop
owner) and a good diver-tourist trap), but I look forward to doing
that with Chris when I get back to Japan after PB.</p>

<p>Chris said the visibility was the best he had ever seen it at this
dive site, so I had a really good opportunity to explore.  But I
forgot to bring my contacts.  And I unthinkingly sent my underwater
camera case onto PB already (it went from the PB office
today).  So I couldn't see the good visibility and have no pictures
from underwater.</p>

<p>The second to last skill was one of the scariest for me: Emergency
Swimming Ascent: while blowing out one breath, go all the way from
some meters down to the surface.  I blew too quickly at first, and
the surface didn't seem to come quickly enough for my breath, so I
had to push to keep air coming out.  But Chris said I did well and
noted that I didn't go up too quickly.  I'm glad about that, though
at the time it was the opposite of my worries.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the surface I had to inflate my BCD orally.</p>

<p>Then was the last and scariest manuever.  Taking off my tank while
on the surface.  The tanks are really heavy, plus we wear weights in
the BCD and I was like, <em>how can I hold it up?  What if I drop the
vest?  I'll lose my regulator, be swimming while wearing a weight
belt, etc etc etc</em>..</p>

<p>.. but then Chris showed me how to do it.  It's easy!  The super
heavy tank floats.  He rode on his like a horse and it was great.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to ride on my tank, but I floated on it like Jack
Dawson before he died (in the version where he was in much warmer
water with scuba equipment) until time to put it back on.  Chris
showed me how to basically "sit down" into the BCD jacket, and made it
look really easy.</p>

<p>I was definitely unable to do that, but I got it on with my face
(mask and regulator) down in the water and wriggling under the tank
and into the jacket like a crab who found a new shell.</p>

<p>Somewhere near the last of the skills was sipping air from a
freeflowing regulator.  This was easier when I did it the wrong way
(face down so the bubbles could knock off my mask) than tilting my
head, but I was able to do it.</p>
