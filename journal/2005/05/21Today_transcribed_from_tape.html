<p>Shawn says HI.</p>

<p>Somehow I lost my clear and green folders with paper in them.  Been
looking for them for a few hours.  Just had a boring meeting where we
were introduced to the passengers. Going to have a costume party.</p>

<p class=date>10:01pm</p>

<p>I just shaved my head and beard with Dan's green shaver, but I have
two uneven streaks of hair on either side of my head cause I had my
glasses on when I shaved and a couple of missed spots for overall
effect, but we're going to a costume party so I'm just going to put my
hat on and then be all "Woah!!  Nice Wig!" when I take it off.</p>

<p>Took a shower; I found the folders, I had tucked them into a
manilla folder, so I was looking for the wrong color; they were on
the chest of drawers in my room.</p>

/></a> Just walked out of the party; met a dude named Kumau, who is
playing a reggae mix, but I jetted out of the party.  My ears are
still ringing.  Loud music and good beats.  We had wigs and crazy
stuff.  I wore my hat and then switched to yellow wig and then gave it
to someone, revealing my hair with crazed sideburns.  Katt got
pics of each side with me and Audrey.</p>

<p>I'm about to go up to the 8th deck, which is where we can walk
outside; I'm at the door now and I was going to let you listen to the
wind, but this is transcribed.</p>

<p>According to my GPS, we are 310 km from Kobe and now traveling
31.4km/hour.  We seem to be going well past Kobe, like 90 degrees
tangential to where Kobe is.  (later Pat pointed out that Japan is
shaped more like an L than a straight line; we have to loop around the
L and up north to get into Kobe.)</p>
