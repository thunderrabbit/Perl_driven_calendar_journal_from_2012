Hey Rob,

Just checking in and giving you, what has become a biannual
event...The report...This one wont be that long, as it is four in the
morn and I need to get to bed. But if you dont know already im in
Korea, been here for almost four months and absolutely loving
it..everything about it. I actually enjoy Japan, the country, much
more, but I enjoy the people here way more than Japanese.

If you ever have a hankering for a visit you are more than welcome to
crash here. So what are you up to, how was the bike treck, or the
volunteering,,,did any of that ever happen, are you still in japan,
working for nova...please say no, have you gotten married to the older
woman..hmmmm all the possibilities and the answers are just a email
away....

I will be here for a year and then off to China,Mongolia, Bhutan,
Nepal, India, Kazakistan, Russian and Europe for a year long journey,
im pretty stoked about it...

Well bro, let me know what you are up to

Late

Andrew

Yo G

Thanks for the update; I think of you often: attached is the first
picture in my photo album from Japan, so every time I look through my
pictures and it wraps around from the end to the beginning, this
picture comes up and everyone goes, "who is that?"

"That's DruDaddyG.  He was my first friend in Japan.  We were in the
same batch of Nova cookies."

The pic was taken 15 April 2003.

I'm an AT at Kamata NOVA now, getting an extra 10,000 yen every month.
It's kinda hard, but fun overall.   I'd like to move out of this
apartment though; I've heard I can get a better price, but I don't
know where to start looking.

For fun these days, we hang out drinking by the kiosk at the station.
Great times!

I climbed Mt Fuji with some of my friends last July.  Images are here
(sorry no thumbnails)

I</a> haven't actually left Japan since I arrived that day I met you.
I've traveled a bit around the country: Yukimatsuri in Hokkaido,
Expoland in Osaka, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Shibuya....   I rode my bicycle
to Gora station in Hakone.

Okay, all of the above is true except the shit about Nova.  I finished
my year contract and then moved out and worked for Gaba for a year.
Gaba was much better for me: computers in the classrooms, only 1-to-1
lessons, and students who will speak up (considering they are all
1-to-1; ain't no one else to hide behind)

I finished my Gaba contract in March this year and have been sorta
jobless for a while except I'm working for my friend's uncle. 

BUT I will quit even that job: I will be on PB's 49th Global
Voyage starting May 21st!  <a
href="/travel/pb/49/itinerary.shtml">/travel/pb/49/itinerary.shtml</a>
Going around the world teaching English on this big-ass cruise ship.
About 14 teachers, 800 passengers (mostly Japanese).  I'll be in
charge of two classes (6 people each) twice each day we're on the
water.

I don't have to pay, and I don't get paid, but I'll add like 19 new
countries to my passport and see tons of shit I've never seen
before....   I have nothing to compare this trip to in my experience..
it will kick ass.

Before the trip, I am getting scuba certified...  I've wanted to for a
while, but just never did it.  Now I'm doing it.

I'm glad you got gmail; I'll add you to my mass email list.

What are you doing in Korea?  Your huge trek sounds awesome.  I know
you'll have a blast + 1/2.  Have you been home yet?

To answer yer Q's: I don't work for Nova, I'm still in touch with
janette but we're not married.  I'm not even dating anyone who I
consider marriage-worthy.   I never did my long-ass bike trip; Hakone
was the farthest.  My plan was to ride TJ Bike around or get on P
Boat. I was accepted for PB, so I'm chillin' and getting rid
of my apartment before I go.

Volunteering turned out to be too expensive; basically US$800 to be
there for 2 weeks.  Fuck that.  I'll just go as a tourist if I'm gonna
pay that much.

And that's that, Jack; peace out
