<p>Last night was the third or fourth night of new timezones.  We
just threw this graduation ceremony together in like a couple hours
but it looks like we got it all and it's all good.</p>

<p>Audrey was tossing together a map in realtime and we just handled
it all, even as the students began to enter the room.</p>

<p>I didn't really say a lot for my classes because Hitomi had been
harassing me and I wasn't in the mood and I didn't know what to say
for my Shy Girls class who have vexed me all voyage by not
talking.</p>
