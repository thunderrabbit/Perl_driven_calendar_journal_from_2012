<p>I caught two fish with my bare hands!!  If by catch I mean I held
them out of the water long enough to get photos of them.  I stood in
this frigid glacier stream as the salmon were vying for space up the
stream.  I was just super patient and eventually scooped one up!  I
can see how bears would enjoy doing this.  I stayed for a while,
hoping to get a realllly good photo, and caught another fish.
Katt got a good pic of it as well.</p>

<p>We were a bit low on time so I resisted the urge to walk upstream
through the corugated tubes.  They were perfectly straight (but
certainly sprinkled with spider webs) and went to the other side of
the street.  I can imagine the faces of the other passengers when I
popped out of the tube.  「！びっくりした！」 they would say.
HAHAHahahahahaah  that would have been a riot!</p>
