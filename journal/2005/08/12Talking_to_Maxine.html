<p>I'm chilling with Maxine at her jewelry stall.  We just saw Matt,
Emi, Petra, Greg, and Nicole walking around.</p>

<p>I'm here because after I dropped off my skates, I determined I
didn't have Tami's phone number!  Nightmare!  I was really sad at
first, but then I saw someone eating a new ice cream cone so I knew
ice cream cones must be available nearby and I went to get one to
satiate my emotions.  Dairy Queen less than a block away produced a
Blizzard with Reeses Pieces (no M&amp;Ms), and I walked back toward
P.B and saw a girl behind this table and she just breathed the
biggest *sigh* in the planet and I felt sorry for her so I went up
and made like I was looking at jewelry.</p>

<p>Just spent 3 hours talking to Maxine.  Just chatting in English
and I practiced a tiny bit of Spanish.  She said she learned Spanish
in one month in Mexico.</p>
