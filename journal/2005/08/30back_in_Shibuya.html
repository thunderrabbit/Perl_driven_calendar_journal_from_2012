<p>Wow; has it really been 2 days since I changed my clock?</p>

<p>Katt and I have been wandering around Shibuya, starting with El
Torito and then ice cream and now chillin' in a KFC during a rain
storm.</p>

<p>We saw a passenger from the boat, and we saw Olivia randomly in
Shibuya station!  We talked to her about ten minutes and did a quick
version of catchup..  Olivia is working hard and Jen is in Bali for a
quick visa reset.  I didn't ask about Tetsuya nor Dan...</p>

<p>Katt and I found a club called Christ On, which had a biblical
motif and is probably a goth club.  They had a door (and Katt
said therefore a cover charge) so we didn't go in.</p>

<p>I fell asleep several times on the way from Nihonbashi to Shibuya
despite my intention to tell Katt stories of the various
stations...  I didn't even budge for Tsunashima nor Motosumiyoshi.</p>

<p>It's so weird to see Japanese people and think "they must be from
the ship!" but then realize, hey - everyone around us is Japanese!</p>
