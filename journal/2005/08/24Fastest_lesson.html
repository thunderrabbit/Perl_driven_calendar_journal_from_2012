<p>I'm about to practice with Brandt for the one hour day.. we are
doing the open lessons, and he seems to have taken it over.  I
volunteered to do it originally.  (Thanks to wonderful Kim) I had a
plan for the beginner version (variants of "time flies"), and had my
plan for the high level lesson (discussion of time dilation according
to Einstein's theories) and then Brandt came in with his idea and
there became no room for my ideas.</p>
