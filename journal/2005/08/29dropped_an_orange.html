<p>New timezone; back into the Japanese timezone!!!  Katt and I
walked around the top of the ship and I dropped an orange that had
been sitting in my room, but hadn't been eaten for quite a long time.
We are traveling quite slowly, so there was basically no wind and very
little wave action.  We could hear the orange go gabloosh into the
water.</p>
