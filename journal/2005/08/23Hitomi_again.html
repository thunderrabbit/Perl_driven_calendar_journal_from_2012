<p>Argh; I've been taking a hard stance against Hitomi who is jealous
of me talking to Katt.  Argh argh argh argh.</p>

<p>I was just so irritated I bent the fuck out of a fork and just left
the dining area and came up to where it's FREEEZING cold to dissuade
her from coming to talk to me, and she came up and froze and was like
like, "I'm cold; can we go inside?" and I'm like, "no; I came out here
cause I want to be alone.  Get out of here if you're cold."</p>

<p>Rar.</p>
