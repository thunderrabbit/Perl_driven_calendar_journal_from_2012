trying to do something weird with my straw after I showed her how to
wind it up and pop it with a flick of the finger.  It split and
someone tried to stick my orange soda bottle through the split, but
spilt it on Katt's blouse.</p>

<p>Funny Katt!</p>

<p>The music at this bar was loud and dancy; I could imagine Natalie
or Sally dancing on stage, and wondered if I could be enticed up there
as well.  I really can't salsa well, but which would win: the lure of
women or the lure of not trying to salsa?</p>

<p>Also today, we saw some dudes playing backgammon, and a guy with a
rifle.  It's not often that I can get pictures of guys with rifles,
though I see them a lot.</p>
