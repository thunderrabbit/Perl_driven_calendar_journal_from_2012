<p>Today was post port holiday after Acapulco.  My bed is now covered
in food and stuff from Acapulco.</p>

<p>Watched a movie about and met a woman who was 1.3 kilometers from
the atomic bomb in Hiroshima.  Yikes.  </p>

<p>It was argued that the US dropped the bomb not to end the war more
quickly and with fewer casualties, but simply to test the bomb and its
effects on humans.</p>

<p>I just finished lunch and checking Yuma's speech.</p>

<p>I have noted that I've lost all interest in learning Japanese.
Don't know if it's cause I lost the momentum or just got sick of the
language while on the boat.</p>

<p>All the grammars seem to have uncertainty or "I think so" built
into them.  Grr; just say what you wanna say.</p>

<p>Had a GET meeting then planning for Fashion Show meeting (I'll be
wearing sweatshop-made clothes (GAP and Nike)).</p>
