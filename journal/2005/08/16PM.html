<p>I quite enjoyed the English session with George Meegan, and at one
point I wasn't following him at all, but he definitely has some
spirit and ideas that I may or may not understand.</p>

<p>Saw a bunch of whales, but the one that jumped well out of the
water was definitely the star of the show.</p>

<p>Got ready for classes tomorrow: Cheerful Dancing Fellows should be
easy; they are working on their speeches.  However, Happy Wonderful
Shy Girls are another story; they don't all have speeches, so I
printed out a little lesson on Saying Goodbye; we are down to near
the end dawg; this is nearly it.</p>

<p>I'm going to apply for 52 and for 54.  Apparently the third voyage
for teachers means we actually get paid.  Paige told me.  I don't
remember how much, but still.</p>
