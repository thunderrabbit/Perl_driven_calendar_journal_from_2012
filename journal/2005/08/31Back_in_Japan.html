<p>I am back in Japan.  Staying in Kellie's house and she is bunking
up with her husband in the next room.  She has really worked to help
me feel at home here and I'm really thankful for that.</p>

<p>Booyah!  and my bags have just arrived <em>and</em> I had enough
cash to pay for their delivery.  Barely.</p>

<p>I'm watching the news of Katrina the hurricane's impressive
devastation.  I hope my peeps are okay, but there doesn't seem much
chance that everyone got out unscathed.  Interesting to see an area
that I have been to on the news like this.  I can say "I've been
there" for some of the images on TV.  Also interesting is the
financial effect of losing the casinos.</p>
