<p>Up on the port deck now watching the rest of the passengers yell
over the rail before they leave and get one more day of food and fun
on the ship.</p>

<p>I got my stuff takubined to Kellie's house, though they wouldn't
guarantee what day it will arrive, much less what time.  But it was
cheap.</p>

<p>Kuni asked me to throw something to the ship: a bag of nuts
attached to a sturdy ribbon of plastic.  I was like, "aight," figuring
I can whirl it around my head and release at the right time to send it
on its way.</p>

<p>I am *sure* it would have made it, but one of Kuni's friends
stepped on the inside of the ribbon, so it got stuck on his leg and
just stopped in mid-trajectory and fell.</p>

<p>Tetsuya, the cruise director saw me from the bridge deck and gave
me a big batsu (X shape with his forearms).  I hope I haven't mucked
my chances to sail again..</p>
