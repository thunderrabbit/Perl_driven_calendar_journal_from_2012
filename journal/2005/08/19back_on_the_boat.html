<p>We are back on the boat now.  We saw the fishing derby, but I
didn't get a picture of Francois hanging with the fish; that would
have been so so awesome, but I just didn't speak up before the guy
started pulling them down.  I was a bit embarassed to be a man with a
rabbit in front of all these manly fishermen with fishguts and blood
all around.</p>

<p>I thought for a long time about how to pose Francois vs a huge
locomotive, but didn't come up with anything in the super short time
we had before we had to be onboard.</p>
