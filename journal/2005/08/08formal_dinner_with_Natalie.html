<p>Tonight was a formal dinner, and I luckily got a four-seat table
alone with Natalie; we shared fun stories and I told her about my
skating accident and subsequent palm reading.   She got 90% of the
story, but I cropped parts of it for time.</p>

<p>After dinner I chatted with Naho (one of my students from Cheerful
Dancing Fellows) for over an hour to continue our conversation we had
had during the end of Chat With today.</p>
