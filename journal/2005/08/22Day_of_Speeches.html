<p>The speeches have been good.  Most of them are fine and some are
so so.  I am pretty nervous about mine.  I plan to study mine during
the break, but fuck we have a GET Meeting during that time.</p>

thought about her English and I was like, "you gotta stop being shy or
you won't learn" and she cried and cried for 25 minutes.....  she just
did a speech.  I am *so* proud of her and *so* impressed...  It's *so*
*great*!!!</p>
