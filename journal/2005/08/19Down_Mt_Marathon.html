<p>Heading back down.  I did some scree sliding while coming back
down to meet Katt.  I basically got it on video and a cut my hand
a bit, but nothing bad.</p>

<p>The mountains here are basically tree covered up to a point, and
then there are rocks and snow above that.</p>

<p>We met Kyle on the way down; she was on vacation.  She works in the
tundra and to keep the bears away, was singing a song (about the
tundra plants).</p>

<p>On the way back down, I told Katt about Char Crofut, who has
been a sortof like spiritual guide for me.  She always watches my
crown chakra when we communicate.</p>

<p>We saw a little chipmunk.  He let us get pretty close for photos.</p>

<p>Around the same time we were on the mountain, Natalie was on Exit
Glacier.</p>
