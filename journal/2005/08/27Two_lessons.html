<p>I learned two lessons today.  I had a Kamau CD listening party,
trying to sell the remaining CDs I have of his.  Only Hitomi showed
up.  Don't just haphazardly buy CDs and expect people to pay me back
for them.  Should have asked exactly who wanted them.</p>

<p>I donated 1000 yen (to Audrey) to help pay for the GET Namihei
party, and I expected Audrey would be all, "hey guys; Rob gave 1000
yen!" but she did not.  I guess if I had this expectation she would
say that, then it wasn't given as a true gift.</p>
