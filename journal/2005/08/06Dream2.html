<p class=dream>I got a bunch of packages on my bed.  I was like, "holy
shit" cause there was so much.  Only one of them was for me.  They
were all for someone who is apparently having a baby soon because they
sent baby diapers and socks and stuff.  I sorted through it all to get
my stuff and noted some of the items were socks for the Sock Puppet
Making workshop I'll be doing.</p>

<p>That reminds me of something funny.</p>
