<p>The beginning of our chat was a bit rough cause I she acted
surprised that I came despite her shenanigans.  I had seen Hitomi at
the immigration thing in Broadway before we arrive in Alaska.</p>

<p>We went to Yacht Club and I joked about counting whales in
Japanese.  Naho hasn't seen whales yet, but really wants to.  She is
so cute!</p>
