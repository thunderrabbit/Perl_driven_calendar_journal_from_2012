<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<ol type="I">
<li><p>My computer is not plugged in; when it shuts down I'll be done.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm on P.B's 49th global voyage, and like that, it's
basically over.  I correctly predicted the last half would go by like
SNAP!</p></li>

<li><p>We have one last port tomorrow (Seward, Alaska) and,
interestingly, I rarely used the pre-voyage research I obtained for a
few of the ports.  I can't think of any examples, at least.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been hanging out a lot with Katt.  She's cool.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been stalked on and off during the voyage by Hitomi.  Some
days she is bearable and some days the opposite of bearable.  For some
reason it sees like most days she is unbearable.</p></li>

<li><p>Carissa's parents are onboard.  That's cool.</p></li>

<li><p>There's a cat named George Meegan onboard.  He's in Guiness
Book of World Records for having walked the farthest (from bottom to
top of the Americas along the western edge, with a dogleg around the
perimeter of the southern, eastern, northern US states).  He has a lot
of stories to tell.</p></li>

<li><p>I figured out my angle on long treks.  If I walk 100+ miles, I
will do it barefoot.</p></li>

<li><p>Meegan says, "I'm not interested in learning Japanese; I have
bigger fish to fry."</p></li>

<li><p>I talked to him: told him of my skating accident, recovery,
premonition and confirmation that I will do something for the world.
He gave me a copy of his book (he brought four copies onboard) and
gave me some ideas.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>be open to ideas</li>
<li>stand silently with a string of people along the entire wall in
Palestine.</li>
<li>open a skate park in Palestine</li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>Part of my story includes Rebecca telling me that when I am
ready, I can go into meditation and ask my angels what is my task.
Why haven't I been ready?</p></li>

<li><p>I have enjoyed sharing stories with Katt.  She's pretty
cool for a girl.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm falling asleep.</p></li>

<li><p>I figured out a few days ago that I like everything about
myself except my sex addiction.   That is the only thing for which I
consistently lie.  Tricksy bastard that.</p>

<p>For example, basically the only hidden entries in my journal are my
exploits of who I chased (and who chased me) and who I kissed,
etc.</p></li>

<li><p>I wrote to Niveen recently.  I'm not chasing her.</p></li>

<li><p>Last night I went to Katt's RENT listening party and Kuni
tusseled my hair and gently traced her fingernails on my ear.  I
basked in the good feeling and wanted her to want more specifically
so I could turn her down.</p>

<p>After the last little incident where she enticed me to a private
room where I was horrified to find Hitomi waiting... oh my god that
was horrible.</p>

<p>and soul purifying.</p></li>

<li><p>kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk</p></li>

<li><p>Definitely falling asleep.</p></li>
