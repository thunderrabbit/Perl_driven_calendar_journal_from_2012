<p>We are in the all-English session with George Meegan.  He seems
impressed that most of us quit our jobs to join P.B.</p>

<p>He showed us his tattoo.</p>

<p>His stories inspire and amaze.  Check him out if you can.</p>

<p>We were interrupted by whale sightings several times, and most of
them were boring: Way off in the distance, we see a little bit of
spray and then watch the spine slowly slide by and then the tail flips
up and shoops straight down and the whale is gone.  Well,
underwater.</p>

<p>BUT, one time we were all climbing on couches with noses pressed
against the windows and this whale JUMPED out of the water did a half
turn and kerspalooshed into the water!!  Yah - that was cool.</p>
