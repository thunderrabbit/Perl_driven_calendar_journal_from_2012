<p class=date>[] 25 August 2005</p>

<p>This day lasted the hour that we set our clocks back.</p>

<p>At the very last minute, after Brandt took over the high level
lesson and had quite specific ideas about how fast it should be done
and was just whizzing through everything, I was like, "nup" and
decided he could do it.  I just handed the mic over to him and was
like, "you can do it," and stepped back to watch.</p>

<p>Kim did her Beginner lesson and Brandt did the Advanced one and I
just watched.  I later realized it was better that I hadn't gone
onstage with Brandt (part of his original idea) because generally, we
only had one teacher onstage at a time during the open classes.</p>

<p>Generally, I did not understand the presentations; they were all
in Japanese and not translated.  I understood the dances being done
in fast motion, and I understood when they handed out breads for
'breakfast' and fruit for 'lunch.'</p>
