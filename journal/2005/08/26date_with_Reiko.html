<p>In the middle of Reiko's date with all the GET Boys (male GET
Teachers) I suddenly wonder why Dave seems so friendly (he's like,
"yah if you come to Cambridge, give me a call and we'll go to lunch"),
but I never say things like that.  Never even think them.  Is it
because I don't want to get close to people only to have to say BYE to
them again (like what Bryn was saying all those years ago)??</p>
