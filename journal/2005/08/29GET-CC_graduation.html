<p>We had a private GET T / CC graduation ceremony in the theater, for
whch we thankfully did *not* have to get dressed up.  Audrey presented
us all with certificates and compared us all to various things: The
Big Dipper, a bag of trail mix, toilet bowl cleaner, a huge shaver
with a radio attached to the side, Bobby from the Tae Bo video, a big
bowl of corn, the Topaz crew, the Namihei, GET Room 10 closet, the
light above your bed, a big huge comic strip, etc etc etc.  Joel gave
certificates to all the CCs, and Emi and Allison gave certificates to
our leaders and each other.  Really good times.</p>

<p>Haha!  Emi presented an award to Matt the Artist, her husband.</p>

<p>Afterward, we attached sheets of paper to our backs and all signed
notes for each other and it was great.  Lines of people writing on the
back in front of them.</p>

<p>Went to the top deck for drinks afterward.</p>

<p>Hitomi chased me down and asked me something and I was like, "no -
write them down."</p>
