<p>The wind is realllly powerful; I've got my recorder inside a
plastic bag to protect it from the rain.  It's really cool and really
amazing; the wind is crazy hard and huge waves and the rain is
painfully peltingly stinging anything that ventures beyond the
protective walls.</p>

<p>Katt and I spent a great deal of time above the Yacht Club,
screaming into the wind and being pelted by the rain on the port
side.  The starboard side was basically not windy at all.  We
screeched like Cartman from Southpark.</p>

<p>After about 15 minutes, we were spotted by a guy wearing a
parka-looking coat and flashlight.  He asked us to get off the top
deck and into the boat where it's safer.</p>

<p>We've had to stop burning CDs because the ship is so tipsy that
it's causing the CD players to have errors during the write process.
These are for the yearbook and English lesson CDs.</p>
