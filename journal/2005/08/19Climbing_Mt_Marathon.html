it's pretty steep - about as steep as it could be without us
slipping.</p>

<p class=date>NOONish AKDT Friday 19 August 2005</p>

<p>I left Katt happily sitting with out backpacks.  We were passed
by some performers that are on the big ship parked next to our ship.
They are on for a contracted period as passengers take week long
voyages.  They perform four shows twice each during each voyage.</p>

<p>Matt, Josh, Danielle, and Danielle.</p>

<p>I went up to chase them down and see what was near the top.  The
mountain is really windy, but not really cold.  It's not SUPER windy
and blasting cold like Mt Fuji, but still a worthy climb.</p>

<p>I got pictures of them and they got some of me and then we parted
ways (I continued up, and they went down into a valley for lunch).  I
offered to take pictures of them from my vantage point and said I'd
email them if they emailed me and gave them my card.</p>

<p>The picture of me sitting on the mountain is a self portrait; I set
the camera on a couple of rocks.</p>

<p>Looking down from the super windy vantage point, I could barely see
Topaz.  It's behind the other two ships in this pic.</p>
