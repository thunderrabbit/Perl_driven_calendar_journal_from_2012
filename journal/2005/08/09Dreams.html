<p class=date>8:55am MST Tuesday 09 August 2005</p>

<p class=dream>Shawn got up to go to my class, and then I realized it
was a dream, so I woke up,</p>

<p>but he was really gone, so maybe it wasn't a dream.</p>

<p>Today we are experiencing hunger as we are willing/able to do.  I
plan not to eat until tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class=dream>Koji was flying a kite back and forth in the house.
He told me he didn't have any money, so I was watching him from the
yard, and his kite was on the left hand side, and he turned around,
and it was still flying well.</p>

<p class=dream>Phat Pat was walking around in a sleeping bag and I
was like, "hey Pat, come here; I wanna show you something" but he
walked away.</p>

<p class=dream>Brandt opened up a kiosk where he was selling gum he
found on the ground unchewed.  Hitomi came up and asked if she could
get a discount on hang gliding, cause she only had $12, I was like,
"you can fly for free for one minute, and if you like it, you can pay
later."  She took more than one minute.</p>

<p>I have to get up soon to teach Shawn's class.</p>
