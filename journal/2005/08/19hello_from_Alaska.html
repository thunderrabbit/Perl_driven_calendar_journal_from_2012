HI Everybody!

The fiords in Alaska offered more interesting glaciers and animals
than the fiords near Norway.  We saw ice calving from glaciers (summer
or global warming?) and otters floating around amidst small icebergs
between which we carefully glided.

Oh!  and we saw whales!  For a day there were practically whale
sightings every 20 minutes, though for the great majority (all but 2)
we just saw a bit of spray as the whale exhaled, then the dorsal curve
downward until the tail flipped up then disappeared.  That always
meant "the show is over."  Everyone would be all excited and
squealing..  I was never impressed; whales breathe.  They swim.  I
agree it was *neat* to see wildlife, but not worth squealing.

Except one time, when a whale about a kilometer from the boat leapt
out of the water with a spin and dramatic splash... "OH MY GOD THAT
WAS AWESOME!!!" and people talked about it for the rest of the day.  I
wonder if anyone got it on video.

Classes are over; my quiet girls' class left with nary a peep, and my
loud and crazy class made me a big card with my favorite class photo
and wrote things like "I came to enjoy English through you."  I'm so
so thankful.

Our jobs as teachers are basically done except for three big days of
events that will be held over the next few days after Alaska:
graduation, prom, speeches (teachers in Japanese then the students in
English) and project presentations: video, performance, and journal
teams will be featured for a couple hour event.

There's a man named George Meegan onboard.  He walked from the
southern tip of South America to Barrow, Alaska over a long period.
He has many stories to tell, and is promoting a revolution in
education where every child is rewarded for what they're good at
doing, not punished for being bad at certain subjects.  DEMOCRACY
REACHES THE KIDS is his book, though I don't see an ISBN or publisher.

His lectures are full of surprises and tangents as he brings random
people onstage as examples or has the entire auditorium go onto the
top deck to experience the world more directly.  Engaging, unique,
revolution, spirit.. these words come to mind but don't want to be
wrapped in sentences.

I've heard a rumor that the weather is beautiful outside; I'm going
now to experience it.  I spent some hours last night creating art
with Matt instead of writing an email like this one.
