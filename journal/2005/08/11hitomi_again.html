<p class=date>4:40am PDT Friday 12 August 2005</p>

<p>Katt and I were watching Simpsons in GET Room 4 until around
3:50am, and she went to bed and I wrote in my journal about finding
Francois and then went downstairs and for an apparently 'random'
reason, Hitomi was on the 4th floor writing in her notebook and I came
down (with the intention of going to bed) and I saw her and was like,
"aw fuck," and she asked me where I had been and what I had been
doing.  I told her "upstairs, having a picnic" and she was like,
"what?" and I was like, "this conversation is over," and she basically
let me go.  I went upstairs to 6th floor with the intention of taking
the elevator down to 3rd floor to bypass Hitomi, and then on the 3rd
floor, she was just walking down.</p>

<p>I believe she couldn't have consciously known, but it sure was
convenient for the fates.  I stopped and she stopped and we spent
THIRTY MINUTES of her asking me why I don't talk to her and me saying
"because I don't trust you and you won't let me go to bed when I want
to go to bed."  She was like, "I want to sleep with you," and I was
like, "no; it's not appropriate," and she finally gave up and was
like, "can I hug you?" and I was like yes, but didn't hug her back,
and then she was like, "will you hug me?" and I'm like, "only if you
don't tax me for it later," cause she has used my compassion for her
as a human as if it's love for *her*, and I hugged her, and then she
looked up to kiss me and I was like no, and then she was like
something, and I was tired and thinking what the hell, and went in to
kiss her and then *she* pulled away, and I was like, "oh, fuck
off. what. do. you. want. ??" and she goes, "do you feel?"  "what?
yes I feel. What are you talking about?"  "do you feel bad or good?"
and finally I realized she was asking if I have any feelings for her,
and I was like, "no.  I don't love you; I don't want to kiss you; I
don't want to talk to you; I don't want to fuck you; I just want to go
to bed."</p>

<p>And she seemed to get it and then began to walk away and I was
like, "you can do it," (wanting to bless her cause I know it's hard
for me to pull away from someone I love,) and she was like, "what???"
almost sounding like she took offense, and I'm like, <em>ah jeez, how
can I fucking explain Namaste to this girl?</em> and that turned into
a big fuckin' thing too, and I just collapsed onto the floor and was
like, "good god just fucking go away," in tears, and "can I please
just go to bed?" and it's like some power thing; each of us want the
other to leave first, and then she's like, "don't cry" and I'm like,
"man, fuck you, I'm crying because of you; I'm just devastated
here."</p>

<p>I'm in my room and too tired to feel too sad, and I haven't taken
a shower for a while and the tears just burned sizzling body oil into
my eyes.</p>

<p>I also had to write a note to Kim to tell her that I wouldn't be
joining her tomorrow in Vancouver; I am just too completely wiped
emotionally and physically.</p>

<p>I think I put the note under the right door.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Oh, *and*, though Hitomi may have been unaware that I would be
coming down (and therefore not actually waiting for me), she certainly
pounced on the chance to talk to me and went straight to bed after I
got rid of her.</p>
