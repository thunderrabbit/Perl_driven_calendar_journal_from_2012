<p>I have just written the first part of the mail I plan to send
everyone tomorrow from Vancouver.  Right now I'm wrapping up some
question cards for my next class.  Puttin' 'em in my pocket so they
won't get ripped up.</p>

<p>I'm looking for Niveen's email address and it's completely
shocking that I don't have it!  I've looked in both places where I
could possibly have put it, and it's not there.</p>
