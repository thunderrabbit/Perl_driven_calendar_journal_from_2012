<p>Oh my gosh I am seeing all these Harajuku Girls (as noted in Gwen
Stefani's song) wearing little cat ears and giant boots and frilly
lacey goth-French-maid outfits.  Stuffed rabbit necklace pendants,
tight shredded pants, necktie worn as a belt, streaky bleachie white
hair, lip piercing, black oversized hats on sideways.  The fashion
here is just so confused: rap, hip hop, goth, cos-play, etc, all
combined.</p>
