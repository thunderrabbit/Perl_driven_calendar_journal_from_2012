<p>Today was a long day and it's not quite over yet.</p>

<p>When I switched my keyboard to Dvorak layout (I'm typing this in
qwerty now), I broke my C key so it won't stay on.  (In qwerty, it's
my rather important I key.)</p>

<p>But all of that is not why I'm writing.  Tonight we switched to a
new timezone.</p>
