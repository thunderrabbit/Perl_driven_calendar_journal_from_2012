<p>I'm here at Chat With, but my student is not.  It's only a 15
minute chat, so it's pretty short.  During my previous lesson a dude
behind my student *fell* out of his chair.</p>

<p>I just saw Fei, who claims he is not Francois' captor.  He's
supposed to get proof that it wasn't him.</p>

<p>At the end of Chat With, Naho came and chatted with me, though she
hadn't actually signed up for it.  She tries really hard to learn and
speak English, so I was happy to chat with her.  Also, no one had
signed up for that timeslot.  She asked me about my online journal
and asked why I kept it.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>I want to be famous</p></li>

<li><p>I want to share my storie</p></li>

<li><p>I want people to be able to see what I'm up to</p></li>

<li><p>If I become famous later, I want proof that I was just a
regular dorky guy back in the day.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Best I can understand, she said she doesn't like expressing her
inner thoughts on paper.</p>
