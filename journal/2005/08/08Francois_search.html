<p>People have been generally loving my interpretations of Francois'
captors' demands.  I have been unable to explain it to any Japanese
people, except for one, Aki, in my CDF class.</p>

<p>I went to sports bar to see if I could find Pat at the magic show
where I thought Francois might be.  He wasn't there, but Natalie and
some salsa peeps were there doing some crazy fun salsa moves.  The
girl grabs the guy's hat, then he grabs it back and throws it over his
head, and they do all sorts of crazy spins and zaniness.  I was like,
"woah."</p>
