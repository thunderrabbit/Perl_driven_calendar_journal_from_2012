<p>Katt and I went to Yacht Club for teatime and there was a long
ass line going all the way out the door and down the stairs.  I
hypothesized that the little snacks given at teatime couldn't have
suddenly become *that* popular, so I bypassed the line to see what was
up.  People were queued to get cups of whiskey coffee.  Absolutely
unbelievable what things are popular in various cultures.  I hate
coffee and I hate whiskey, so I did not join the line.</p>
