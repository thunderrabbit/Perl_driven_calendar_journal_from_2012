<p>Holy crap I haven't recorded anything yet today!  We didn't have a
holiday; the girls class was quiet of course and my second class was
GREAT!!!  They taught each other: Aki taught carimba, Naho taught us
to make origami snails, and Yama taught about scuba diving.  I didn't
have to help them prepare anything or do anything myself.
Fantastic!</p>

<p>I slept for a while, then lunch, then Hitomi came in and talked to
me for 12 minutes, though I had said 10 minutes, and I tried to
explain that she doesn't respect my boundaries and that's what pisses
me off.  She's asking foolish questions like, "am I your friend?"  and
"have I ever been your friend?" and I'm like, "use your brain; there
are times that we have fun and times we don't."</p>

<p>I was just so overwhelmed that I went to the back of the boat and
just put my hood over my head and cried.  Katt saw me at tea-time
and I ate some cake with her and some old Japanese guys, and then
suddenly Katt was like, "welp, time to go!" and I was
like, <em>shit; you're leaving me alone with these guys?</em>, which
is nothing against them, but I just was not in the mood to be genki
for them, but then she put her hand on my shoulder and was like,
"let's go," and we left.</p>

<p>I recognize that *I* would not have excused myself so easily; I
didn't *have* to go, though I may have wanted to go.  I guess I don't
put enough importance on my own needs for time alone.</p>

<p>I think I need to practice leaving.</p>

<p>We have finished Family Guy and Simpsons, so now we are in story
telling mode and she's been telling me about her pets: big dog that
puts up with Katt's harassments.  And her big rabbit named
Bunbunchun who goes crazy if Katt feeds the dog without feeding
the rabbit.</p>

<p>I almost met George Meegan, who walked from the tip of South America to
the top of Alaska.  He's a cool cat, from what I can tell.</p>

<p>I told Katt about how I found my men's group and how Kim
Sawyer taught me to create art in a spontaneous way instead of
necessarily planned.</p>
