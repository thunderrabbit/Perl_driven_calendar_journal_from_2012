<p class=dream>Playing soccer on a big soccer field with a bunch of
players.  I was not being very aggressive; people were moving the ball
down the field (as they do) and I decided to play offense, and I kept
sneaking past people as the ball was coming toward me.  I would sneak
past the next person, basically tracking the ball back and forth and
basically jump past the next person.  Then then ball went next to me
and I got past it and then it got close to me and I was like
'woahwoah' and kicked it into the goal, and there was no goalie, but
it just went barely past the line and I got a point for our team.  The
game was over or I was done, and then Greg came up, and was like
"we're going to make you a plaque." and I was like, "cool."  "Now
you're name is spelled with three N's right?" he joked, but I was
like, "well, actually, if you use Robert Nugen Junior" there are three
N's.  He goes, "but if you use Jr there are only 2 N's"</p>
