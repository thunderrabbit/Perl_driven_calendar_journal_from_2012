<p class=note>(crying voice)</p>

<p>Hitomi is chasing me again and I just want her to leave me alone.
It was after Minoru's party like dancing and fun and fucking Hitomi is
stalking me in the stairs like she is waiting for me.  And I'm lke,
"no, I <em>can't</em> talk to you."  She's like "I want to know how
you feel," and I'm like "just go to sleep and leave me alone." and
she's like "no no no just don't be angry."  "Then fucking go to bed
and leave me alone."  God.  Finally she did leave.  I called Natalie
looking for her, and I had to fucking yell at Hitomi and I was running
away from her in my room and I can't close my door.  It's like, "just
stop, Jesus."  She had written me a letter that promised she would
stop talking to me.  That's what I wanted.</p>
