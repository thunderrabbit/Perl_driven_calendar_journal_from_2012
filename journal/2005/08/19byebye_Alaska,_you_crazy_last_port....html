<p>This is the last port.  We handed out champagne and watched the
port go away.  Funny is that we were right next to a huge ship and we
all waved to them and they all waved to us, and there was some kind of
cruise-ship connection, plus we were all emotionally high on this
being our last port.</p>

<p>I chilled with Naho in a heated area of heat being dumped out from
the lower decks.</p>
