<p class=note>(crying)</p>

<p>Fucking devastated by Hitomi.  She won't leave me alone.  She
chased me all the way to my room telling me to calm down and stop
crying, and I'm like I'm crying because you won't leave me the fuck
alone you stupid fucking fuck.  I fucking ripped Francois' ear and
neck because I wanted to rend Hitomi's neck.  Stupid.</p>

<p>But the good thing is I was able to get the alcohol in.</p>

<p>She was like, I just want to ask five questions.  I was like,
"no." then I was like, "alright, noon on the boat holiday for one
hour," and she was like, "why didn't you tell me before [that you had
the time available]?" and I was like, "I just fucking thought of it
now cause you won't fucking leave me alone" and then she was like, "I
wanted to talk to you before P-B," and I got pissed.  I was
like, "you fuckin' should have talked to me SIX WEEKS before PB instead of springing this shit on me less than a week before
P-B and I would have told you to not fucking come."</p>

<p>((Her version of that story is that she *did* tell me well before
P-B that she wanted to go, but I "didn't believe" her.  (I
fucking believed her, but I believed *everyone* "wanted" to go on
P.B because *everyone* said they wanted to go.) ))</p>
