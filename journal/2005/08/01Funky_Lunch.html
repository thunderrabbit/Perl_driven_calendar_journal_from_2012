<p>Just had a fucked up lunch situation.  Petra was like, "hey you
wanna go to lunch?" and I was like "yeh" but I got there a bit late,
and the table Petra was at was all filled up, so Nicole was like,
"oh, you wanna sit here?" and invited me to sit down.</p>

<p>Brandt came back and was like, "oh, that was my seat," and Nicole
said, "oh, I couldn't stop him," which is actually the opposite of
what happened; I was invited to sit down.  But for some reason I
didn't think to say anything.</p>

<p>We actually *lose* an hour tonight, which is weird, cause we are
headed directly west, according to the setting sun.</p>
