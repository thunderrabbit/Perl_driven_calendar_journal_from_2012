<p>Just about to go to my Cheerful Dancing Fellows class.</p>

<p>I was talking to Kuni and Brandt swooped in with onion rings and
got a kiss on the cheek.</p>

<p>Wooooo..   I heard a bit of rumbling on the ice and was sure it
must have been a bit of snow tumbling down.  I didn't actually see
anything, but I am sure that's what it was.</p>

<p>Everyone was on top deck as we sailed super slowly into the fiord
area.  I really loved this line of ice, which looks to me like a water
current boundary.</p>

<p>Topaz crew went to get a block of ice.</p>

<p>We all happily froze and cuddled on the top deck.  Thanks to
janette for her quilt!!!!</p>
