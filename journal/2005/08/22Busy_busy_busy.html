<p>We switched to a new timezone last night.  That was two in a row
and there is one more tonight. We are switching so quickly that I'm
totally losing track.  They don't tell us what timezone we are in,
only that we should switch our clocks forward or back an hour.</p>

<p>Last night I offered to print copies of the graduation certificates
for everyone, and then Yuuka was like, "oh - don't worry about it,
Carissa is going to mail merge them to get the students' names
printed."  So I aborted and then just chilled out, watched movies, and
worked on my speech for today.  It's actually quite a good thing that
I got to work on that; otherwise I don't know if I would have been
able to do it today.</p>

<p>This morning Audrey was all, "oh, Carissa is really busy, so she
won't be able to do the certificates; can you print them?" and I was
like "sure," but also wondering what was all the confusion about.</p>

<p>Turns out, behind the scenese Yuuka would rather have them printed
so we won't have to worry about any teachers with bad handwriting.</p>
