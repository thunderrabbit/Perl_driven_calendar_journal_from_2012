<p>Audrey's Vancouver Port Orientation was funny cause it was fuckin'
written exactly the way she talks with all her wicked fun and crazy
ass language crazy mad tunes.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>We are still looking for Francois; I am suspicious of most English
speakers, which is mostly just the GET Teachers.</p>

<p>The water is an ugly brown green color, like old dried moss filled
scabs.  Now I'm going to dinner.</p>

<p>Nicole asked me if I had any art on the boat after I described my
style of painting to her when I was chillin' with her, Petra, and Matt
the Artist in Agora while he was painting.  I said I didn't, but would
be happy to draw/paint one for her.  Matt donated a heavy sheet of
paper and I put a few marks on it.</p>

<p>What was really weird is having Petra and Nicole both say "you
should talk to Tracy at the Pink Cow" when Matt said he was looking
for space to sell his paintings.</p>
