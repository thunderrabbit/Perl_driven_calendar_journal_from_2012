<p>We're doing Peace Fair tomorrow, and my booth is making sock
puppets.  Several teams are doing different things, and Peace Fair is
one of them.  When it was time for the GET Teachers to present Peace
Fair, I borrowed Brandt's sock and put it on my hand (after letting
it air dry a bit).  He and Nicole held the Sock Puppet sign I had
made when it was time for individuals to describe their specific
booths.</p>

<p>Without even *trying* to disguise that it was me, I ducked down
behind the sign and put the sock up.  I said in a slightly weird
voice (kinda bummed out but high pitch voice):</p>

<pre>
"Hello.  My name is Jason.

And I am a sock.

But I am very sad, because

I don't have a face.

So I hope you will come

to help me and my friends

be happy and have faces.

Thank you."
</pre>

<p>And then I stood back up again and looked around like, "hey guys;
how's it going?" and handed the microphone to the next person.</p>
