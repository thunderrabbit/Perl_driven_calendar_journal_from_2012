<p class=dream>I was on a subway and the train could turn ridiculously
tight curves anpd it was like going down a spiral staircase, and
specifically the electric wire powering the train was dangerously
twisting and dangerously close to my head, it seemed as the train was
spiraling down.</p>

<p>This is the 60 year anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb.  Only three
of seven Happy Wonderful Girls came to class today.  One is overland,
so she has a good excuse.  We went to the top deck and practiced
yelling to converse.  I spread us out along the side of the rail and
was like, "what are you doing?"  "I am looking the ocean!"  I didn't
correct their grammar; I just want them to fucking speak up!  Rie said
her throat was sore, which I'm half inclined to believe.</p>
