<p>After that I went to the top deck where No Music No Peace festival
is going on.  Basically the music is not good enough to make me
withstand the freezing cold wind so I came downstairs.  I may go back
up at 1:30am to watch the merengue performance (starring Natalie,
Shawn and Miki) and then the Irish dancing performance starring Dave,
Carissa and Kuni.</p>

<p>I did go back at 1:30 and saw those performances.  Beyond that was
more guitar stuff so I left.</p>
