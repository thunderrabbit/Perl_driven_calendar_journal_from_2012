<p>Today for Guest Teacher Day, I taught Shawn's classes and he taught
my classes.</p>

<p>Today is hunger day; I and several other people on the boat are
not eating.</p>

<p>Tonight we gain an hour, so it's an extra hour to be hungry!</p>

<p class=date>4:10pm MST Tuesday 09 August 2005</p>

<p>Some people are like, "OH I'M SO HUNGRY!!!" and I'm like "whateva;
I'm a bit hungry, but."  It's the same as me being out here saying,
"IT IS SO COLD!!!" and some people would be like, "it ain't that
cold."  But serious, it is fuckin' frigid out here; they wouldn't
know what they would be talking about.</p>

<p>I just sent janette an email!   I still need to videotape the boat
like a video tour.</p>

<p>There are Hunger Day lectures going on in Windjammer and in
Broadway.</p>

<p>The Windjammer one just finished.</p>

<p class=date>8:10pm MST Tuesday 09 August 2005</p>

<p>I haven't eaten in basically 24 hours.  I'm hungry, but I'm more
hungry for sex; I want to chew on someone, anyone; yargh.  There is
just no where on the boat to hook it up.</p>

<p>I might go get some sugar (actual literal sugar), but I'm also
thinking "rar! no food! only water..."</p>
