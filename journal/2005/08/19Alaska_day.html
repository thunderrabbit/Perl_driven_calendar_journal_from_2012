<p>Katt says the weather is warm here in Alaska.  We are about to
head out and go climb Marathon Mountain, if we can find it easily
enough.</p>

<p>We came out on the 6th floor, but there is no building; just a ramp
that comes all the way down.  Muddy gravel surface we are walking on.
Lots of shipping containers.  Katt says there's a guy in NZ who
made his house out of shipping containers.</p>

<p>Hahaah we got a bunch of pictures of Francois being naughty.</p>

<p>That started when I saw "CAUTION LOW RAILS" next to a rail so low
it looks like a curb.  And then a picture of him on a mooring line
next to a sign that says STAY AWAY FROM MOORING LINES.</p>
