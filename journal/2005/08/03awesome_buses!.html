<p>Holy crap the busses here are AWESOME!!!  We were bumping to the
loud dance beats blasting from the system in back, and having huge fun
watching the driver drink a slushy and the doorman holler at his
friends and strangers to come ride.  I met a guy named Dr Sergio who
is a root canal doctor and an English instructor.  He speaks Spanish,
Yiddish, English, French, German, Austrian, Swiss, Hebrew, and Arabic!
Holy fuck!  He was super friendly and really interested in sailing on
P-B.</p>

<p>We are totally bumping to Right Said Fred's "I'm Too Sexy" dance
remix.</p>

<p>Holy crap!  The bus driver pulled off to the side of the road and
his doorman jumped out and got a drink for him at a vending
machine!</p>

<p>The front dashboard is covered in stuffed animals.  There are
bikini bottoms decorating the speakers.  This totally makes me think
of Jason Fricke; we would love bumping around in these buses!</p>
