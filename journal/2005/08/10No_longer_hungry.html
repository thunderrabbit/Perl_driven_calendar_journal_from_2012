<p>I'm done being wiped out from hunger.  That was good.</p>

<p>The waves are really rough with really short wavelengths.  So the
ship is not all that rocky, but it is a little bit.</p>

<p>Just had lunch with Katt, Petra, Natalie, Carissa, and then
Shawn came to replace Petra and Carissa who ran off to smoke.  Shawn
showed us his wonderfully edited video for "are you gonna be my girl?"
featuring Miki (in Shawn's class, not the perfect-bi-lingual 16 year
old Miki) and Yama, who is in my class.</p>
