<p>I've been in 4 GET Street creating art with Matt The Artist, who
has been on board teaching art classes which (in my story) consist of
just saying "do what you feel like doing; there is no correct way to
do art," painting various posters, and overseeing art projects like
making trees (that are now on display somewhere (public radio
station?) in New York City).</p>

<p>He donated a sheet of 100% rag watercolor paper (I was going to say
"a piece of paper") a week ago or so and I put some lines on it, but
then got too busy and didn't work on it for a while.  I commented that
I didn't think I'd be able to finish it before the end of the cruise.
He was painting and I asked if I could borrow some of his ink.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>At this point, we have worked together on two "Exquisite Corpses,"
a name I had never heard of, but just means tag-teaming on paintings.
I started one and he had already started another.  The only rules are
there are no rules, and the result is total freedom of expression!!
We are just creating for the pure joy of creation and I love it.</p>

<p>I just took pictures of my piece and our two pieces.  They are not
finished yet, but they could be.</p>

<p>The two exquisite corpses:</p>
