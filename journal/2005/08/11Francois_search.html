<p>It's the 80th day of the voyage and I *just* *now* found out we
have folders near the GET Board where students can write us notes.
That's where the first clue was trying to send me.  Carissa said she
didn't know until a week ago.  She suggests they replaced the ones we
had had down in GET Office.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to the Sunshine Bar to find another note.  *aha*</p>

<pre>
      In the most recent article about kidnapped rabbits, please find
      the third person quoted.  That will be the password to open the
      first document.
</pre>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Where could there be an article about kidnapped rabbits?</p>

<p>Where could there be a *most recent* article about kidnapped
rabbits?</p>

<p>Something that has repeated articles?  On the boat?  Encarta??</p>

<p>I spent a great deal of time on this, and ultimately decided there
could not possibly be any actual articles about kidnapped rabbits,
though I must admit I did a couple of Encarta searches of various
intensities.</p>

<p>So there must be a fake article about kidnapped rabbits, and the
only articles I knew of were typed by Tami as little snippets from
actual news headlines.</p>

<p>I zipped up to the English news binder and found a page on top of
all the others:</p>

Authorities are frantically searching for clues regarding the rabbit
Francois, who went missing on August 5.  A ransom note was delivered
on August 7, and apparently the demands were met, but the rabbit was
not returned.  "This is why you should never bargain with rabbit-nappers," 
said Shawn, a co-worker of the owner, "they will keep asking and
asking for more.  Eventually when they get tired of the game they will
just throw the rabbit overboard and run away- or maybe paddle.  At any
rate, you can never win."  The P-B Daily English Newspaper on
August 8 published more demands from the rabbit-nappers.  The new
demands are that the owner, Rob, wear his shirt backwards until
Vancouver, take off his ugly nail polish, read a poem "Ode to
Francois" in a public meeting, and shave the left half of his head.
The translator himself, Fei, offered no comment.  He is claiming a
journalist's right to protect his sources and refuses to divulge who
the rabbit-nappers are.  A huge controversy has begun about a
journalist's right to protect his sources and his duty to ensure the
protection of innocent stuffed animals. Kim, a close friend of the
owner, said, "I was shocked that the translator of the newspaper would
print such scandalous things in the newspaper.  I assure you that I am
canceling my subscription immediately.  We should all boycott any
organization that is willing to cooperate with rabbit-nappers in that
way."  Authorities are asking anyone with information about the rabbit
to come forward.

On August 5, a stuffed rabbit known as Francois went missing.  The
disappearance had stumped authorities because no clues were left
behind as to the rabbit's whereabouts.  Early in the morning of August
7 a ransom note was discovered near the classroom where Rob, the
owner, teaches English class.  According to sources, there were
demands made in order to secure the release of Francois.  The
authorities have refused to divulge the contents of the ransom note
for security reasons.  "All I can say is that I'm glad it isn't my
rabbit.  This is a terrible thing for anyone to have to go through.
Fortunately, Rob has a good support network here and we are all going
to help him.  We won't rest until Francois is brought back," said
Brandt, a close friend of the owner.  Authorities say that they have
many suspects, but due to the lack of clues they are still not close
to making an arrest.

Onboard the P-B, a Japanese-based cruise ship/NGO that is
traveling around the world, a blue stuffed rabbit known as Francois
has been kidnapped.  The owner Rob at first thought the rabbit had
just gone to play with some of the children on the boat.  "I knew
something was wrong when Francois didn't join me for dinner.  He never
misses a chance to nibble on my carrot sticks," said Rob.  A general
search has been started for Francois and authorities are still hoping
for the best.  In the meantime the general public is being asked to
participate by searching in laundry baskets and trash cans around the
ship.

<p>Kim and Katt cracked it; 'brandt' is the password, but he is
not the third person quoted in the most recent article.</p>

<p>We ultimately recognized he is the third person quoted on the
paper, Fei isn't actually quoted.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Fuckin' hell, this is supposed to rhyme: "far" and "Francois."
Katt believes it rhymes. Silly girl.</p>

<p>It looks like the white square could look like a whiteboard, which
exists in the GET meeting room.  I bet he's there.</p>
