<p>Again in Dvorak layout, and it's actually vaguely bearable, as if I
am just on a really foreign keyboard.  I think typing in different
countries around the world helped because I had to learn where
different keys were on different keyboards.  That kinda jostled my
brain into the idea that keys aren't always where they should be..</p>
