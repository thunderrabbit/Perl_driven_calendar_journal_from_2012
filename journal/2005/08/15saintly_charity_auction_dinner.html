<p>Good thing no one shows to silent football anymore cause I thought
there was a game and invited people, but the T-club, where I thought
the game was to be held, was fully occupied by the private dinner
that had been purchased for 60,000 yen or so.</p>

<p>The woman who bought it invited her cabin attendant, the person
who makes rice on the boat, her teacher (Pat), the cruise director,
and someone else kinda random, but that makes sense.</p>

<p>I was really impressed that she didn't persuade her friends to
just chip in and gorge.  What a saint!</p>
