<p class=date>10pm MAGST Sunday 28 August 2005</p>

<p>Today, we went to the presentation I didn't want to do, and we had
to wear suits and I didn't want to and it was for some stupid
yay-thanks-for-being-onbaord crap.  We gathered at 4:45 and got free
drinks (orange or champagne) and there was a jazz band and Captain
Costas introduced his crew and then people ran off to dinner and we
were supposed to go to the GET meeting but Katt and I nixed the
location: Hemmingway, cause I totally hate cigarette smoke.  I
apologized later cause I hadn't been very gracious about the way I
said I didn't want to meet in Hemmingway.</p>

<p>At the second copy of the same presentation (for the other half of
the passengers), we were cutting up more and taking pictures of
Francois drinking champagne and being totally silly and my 73 year old
student Shunji came up to us GET Teachers as we were having Francois
drink champagne and he said something that sounded like "lick nipple,"
and I was like, "what??" and he said it again and rubbed his nipple
and we tried to think of anything it could be, but it really sounded
like "lick nipple."  He went away and we were baffled.</p>

<p>((and then Hitomi came up and I was like no, fuckoff, go away,
leave me alone, I hate you, but she kept talking and hounding me and
finally she somehow convinced me to meet with her tonight and I put a
 30 minute limit on it but was pissed about meeting her at all.  later,
on the way to dinner Katt was like, "you shouldn't have talked to
her at all," and I was like, <em>fuck off about what I should or
should not do. I shouldn't have done a lot of shit, I know.</em>
"grr"))</p>
