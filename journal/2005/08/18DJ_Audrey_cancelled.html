<p>Thank goodness I was woken up.  I wanted to be up to meet Audrey
on the top deck for her 6 hour DJ extravaganza.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It's raining up on the top deck; Audrey's thing almost certainly
got cancelled.  I'm still glad to get outside, because, true to the
comment made by one of the teachers on the 48th, we should "go outside
every day; because some days it's easy to forget..."</p>

<p>I am also supposed to meet my class on the top deck, but that
won't be happening, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Man, one day I'm going to get video of this ship.</p>
