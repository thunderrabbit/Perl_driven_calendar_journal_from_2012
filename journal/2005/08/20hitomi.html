<p>Played Silent Football: Katt, Francois, a shoe and I played
first.  Then Hitomi took the place of the shoe.  Then Naho joined us.
Naho moved Francois as if he were playing.  We had fun.</p>

<p>I invited Hitomi to my GET classroom to show me pictures that she
has been wanting to show me.  She brought cookies, knowing I would
like them.  I worked hard not to eat all the cookies in 1 minute.  She
fed me the last cookie, which I shouldn't have accepted.  I engulfed
the entire cookie and she was like, "ah?" and wanted me to feed her
some from my mouth.  Pulled part of the cookie out of my mouth and
offered it to her, but she didn't want it.  She jokingly went in for a
kiss again.  I shut down, pulled away.  I was like, "don't touch me,"
etc and just put up a total barrier.  Looking at pictures was okay,
but a tiny step toward that which even a grandma wouldn't call sex,
I'm nixing.  I wouldn't accept her hand when she wanted to make peace.
I wouldn't let her hug me after she said she understood how I felt.  I
absolutely know how it feels to want a hug.  But I can't let her in
anymore.</p>

<p>"There is a history between us; I must have stronger boundaries."</p>

<p>She left, crying.  I'm sorry it had to come to this/that.</p>
