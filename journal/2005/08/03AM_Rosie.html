<p>We are in Acapulco!  We're talking to Rosie, our tour coordinator
for the day.  She is going to get us hooked up with a scuba diving
guy!  I'll go with Angie and her boyfriend Ryan <em>who drove down
from Minnesota(!!)</em> to see her!</p>

<p>She drove in circles on the not-really-parking-lot area in order to
turn around.  It was great.</p>
