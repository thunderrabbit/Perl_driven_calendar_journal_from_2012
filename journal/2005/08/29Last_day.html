<p>Today has been a final whirlwind to finish this crazy awesome trip.
I have somehow packed two suitcases while watching Matrix 3 and we had
a GET / CC graduation ceremony then free drinks and pictures upstairs
and Hitomi tried to talk to me but I flat wouldn't let her.  Then GET
meeting and Audrey/Yuuka thanks and dinner then paying final bill and
now the day is basically over like zoooom!!</p>

<p>Wrote all that and this in Dvorak in 8 minutes!</p>

<p>The Happy Wonderful Girls wrote me a card and Yuka, who cried
after I told her to stop being shy, said that moment affected her in
a positive way.  Awesome.</p>
