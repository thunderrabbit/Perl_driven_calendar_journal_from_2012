<p>I've just finished today's first class (the Happy Wonderful Girls,
two (of seven) of whom were present); I have only 4 more classes with
them.  It's been quite a challenge for me to know what they want/need
to study because they simply won't speak up in class.</p>

<p>At all.</p>

<p>Ever.</p>

<p>Individually they are happy to talk and ask questions, but it's
like complete silence when they are together.</p>
