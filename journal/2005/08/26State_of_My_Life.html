<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I am using Dvorak keyboard layout.</p></li>

<li><p>I am on P.B's 49th Global Voyage; we are almost done.
It has been quite an incredible ride.</p></li>

<li><p>The C key popped off my keyboard; I broke it when I rearranged
my keys.  D'oh!</p></li>

<li><p>My computer power supply got a bit fried; the end of the plug
soaked in water while it was plugged in.  Now when I plug it into the
wall, it glows as if it is also plugged into the computer.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been hanging out with Katt, a Kiwi from
Wellington.  She laughs loudly.</p></li>

<li><p>Francois is back safely.</p></li>

<li><p>My back is sore from sleeping in these cramped beds.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm not sure about my finances; I plan to get that sorted once
I get back to Japan, buy tickets to Texas and Palestine (Jerusalem),
fly to those places (with a stop in DC for anti-war protest 24-26
September) and hang out and work, respectively.</p></li>

<p>I just finished writing the State of My Life all in Dvorak layout.</p>
