<p>I've got Francois back!!  I got stuck on a couple of the clues, but
it turns out I had been on the right track: a clue had been left in
one of the women's restrooms up on the 7th floor, but (!) the clue had
been tossed into the garbage before it could be recovered.  Also, I
didn't know we had folders in which students could leave us
notes/messages/etc.  One of the clues was like, "look where students
can communicate with us," and I was like, "where ??????" but Petra was
like, "go back to the GET Board" and I looked more carefully and found
the folders.</p>

<p>For a while I got stuck on the one that was like, "In the most
recent article on kidnapped rabbits, find the name of the third person
quoted.  That's the password of the first file," but then I realized
it must be in the English news section of the boat: faked articles
about rabbit-nappings, and I found it.</p>

<p>Katt and Kim got the password; it was the third name quoted on
the page, but not within the 'most recent article' ah well; I'm just
being anal.</p>

<p>The clue revealed in that file gave the location.  Francois was
tied up in a plastic bag on the back of the whiteboard in the GET
meeting room labeled in Japanese [do not steal, please.]</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm walking back from the seminar room now, with Francois in my
pocket; I am almost embarassed to be seen with him..  I just want hugs
first from Kim and Katt (who helped me get him) and feel happy
that he's back and sad he was gone and be with people who
understand.</p>
