cooler than the fiord in Norway, which featured no glaciers.  We are
even seeing some calving, though I didn't actually see anything big.
I think I got a picture from someone of a nice calve, though.</p>

<p>We had to turn in our evaluations by four PM, and I did it, but my
evaluation wasn't there when Audrey went to go pick them up.  Hmmm.
I wonder what happened with that.</p>

<p>Fuckin' Hitomi called me and wants to talk about something.</p>

<p>I wonder wtf happened with the evaluation; I was all happy to have
turned it in well on time and stuff.  Crap.</p>

<p>The wind is going just about the same direction as us, and the
waves are coming along with the boat.  There are some low hanging
clouds and there's a bit of fog.  The smoke from the smokestack is
blowing forward and a bit to the starboard side.</p>

<p>Alaska is the day after tomorrow.</p>
