<p>It's been a while, and I thought I already wrote about these, but I
can't find them.  I want to get these done before I forget!</p>

<p>It was my first time to dive, so my mind was on <a
href="http://oneworlddivers.com/">Chris Goodman</a>, my diving
instructor in Tokyo.  I wanted to show him the equipment we used, so I
took pictures of Francois using the equipment as a guise.</p>

<p>Angie and Ryan chatted about whatever they chatted about.  I could
just imagine how cool a trip Ryan had just taken, driving down from
Minnesota (or one of those northern M states) just to hang out with
the lovely Miss Angie.</p>

<p>Our instructor, Jimmy, on the left, and our driver / diver (forgot
his name) on right.</p>

/></a></p>

<p>On the way to the diving spot, we saw many many many neat houses and hotels.
This was one of my favorites.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Images/5.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Thumbnails/5.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>We finally arrived at the spot, an island in Acapulco Bay.  After a
quick training session, we were ready to go.  I felt a bit nervous
that I wouldn't be able to equalize my ears, but using the line to go
down, I found it was no problem whatsoever.  I think the warmth of the
water helped a lot.  (During my training, I was wearing a 7mm wetsuit,
and was still cold.)</p>

<p>The water wasn't crystal clear, but it was fine for a first dive.
I headed down, and then realized I wanted my camera.  I used the
universal sign for camera toward our guide, and he went back up to get
it.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Our guide picked up this little crab.</p>

/></a></p>

<p>After a bit I was like, <em>aight; I can do this; where's my
rabbit?</em> and decided it was time for Francois to swim.</p>

<p>I was much more comfortable with equalization, so I didn't worry
about surfacing again to nab him myself.  I was like, "hey
Jimmy...  can you throw me my rabbit?"</p>

<p>He got Francois and made a half throwing motion toward the water to
make sure that I in fact wanted him to get wet.</p>

<p>"Yeah yeah; perfect!"</p>

<p>And with a light &lt;plip&gt;, Francois began his dive.</p>

<p>At first he didn't want to go down; maybe he didn't want to get his
outfit wet.  Kuni had made it for him a few days before.  Maybe he
wasn't equalized.  I had to totally squeeeeeeze the bubbles out of him
before he would stay submerged.</p>

<p>Then he happily drifted with the currents, which were gentle but
sometimes faster than I wanted them to be.  I took many photos, trying
to get him near some fish.  I really wanted some fish to take an
interest in him, but they seemed more interested in staying away.</p>

<p>Got some pics of Angie, Ryan, then me holding Francois.</p>

<p>These are the only other Francois and fish pics I got:</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Images/14.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Thumbnails/14.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Images/15.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Thumbnails/15.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>We dove for about 40 minutes, 1 tank each.  I didn't adhere to the
buddy system; I lost Angie, Ryan and our guide, but I stayed near the
rocks where we had started.  We were only in 3 meters of water, so I
wasn't too worried about running out of air.</p>

<p>Before I ran out, our guide found me and checked my air.  He
indicated I should go up, so I did.  Probably had 50 bar (is that the
right unit?) left.</p>

<p>A really funny thing happened after I surfaced and gave my tanks to
Jimmy.  I kept my mask on and went swimming a bit
and <em>*almost*</em> tried to breathe under water.  No snorkel.
Woah; that would have been worth coughing about.</p>

<p>An equally funny thing happened: Angie dove into the water and lost
her bikini bottoms down to her ankles.  Fortunately, she recovered
them before anyone got a strip show (besides the fish (who I'm sure
would have closed their eyes except for lacking eyelids)).</p>

<p>But I bet Francois saw everything.</p>

<p>On the way out, we saw a turtle!</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Images/16.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/diving_in_acapulco/diving_in_acapulco-Thumbnails/16.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Our driver / guide saw him; I'm sure we all would have missed him
otherwise.  It woulda been so cool to dive near a turtle!</p>

<p>Francois was horsing around and got stuck in the anchor.</p>

<p>That naughty rabbit!</p>
