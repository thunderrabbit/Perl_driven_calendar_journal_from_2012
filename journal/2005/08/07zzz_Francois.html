made three sock puppets and sold one for $2.  No one else made any
sock puppets; I guess a bit more promotion could have changed that,
but I certainly enjoyed just having quiet time to myself.</p>

<p>During my quiet time, Shunji the 11 or 12 year old climbed on me
while I was sock puppet making.  He has taken to repeatedly
asking/yelling/screaming "what are you doing?" and then laughing
hysterically as he says "I don't know."</p>

<p>I gave him Francois some days ago, expecting him to come back with
Francois soon thereafter.  But, being 11 or 12 gives one a
delightfully responsibility free lifestyle.  Today on the GET Board on
GET Street there was a ransom note for Francois.</p>

<p>On most computers in GET Street the desktop had been changed to
show Francois captive.</p>

<p>And a text document showed the captors demands.</p>

<p>After the Language Olympics and Peace Fair, I wrote an Ode To
Francois and put a copy in the book as requested by 5:56pm on my way
to the GET Meeting room.  At 6:01 only Adi (Adriana) had arrived and
then Dave came by and was like, "the GET Meeting is on the top deck
today," which basically meant there was not much of a meeting besides,
"great job on Language Olympics and Peace Fair!!"</p>

<p>To the top deck and into the hot tub with some other GET Teachers
plus Joel the CCC and (my ex) Hitomi and her roommate Mika plus Kuni
(who has made 2 outfits for Francois) I merged and Kris asked me if I
had written the poem as requested.</p>

<p>I was like, "Ah- it will be okay."  Audrey goes, "yeah man, he's
over it."</p>

<p>I blew it off specifically to make her think I hadn't, to see if
this would trick a Francois captor into *not* checking for the note so
I could determine who did it.</p>

<p>Later, Kris was like, "what if they send you a severed leg?"</p>

<p>I said, "I dunno..  I doubt that will happen, though."</p>

<p>((What I *should* have said after Kris was like, "what if they send
you a severed leg?" is like, "I'll have Kuni sew it back on!"))</p>

<p>We chilled in the hot tub for about an hour until it was only me,
Audrey and Joel the CCC being quite silly in conversation.  We finally
headed out and to dinner, though Audrey was a bit late due to being
left to carry down a lot of the stuff from the Language Olympics and
Peace Fair.  She asked me to take some stuff down (which I did), but I
didn't know she had been left with so much more that it would keep her
from dinner; I would have helped more..  Anyway she was jokingly like
"you guys left everything and I had to clean it all up, including your
computer, Joel," and Joel was like, "but that doesn't mean you should
be late for dinner; my goodness."</p>

<p>Auds was in quite a frisky mood and tried to start a food fight by
throwing pieces of roll at Katt and an entire roll at Dave, but
the eruption of food madness never happened, though Katt did fire
back, trying to get bits of roll down Audrey's shirt.  Conversation
turned to where we had or had not had sex (which reminds me I want
to download the 100 and 500 question purity tests) and even the wait
staff all but joined the fun.</p>

<p>Later that night I changed the desktop background on the computers
to a copy of my Ode to Francois.</p>

<p>Katt says:</p>

<p class=note>Katt sold Kiwi stuff.  She is cool.</p>
