HI Kellie!

I don't yet know when we will be done exactly, but I know a few things:

1) I have many stories!
2) We will arrive in Yokohama on 30 August around 7:30am, but
3) GET Teachers prolly can't get off till noon
4) We are supposed to help unload passengers' luggage in Yokohama Port.
5) The boat will leave the port at 2:00pm
6) I have some boxes that need to go somewhere. (Your place? Texas? Hell?)
7) You are basically the first person I want to see, 
   for your stability and shared interest in PB.
8) I want to go out for a final overnight adventure with PB peeps.
9) I will not tell Hitomi where you live.  It's still an issue.

At your place, I just want internet, food, and floor for a few days
in exchange for all the stories you want....

This email was written in Dvorak layout.

janette!

Do you remember the days when you were a slow typist?  Well, I am in
my own set of those days because I have switched my keyboard to Dvorak
layout.  Fred may have told you about it; basically the most used keys
are on the home row, the center of the keyboard, for easy access.  I
am getting faster at using this layout...

The ship is really rocky now; we are in a storm and I love it!!  I
may go outside in a bit.

But none of this is why I'm writing - I will be back in the US soon
and would love to see you!!  I don't know where/how/what you are
doing, but if it would be possible to see you, please let me
know... I can exchange innumerable stories for food.

Also, I plan to attend an anti-Iraq-war march in DC 24-26 September;
do you know if Johnny is sending a bus up there?

I will scope my finances in Japan; there is a small chance I will go
directly to Palestine/Israel and not stop in the US.
