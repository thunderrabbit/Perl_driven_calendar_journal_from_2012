<p>This is the day Katt had her GET Closer thing, and Kill Bill 2
was on all day so I watched it.</p>

<p>Hitomi came up to me while I was supposed to be talking to my
speech student and I was like, "leave me the fuck alone," but
ultimately I met her for one second and "fixed" her computer problem
that took one single click and then she started asking me all these
questions about girls and sex and shit and I was like "fuck off;
leave me alone" and I got furious and left and then wrote her a
letter telling her that I hate when she follows me and she followed
me there.</p>

<p>I escaped the room and sat in the room where Matt was creating art
with coffee and Angie was in there and Nicole and I was just miserably
crying and wishing Hitomi would leave me alone.  Nicole went upstairs
with me to the top deck where I vented to her and then we had GET
Meeting and then Katt's GET Closer and then burned a CD for Brandt
and took pictures of Pat and Angie pretending like they were kissing
for the GET superlative survey (which GET Teacher is most like to be
famous?  Which GET Teacher is the craziest?  Which two GET Teachers
would make the best couples?, etc) and Pat and Angie got a lot of
votes (and Pat and Maryann (and Angie and Greg (and Greg and Brandt)))
so we got interesting photos.  I was often voted the craziest, to I
got some photos of me being crazy.  It was late at night, but Katt
did a good job as director of photography.  During most of this stuff
I was just emotionally wrecked inside, always on the verge of crying
cause I just feel like it's so fucking unfair that I must deal with
all this crazy shit from Hitomi.</p>

<p>During dinner Christina (my favorite server) was all funny and I
pulled the table cloth really far one direction and then she pulled it
back and then I pulled it again and put a glass on the edge so that if
she pulled it, the glass would fall.  She laughed.  Good times.</p>

<p>Katt talked to Hitomi while I talked to Nicole.  Katt
thinks Hitomi "got it" to some degree: things are not normal between
us because there is some history.</p>

<p>Today we are monstrously busy busy with speeches tomorrow and then
graduation the next morning and Prom the next night and our project
presentations the next day.</p>
