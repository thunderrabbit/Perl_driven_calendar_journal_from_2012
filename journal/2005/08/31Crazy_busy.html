<p>I'm just now beginning to get my shiznit sorted at Kellie's.  Way
tired, but heading out to Yoyogi park to meet the peeps for Kris'
byebye party.   She is leaving tomorrow and therefore won't be able
to attend the handover.</p>

out WTF I am doing.  Man - so super crazy busy and it's just like
waaaaaaathhhhaaaaafuckkkkkk am I doing???</p>
