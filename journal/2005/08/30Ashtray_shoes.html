<p>Last night I offered up my beloved (well worn) boat shoes up to
anyone who might want them.  I couldn't bear to throw them away, so I
put them on the Emergency Escape Breathing Device (which I don't know
how to use) near my room.  This morning I found two cigarettes crushed
out into the shoes, so I guess someone decided they were trash.  I
felt a bit sad, but I offered them up as a gift to the universe, and
if that's how they were to be treated, so be it.</p>
