<p>Vancouver Day: I am waiting off the boat to let Katt bring
alcohol off the boat so I can take it and bring it back *on* the boat.

<p>This is taking a bit longer than I expected for her to get the
bottles from reception.</p>

<p>I'm sorta greeting people as they come in and out of the boat.  I
don't want to look too obvious.  I hope she's not getting in trouble
or anything.  Not sure what's going on.</p>
