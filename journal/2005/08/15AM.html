<p>I saw a whale today; nothing like a whale ringing a bell at Sea
World, but I saw the little bit of spray as he vented his blowhole
and then he submerged.</p>

<p>I was amazed that the Happy Wonderful Girls were able to teach
each other.  We called and woke up Hanayo cause she works late in
Namihei.</p>

<p>I got a letter from Hitomi last night, basically apologizing and
telling me she'll give me space.</p>
