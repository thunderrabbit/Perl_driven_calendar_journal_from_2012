<p>Went to George Meegan's lecture on education.  He is arguing that
students should be taught / rewarded for more important things: Peace
/ Environment / Health / Social / Culture issues.  Then only people who were
*interested* in mathematics / science / literature / history should be
taught that.  And because they are interested, the classes could go
much further.</p>

<p>He suggests people graduate after they collect a certain number of
credits in each category, for life experiences.  A trip around the
world: Social-Culture-Environment-credits.  Bake a cake that doesn't
kill anyone: Health-credits.  If you can ride a horse:
Environment-credits.</p>

<p>People should be rewarded for what they can do, and not punished
for what they can't do.</p>
