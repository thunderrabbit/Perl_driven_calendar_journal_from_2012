<p>Tonight's rabbit search was interrupted by the Fashion Show,
including the Sweat Shop Fashion Show (( short version:  Nike bad;
GAP bad; Timberland good )).  I'm going to alter my beloved GAP
hoodie to say "BOYCOTT GAP" instead of just GAP.</p>

<p>Now Katt and I are going to watch Simpsons episodes.</p>
