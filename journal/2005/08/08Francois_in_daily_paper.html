<p>In the English version of today's paper, there were messages
sprinkled in various places.  Stuff like</p>

<pre>
Rob you better
meet our demands
or the rabbit gets it
Here are our demands
1) shave the left side of your head
2) wear your shirts backwards till Vancouver
3) remove your ugly nail polish
4) read Ode to Francois in the next GET meeting
</pre>

<p>For a long while I debated doing as they requested, taking into
consideration who I would be doing it for, the pros-n-cons of playing
along vs blowing it off, etc etc etc and I couldn't come to a clear
answer.  FINALLY, I had a brainwave as I considered telling the story
to Fred later.  I heard in my mind "what you shoulda done is..." and I
knew what I had to do. I followed the 'letter of the law' by</p>

<pre>
1) shaving the left side of my head (and the right side)
2) writing "your shirts backwards till Vancouver" on a shirt and wearing it
3) replacing the partially chipped nail polish with a new coat (*)
4) reading Ode to Francois in today's GET meeting (**)
</pre>

<p>(*) Actually, Katt had already done this nail painting the
previous night, so it worked nicely.</p>

<p>(**) This is the only thing I performed as requested, and Kim got
a video of it!</p>

<p>Fei is the CC translating the paper these days so he was the
obvious culprit, but he had a good alibi: a sheet of paper from the
supposed actual captors telling him to put that stuff in the
paper.</p>

<p>The pictures of Francois were taken with a "Canon EOS Kiss Digital
N" according to the information recorded within the photos.  I wonder
if N stands for something that got truncated.  I wonder who has such
a camera.</p>

<p>I queried Matt the artist to see if he had done it, and he said he
had not, but he told me he had seen the pictures on a girl's computer.
So I'm thinking Nicole; she has a nice camera, though I don't know
what make or model.</p>

<p>Kim thinks it was Joel the CCC; he would definitely do this type
of thing, and he has access to the CCs and basically has access to
GET street.</p>
