<p>Welcome to a new timezone.  Welcome to having eaten after 35 hours
of fasting.  I was actually okay when I woke up, but <em>after</em>
eating, I felt a little light headed.  I'm sure it's a combination of
energy going to my stomach to process the food and lack of energy to
go around.</p>

<p>Just had a lesson with my Quiet Girls, and it was like, <em>oh
god</em></p>

<p>AND guess who wrote me a letter after promising that she wouldnt:
Hitomi!  <em>aw god; stop writing me fucking letters!</em></p>

<p>I haven't read it yet; I am worried about the state of my brain:
50% chance she says something that makes me crazy.</p>
