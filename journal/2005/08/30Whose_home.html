<p>Oh man; that was weird to be in a convenience store and have this
feeling of home like, "ah, this is natural."  Fuck!  it's fuckin'
Japan!  This isn't home to me!</p>

<p>On the train now, and there are other passengers from the ship.
Girls across from me were singing the departure song as we left the
station and some of their friends on the platform.</p>

<p>The voice on the train says stuff like, [next station,
blahblahblah] and I feel this pang of being back in normality.  And
it's really tripping me out.</p>

<p>Woah.  Really tired.  I intended to be awake to watch (and tell the
stories as) my old stations go by, but I completely missed Okurayama,
Tsunashima, Hiyoshi, Motosumiyoshi.  I woke up at Musashikosugi and
again at Jiyugaoka.</p>
