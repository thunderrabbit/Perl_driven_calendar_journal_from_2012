Katt is going to record my speech.</p>

<p class=date>8:41pm HST Monday 22 August 2005</p>

<p>Okay now I'm nervous.  Greg just busted through his money speech.
Next is Carissa and then is me.</p>

<p class=date>~8:50pm HST Monday 22 August 2005</p>

<p>Done!!  Fuckin' relieved.</p>

<p>Hahahaha Dave is the timekeeper, and is supposed to ring a
bell if people go over 3 minutes.  That I've seen, he has only dinged
the bell on Brandt's long-ass speech.</p>

<p>I went up on stage and was like, 「皆さん、こんばんは。」 (Good
evening everyone), and he rang the bell for a good laugh and I
pretended to be shut down and walked off stage.  I laughed and gave
him high 5 and ran back to the mic for my speech.</p>

align="left" /></a> Stumbled all the shit through it and did the joke
with Francois (implying huge rabbits were a danger to cowboys on the
range), then <em>FORGOT</em> the line that includes my favorite word
in Japanese: 右往左往 and then talked about Johnson Space Center in
Houston and finished it to a chorus of cheers.  (as did everyone, but
it's still nice to hear it for my own speech)</p>

<p>Those lights are bright up there, dude.</p>

<p>Damn.  Katt recorded into my tape that some guy liked my
speech best, but, when trying to *listen* to what she said, I
accidentally *recorded over* part of it.  Fuck.</p>

<p>Today was the speech contest.  I was really glad when I finished
mine.  Not that it was near the beginning of the day.  I played with
the audience a bit; played with my speech to make it more entertaining
like I was just winging it, which Angie said she thought I was doing,
which is good news for me.  Greg said he liked it as well.</p>

<p class=note>5:19pm JST Saturday 24 September 2005: I don't seem to
have a copy of my speech on my computer, but I'm hoping/assuming I
recorded it onto a CD.</p>

<p class=date>4:29pm IST Friday 07 October 2005</p>

<p>For the record, while clearing out my crap from Kellie's house, I
found a paper copy of my speech I did when janette came to Tokyo to
visit me!</p>
