<p class=dream>Advice if he want to be a company, just get incorported
and be done with it.  This is from an executive of Warner Brothers,
cause when they started hanging out, pro wrestlers started sending
things in the mail.  Without being incorporated, the company would
have paid big fines.  "Well, what did they send you?"  "Well, a
powerpoint presentation, and slide projector and screen."  "Oh,
interesting."</p>

<p class=dream>As I was waking up, I saw a shark swimming around in
the hallway.  I was like, "woah, there's a shark", but he looked
pretty relaxed so I wasn't too worried about him.  Katt and Jack
came over and I was like, "hey guys there's a shark," but when they
looked, he was gone.  They didn't believe me.  Grrr.  But he really
was there.</p>

<p>In my dream!</p>
