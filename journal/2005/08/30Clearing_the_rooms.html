<p>Ah shit; I forgot we have to clean out our carry-on bags before we
meet at 7, so I am packing that now.  Getting the cash out of my safe
and stuffing my pockets with my final tape (I'm about to finish #32
now) and ready to head up soon.</p>

<p>Some people are crying.  I so far have not, although I dropped the
sideboard of my bed on my foot.  Ow.</p>

<p>I gotta turn in the proof that I turned in everything and get my
passport and then I'll be ready to get off.</p>

<p>I got Francois back!  Christine washed him!</p>

<p>We've been lugging luggage off the ship: different teams of
staff/crew/GET-T combinations are systematically going to different
rooms where the passengers are supposed to be waiting (to let us in
and tell us what to take) with their bags packed.  They are mostly
all ready.</p>
