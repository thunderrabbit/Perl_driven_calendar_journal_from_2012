<p>Just got back from breakfast.  There was a guy speaking Japanese
like fucking fast, even for a Japanese guy.  I was like, "dude; I
don't understand at all," and the woman next to him told him in
Japanese, "he doesn't understand."</p>

<p>The next time he spoke, he spoke just as fast.</p>

<p>I kinda appreciated it; that's the way he talks, and he wasn't
changing for anyone who couldn't understand.</p>

<p>Funny.</p>
