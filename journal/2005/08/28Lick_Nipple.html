<p>I had a fantastic dinner with Cheerful Dancing Fellows, and I asked
Shunji just what he had said.  He goes, "lick nipple," and the girls
were like, "what does that mean?" and he pointed to his own chest and
perhaps stuck out his tongue and I was like, "stop stop stop" and the
girls were totally confused and I explained it briefly in two parts:
"lick is like taste" and "nipple is おパイの上" but realized that
wasn't quite right but the girls got it and then I asked what was the
actual translation for nipple: ("ちくび").</p>

<p>Shunji explained that was his phrase of the day.  Oh man.</p>

<p>So that became our buzzphrase during the party and then it came
time to determine who was the winner(loser) of the
Spoke-The-Most-Japanese during class game.</p>

<p>I had a paper cup with names of people who spoke Japanese during
class.  Every time they spoke Japanese, I gave them a red piece of
paper.  Every time they used a good vocabulary word, I gave them a
green piece of paper.  The papers were signed and duly collected in
the cup.</p>

<p>I made a bit of an event of counting the number of times each
person had spoken Japanese, pulling them out of the cup one at a time
and announcing the name and handing it down the table to whoever's it
was.</p>

<p>Before I got too far, I was like, "what will the winner have to
do?" and Shunji goes, "lick nipple!" and we all laughed.  Then he's
like, "lick Rob's nipple!" and I was like, "okay, ha ha, no really,
what should it be?"  and we came up with something like sing New York
New York in the middle of Namihei.</p>

<p>The results of the game:</p>

<pre>
 Kazue:  4-1 (1 good vocabulary)  
  Koji:  3
Shunji: 10
  Yama:  0
  Naho:  1
   Aki:  1
   Rob:  6
</pre>

<p>And before I could say, "Yama, did you say nothing at all??"
Shunji ran up to me, opened my suit coat and unbuttoned my shirt and
LICKED MY NIPPLE and I was like "aaaaaahhhh!!" and "get a picture!
get a picture!" and everyone was crying laughing, and amazingly, every
other table ignored us.  I can understand that if we were in Japan,
but we've been on this boat for three months!</p>

<p>Shunji was all, "mmm delicious."</p>
