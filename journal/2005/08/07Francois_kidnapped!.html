<p>Francois has been Rabbitnapped!  I think it's a GET Teacher; it's
definitely someone who has access to the network computers.</p>

<p>I am supposed to write a poem of at least 50 words to describe my
love for the rabbit.  It must be good.</p>

<p>If we weren't so busy, I would write, "Dear Francois, how do I love
thee?  Let me count the ways: one, two, three, four, five, six, ..."
until I got to fifty words (not until "fifty"), and then give the
ransomers a scavenger hunt to find the actual poem, but I don't have
time for that.</p>
