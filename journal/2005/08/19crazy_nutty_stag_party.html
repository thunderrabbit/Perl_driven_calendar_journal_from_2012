<p>I could sell the audio and video I got of Matt's stag party for big
blackmail money.  Dave naked on Shawn's bed with Shawn complaining
bitterly like, "c'mon man, get you sweaty ass off my bed or put some
clothes on!  I gotta sleep here!!" and Dave going, "nah, it'll be
alright; don't worry about it..."</p>

<p>At one point Maryann came in (from the bachelorette party (they
called it a hen party)) with a bottle of red wine, asking if we could
open it.  I tried to send her away, saying it was dangerous for her to
bring wine into our room; she would lose it in a trice.</p>

<p>Dave grabbed it and said he would open it and bring it right to
their room in a couple minutes.</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p>A good portion of that wine soaked the carpet.</p>

<p>The party was nutballs.  Totally crazy.  Girls pashing on each
other, red wine spilled on the floor, crew staff coming to the door in
uniform saying "please be quiet, we have to be awake in 3 hours.."
(To me, that means he *was* asleep, but woke up, but had to put his
uniform on before he could talk to us...  wow.)</p>
