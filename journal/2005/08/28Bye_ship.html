<p>We switched to a new timezone last night.  Today I recorded an
hour of byebye ship video.  12 year old Shunji and a girl fell and I
nearly got it recorded.</p>

<p>We have to be dressed up at 4:45 for some stupid kampai byebye
ceremony crap.</p>

<p>Today we have been selling GET CDs, and I have nearly recovered my
money on Kamau's CDs that I bought for everyone to buy, but not
everyone has wanted.  I sold two to passengers, Hitomi and Miki with
an underbite.</p>

<p>Sent three emails today- Kellie, janette, Rob Update List.</p>
