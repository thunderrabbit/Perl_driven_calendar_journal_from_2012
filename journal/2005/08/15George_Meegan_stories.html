<p>Listening to George Meegan: amazing stories.</p>

<p>here are samples.  Just a snippets from his myriad thousands of stories.</p>

I finally reached the barrel
and I could see in the rusty water
animals doing the breast stroke.
I knew they were healthier than I
for I could not have done the breast stroke at that time.
I dipped my bottle into the barrel
and I was so weak
I could hardly lift the bottle to my lips.
but I did and found something interesting
my stomach had become a trampoline.
I swallowed water
and it bounced out like [ppshsssssssst].
and I thought
well at least that's progress.
so I drank more.
and reached a state
of water into the left side of my mouth
and spraying out the right side of my mouth.

do you have a wallet?
how much money is in there now?
[1000 yen ($10)]
That's how much money I had when I started
that money will have to last you 10 years.
I had no money.
I didn't need money.  I only needed food and water.
People will support people who are living their dreams.
I learned about the good side of humans.

I also learned about the dark side of humans.

My diet was not like your diet on the boat.
Some of you are vegetarian.
Some of you don't like natto.
Some of you prefer vanilla over chocolate.
My diet was different.
My diet was *anything* I could put into my mouth.

I arrived in the valley and the cloud turned out to be
*billions* and zillions of insects.
people wore stockings over their faces
to keep the insects out of their eyes and other openings

the houses don't have roofs.
the children would say "water from the sky!
how fantastic; how impossible"

I shouted up at the window
"have you any food?"
The answer came back
"no. have you?"
"yes! I have a coconut!"
"well, come up; let's have coconut!"

I reached the man who continued to stare at me.
He said, "we haven't had any travelers in weeks"
I could see why; the rain was relentless;
pouring buckets down everywhere.
It was pouring in rivers off his black UFO hat.
I said, "I can see why you haven't any travelers these days.
When is the dry season, your tourist season?"
And the man said
"this is the dry season."

I went over the Panama Canal.  
Over the bridge that you went under.
I crossed the jungle.  I was in Panama City.
Suddenly, I was held from behind by two guys.
Now there was a gentleman in front of me.
There is communication with the eyes
and he said, "I'm going to kill you"
and he threw from one hand to the other this knife
He thrust forward and I twisted away and he missed
I couldn't believe it!
*he* couldn't believe it!
We were both astonished.  Everybody was astonished.
I thought, "good move, George."
now he was more angry
and he made a decision; he had missed.
he would not try the same move again
So he raised the knife up here 
and I saw the light reflect on the knife
the blade came down here, and my old royal navy shirt,
somehow,
now this is a miracle, truly
the knife came down here
and I could see this Mike Tyson sized guy here pushing,
but the knife was stuck.  He couldn't move it forward 
and he couldn't move it back.
it was in this moment that a Panamanian police car
a Guardia Ceville, and the man's name was Santiago
and he drove up and the people were able to escape
Wow.

I received a little weenie sausage
from a little tin of sausages
and I was so weak that it took 15 minutes
for me to put the sausage into my mouth
and I realized what was the problem:
the roof of my mouth had fallen onto my tongue
and I thought
I think I need a doctor.
I found a doctor in Panama
and the doctor said,
"Meegan,
you have scurvy."
I'm the only man you will ever meet who has had scurvy.
