<p>I didn't send a mass email in Alaska, our last port, which we left
yesterday.  I did have lots of fun there with Katt; we climbed the
jeep trail of Marathon Mountain to the waterfalls.  She almost made
it, but chose not to ascend the steep slippery shale trail near the
end.  We had met four performers (in order of ascent: Josh, Danielle,
Danielle, and Matt) from The Summit, one of the panamax cruise ships
run by Celebrity Cruises.  We've seen their ships at a few of the
ports we've been at - Singapore, Acapulco, and Vancouver at least.
They're quite identifiable with a big X on the top.</p>

<p>I climbed the rest of the shale trail with them and then we parted
ways once we reached a peak.  They went down to have lunch, and I went
up to have a birds' eye view of their picnic.  Wind about 2/3rds the
strength of what jostled us on Mt Fuji (but not nearly as cold)
crested the next peak I reached, which offered a fantastic view of the
bay.</p>
