<p>I walked into Yoyogi Park and people saw me and hollered over.
Then Petra *RAN* to greet me with a flying leaping hug and DID NOT
STOP, but just was like [whoooosh] through the air and straddled onto
me.  I was flat scared for my health (especially the back of my head),
but somehow I was able to catch her and retain my balance, though I
was knocked back a few feet.</p>

<p>I brought my remaining WONDERBOY disc and played disc with Petra,
who enjoyed having to catch throws that were a bit beyond her reach.
I kept throwing directly to her and she said "boring," a lot.  When I
threw it to one side or another, or over her head, she was like
"yeah!" but it was a bit of a trick for me to specifically throw
not *to* someone.</p>

<p>We ended up congregating around a picnic table once it got
basically dark and people kept trickling in, each for big yelling
hugging greetings (but no more dangerous greetings).</p>

<p>Drummers arrived and played a continuous groove near the fountains
where we had been, and for a while our party was there, watching two
girls do a super crazy dance (crazier than Rob's Crazy Dance (but a
bit choreographed (but really fuckin' fast))), and one of them even
did it barefoot.  I joined them barefoot and had cheering support from
other GET Teachers, but I didn't maintain that level of nuttiness for
very long.  The pebbly sidewalk took a toll on my footses, but I've
still got pretty tough soles even after a couple years of wearing
shoes here in Japan.</p>

<p>I talked to T, who was on the 47th voyage and will be on the 51st
voyage.  She seems cool; she worked in Galapagos for a few months,
doing some research (data collection?) about the activities of sea
turtles on the islands.  She learned Spanish during the first month of
that time, which is awesome.  She said it was really difficult to be
there at first, not knowing the language.</p>

<p>I'm walking to the convenience store now (happy that someone chose
to join me (T)) to get two cokes, diet coke, umeshu, and hazelnut
snickers for various people.</p>

<p>I was ready to go and was all, "aight see you guys later," and I
was Kris: "see you tomorrow; oh shit you won't *be* there tomorrow!"
and I put my stuff down and just hugged hugged hugged her.  She is
such a beautiful girl with incredible blue eyes and incredible heart
and incredible dilligence at work.  It hit me that I might not see
her again, but I know we'll stay in touch via email.</p>
