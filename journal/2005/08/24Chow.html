<p>I'm kinda wandering around today.  There is shit to be done, but I
think I got my part of it done.</p>

<p>I slept in late today until like 12 noon.</p>

<p>Hitomi wrote me another letter last night.</p>

<p>Today is the day I went to Topaz to eat and sat with Aki from my
class and two other girls I don't know.  I talked to Christina, my
favorite Bulgarian (and waitress) a bit and she was funny.</p>

<p>Oh, we had to hurry, so Aki ate her cake in two bites and I ate
mine in one bite.</p>
