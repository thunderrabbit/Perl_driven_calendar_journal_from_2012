<p>Kim, with whom I was quite madly in love at the beginning of the
trip, is having her GET To Know Kim presentation today.  I'm gonna
eat and go to that.</p>

<p>Kim is awesome because she was born on 29 February, 25 years ago.
She has a science-oriented family.  She studied linguistics in
university.</p>

<p>We are at the fashion show rehearsal.  It is incredibly late and
incredibly not up my alley.  All the girls are getting all dolled up
and it's like <em>dude; it's just a rehearsal..</em></p>
