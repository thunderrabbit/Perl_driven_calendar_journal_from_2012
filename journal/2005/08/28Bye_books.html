<p>I'm consciously releasing these books to the junkfest upstairs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lonely Planet Journeys: Lost Japan</p></li>

<li><p>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, given to me by
Marcel.  I recognize I don't care to become a great artist.</p></li>

<li><p>The Art of Loving by Eric Fromm, because it's dry and I'll
never read it.</p></li>

<li><p>Travels with Lisbeth, the kind of book I want to write myself
some day.</p></li>

<li><p>Married Lust, the 10 Secrets of Longlasting Desire.  Wende and
I got this, but I broke up with her.</p></li>

<li><p>Japanese History, written in Japanese and English, given to me
by Miho from Nova.</p></li>

<li><p>Conscious Breathing by Gay Hendrix, PhD. purchased at Half
Price Books, with a red wine stain now from the stag party.</p></li>
</ol>
