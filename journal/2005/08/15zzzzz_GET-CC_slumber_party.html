which was basically just a hang out and eat and paint nails and watch
movies and take the Purity Test party.  Maryann (who administered the
Purity Test many times during her dorm days at Rice University (!))
spilled out a great number of the questions from memory.  We patched
together some others and made a 100 question test.  I had hoped that
we would all take the test, but just a few people read the questions
privately and recorded their scores.</p>

<p>Yuuka fell asleep during the event...</p>

<p>This was also the night the GET Girls had a date with Shunji (my
73 year old student) who fed them lots of sushi and champagne.</p>
