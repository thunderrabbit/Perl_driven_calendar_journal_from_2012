<p>I don't have a layout of the city in my brain really, but I have a
general sense.  Katt and I are at a cafe with internet access for
$10 per hour.  Katt is trying to steal my food.</p>

<p>Haha she thought I said, "Katt is trying to civilize me."</p>

<p>I'm glad Katt saw me crying crying crying and offered to take
me to lunch.</p>
