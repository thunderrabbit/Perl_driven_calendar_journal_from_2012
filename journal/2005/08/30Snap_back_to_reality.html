<p>The ship is basically gone.  Too late to get on now.  People were
screeching screaming goodbyes.</p>

<p>I'm in the stage of not wanting to leave and not wanting to get
back into reality and not wanting to get stuck into my old life.</p>

<p>The only people left on the port are those who don't have anything
to do, like the last stragglers at the end of a rally.</p>
