<pre>
I'm goin' down to Tel Aviv
if I can get myself there
I'll find a service, tellaman Tel Aviv
And then I'll pay my fare

I'm goin' down to Tel Aviv
to get a visa there
I wanna go to Rio de Janeiro
And see what's up over there

I showed the driver the address
of where I'm goin' in Tel Aviv
I didn't show it to him too late
but right after we did leave

Across the plain to Tel Aviv
stopped by guards with a stare
They check our IDs and if they're rude
make us stand over there

<p>We've left Jerusalem and are bound for Tel Aviv.  Haven't gotten to
any checkpoints yet, and I hope we will continue trveling freely all
the way to and from the city.</p>

<p>I believe I have all the documents I need: proof of onward voage
from Brazil, proof of sufficient funds for my stay (all 15 hours), my
passport, contact information at the Faisal, and (as a tourist in
Israel) ticket from here to my home country, thouh I won't be going to
my home country; I'll see what they say about all that.</p>

<p>Though I had told the guy I wanted to go to 2 Kaplan Street, he
didn't tell me the service wouldn't actually go there.  But he did
tell me to hop on the #5 taxi nearby our final stop.  Number five had
just filled up so the driver told me to hop on number 4.  I did (but
didn't ask the driver immediately because he was across the street
watching the van fill up,) and showed him the address once we got
started.  He dropped me off soon thereafter and said I should catch
the 26 bus.  Other people were like, "no the #5" and others were like
"#26" and I got off at a bus stop where there was no #5, but only #26.
The 26 bus came and I showed him my address and he shrugged his
shoulders, and the passenger behind him translated.  The driver was
like, "oh blah blah" and the guy said, "take #7" and I got off again.
The stop didn't have #7 listed, but it did have #70.  #70 came and I
showed the driver the address.  He said, "okay" and said he would tell
me where to get off. </p>

<p>And that's exactly what he did.</p>
