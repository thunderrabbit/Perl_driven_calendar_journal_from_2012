<p>On the plane now, and have a window seat, though I should be
sleepin' for most of the flight, I think....  I haven't actually done
a check to see what time it is now in Tel Aviv, but I think they are
about 6 hours behind Japan, so I should stay awake until about 6 hours
after a normal person's sleeping time, which I nearly have been for
the past few days.  Hahah I'm already accustomed to Tel Aviv time!</p>

<p>Talked to Rie for a bit before we left, and she asked who had me so
upset on the phone.  I had to tell her.</p>

<p>So far I don't have anyone beside me.</p>
