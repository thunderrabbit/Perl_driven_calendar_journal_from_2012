and he showed us all these sections of rubble and rebuilt buildings
that had been destroyed by the Israeli army in the not so recent past.
There are tons of memorials for martyrs and prisoners and innocent
victims, like a family whose house was destroyed and collapsed upon
them.  And a dude who used the outdoor payphone which was rigged to
explode and killed him, so they made a memorial for him shaped like a
phonebooth.</p>

<p>We also saw a turkish bath, from the inside, which looked a lot lot
lot like the place in which I had photographed Francois, but at the
time, thought it was a mosque of some sort.</p>

<p>And a place that made chairs.</p>
