<p>Yesterday I helped Rami edit a couple of papers.  One of them had
been basically cut-n-pasted from a paper I had already edited, but
from before I edited it, so I had to make some of the same changes
slash cut-n-paste my edits into the new document.</p>

<p>I looked in some bookstores on the way back, examined some of the
arabic-learnin' books, but didn't find the one I had decided I liked
in Nablus.  The one shown to me by the girl who was in the room next
to mine.  What was her name??</p>

<p>I didn't find that book, and didn't seem to love any of the books
I saw there, though two were well stocked and therefore apparently
popular.  Or unpopular.</p>

<p>With stories from _Evasion_ by crimethinc in my mind, I wondered if
I could just <em>walk out</em> with a book, but decided not to.  If I
didn't actually like the book, there's no reason I would like it more
with a guilty conscious attached.  Plus, I've heard a rumor about the
punishment for stealing in the middle east.</p>

<p>Back to the hostel, hung out on my computer finalizing *something*
that I couldn't quite articulate and finally broke away and realized
that I'm looking for acceptance slash a new project slash something
useful to do.</p>

<p>It was the day I had signed up for <a
href="http://flock.com/">flock</a> availability announcement, paid $30
for The Caretaker Gazette, tried in vain to solve the moronic [message
clipped] issue with gmail.  Show All doesn't work nicely when there's
fifty million =20 and ^M added in the middle of an HTML formatted
email!</p>

<p>Chatted with Sarah, rubbed Hisham's shoulder, Sarah's knee,
Rochelle's back.  Went to get breakfast with Sarah at the shop with
the friendly guy with a big moustache.</p>
