<p><a href="http://bookcrossing.com/385-3312195">_if the Buddha
dated_</a> seems to be just perfect for me.</p>

<p>It talks about a lot of the same things I've talked / wondered /
thought about, and goes a bit further with some of them.</p>

<p>For examle, I often make references to my angels and being able to
listen for guidance from my angels.  The voice is always loving,
always patient, always truth.</p>

<p>The book talks about inner guidance as well.  I take it to be
different descritions of the same thing.</p>

<p>Then I wondered what languge my angels can use.  I've used English
by default, but I guess Japanese would be just as good.
But.... spoken languages are filled (*) with inconsistencies,
etc..  I'm sure my angels would know how I hear something and use the
right words for me, but..</p>

<p> I bet it's more accurate to think the teaching comes and then I
translate it into my most commonly used languauge.  Well, why not
learn the language of the angels?</p>

<p>And last, I have known for a while that I choose / chase women as
friends / cohorts / cohabitants.  I don't have nearly as many male
friends.  Why?  How do I stop?</p>

<p>from page 38 of _if the Buddha dated_:</p>

<blockquote>
      We become more natural and relaxed with people through spending time
      with friends, revealing ourselves, settling conflicts, and taking on
      adventures.  Our path is not so much to find a lover as to be a good
      lover of life, of all people.
</blockquote>

<p>(*) I was going to use "fraught" "fraut" "froght" but I can't
decide how to spell it.</p>
