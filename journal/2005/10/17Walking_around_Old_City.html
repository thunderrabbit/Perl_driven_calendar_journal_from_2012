<p>Just got back after walking around the old city with Dave, Serena,
and Rochelle.</p>

<p>We are all Americans, but the cool open-minded kind, and had a
great time.  Just walked slowly through the slowly quieting streets,
occassionally offset with the loud rumble of tractors pulling trash
collection carts and a guy standing on the trash as other guys threw
it up there.  I thought of some lyrics for a new song called "funky
cold Serena," based on Tone Loc's original, but I didn't get much past
the first verse, being vexed looking for a word that rhymed with
"Jerusalem" and meant "candy" (not gum, candy).</p>

<p>We tried to find the Wailing Wall (led by me since I've been there
before), but the gate Sarah and I had previously used was locked.</p>

<p>Tried to find an alternate route and a guy showed us a way and
asked us for change in exchange, which we refused; I might have given
him some had he actually <em>led us</em> to the gate, but. (*)</p>

<blockquote>(*) I think this is the second or third or tenth time I've
used this grammar I learned in Australia when I went to see Bryn
during me-an-Wende's trip to let her attend Irene and Nick's
wedding.</blockquote>

<p>The next guy somehow immediately mentioned Texas and "Don't Mess
With Texas," which was a bit surprising..</p>

<p>We arrived in a part of the city I had never seen, but my sense was
we were behind the wall.  We followed Dave's stomach after that and
ended up at a nice little restaurant where the girls shared
pomegranate juice, and Dave and I each got some on their assurance of
its deliciality, plus a meal each.</p>

<p>Shared stories and laughs equally around the table as Serena added
fork stabmark designs to her already stabbed placemat, I carefully
studied Dave's face because I recognized I had been focusing on the
girls (Serena's blue eyes and Rochelle's height, 182cm), and Rochelle
and Serena both told us stories about <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Rachel+Corrie">Rachel Corrie</a>,
who they knew well when she died.</p>

<p>Dinner finished, paid (more expensive than I expected, though I did
get to take some home), and we headed out.  We turned right and I
thought we went way way down and into new territory, but then turned
left a short ways and then suddenly we were at the very gates of the
Wailing Wall that I thought had been closed before!</p>

<p>I was surprised, but we rocked in there through the laughable
security. I could have had a gun in my pants; he didn't check between
my legs (crotch or otherwise), although maybe I'm wrong about
this... the alarm thing didn't beep as I went through but she stopped
me and said it was my belt.  I guess a small bit of metal didn't set
off circus whistles, but a large chunk of gun would have.  But, I could
have had a <em>glock</em> in my pants.</p>

<p>Instead of having guns, we walked quietly appreciative of the
area's religious significance.  I told them the left side was for men
and the right for women.  Something really interesting about that:
the dirty line where people have been touching the wall is just a bit
shorter on the women's side.  Just a bit.  I'll may try to get a
photo of it; the effect slash implication is interesting.</p>

<p>Basically headed out of the city past that and Dave headed back to
the hostel while I walked with the girls on a beer run (ice cream for
me).  I was sortof in my own world of music, making up new lyrics to
various songs ("oh what a wonderful world" and something else) and
occassionally commenting on something they said.</p>

<p>Saw some inline skaters and I expressed my interest in skating; I
wonder if I can rent some around here.</p>

<p>Arrived back at the hostel and was pleasantly surprised in a bad
way by the girls: "we were harassed a lot less having you with
us."</p>

<p>"Wow.  I'm glad, and it's my pleasure not to harass you."</p>
