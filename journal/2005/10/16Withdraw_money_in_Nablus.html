<p>I'm in Nablus for the second day; right now importing video from
the Bil'in demonstration on Friday.  The video is pretty wobbly, since
I was walking slash using my other camera slash etc, but I hope to
find a few useful clips.  If that guy (not Jon) emails me looking for
the video of that interview, I may be able to give it to him.</p>

<p>This morning I walked with Valeria from the Project Hope apartment
to the city center, where she continued to the office and I wandered
around with a basic plan of finding a bank at which I could withdraw
money.  The first three I tried each told me they could only take
Visa, but sent me to the next bank, which also only accepted Visa
until I got to the fourth bank which actually would let me get money
on MasterCard.</p>

<p>Jalal was my very patient teller, who quoted me $140 for 600 NIS.
That price seemed high, so I asked for his calculator and tried to
compare that to $85 for 400 NIS (the price I got in the airport bank)
but taking into consideration today's exchange rates (which Jalal of
course was doing) and not really knowing if I should use the BUY
number or the SELL number, but figuring it out cause of course the
bank should make money on the transactions.</p>

<p>In the end, I signed a thing to give me 100 Jordanian Dinars, but
don't know how many USD it cost.  (I wonder if I can look it up online
now (and not get too sidetracked on the internet.) Dammit; I'm still
locked out from viewing it online.  I gotta figure out how to call
them collect from here.)</p>

<p>I went to the booth with a man named Armstrong (or something in
reference to his size / strength) and he gave me 100 Jordanian Dinars.
I was like, "двдь?" and asked if he could change them to NIS, which he
did: 651 NIS.</p>

<p>While sitting at Jalal's counter, I met a man named Bin Laden ("do
you know what it means?"  "I know of the man, but I don't know what it
means."  "It's just a name; it doesn't mean anything.") who joined me
in line at Armstrong's counter.  Bin Laden was like, "wait me," and I
confirmed he meant "wait <em>for</em> me," and was
like, <em>aight</em> and waited for him, cause I didn't have anything
better to do.  I wondered if his intentions were pure, or if he wanted
to bring me to his shop or otherwise extract money from me, but I
figured I could handle anything he presented.</p>

<p>I made eye contact with another teller and Jalal introduced me to
him - a man named Munther (if I remember correctly).  He was quite
friendly with good English, and I met his customer and another man
named Osama Labrake and we joked about having Bin Laden and Osama in
the same room, but not the same person.</p>

<p>I met the woman next to Munther, (but never learned her name) and
she scoped the flashcards after Munther flipped through them, and we
chatted for a bit and generally everyone had a great time.</p>

<p>Bin Laden came up to me, "are you ready to go?"</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"Where do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"I want to buy a belt." (my jeans have been practically falling
off my butt cause I've been eating less in Japan)</p>

<p>But I was still fully engaged with my new bank friends, "you are
not alone; stay here; we are your friends," and having a great
time.</p>

<p>Bin Laden bade me adeiu and I stayed a bit longer and gave out
three copies of my yellow adventure cards when I left.</p>
