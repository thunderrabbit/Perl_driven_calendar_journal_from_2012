<p>On a bus to Nablus now.  Well, on a bus to Qalandia which, if I am
beginning to get a tiny grasp on anything I have experienced, is a
checkpoint at which we will be requried to jump off the bus and walk
through, then find a new form of transportation the rest of the way to
Nablus.</p>

<p>I'm sitting next to Max, and Anna, who read "Qalandia" in Arabic on
the bus, is in a nearby seat on this 19 seat bus.</p>

painted silouhette of a young girl floating upward over the wall,
lofted by balloons.  It's a fine image in its on right, but even
cooler that I've seen it online; apparently it was one of a <a

of paintings</a> by a famous European graffiti artist <a
href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/news/palestine3.html">Banksy</a>.</p>

<p>In the article was a reference to a hidden word under rock or
something; I'm interested to see if I can find that word now.</p>

<p>Except for the fact we are in a taxi to our next destination.</p>
