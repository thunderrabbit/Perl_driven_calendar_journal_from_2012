<p>I have just about finished my <a
href="/cgi-local/daysold.pl">daysold calculator</a>!  It's way way way
better than the old one.</p>

<p>I just want to add the ability for users to request the date for an
arbitrary Nth day.</p>

<p>Once I do that, I'll make it available from my top navigation bar,
and make robnugen.com/ refresh to robnugen.com/journal.</p>

<p class="date">1:16pm</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Oliver (*) tried it out and found a bug when selecting 30000
days.  It told him some date in 1919. That code uses a quick
convert-the-date-to-a-(long?)word-add-(30000*24*60*60)-seconds-convert-back-to-a-date.
I bet it's overflowing the word.  I'll try briefly to figure out how
to make it use more bits in the word, and barring that, I will wipe
out 30000 as an option, and then when I add user-choice Nth day, write
a note about the limitation until I figure out a solution, which will
probably be coding it myself.</p>

<p>(* I got the same 1900 result when I tried 30000, but simply didn't notice.)</p>
