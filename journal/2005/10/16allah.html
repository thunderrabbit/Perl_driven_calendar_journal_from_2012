<p>Whew.  My brain is a bit tired.</p>

<p>A man whose beard appears to have grown from orange to white told
me about Islam and how the Koran is the final book and Mohammed was
the final prophet and now we are waiting for the return of Christ who
will kill the anti-Christ (for whom, btw, the Jews are now waiting to
come as their savior) on a certain spot in a city he named near Tel
Aviv, I think.</p>

<p>I was as patient as I could muster for the long soliloquy, but in
the end, when he invited me to his village (thank you very much) and
went for the final closing: "so what time can I expect you to come?"
I answered, "when Allah sends me, I will come."</p>

<p>I basically shut down all further requests, though I did let him
write down his number, which I read carefully once and then folded
neatly and placed in the waste bin beside this desk.  If Allah wishes
me to remember the number, then I will remember it and call the guy
and set up that time.</p>

<p>Until then, namaste.</p>
