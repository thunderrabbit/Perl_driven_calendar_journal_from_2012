<p>I just sent a Rob Update and was *amazed* that Hitomi called me
just before I sent it.  I had been flying for over an hour, with phone
off, an *I* thought my next moment would be in Tashkent, far away from
Vodafone Japan's reach.  How did Hitomi know she could talk to me?  I
had just turned my phone on to use the clock so I would know when to
get back to the boarding gate.  Incredible.</p>

<p>I notice that I feel some sadness that I did not get to reply to
Miki's text message, nor talk to Satoko who called me *just* as I
turned off my phone to get on the plane.  I'm guessing she got the Rob
Update email and then tried to call me to say Bye.</p>

<p>Hitomi keeps asking me why I don't trust her when I say I don't
trust her, and then why I do trust her when I say I do.  I trust her
to keep calling me when I want to be alone.  I trust her to keep my
stuff safely.  I don't trust her to respect my boundaries.  I don't
trust her to understand why I change my answers from moment to
moment.</p>

<p>Now settling in for an 8 hour flight at 10,820 meters.</p>

<p>I just changed my clock to Tashkent time.</p>
