<p>So, during the day a gnawing set of ruminations wandered through my
brain.  They boiled down to one question: "is I is or is I ain't
pickin' olives?"</p>

<p>Specific variants included fears about my personal safety, wanting
to see what's up with Palestinian Vision (the NGO through which I met
Niveen), etc etc.  Basically I'm being wishywashy.</p>
