<p class="date">7:38am IST Monday 17 October 2005</p>

<p>I have just left Nablus through the Owhara checkpoint, sharing a
taxi with Masada, my Nablus body guard, to the checkpoint.</p>

<p>I was amazed to hear my name called, turned around to find the
Swedish Mafia unshaven: Gabriel (who said three settlers (Israelis)
had been killed last night), Ulf, Johan plus Carola in the parking lot
just ahead!</p>

<p>They had been living in Balata, the refugee camp I visited briefly
with Masada, and I got the intense feeling that they (the Swedish
Mafia) were doing more good than I.  I've just been walking around
Nablus looking for a bank and wondering if I would survive without
eating until breakfast at 5pm.</p>

<p>How are these guys doing it?</p>

<p>Well, no mystery: they just jumped into ISM and have been on the
front lines in Bil'in, and living in the cramped chaos of Balata.</p>

<p>Am I doing as much good by posting my pictures, videos, stories on
my website?</p>

<p>By practicing awareness of my Buddha nature?  By chewing my food
thoroughly and wishing breakfast didn't mean everyone would light up
their cigrettes?  I like Ramadan during the day; the air is fresh.</p>

<p>We went through a flying checkpoint *just* after we went through
the Ohwara checkpint, and now (about 3 miles later) we are stuck
behind a line of traffic so long I can't even see what is the
holdup.</p>

<p class="date">7:52am</p>

<p>The taxi driver got out to investigate.</p>

<p class="date">7:55am</p>

<p>We are turning around.  This occupation is fucked up.  No wonder
there are actions against the Israelis here.  I'd be fuckiing pissed
if I was supposed to be somehwere but turned around due to a godamn
arbitrarily placed checkpoint..</p>

<p>The fucked up thing even worse is we are just going to go around
the checkpoint, winding through a narrow village with tons of
speedbumps.  So it cannot be argued that the Israelis are making
themseles safer; if we had a bomb, and can just <em>go around</em> the
checkpoint, wouldn't we do so?</p>

<p class="date">8:10</p>

<p>And by "go around" the checkpoint, I mean drive all the way up the
face of this rather large hill, twisting through the labyrinth of
streets, back down the oher side, and we aren't even back on the main
highway yet.  Of course this means countless hours / fuel wasted if we
count all the people who are adversely affected by the checkpoint.
Isn't that worth getting pissed about?</p>

<p class="date">8:19</p>

<p><em>Nowm</em> we are bck on the highway.  I see some dark smoke
from a very concentrated point on the mountain; like a fire 10 feet
across.  Or less.  But enough black smoke to choke a chain smoker.</p>

<p class="date">8:35am</p>

<p>Holy fuck.  Now we are backing away from another checkpoint, but
this one had no line of traffic.  I wonder if for some reason me or my
fellow passengers are disalloowed to be checked.</p>

<p>That seems strange, because we were checked at the first checkpoint
without a problem,but have avoided the second and third
checkpoints./p>

<p class="date">8:42</p>

<p>Going through another small town now.  Narrow bumpy streets not
even counting the speed bumps.</p>

<p class="date">8:51</p>

<p>Through another villge, more steep twistycurves and another village
an now more steep twist curves and a village visible on top of this
hill.</p>

<p class="date">9:00</p>

<p>Our taxi driver just talked  with the driver of an oncoming taxi.</p>

<p class="date">9:02</p>

<p>Our taxi driver is now borrowing a phone from a passenger and looking up
phone numbers on list..</p>

<p>while driving.</p>

<p>List has been passed back to passengers.  Phone dialed, given to taxi driver.</p>

<p class="date">9:04</p>

<p>Phone call failed; try again.</p>

<p>Passengers are beginning to talk about the situation; For a while I
was shocked by their silence, which indicated to me this was
situation: normal.  Really it's situation: fuckedup, but has become
normalized in Palestinian lives.</p>

<p>Now they apparently think it's fucked up, too.</p>

<p class="date">9:06</p>

<p>On a highway again. We scoot down hills at 120 kph usually and once I
saw 141 kph.</p>

<p class="date">9:09</p>

<p>Just saw a sign saying Jerusalem was 25 (km?) away.  We are going
to Qalandia, but they are maybe 10 km apart.</p>

<p class="date">9:17am</p>

<p>Another flying checkpoint, right on the highwy.  Our driver is
talking to soldiers now.  Three soldiers with weapons.</p>

<p>One soldier has my passport and didn't just give it a glance over;
they are taking it somewhere and now we are apparently going to be
checked more thoroughly.</p>

<p class="date">9:20</p>

<p>Nope; we weren't checked more thoroughly; we all got our passports
back and now we are turning around again.  because of me??</p>

<p class="date">9:27</p>

<p>I called Rami.  He said it is not because of me, but there is a
"closure".  I don't know if/when/where I will be able to get through
to Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="date">9:37</p>

<p>Woah; I have been here before.  This is the checkpoint that forces
the road to extend up the hill to meet it, closing off with a yellow
frame barrier the shortcut road.</p>

<p>We just rolled through it and strangely saw several taxis trying to
get to the side of the checkpoint we had just been on.  Shoulda gotten
a picture of them.</p>

<p>I think we are sorta kinda close to being back to Qalandia..</p>

<p class="date">9:51</p>

<p>Aha!! I recognize we are in Ramallah.</p>

<p>Very close indeed to Qalandia.</p>

<p>I'm seeing soldiers on the streets - more than normal.</p>

<p>4 walking and 1 by Yassir Arafat's compound slash tomb.</p>

<p class="date">9:59</p>

<p>We have just arrived Qalandia.  I was going to give the guy 20 NIS
cause it took so long; I thought I'd be nice.  But he wanted 25 NIS.
I'm not sure where in Qalandia we are.</p>

<p class="date">10:04am</p>

<p>oh.  I see.  We are in Ramallah.  I still have to take a taxi to
Qalandia.</p>

<p class="date">10:15am</p>

<p>In a service taxi from Ramallah to Qalandia now.</p>

<p>I've sent 20 NIS up to the driver, but haven't recieved change
yet.</p>

<p>The guy beside me made the apparently universal closed fingers
gesture for money, but I don't know what he meant.</p>

<p>My sense is he meant "I know your money hasn't arrived yet."</p>

<p><p class="date">10:19</p>

<p>It just came back: 17 NIS.</p>

<p class="date">10:23</p>

<p>I showed my money buddy my Japanese coins and ¿È±ﬂ note.  He
examined them all carefully and gave me a thumbs up.  Then he seemed
to describe the 1000 yen note as "sharraf."</p>

<p class="date">10:37 IST Monday 17 October 2005</p>

<p>I walked through the checkpoint at Qalandia <em>without</em> going
through the metal detector *and* <em>without</em> them looking at my
passport.  I had it out so they coould have seen its nattionality, but
that hasn't stopped them from checking it before.  Save the first
time, but not the 2nd and 3rd time.  So, in short,</p>

<p>They have not checked my passport 50% of the times I've been
through Qalandia checkpoint (2 of 4 times).</p>


<p>I'm on the #78 shuttle now: 4.20 NIS to a lot walking distance from
Faisal hostel (Damascus Gate)</p>

<p>We just need to go through this one checkpoint.  I'm in the back
corner of the bus, apparently focused on this entry.</p>

<p class="date">10:44</p>

<p>I showed my passport when the dude motioned toward me, but one old
cat did not show his.  He is just going through his prayer
beads.....  We went through without him being checked.</p>

<p>What kind of lockdown is this???</p>

<p class="date">11:00</p>

<p>Back at damascus parking area.  I'm going to PalVision now to help Rami.</p>
