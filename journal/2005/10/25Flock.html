<p>I really like <a href="http://flock.com">flock</a>.  It's become
my preferred browser over Firefox, which I really liked.</p>

<p>Flock is happy to give me webpages I've seen recently, even if I'm
not online at the time.  Firefox does not.  Flock has blogging
software built into its core.  Firefox does not.  Flock lets me
rearrange the tabs.  Firefox does not (without an extension)
(yet; I know the new major release of Firefox will).</p>

<p>Flock also has an awesome way of handling bookmarks on the top
row: I can switch between categories and new bookmarks appear.</p>

<p>Rochelle and Serena are back; their voices are like music in the
hostel.  I honestly was going to get off my computer and go help Rami,
though part of me was thinking of giving a more solid effort on the
documents he gave me to see about rewriting them.</p>

<p>I just need to mail the one I wrote to him and then eat and rock
over there.</p>
