We arrived in Tashkent, Uzbekistan around 4am, piled out of the plane
onto buses on the tarmac, and headed toward the terminal building.  We
generally sat or stood in silence, like a train in Tokyo, but slightly
less crowded.  Interesting to feel the queries boil up in my brain as
we stopped for fully 5+ minutes in front of the terminal with the bus
doors closed, and the bus engine and interior lights actually turned
off.  Someone began knocking on the glass to express his/her interest
in exiting the bus, but no answer was returned.  We just waited until
the bus came back to life, the doors opened, and we herded into the
terminal.

No clear indication of where to go, but I was keenly aware my next
flight planned to leave in 45 minutes.  About 1/3 of our group was
crowded around a counter, but I wasn't sure if that was required for
everyone or if passengers to Tel Aviv should go elsewhere or what; I
didn't want to waste time in line, but I felt a bit afraid to ask
where to go, fearing everyone else knew what was going on, wouldn't
speak English, or worse.

After a bit, someone said "Tel Aviv" and I began to see what I needed
to do.  Gently asserted my way toward the desk to get stamped and then
headed upstairs to another line, where one overworked man was checking
passports.  Eventually someone announced that some people needed to
leave soon and they (including me) should move to the front of the
line.  Got stamped, scanned, headed down the hall to wait at the gate;
I was headed in the right direction.

Another bus to the plane, another 767-300 for a four or five hour
flight from Tashkent to Tel Aviv.  This flight had fewer Japanese
passengers, more backpack carrying passengers than the previous
flight.

I got names and numbers of the couple sitting next to me, and they
gave me some advice for how to get to Jerusalem.

The Ben Gurion Airport is far more beautiful than I had imagined.  In
my mind, the immigration counter would be a table next to a gate in a
chain link fence stretched across a rather large sheet metal hangar,
with holding cells nearby for when they caught activists trying to
enter the country.

Instead, a beautiful modern terminal with large glass windows greeted
us as we glided down moving sidewalks down a huge corridor of hewn
rock that reminded me of Egyptian architecture.

At the bottom of the last sidewalk, a couple of doors led to the
immigration counters.  I filled out my form and waited in line,
gawking at the hasidic Jewish clothing, beards, and hair styles.  I
was no longer in Japan.  Or the US.  Or anywhere else I've ever been.

I presented my passport and form to the woman, and was a bit flustered
when she asked me what I was going to see; I hadn't been preparing in
my mind what to say, so I just stuttered that I wanted to see some of
the famous sites.

"What sites?"

"Um, the um, dome thing with a rock, and the olive mountain thing.  I
don't really know, but my friend knows."

"Who is your friend?"

"Niveen."  (oh dear, I had said the wrong name, and hoped it didn't give me away.)

"Who?"

"Eilat.  I have her information here," and I began to dig through my
envelope.

"It's okay, it's okay," and she pushed the stamped passport and entry
permit back to me.

I had made it into the country.

Through the next door, got my suitcase, then headed toward the exit.
Out into the insecure area of the airport and realized I had little or
no idea how to get to Jerusalem.

And I had no money.

But I did have a credit card, which I tried with my pin at the ATM and
then the bank upstairs in the airport arrival area.  Got 400 NIS (for
US $85) and marveled out how cheap that was (I remembered the website
saying I'd need 100 NIS per week, but it actually said US $100 per
week..)  </pre>

<p>Bah; I was going to send this as a Rob Update email, but it's too
long and boring; I'll just post it.</p>
