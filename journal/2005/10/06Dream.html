<p class="date">7:12am Tel Aviv Thursday 6 October 2005</p>

<p>We are about an hour from landing and I plan to stay awake from
now.  I had an interesting dream:</p>

<p class="dream">I was seated on a toilet, waitig for nature to do its
thing and I cut a huge fart, that was like "oh yeah; that's a relief,"
but it kept farting blasting and stinking up the room and I thought,
"okay; that's quite enough," and it kept going and going until I
realized it could not be me (I would have been completely deflated)
and realized the toilet was backspraying stinkbomb air at my ass while
seated..</p>

<p class="dream">I then heard somone say "excuse me," and I thought,
"heh heh; good joke" but then I realized she really wanted me, but
when she asked for water, I woke up.</p>

<p>It was the woman (Osnat) beside me asking the cabin attendant for
water.</p>
