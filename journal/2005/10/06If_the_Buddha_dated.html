<p class="date">8:28 Tel Aviv Thursday 6 october 2005</p>

<p>Have just gotten to another quite interesting part of the <a
href="http://bookcrossing.com/385-3312195">Buddha book</a>.  Talking
about different levels of connections.  I've thought about this a lot.
I need more than just physicl connection.  I need intellect and shared
interests.  So I figured if I go *do* the things I wat, then I'll meet
someone doing the same thing and have that part sorted.  Physicl
attraction and interests all in one.  just check for intellect and be
on our way.</p>

<p>But...  there is far more than that.  I knew that, but hadn't ever
written it down.  The bok as it written down in a pretty well thought
ut maner, it sees.  I'm not calling this a bible, but quite cool that
I hae come to many of the same conclusions... Just didn't go to the
same lengths of discussion.</p>

<p>About to land very shortly.  The landing gear just dropped at
8:33am.</p>
