<p>We just used white privilege to get through the checkpoint at
Nablus.  Palestinians trapped like fuckin' animals behind the barrier,
and we just walk out through the in gate, briefly showed our passports
to the soldiers and got through.</p>

<p>It's fucked up that all those guys will likely not get through
today; the border will close in a couple hours for Yom Kippur, and
stay closed for 24 hours.  Maybe 36.  That shit is fucked right the
hell up.</p>

<p>What action is appropriate?  Refuse to go through unless they let
everyone else through?  Just wait in queue?  Simply ask why they can't
go through???</p>
