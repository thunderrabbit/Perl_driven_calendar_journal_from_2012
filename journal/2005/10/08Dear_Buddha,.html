<p>Dear Buddha,</p>

<p>There's this babe living in the hostel and part of me wants to
jump her bones, but I recognize such an action would not be in my
best interest in the long run.</p>

<p><a href="http://bookcrossing.com/385-3312195">_if the Buddha
dated_</a> has captured the core of many of the issues I have
experienced regarding women.  There are several homework items in the
book, and I'd like to work on some of them here.</p>

<p>However, I recognize a fear within me.  Something like, "I don't
want people able to read how fucked up I am."  Which begs me to note
the self judgement that I'm fucked up.</p>

<p>One of my ex-girlfriends told me I am okay the way I am.  People
can love me as I am, and I don't need to change to be loveable.</p>

<p>Hmmmmm.. Interesting concept.</p>

<p class=date>11:00am</p>

<p>Right now, instead of writing the homework, I'll try to describe
slash uncover the brainwaves in my brain.</p>

<p>Just a bit ago, when I saw the object(*) of my interest, I just
wanted to hold slash have her, like a doll that necessarily loves me
back.  (I can see a fantastic market for realistic sex/love-robots
that always cherish their owners.)  When she smiled and gave me a bit
of attention, I thought <em>awesome</em> and felt happy endorphins
inside my brain.</p>

<p>(*) women are not objects.</p>

<p>Just just now, a woman walked by who has not smiled toward me; I
feel a lack of interest in her, as if she were just some man or animal
walking by.</p>

<p>When my infatuation walks by, I get a bit of a internal jolt, and
hope she'll pay attention to me.  Sometimes I find myself following
her or setting up situations so that I'll be near her.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Once it's confirmed that she likes me, we will play together a bit.
But before too long, the end begins.  I lose interest; I look for the
next one to like me.  Endless cycles.</p>

<p>I am ready to start a new cycle.  I'm ready to love myself.</p>
