<p>Chillin', well fed, waiting for the 10am ISM meeting to start.
Some key players are still in transit.  Probably.</p>

<p>Last night I was like, <em>aight, fer cripes sake, I am <b>going to
go pick olives</b> tomorrow.</em> so I texted Nina (the coordinator of
where people go) to tell her I wanted to do it.</p>

<p>She never replied, and this morning right after I woke up, I got a
call from a woman (Netta Isp)), who was looking for Joe.  She invited
me to the meeting today, but I was like, "I wanted to go pick
olives..." so she suuggested I contact Nina or Ayesh.</p>

<p>Memories of the last time I called Ayesh, got lost on the way to
Nablus, spent time on the internet, but complained that I didn't know
we had to <em>pay</em> for the usage (given that I think internet
access should be an inalienable right, and at Faisal, it <em>is</em>
free), and he ended up paying 2 NIS ($0.50 ish) for me, and I ended up
not picking olives.</p>

<p>So I called Nina again, but got a recorded message that the numbber
was unavailable.</p>

<p>Two people in the hostel asked if I was going to tthe meeting.  I
held firm to my indecision, and wondered how to resolve it.</p>

<p>I wanted the answer to come from within, not a coin toss, and not
talking to anyone else, so I went and sat quietly for a moment.</p>

<p>I thought about the bigger picture of what was happening, and
wondered why I was wanting to pick olives etc etc.</p>

<p>Several messages/signs/suggestions that I join the meeting, no easy
access to olives,..  and I was feeling rushed to pick olives out of
fear that I wouldn't pick olives etc.  Hmm.  go to the meeting.  clear
as fresh water.</p>
