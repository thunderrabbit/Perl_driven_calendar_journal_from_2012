of West Texas..  rolling hills of arid rockiness, with consistently
sparse vegetation.  Trees like brave shrubs grow in clumps where water
visits; the hills have an almost terraced appearance, as if they
have been cut into architecture student models of mountains, made
from stacks of cardboard.</p>

<p>Like an impressionist painting, little speckles of vegetation give
a 50% coverage over these hills.</p>

<p>Our two lane asphalt highway cuts through like a long scribbled scar
across this desert plain, that features occasional warts of buildings
on its face.</p>

<p>Just saw a grove of young olive trees, each protected by a painted
oil drum barrel that will each have to be cut off when the trees are
old enough to fend for themselves.</p>

<p>Max, Anna and I are arranged right to left in the taxi's back seat;
three guys in the mid seat and one in the passengers seat, plus the
driver.</p>

<p>Make that 2 guys in the mid seat; we just stopped to let one
off.</p>

<p>Make that three guys in the mid seat; we just picked up a long
beard tan guy with a small dark turban hat.</p>

<p class="date">11:30</p>

<p>He just got out.</p>
