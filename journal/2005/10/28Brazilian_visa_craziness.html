<p>I got to the embassy well on time, but the guy at the window
seemed quite happy not to help me.  I tried to call PB via my
cellphone, but was unable to do it; this cellphone is not even able
to make a collect call.</p>

<p>I opened my computer on the off chance there would be an internet
connection available, and .. there was.  Thank God.  Solid signal,
even.</p>

<p>I skyped the PB office, and though the connection was pretty much
terrible, it was close to free, and I got Josh to email me back and
we've started an email dialogue.  Here are snippets:</p>

HI Guys!

(Josh, thanks so much for being in the office and dealing with the slow
VoIP; I'm just emailing to put Matt and Yuuka in the loop)

I am in the Brazilian Embassy in Tel Aviv using a free wireless connection
(thank god) and skype to talk to Josh right now.

Basically the guy at the embassy said flatly I cannot get the visa here.
Even if I have all the documentation, I would have to step foot into Brazil
within 90 days of receipt of the visa.

I'm looking for expert guidance....

Love Love

<p>From Yuuka:</p>

Then can you possibly go back to the embassy after Nov.8th (We are goi g to Rio de Janeiro) on February 8th.
Or if you come back to Japan early enough for us to apply for your visa, we can sort that out.

Sorry for the situation. Everything totally depends on the country. I guess. Here there is no problem to
get a visa.

Good luck. I will be here for a while. Give me e-mail back if you have any more questions.

<p>From me:</p>

<pre>
I've spoken with the man here at the embassy and seem to be getting
conflicting stories from him.

In short, he says it's impossible for me to get a visa from here,
because I will be on the ship well before I am in Brazil.

He has said that I need to enter the country within 30 days after I get the visa,
He has also said I need to entery the country within 90 days after I get the visa.

I'm not sure how much of this is an issue with miscommunication in Global English.

Beyond those points, I need proof of a job (which I haven't got), and
proof of sufficient funds in a bank account (which I've sortof got).
I'm quite low on funds after not having worked since April.

I am not ready to "get a job" with P/B, but the idea has crossed my mind.

Yuuka has suggested coming back to Japan in time to sort it out... 

How soon would that be?

I can go back to the embassy here after November 8th, but no guarantee
they will be happy with the documents I put together for proof of
income and proof of savings.

If, worst case scenario, I flat cannot get a visa, is it okay to just "not get off the boat"??

ps: and if you have any ideas on  how to forge/acquire proof of income and proof of savings, that would be great.

The guy at the window is being quite abrupt with me, so I can't
confirm 100% about the docs I need,

BUT, I'm 90% sure I just need proof of income and proof of savings.
Those are the biggest two issues for me now.  I haven't had a job
since April.

I can come back to the embassy after November 8th, but he has *also*
told me it must be within 30 days before travel.  When he saw my
itinerary, he said flatly it was impossible to secure the visa because
I will be on the sea.

<p>I haven't heard back from them since then, but I just sent this
last one:</p>

<pre>
Matt, I heard from Josh that he called you into the office to help,
but we might be sorted for now.  my computer battery is low; I'll have
to sign off soon.

Barring any other suggestions on the visa-acquistion front, I am
basically going to come back to the embassy on 8 November and try
again.  I hope by that time I will be able to put together proof of
employment and proof of savings.

I still have two unanswered questions that I hope you guys can help with:

1) is it an option for me to "not get off the boat" in Brazil?

2) what's the latest I could get back to Japan and do this?  My
   current return flight is set to arriive on 30 November.

If I apply in Tel Aviv, I think I can get (fake) proof of employment, etc.

If I apply in Tokyo, can you help me put that together (if I need it)?

おつかれ, guys; I really appreciate your help!!

      Thanks!
        - Rob
