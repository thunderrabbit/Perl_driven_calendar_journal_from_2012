<p>Went out for drinks with Joe, Andy, Mariah, Jason, and ______,
whose name I've forgotten.  The bar we visited had *no one* inside
(save two employees) so we could be as loud and silly as we wanted.
Which wasn't too loud, but was a bit silly.  Many stories centered on
arriving at the Faisal for the first time, or after curfew.  Joe told
a story titled, "you people are destroying a nation" which featured a
couple of ISMers doing karaoke and using the stage as a soapbox
against the occupation.</p>

<p>During the stories, Mercury Rising was on in the background.</p>

<p>On the way out we discovered a couple more customers: two Israeli
soldiers talking to the employees, maybe.  They left their jeep
outside and one guy was in it waiting / watching it.</p>
