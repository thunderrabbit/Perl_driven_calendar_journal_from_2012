<p>Wow wow wow wow!  I got to see Niveen today!  She brought her old
cellphone and took me to a shop where I could get a sim card so now I
have a call phone in Jerusalem.  I can apparently receive calls all
over Europe, but I'm not sure about details.</p>

<p>She forgot to bring the power supply, but she'll look for that and
bring it next time.</p>

<p>But *that* is not the best part!  She took me to the <a
href="http://palestinianvision.org">Pal Vision</a> office where I met
Ramy, the official middle east coordinator for P/B!  He talks
about 1millionmilesanhour and got three phone calls during our 10
minute conversation.</p>

<p>I said I was interested in helping P/B in some way, and he
was like, "not P/B; you can help us," or something and "what
can you do?"</p>

<p>At first my brain thought, <em>well, not much</em>, given that I
only know 3 words of Arabic [thank you] [you're welcome] and "Ramadan"
and speak much more slowly than he does, but I was like, "I can
write," and he goes, "I love you.  Writing is enough; we need you."
and I was like, <em>woah</em>.</p>

<p>He told me he would definitely give me a headache if I try to do
everything he suggests, but that I should definitely come into the
office on Wednesday at the latest and we'll go to Ramallah (sp) and
Nablus (sp) and he got a phone call and I listened to Adam tell me I
shouldn't believe all the media and everything I hear, but should just
explore for myself, look around and see what's real.  Before I start
talking.  And by that I think he meant before I tell people "who's
side I'm on," etc.</p>

<p>I told Ramy I'd have to talk to Hisham about schedules and whatnot,
and he said that was cool, but guessed I would grow distinctly bored
of picking olives if I tried to do it for a whole month.  He welcomed
me back <em>any</em> time, including without appointment, including if
he wasn't there.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Niveen showed me the best way to walk to their office from the
hostel, and I think I'm set.  Way way way awesome.</p>
