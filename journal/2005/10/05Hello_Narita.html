<p class=date>5:55pm Tokyo Wednesday 5 October 2005</p>

<p>I've arrived at the airport!  I got to Nippori no problem and
hopped on the next Narita Airport bound train o the Keisei line, which
happened to be an all-seats-reserved train, but I didn't pay the extra
fee.  The guy on the train who was checking holepunched my ticket so I
couldn't get out through the gate (and he asked for my name and
confirmation of what station I would depart the train) but I just
handed the ticket to an overworked guy taking tickets and walked
through.</p>

<p>I realize now, that from the train guy's point of view, the system
has been gypped, and he's going to report it and know about it and
know they are out 920 yen (9.2 chicken sandwiches at McDonalds), and
next time the next guy like me might not be able to get away so
easily.  Sorry, guy...</p>

<p>I am an hour early at the Y terminal, so I'm waiting, thinking
about what I've done, which includes depositing my umbrella carefully
along the escalator because I no longer want to carry it and hope some
umbrella-needer finds it.</p>

<p>Little kids are going crazy with hyper energy aroound the copious
stacks of luggage, all carefully monitored by their respective
humans.</p>
