<p>Now I know what a bit of tear gas smells like.</p>

<p><p>Came to Bil'in to see what all the fuss was about.  But before
we even arrived in Bil'in, we were stopped at a flying checkpoint.  I
took a few pics, then we pretended to leave and then we just walked
around the checkpoint.</p>

<p>Before the thing started, I walked with Jason to where the conflicts usually occur.  There was quite a lot of nothing there.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/pre_anything.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/pre_anything.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/Francois_pre_anything.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/Francois_pre_anything.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a

src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/start_of_demonstration.jpg"
align="left" /></a> We walked back to where the crowd had been
gathering, and were met by hundreds of people just chanting at first,
with a peaceful mob of about 100 people marching from the mosque in
Bil'in ("that's a mosque?") to the wall construction site, where there
was not a wall in sight.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/march_and_chant.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/march_and_chant.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/stragglers.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/stragglers.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/soldiers_waiting.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/soldiers_waiting.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>It was a standoff at first with some dialogue between leaders, and I slowly wound my way cautiously closer to the inactivity.  I was pretty nervous, but the fact that so many media types were right there, completely ignored by the soldiers helped bolster my courage.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/standoff.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/standoff.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/observers.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/observers.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/discussions.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/discussions.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/soldiers_waiting_1.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/soldiers_waiting_1.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/plenty_of_media.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/plenty_of_media.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>There was nothing going on, so I put my cameras away and sat on a
rock, wondering when I could sneak a drink (impolite to eat or drink
around Muslims around Ramadan). Also took a few snaps of this cute soldier.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/cutie.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/cutie.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Then the peaceful mob of 100 split into three groups: retreaters,
separators (who walked off the main trail), and stayers.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/separatists.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/separatists.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/chasing_separatists.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/chasing_separatists.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/just_a_moment.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/just_a_moment.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/smiling.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/smiling.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The separatists were followed by the soldiers, and the stayers just
stayed.  Kinda boring, but I got several pics.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/more_discussions.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/more_discussions.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/plain_clothes_cops.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/plain_clothes_cops.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thats_it_Im_outta_here.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/thats_it_Im_outta_here.jpg" /></a> </p>

<p>There was a bit of activity down the hill with the retreaters, but
I didn't see what, but the jeeps sure zoomed the hell down there.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/zoooom.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/zoooom.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/come_and_go.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/come_and_go.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/stopped.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/stopped.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Then the remaining Palestinians were harassed by soldiers a bit.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/you_must_leave.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/you_must_leave.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I was unimpressed with one soldier bullying one Palestinian kid:</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/bully_1.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/bully_1.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/bully_2.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/bully_2.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/bully_3.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/bully_3.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Especially when he seemed all proud with his own /\/\4d 5k!11z of
intimidation.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/I_showed_him_mwahahaha.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/I_showed_him_mwahahaha.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Lots of words exchanged, and I was surprised when the most adamant stayer immediately got up when I cop wanted to talk to him. Maybe because the police have authority to arrest, but the soldiers do not.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/I_aint_leaving.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/I_aint_leaving.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/talk_to_cop.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/talk_to_cop.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Finally the soldiers left, and soon thereafter the stayers left as
well.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/Francois_on_jeep.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/Francois_on_jeep.jpg"
align="left" /></a> I walked back with them - down the hill and back
up the next one.  I was quite surprised to see some soldiers holding
the snakes (that represented the wall) and having a chat with the
Palestinians.  There's obviously far more to this than us -vs-
them.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/getting_along.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/getting_along.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/flame_thrower.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/flame_thrower.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/overview.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/overview.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/all_done_maybe.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/all_done_maybe.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/homegrown_road_block.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/homegrown_road_block.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>but then some of the retreaters became rock throwers, and the
soldiers whizzed into action against them.</p>

<p>I climbed up onto an unfinished, slightly damaged house where I
could see the soldiers shooting (rubber?) bullets and tear gas.</p>

<p>I'll be straight, dude - it was scary.  And I was well visible on
top of the house.  Fortunately, I was no one's target.</p>

<p>I thought about ways to get a picture of Francois from that vantage
point with the soldiers in the background, but I never got it.</p>

<p>(( in fact, it appears I got *no* pictures from that exchange, but
I know I got a significant amount of video.  I may get it imported and
find some useable bits to put on here. ))</p>

<p>That action seemed to stop and basically the internationals were
around that broken house area, and many young Palestinian men were
having a bit of guerilla warfare with rocks against the soldiers with
bullets and tear gas.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/spent_shell.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/spent_shell.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/tear_gas.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/tear_gas.jpg" align="left" /></a> Several internationals were milling about for a while, watching and
chatting with some Palestinians.  We got a large but diluted waft of
tear gas that blew up the hill toward us.  (Amazingly, raw sliced
onion smells *far* better than tear gas.  Like, "oh yeah;
that's <em>gooood</em>" practically shoving onions in our noses..)
Later, some press interviewed a guy (why did they only have pen and
paper, and not a tape recorder at least?)  while a couple of people
(including me) videoed parts of the interview.</p>

<p>Suddenly it was cut short (after my video camera battery cut out
(dammit; I had left it on while not in use for at least 20 minutes))
as Palestinians came running away from the soldiers shooting tear
gas.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/Francois_after_tear_gas.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/Francois_after_tear_gas.jpg" /></a> 
<a href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/me_after_tear_gas.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/me_after_tear_gas.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/slinging_rocks.jpg"><img
src="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/thumbs/slinging_rocks.jpg"
align="left" /></a> Holy shit.  I found myself in the middle of it,
first near this Palestinian guy slinging rocks (I got a 
<a
href="/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/bilin_14_october/slinging_rocks.mov">video
of his shot</a>), and then I got the hell away and ended up among
soldiers with guns having rocks thrown at them (with slings) and I was
a bit nervous about Hitomi's camera and my camera being hit with
rocks.  Also a bit worried about my head, but I actually felt a lot
better being <em>with</em> the soliders than being on the receiving
end of their bullets.</p>

<p>We retreated even farther and left the melee behind us and
regrouped for a bit.  Then &lt;foom&gt; &lt;foom&gt; two tear gas
canisters were shot and came *right* near me, and I got a small but
intense wiff of tear gas.</p>

<p>We started to run-retreat and the guy who had previously asked me
for a copy of the interview I videoed was in a car and offered a ride
out of there.  I quickly accepted, but then hopped out after we got
stuck at a rock roadblock put in place by the locals to stop the
soldiers' jeeps.</p>
