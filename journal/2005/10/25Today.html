<p>Hung out with Ben a lot today.   We listened to some of his tunes
and talked about the carpet problem and tried to understand
fibbonacci spirals and stuff.</p>

<p>He told me about the ISM training, and about adventures they had
there.  He and Dave had a chinup competition; Ben showed me the
videos.</p>

<p>We had a bit of our own chinup competition, and he beat me hands
down.  Or.. up.</p>

<p>Ben's a pretty cool cat.</p>
