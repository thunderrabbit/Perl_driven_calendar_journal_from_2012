<p class=date>1:45pm Tokyo Wednesay October 5th 2005</p>

<p>Have left Kellie's house and am on the bus to MusashiKosugi station
and then will take a train to Kawasaki where I hope to meet Miki,
though she hasn't responded to my text message yet.</p>

<p>Before hopping on the bus, I stopped by the post office and mailed
coins to Karina, my old broken GPS and cables to Art, and Chinese
textbooks to Bryn.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a trick to explain that I didn't mind if the little
package I put together for Karina was placed in a larger envelope.
They were all wonering what to do since tthere was no Japanese
return-address on the package and not enough room to write one.</p>

<p>I sang a song to put myself in a more optimistic mood after that.</p>
