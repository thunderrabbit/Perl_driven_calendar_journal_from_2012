<p>Argh.  I have done not so much, by some reckoning.  I guess it's
that I am here in *Jerusalem* but just fucking around on the internet,
and not saving the world, which I have discovered to be more difficult
than originally planned.</p>

<p>Yesterday I helped Rami at Palestinian Vision with some documents
and was supposed to work on (*) their annual report, but the
documents he emailed me last night hadn't arrived by this morning.  I
also hadn't tried the flash drive last night to discover that it
couldn't be read by my computer, so I *could* have emailed him last
night to resend the documents.</p>

<p>I set up the itineraries for the 49th and 52nd voyages on my site

<pre>travel -> pb -> ## -> itinerary</pre>

so that is at least something productive.  Also fucked around on
longbets.org, a site that I've discovered is a bit less than
astonishing, considering it's supposed to be recording information for
hundreds (thousands) of years, but the website doesn't work properly
(login details on the www. 3rd Level Domain name don't work on the
discuss. 3LD)</p>

<p>Right now I am curious to know the command in emacs that allows me
to type a character and have its HTML &amp;-code come up.</p>

<p class="date">(*) 9:38am</p>

<p>They *just* arrived.</p>

<p>Except the one I need to start (the base that I wrote
yesterday).</p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck how did it get to be 11am?????  Who's in charge?
What's going on here??</p>
