<p>We are "in Nablus" tonight, but we are actually staying in the ISM
apartment just outside Nablus, in Balata (sp), the largest refugee
camp in the West Bank.  There is a common room, kitchen, bathroom, and
two bedrooms.</p>

<p>The bedroom furniture consits of foam rubber mats, some of which
have coverings.  Stuff is tossed in various places, with a slight
semblance of order, as some of the mats are up against the wall to get
them out of the way during the day.</p>

<p>Before going through Hwara (sp) checkpoint, we coordinated our
stories that we were English teachers going to see some high schools
in the area.  So strange that we may have to lie to get into a city;
not another country.  Or is it?</p>

<p>I feigned sleep through the whole thing and the soldiers never
checked my passport.  I believe they didn't even come close to where
we were in the back of the bus.</p>

<p>Afterward, Sarah said I did a good job sleeping.  I'm not sure if
she actually meant it was helpful, or just commenting in general that
it really looked like I was sleeping.</p>

<p>If I understand where we are, the bus must have driven up a hill
as it arrived in the greater Nablus area.  I didn't notice such a
hill, so I imagine we are on the right hand side of the main road
into Nablus (from Hwara).</p>

<p>There's a note in the restroom explaining that due to low water
pressure, we are only allowed showers once every three days.  And to
flush the toilet, we should use waste water from the sink.</p>

<p>I just climbed the wall 2 feet away from the back wall of this
building.  There is a warped sheet of plywood or something upon which
I stood to boost myself to the top of the wall.  I stood on it for a
bit and looked around before climbing down.  Saw mostly buildings in
various degrees of repair and construction, but no construction
materials.  Lots of TV antennaes and satellite dishes.  A couple of
lights and a mosque as well.</p>

<p class="date">1:08am IST Sunday 30 October 2005</p>

<p>We had an orientation by Ayesh, who told us a lot of things about
the history of Balata, and some of the present events: there are
military incursions every night and we must not go outside after
midnight because we could get involved in a shooting from either the
soldiers or the fighters, neither of whom will be able to identify us
as a friend.</p>

<p>Yikes stripes what kind of place am I in?  I thought we were just
going to go pick olives tomorrow.  I thought the intifada was over.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm really thankful for Chris being a proponent of
Silent football, though we haven't had enough other interest to form
a game.</p>
