<p><b>Legal:</b></p>

<p>Three distinct legal systems exist within Israel/Palestine.  Legal
system encompasses laws / police force / judges / court houses / jails
/ etc.  One for Israelis, one for Palestinians, one for
internationals</p>

<p>Israeli system is a civil system; its people have rights, and the
police are police.</p>

<p>Palestinian system is a military system; its people have few
rights, and the police are soldiers.  The prisons are tents behind
barbed wire and chicken wire.  Easy to expand and difficult to say
"it's too full."</p>

<p>International system is new; detention centers are old hotels (in
some cases).  Developed by the Ministry of the Interior.  It's
basically for deportation, and started when the West bank was closed
in April 2002 and Israel had to import workers from 3rd world
countries.</p>

<p><b>remember these regulations and rules that apply to me today:</b></p>

<p>We no longer have to be proved guilty to be deported.</p>

<p>All they need to deport me:  a hearing with no lawyer, no burden
of proof, just issue a deportation order, and a right to appeal being
held until my deportation, but no chance to win the appeal, and no
chance to appeal the deportation.</p>

<table border=1><tr><td>

<p>In the old system (pre April 2002),</p>

<p>If an international is found guilty of committing a crime with a
punishment of less than one year, will not be charged with the
crime.</p>

<p>Basically, any non-serious crime would not be tried.</p>

<p>We cannot be held for more than 24 hours without a trial.</p>

<p>The judge must agree we are dangerous or will flee when requested
to be interrogated before the detention can be prolonged.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Nowadays we will not likely be deported unless we try (or have
tried) changing our name to get in, or straightup lie to the system,
or break conditions that we previously signed.</p>

<p><b>if we are arrested now:</b></p>

<p>We could be held up to 24 hours</p>

<p>given conditions for release</p>

<p>release</p>

<p>probably not deported</p>

<p>bring us to a judge, who can only do the same things: release or
release with conditions.</p>

<p>Might be denied entry next time I try to enter the country</p>

<p>What if I speak Japanese?</p>

<p>Should we pack before acting?</p>

<p><b>tactics:</b></p>

<p>Sit down: this holds our ground and is de-escalating</p>

<p>Distraction: going to a conflict sometimes</p>

<p>Absorption: pulling a soldier away from their target</p>

<p>Puppy piling: piling onto a soldiers' target</p>

<p>Linking up: grabbing each other makes it harder to be arrested</p>

<p>Regrouping: after the issue is over</p>

<p><b>weapons:</b></p>

<p>Sound bombs: look like grenades but only plastic shrapnel</p>

<p>Tear gas: makes us feel like we can't breathe, and causes tears.
We can still breathe; onion or vinegar soaked rags help breathing.
Swim goggles are great to protect the eyes.  Wearing contact lenses
causes huge problems with tear gas.</p>

<p>Wash about a half hour after being gassed.</p>

<p>Rubber bullets: two types are used, buckshot and sniper.  Turn
around and cover neck and ears.</p>

<p>Live rounds: deadly.  Get down and find cover.  Stay.</p>

<p class=date>2:45pm IST Monday 10 October 2005</p>

<p>We just did a role play of soldiers trying to push back a group
and arrest a Palestinian.</p>

<p><b>Self care:</b></p>

<p>A lot of the stuff we'll see could be emotionally traumatic.  These
are not normal situations and lots of things can trigger emotional
response.</p>

<p>Eat well.  There's a lot to do, but don't forget to eat.</p>

<p>Sleep well.  Sometimes we have long long days of actions, then
have to write reports.  Adrenaline can only take us so far.</p>

<p>Take a break after seeing really wack stuff or after working a while.</p>

<p>Post traumatic stress disorder happens to some ISM participants,
so get contact information of other ISMers and get professional help
if necessary.</p>

<p>Give yerself some time to chill when going back home.  Don't just
jump back into work or try to set up a speaking engagement or keep
the momentum going.</p>

<p><b>language:</b></p>

<p>Ahterem halak: lit. 'respect yourself' good for stopping begging,
theft, or sexual harassment</p>

<p>Chalas: </p>

<p>Men should be the ones to greet other men; women should not greet
first as it will be seen as flirtation or invitation.</p>

<p class=date>4:06pm IST Monday 10 October 2005</p>

<p><b>Emergency procedures:</b></p>

<p>If someone is killed or injured badly:</p>

<p>call the ambulance (usually 101)
<br />stay with the person, but don't try to move them, depending on injury
<br />call ISM media office
<br />re-group; check others' responses
<br />*  agree on story as seen from various points of view
<br />*  choose contact person for media
