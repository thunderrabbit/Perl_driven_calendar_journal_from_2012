<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>I am definitely mo' bettah packed for Palestine than I was for
P/B.  I have a single suitcase that is packed and zipped and
ready.  (though I might charge my video camera battery
tonight)</p></li>

<li><p>I have everything for my backpack packing in easy reach slash
within Kellie's house.  I can toss all that together in the AM.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't met Hitomi yet, nor mailed stuff to the US.  I
haven't received emails from Wende, Frank, nor Bryn to tell me what
address I should use for them.  I can forward that info to janette for
Wende and Frank, but I'll need to work out something else for
Bryn.</p></li>

<li><p>I am feeling quite confident that I will be ready for
everything tomorrow.  So much so that I may go see a movie tomorrow
before leaving.</p></li>

<li><p>I think the final turning point was having an itenerary for my
trip.  Well, a list of places to visit, but in no particular
order.</p></li>

<li><p>Super incredible thanks and love to my fabulous mom for sending
me some much needed cashola.  Blessings and love to her.  (An extra
heap)</p></li>

<li><p>Kellie's room, however, is still a mess.  I gotta get a pile of
crap out of here; Hitomi said she would archive it slash sell / toss
it for me.</p></li>
