<p class="date">4:13am Tashkent Thursday 6 October 2005</p>

<p>Have arrived in Tashkent.  Queues to get off the plane give me a
moment to type.</p>

<p>Flight was uneventful, unless I count chicken dinner and cold
sandwich breakfast as events.</p>

<p>I had a personal event of changing from shorts to jeans in my seat.</p>

<p>I want to video the supervac toilets; they suck hard!</p>

<p>Been practicing mindfulness per the Buddha dated book.</p>

<p>Wondering how cold it is outside; it's a bit cold here on the
plane, and I only have a T-shirt in my immediate possession.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, I'll be on another flight at 5:30am or
so.... to Tel Aviv, baby!</p>
