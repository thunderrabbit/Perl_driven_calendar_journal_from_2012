<p>How high a compliment from Salvador who said simply, "you look
very peaceful," after we made eye contact across the room.  I assured
him I've been having a great day and explained it's my 13,000th day,
and explained what I meant by that.</p>

<p>Big surprise when Marco said he had just done his own days old
calculation just last month!</p>

<p>I gave him high five twice as he described basically the exact
reasoning I've given for why it's cooler to celebrate 500 days instead
of years.</p>

<p>We three guys shared stories about travel and stuff and everything
was quite balanced conversationally and it was all just really
great.</p>

<p>At the end, left with a happy feeling, I reflected back on what
had happened and laughed at myself inside for being so slow to come
to the simple realization, like Homer Simpson wondering how to
acquire more peanuts using money.</p>

<p>If I get off my computer and talk to people, I may have enjoyable
conversations!</p>
