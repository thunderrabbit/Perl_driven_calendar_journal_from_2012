<p>I'm 13000 days old now!!!</p>

<p>Stayed up chatting about philosophical intangible spiritual
inexplicable stuff with Serena and Rochelle.  They have had some
pretty cool experiences, some of which were induced via long periods
of meditation.</p>

<p>Hitomi sent me an email song for my 13000th day!  So sweet!</p>

<p>I made sure Rochelle and I were clear; after my silly statement
last night, which I retracted, everything is all good.</p>

<p>Monica, from Italy, whose legs I grabbed cause I thought they were
Serena's, is talking to some lads (I never say lads!) in the other
room.  I've fully enjoyed the sight of her long dark hair and height
and nice smile.  I can feel myself wanting to make a connection, but
am choosing not to go "hang out" in there with them.</p>

<p>I will, however, being a fellow human on this fragile space ship,
say goodnight.</p>
