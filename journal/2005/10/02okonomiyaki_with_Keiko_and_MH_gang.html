<p>After ultimate I met Keiko in Musashikosugi and we walked to
Millenium House.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Jen for giving me her towel and soap and Michael
Jackson glove so I could take a shower..</p>

<p>We chowed okonomiyaki a la Shoko, Ikumi, and Jen.  Andrew was there
and I saw Sam and Jade and a new guy named Tom.  Cyrus came for most
of it, and Riki came for part of it.  I gave Ikumi a piggy back ride
(against her wishes, so it was a bit tricky).</p>

<p>Special thanks to Ikumi for loaning me her Mac power supply.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Ikumi for storing my skates while I was on PB!!</p>

<p>Special thanks to Shoko and Ikumi (oh, and Jen) for making
Okonomiyaki!!!  Especially Shoko Shoko.</p>

<p>Special thanks to everyone for thinking my shopping cart dance and
driving dance were quite entertaining...  Jen asked me to do them;
it's a bit of a trick to get into a dancing mood with no music, but
for a good laugh, I can do it.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Keiko for buying me ice cream.</p>

<p>I walked Keiko home, chatting with her about her current apartment
and job search situations.  She has become free so I told her she
could go anywhere and do anything during this magical time.</p>
