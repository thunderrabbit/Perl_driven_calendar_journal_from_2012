<p>Watched <a href="http://robnugen.com/wordpress/?p=17"><em>Kung Pow:
Enter the Fist</em></a>.  Funny stuff.</p>

<p>Called Uzbekistan Airlines to arrange my return flight, but they
are closed for Yom Kippur.  I'll call them in the AM.</p>

<p>I need to get Hitomi's address do I can send her camera back, but
a new camera, and get a yellow fever shot so I can sail on PB 52!</p>
