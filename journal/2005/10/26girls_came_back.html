<p>Rochelle and Serena came back after picking olives today, and they
said they got to <em>climb</em> the trees!!  Not only "get" to climb;
they *had* to climb to get all the olives.  Wow!!!</p>

<p>That doubles my intention to go.  I love climbing trees!  I can
just imagine myself barefootedly among the branches.  Crazy awesomely
fun!</p>

<p>Serena walked by (behind me) while I was sitting at the table and I
reached back and kinda grabbed her legs.  She was like, "wha?" and I
looked more carefully; it wasn't Serena!!!!  Oops!</p>

<p>A woman I hadn't previously met.. her name is Monica.</p>

<p>Jason was like, "that's a pretty good way to meet someone; 'oh I
thought you were someone else!'"</p>
