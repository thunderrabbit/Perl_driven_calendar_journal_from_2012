<p>I had a dream about my long lost ex
girlfriend <em>Christine</em>!</p>

<p class="dream">I was all affectionate and flirting with her; she
responded physically, but then said, "don't do this; you're making me
so *hot*," which she apparently didn't want to be.  I hypothesized she
wasn't single, and therefore didn't want to hook up with me.</p>

<p class="dream">Racing downstairs to use the restroom, I realized it
would be faster to fly.  I flew over the door, through a glass window
protected by a grate, and then swooped into the restroom.  I knew that
I could pee, but that for some reason it wouldn't actually help.
However, as a visual joke, I decided to pee myself backwards, using it
like a liquid rocket in some crazy movie (*).</p>

<p class="dream">I peed and flew backwards out of the room and
backwards back down the hall, racing my friend back.  He couldn't
come too close for fear of being pissed on.  I won the race!</p>

<p>(*) if this has been done in a movie, I don't know about it.</p>
