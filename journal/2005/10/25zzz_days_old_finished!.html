<p>I got my <a href="/cgi-local/daysold.pl">daysold code</a> working
for all cases of adding or subtracting days to/from dates to see when
I'll be that many days old.  The code is pretty ingenious, I think,
once I finally figured it out.  But the real champ is perl.</p>

<p>I haven't even optimized it *at all* and perl whizzes through
99999 / 30 iterations faster than it takes me to notice.</p>

<pre>
sub incDate {
    my ($year, $month, $date, $add) = @_;

    $$date += $add;

    # now check to see if we went over $month length
    while ($$date > $daysInMonths[$$month]) {
	$$date -=  $daysInMonths[$$month];
	&incMonth($year, $month,1);
    }
    # now check to see if we went under 1
    while ($$date < 1) {
	&incMonth($year, $month, -1);
	$$date +=  $daysInMonths[$$month];
    }
}

sub incMonth {
    my ($year, $month, $add) = @_;
    $$month += $add;
    while ($$month > 12) {
	$$month -= 12;    # if $add put $$month == 15, it will become 3
	&incYear($year,1);  # pointer to year, as sent to &incMonth
    }
    while ($$month < 1) {
	$$month += 12;    # if $add put $$month == -2, it will become 10
	&incYear($year,-1);  # pointer to year, as sent to &incMonth
    }
}

sub incYear {
    my ($year, $add) = @_;
    $$year += $add;
    &setFeb($$year);
}
</pre>
