Subject: Hello Miss I don't live at home anymore!  

Hey babe!

I just called the number I have for you and some *guy* answered!  I
was like "oh my god who are *you*???  and what have you done with Kris???"

And he was like "who?"

And I go "Kris.  ten."

And he was like "oh *her*...." and went on to say how you live in
Calgary of all places (Where is that??) and he didn't have yer phone
number memorized...

I was like "das coo' bro; I be sendin' her an email an' shit"

An he goes "aight yo, peace"

and we hung up.

I sang Oh Canada yesterday.

Some of the above stories are embellished.

   with Love
    - Rob!!
