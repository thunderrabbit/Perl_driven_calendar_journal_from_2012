<p>I was hoping to hook up a game of Silent Football tonight, but it
didn't happen, and I think I've figured out why.  There have been new
people rocking into the Faisal, and as the new bonds are formed slash
old friendships are reunited, people would rather chat with their
peeps than play a strange but funny new game that requires a bit of
concentration slash distraction from the basics of forming
friendships.</p>

<p>Silent Football is a Deeper Sharing game.</p>

<p>I plan to get up at ohgod thirty and head out to Tel Aviv and
start the visa acquisition process for my Brazilian visa.</p>

<p>I wonder if they will expect me to run around West Bank without a
passport while they process it??  That seems quite impossible; we'll
see how it goes.</p>
