<p>But first, I'll say David spent a lot of time scoping a world map
to see what countries were actually opposite what other countries, and
basically found that there are very few such alignments.</p>

<p>"if you dig a hole through the earth, you'll come out in China,"
is *also* taught to kids in Sweden, even though it's even a bigger
falsity for them.</p>

<p>Basically, only kids in Argentina and most of Chile could dig
straight through to China.x</p>

<p>Afterward, David asked me a bunch of the theory behind binary and
hexadecimal and computer storage and cool geeky stuff like that.</p>

<p>And Chris and Sarah told us about cane toads in Australia, and how
they are an ecological disaster.</p>
