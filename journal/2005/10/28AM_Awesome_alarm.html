<p class="date">5:59am IST Friday 28 October 2005</p>

<p>How wonderful to wake up gently exactly 30 seconds before my alarm
sounded.  I woke up, scoped my phone-clock: 5:59am.  Sweet.  Then
beepbeepbeep beepbeepbeep beepebeepbeep. Click off; stand up; thank
you, angels.</p>

<p>I can't remember my dream from this morning, but I have a deep
sense that it was quite lucid at the time.</p>
