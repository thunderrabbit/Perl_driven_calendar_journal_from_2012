<p>Came to Takabakabaka and got my power supply, donated the Petra
book and said bye to my peeps in the office.  Pretty cool to be with
people who don't say, "holy shit, Palestine???" but more like,
"excellent!  Say HI to Rami.  Take care, and we'll see you in
December!" because they're all world travelers, too..</p>

<p>Rie bought me a dessert thing at Royal Host after I got to hug
Natalie once more before leaving Japan for 6 weeks.  She's nearly got
me sold on accident/travel insurance, saying it's super cheap and
they'll replace the value of my computer for a 3000 yen deductible
($30) which is FAR less expensive than the times I had to pay $900 or
so to replace the hinges..  Yikes.</p>
