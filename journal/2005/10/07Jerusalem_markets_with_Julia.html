<p>Went wandering around some markets in Jerusalem with Julia today.
I met her this morning as she was writing notes about some videos she
had taken in Hebron, about 45 minutes away, where Israeli citizens
were fucking with Palestinian citizens.  Israelis are allowed to
carry weapons.  Not just the soldiers.</p>

<p>I joined her for a bit of a semi-directed wander around the area;
the short version: we went to the post office (where she mailed her
video tapes home so they couldn't be confiscated if she is searched at
the airport), a market, and the old city.</p>

<p>She helped begin my education process about all the madness that's
going on around here.  She said I should always carry my passport.</p>

<p>Because it's Ramadan, Friday, and a Jewish holiday, police and
soldiers are out in full force.  To some extent they are just for
show, most of the women soldiers don't have clips in their rifles. I
estimate about 1/4 of the soldiers visible on the streets here are
women. But they sure do have rifles.</p>

which wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped) for 7 or 10 NIS, depending
on the size of the cups.  We asked the guy what he did with the
shreddings after the carrots had been food-processed.  He pointed to
the trash can.</p>

<p>We were like, "noooo!" and he turned to the back of his little shop
and grabbed a plastic spoon to let me save some of the shreddings from
their doom.  I had a few bites (wanted a doggie bag, but didn't try to
ask for one) and then he dumped the rest.</p>

<p>We headed up the street in search of a market she had seen in
previous adventures.  The streets are well paved with a bit of rubbish
on the sides, and we saw one man drinking and spitting up on himself
in his misery.  Stopped in a Dollar Store equivalent just to look.
There were no shelves in the middle of the store, a concrete room
about 12 x 12 feet.  He had shelves along the side and boxes in the
middle, all filled with stuff that seemed a bit dirty and less
valuable than our money.</p>

<p>Arrived at the market shortly thereafter.  It was basically food
(fruits, baked goods, raw meat, fish, candy) and some household items
(kitchenware that should be in a dollar store, washcloths, hats).
People mostly wore "normal" western clothes, with a few women wearing
head scarves.  I was most intrigued by the hasidic Jewish men. Here
are average pictures from within the market.</p>

<p>Here are pictures from within the market featuring Israeli citizens with guns.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of soldiers with guns around the market.
Basically I was too intimidated by the men with guns, so I didn't try
to photograph them.  The women generally didn't have clips in their
guns, but on their belts.</p>

/></a></p>

<p>We left the market area, with a couple of bags worth of dried fruit
and some nuts and baclava (?) and water.  I saw some girls having
lunch and got the feeling if I didn't at least try to get a picture
with them, I'd berate myself later.  I'm glad I got it.</p>

<p>This is a poster from the market, but I don't know what it says.</p>
