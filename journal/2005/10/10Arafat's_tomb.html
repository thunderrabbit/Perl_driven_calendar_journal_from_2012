<p>Sarah and I took a quick taxi ride to Yassar (sp) Arafat's tomb,
which is within walking distance of this hotel.  Arafat.  A really
famous cat who changed the world, rests peacefully guarded by three
uniformed soldiers who stand sharply when visitors are present and
slouchingly stand when alone. </p>

<p>The large grave is draped with a large Palestinian flag and a head
scarf matching the one in the picture of him behind the flag.  Two
shoulder things are on either side of the scarf, which is folded once
into a triangle.</p>

<p>The plot is surround by dark tile, all enclosed in a glass room
with white roof and a few plants inside.  Outside the room is a decent
sized plot of strikingly green grass and young olive trees planted
around the perimeter.  Some trees are fully grown, and one or two look
stubby and transplanted.  Along the side and back are young trees with
trunks about an inch to 1.5 inches in diameter, and maybe about 4 or 5
feet tall.</p>

<p>I didn't have my camera, nor Francois, so I didn't take any
pictures, though Sarah got one of each of us with her film camera.</p>
