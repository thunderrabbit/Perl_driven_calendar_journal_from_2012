<p>I need to get a yellow fever inoculation.  I suspect I will have
time in a waiting room.</p>

<p class="date">11:25am IST Thursday 27 October 2005</p>

<p>Plenty of time.  I met a couple who told me upon what lists to
write my name and where to go, etc.  They are traveling to India for
as many as 6 months, but "it could be 1 hour" if they hate it.  I
remembered the stories Carla told us, but I don't know in what cities
she had the most trouble.</p>

<p>I saw the first nurse / doctor person who recommended various
injections given my itinerary, but I was like, "just gimme da yellow
fever shot," so she crossed out everything else.</p>

<p>I went quickly to the next room to pay and got a ticket #138 so I
can get my shot.  Now Serving thing is on #89 now.</p>

<p>People are generally in quiet moods slash good spirits; there seem
to be no complaints happening.  Lots of waiting, though.</p>

<p class="date">12:27pm IST Thursday 27 October 2005</p>

<p>People are beginning to get antsy; the clinic "closed" at 11am, but
there are 30+ people waiting with numbers, and various people keep
ducking their heads in to see the progress, then leaving again.</p>

<p>Now Serving #94.  So it's taken 1 hour to do 5 people, and there
are rumors that some guys socially engineered their way in with
ticket number #110.</p>

<p>I'm a bit hungry, but not as antsy as some of the rest of the
group.  I've got time, but wonder how this will all be resolved.</p>

<p class="date">1:21pm IST Thursday 27 October 2005</p>

<p>Now there are about 19 people here and Now Serving is on #105.
It's been increasing a bit more quickly.</p>

<p>Some people in the waiting area have numbers after mine, though I
haven't done a full survey.</p>

<p class="date">1:22pm</p>

<p>Oh my gosh Now Serving #106 already.</p>

<p class="date">2:32pm</p>

<p>Now Serving #124!</p>

<p>I am sitting next to a woman who will travel to India soon - she
will be there for up to six months.  I'm impressed that her first
journey out into the world will be a solo adventure for so long.</p>

<p>We traded a few words of Hebrew for Japanese, but I have forgotten
the Hebrew.  She says the Japanese word for good morning is too
long.</p>

<p>おはいよございます。</p>

<p>Hmph.  This computer can't type in Hebrew script.</p>

<p class="date">3:24pm IST Thursday 27 October 2005</p>

<p>The last part went super quickly with numbers being skiipped like
bad movies in a rental shop.  I zipped in, got my shot, got out,
waited for my friiend who was #144, but right after me in actuality.
She got Malaria somethiing and something else.</p>

<p>Headed home now.</p>

<p>Home to the Faisal.</p></p>
