<p>Whoohooo!!  We played a lovely game of Silent Football tonight!
Super thanks to Chris for being such a great proponent for us to
play!</p>

<p>The game started with me, Chris, Sarah, David, and Ayesh, with
Jonas and Leena (sp) sitting between Sarah and David, but not playing.
Ayesh didn't listen carefully to the rules (as far as I could tell)
and made several errors at first, but he soon got the hang of the game
and did well.  He was funny because he kept making clicking noises
each time he did a motion, which the rest of the players picked up
during game play.  We all found it quite humorous, actually, though
someone called him/us on it and I declared that Ayesh need not make
that noise anymore (and Sarah suggested that he be required to do it
all the time), but then mentioned how I had made Kris Scott sing a
new song with every tattle and then gave Ayesh the choice of clicking
with every move or no clicking at all.</p>

<p>He chose to click.</p>

<p>David and Sarah tattle on each other quite often, though Sarah
seemed quite adept at speaking before addressing the dictator, and
using pronouns in her elaborate speeches, which we all found quite
amusing.  David did really well at tattling accurately and succinctly;
I believe he always properly addressed the dictator.</p>

<p>(( interesting that I just realized I didn't include the Mister
Dick Tater rule. ))</p>

<p>Early in the game, Chris stole the football several times, which
Sarah claimed was due to his inability to count, so I renamed him Mr
Countless.</p>

<p>David made a guess-tattle on Sarah, which turned out to be
inaccurate, so I renamed him Mr Field a Guess; he had said something
like, "if Mr David could field a guess, I would say Ms Sarah said
quote itself unquote."</p>

<p>Paul joined the game at some point and did well, for his first time
and possibly for not having heard the rules; I think he was in the
kitchen at that time.</p>

<p>I'm tired; time for bed.</p>
