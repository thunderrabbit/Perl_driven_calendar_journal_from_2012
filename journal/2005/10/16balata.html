<p>Just went to Balata refugee camp with Masada.  It's the largest
refugee camp in the West Bank; she said it extends some 10 kilometers
in one dimension and is "big" in the other dimension.</p>

<p>When I think of "camp," I imagine tents, but this area has been a
refugee camp since 1948, when the original Israeli occupation began.
It started out as tents, but is now cinder block buildings all crammed
together with narrow litter-filled alleys with water leaking downhill
from goodness knows where.  Its main streets are narrow, with vending
carts on the sides.</p>

<p>Little kids who had been playing in the streets would stop to stare
curiously at me; I can only wonder what questions were in their
minds.</p>

<p>Masada and I walked through about 5 alleys before finding our way
out again.  We saw only a tiny fraction of the camp.</p>

<p>We walked across the street to Balata village, for which Balata
refugee camp is named.  The streets were normal sized; houses were
normal size and normal spacing; there was actually room to move
around.</p>

<p>Masada told me some wack stories from a few years ago, at the
beginning of the second intifada; she couldn't even travel from
Nablus to Balata (about 10 minute walk).</p>
