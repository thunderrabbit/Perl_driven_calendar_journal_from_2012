<p>Played cards with Sarah tonight.  First her card version of
Monopoly, a game which hadn't been well tested, for we quickly found
an unanswered question in the rules.  We agreed on a rule and played a
few rounds; she won all of them, winning with over 10,000 points. (I
got 750 points).</p>

<p>Then we played a game with a regular deck of cards.  Basra, I think
might be its name.  Basically we try to end up with as many cards as
possible, making sets of cards that add up to identical amounts.  She
beat me quite well at first, but then I had a great hand and caught
up.  She finally won 11 to 10.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is going to be much different than today; I wonder what
it will be like.</p>
