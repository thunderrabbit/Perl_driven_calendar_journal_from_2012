<p>We're in Nablus, back in the PalVision office after having a tour
of the old city.  It seemed a lot like the old city of Jerusalem, but
smaller and no Israeli soldiers.  Still plenty plenty of shops selling
food, brushes, clothes, electronics, phones, fans, foul, and
everything else.</p>

some baby ducks in a cage.  Masada warned that he might get a bit
dirty, but I assured her Francois would be okay.  I got a lot of
attention, though I didn't specifically request it; one guy was like,
"is that for the ducks or your friend?"</p>

<p>I was like, "he's been all around the world with me, and now he's
been with some ducks in Nablus."  I was glad to remember the name of
the city in time to say it.</p>

<p>"He went scuba diving with me in Acapulco," I said to no one in
particular as a way of explaining my rabbit photographing
behavior.</p>

<p>Also got some pics of Francois in a church type area that the 49th
P/B team might enjoy renting out for a party.  No alcohol, but
plenty of hookas and loungy seats and cushions.</p>

<p>Here's Francois climbing out through the missing window in a dome
on the roof of the church.</p>
