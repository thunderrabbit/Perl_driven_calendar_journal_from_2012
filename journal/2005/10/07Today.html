<p>Today I basically finished my journal (including pictures!) for
P/B.  There are some more pictures that I might add, but there
are plenty of pictures included now.</p>

<p>I read more of the Buddha book (a bit over halfway finished now)
and Julia passed on some Palestinian information pamphlets that had
been handed down to her.</p>

<p>I got a bit caught up on email, wrote five postcards, including one
in Japanese (to Kin from 49th voyage) and one with upside down writing
to keep people from easily reading its pro-Palestinian content, which
I suspect could get it tossed instead of sent.</p>

<p>I'll take pictures of those now.  (pics might end up here)</p>

<p>Chillin' in the hostel included speaking a bit of Japanese with
Kayo and Daisuke, who checked my card to Kin (two kanji were way
messed up), but though I used basically 大大大 instead of 大丈夫, he
didn't seem to notice.</p>

<p>Went walking a bit with Sarah to get some foodage for tomorrow.  I
got pita and humus; she got chocolate.</p>
