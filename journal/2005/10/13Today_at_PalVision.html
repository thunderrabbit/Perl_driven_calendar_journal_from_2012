<p>I'm having a bit of lunch now at Palestinian Vision.  I have been
working on some documents for Rami, who is constantly pulled in
several different directions, and seems to always work that way.  I'm
not sure I could do that exactly.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>Niveen came to visit after a rather successful interview with a
hotel; she's been looking for a job since her return from P/B's
49th voyage, and I got to hear a bit about that story (her return),
which included 10 days in a hotel while she waited for some paperwork
that she needed before she could enter Israel from Jordan.</p>

<p>She and Rami got into a high speed discussion about the pros and
cons of activist work, especially regarding ISM.  He suggested that
many foreigners are in it for the adventure, which certainly
categorizes me to an extent.  They don't actually care about the
Palestinians, but come to do a couple demonstrations, end up arrested
and never allowed to return.</p>

<p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p>I am definitely interested in adventure, and I'd definitely like to
tell stories of being arrested, but I don't want to be foreverafter
disallowed entry into the country.</p>

<p>I'm thinking, therefore, that I will classify myself with ISM as
non-arrestable, and not get too involved with the clash in Bil'in, but
just watch from a "safe distance," if that is possible.</p>
