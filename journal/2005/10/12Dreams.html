<p>Early AM dream:</p>

<p class=dream>Sally made a surprise visit to see me!  I was really
excited to talk to her and share stories.  She said she wanted to
sleep with me and I found myself feeling really sad to turn her down,
but she understood and didn't worry about it.</p>

<p class=dream>We were in her friend's previous apartment, and I had
just moved in.  I wanted to go take a shower, and the bathroom was
more like a hot spring auditorium, with cascading hot springs set on
the sloping stage with hundreds of seats watching the bathing, and a
large glass wall for the curtain, and fog to decide if the curtain
was closed or not.</p>

<p class=dream>The restroom part of the bath auditorium was down on
the lower left for men, and lower right for women, but the gender
separation was not really a big deal, as not so many people used it,
and those who did, didn't care.  The ample water from the springs
above flushed any waste in a trice.</p>

<p>AM Dream</p>

<p class=dream>In a dark train station, with some confusion as to what
platform I should be on for what train; they didn't seem to have a
consistent pattern; trains on different routes just showed up at
random points on the platform, according to an apparently secret
schedule or no schedule at all, and the engineers themselves didn't
know where they had been nor where the trains were to go next.  All
the switching was done by computers who were trying to teach humans
there were no wrong turns; we should all live by the grace of the
universe to take us where we needed to go and release the outcome of
the train journey; and just go where it took us.</p>
