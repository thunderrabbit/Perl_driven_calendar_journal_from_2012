<p>Took a pretty long walk to find the Ministry of Health facility,
which was described by various people to be in various places until I
finally closed in on it <em>across the street</em> from the first
place I tried.</p>

<p>85 Jaffa Street is not 86 Jaffa Street.</p>

<p>The facility is only labeled in Hebrew, so I walked right past
it.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health facility in Jerusalem is on 86 Jaffa
Street, about 25 minute walk away from the Faisal.</p>

<p>On the way there, I saw a toy that made me shudder with imagination:</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  Oh my god.  Oh my oh my.  I *must* try this out sometime.</p>

<p>I also saw a bike made of a branch or something.</p>

<p>Also, two things that didn't actually work:</p>
