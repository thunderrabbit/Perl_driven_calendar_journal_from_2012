<p>Oooh perfect!  They served drinks with NO ICE, just the way I like!
And they didn't ask what we wanted; just offered a tray with drinks
already poured.  orange drink, coke, vodka, I think.  I poured my
orange drink into my empty 200ml Pocari Sweat bottle for safe
keeping.</p>

<p>This is an Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 767, and the cabin attendants
are tall.  The TVs in my section of the plane are more often staticky
than clear, but I can sorta tell what's going on.  It's about as clear
as a VCR with really messed up tracking.  Except when it's completely
dark.</p>

<p>They are speaking in a language that sounds like Russian, then in
English, then in Japanese.</p>

<p>Ooooohhh..  I think we are flying to Osaka first!</p>

<p>We are backing up now and there was a weird squilling sound like a
ribbed hose being slurped past a corner and into place.</p>

<p class="date">22:05 Tokyo Wednesday 5 October 2005</p>

<p>We have arrived in Osaka.</p>

<p> I was just wondering how much time is spent stopping and starting
a 767 as opposed to stopping and starting a train.  My experience on
trains around Tokyo says that it takes 1 minute extra per stop/start
as opposed to just rolling through a station.  A lot more for a 767.
But trains are heavier than 767s.  But 767s fly faster than trains.
Is air-travel vs surface-travel a significant factor?</p>
