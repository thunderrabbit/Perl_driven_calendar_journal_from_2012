<p class=date>4:00pm Tokyo Wednesay October 5th 2005</p>

<p>I am on the train again after having met Miki in Kawasaki for a
brief time to chat while I got money from the bank and mailed the
package to janette.  It will go slowly, so it "only" cost 4550 yen to
send.  Eek.  But it's allllllll good.</p>

<p>Went to the Vodafone shop after that where Miki talked to them
about pausing my service.  That's not possible, <em>per se</em> but I
may stop my service and restart it (for only a 2800 yen fee) whenever
I want.  I was like "no way, jack" cause I'd only be saving 3000 yen
and lose my phone number, which I can rattle off in Japanese or
English.</p>

<p>Actually, I just checked, and I can do it better in Japanese.  I
have to translate the digits to English to say it in English.
Wow.</p>

<p>Afterward, we headed over to Azaela for some lunch, which was
probably a good call on her part; I haven't eaten a lot today (thanks
to Kellie for making chicken for her lunch and giving me some for my
breakfast!) and that may have been contributing to my grumpy mood.</p>

<p>(why doesn't the Vodafone rep know from which bank my monthly
payments are coming?)</p>

<p>We stepped in to McDonald's (forgive me, Gaia) because it's fast
and cheap; I got two 100 yen chicken sandwiches and one 100 yen
vanilla shake.  Miki chilled with me while I chowed one sandwich and
half the shake.  She is so darling and cute!  Little ponytail from
near the top of her head but still going backward, not upward.  Always
wearing white and always precious smile with one slightly crooked
tooth like a beauty mark.</p>

<p>She walked me to the train station and hugged me on my way.</p>

<p>Hmmm; I am typing using my Handspring Visor and keyboard.  But I
just realized that I might only have one set of AAA rechargeable
batteries.  I can't remember having seen the second set anywhere while
packing.  I imagine my Visor will lose its marbles if I have it
unbatteried long enough for the batteries to be charged.</p>
