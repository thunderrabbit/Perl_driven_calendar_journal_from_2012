<p><b>Last hour in Japan!</b></p>

<pre>Hello from Osaka!

I was unaware we would have an hour layover here, but it's given me a bit of
internet access to write this message!

I was able to get my things packed, but somehow my suitcase bloated during the
final moments; I added a couple of winter clothes and *bang*; I had to unzip the
expansion part to make it all fit!  But I'm much better this time with a single
suitcase and backpack than all the stuff I brought on P/B 49th voyage!

I still know basically nothing about what to expect when I reach Tel Aviv.  I'm
just supposed to not tell them I'm an activist, wanting to help the Palestinians,
for if I do, the Israeli-controlled immigration will try to put me on the next
plane out.  If that happens, the ISM website suggests I refuse to comply with
safety requirements, and they will put me in jail for a day or so and then let me
go.   Or something to that effect.

But it's my intention to slip through unnoticed, and just make my way to Jerusalem
and a hostel there (where Niveen said she'll make a reservation for me).

Tel Aviv!  Jerusalem!  My brain still doesn't know what to do with these words. 
Are they actually cities?  Do people fly on magic carpets?  Is there electricity? 
Moses?  People wearing long robes and playing mysterious music?

That's why I'm going - so I can say I've gone.  And hopefully help make a
difference for Olive Harvest 2005.

I have Francois, so he will be featured in many photos.

In the world I think I understand, I have just begun reading _if the Buddha dated_
by Charlotte Kasl.

Okay; we're going to board in 3 minutes.

    Love and Blessings

     - Rob!
