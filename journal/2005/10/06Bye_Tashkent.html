<p class="date">5:16am Tashkent Thursday 6 October 2005</p>

<p>On the plane now from Tashkent to Tel Aviv.  The transfer was a bit
choppy with our bus from the plane to the terminal stopping for at
least 10 minutes before the terminal was unlocked or something.</p>

<p>A bit of confusion (on my part, and maybe other passengers) about
where to go, but got it all sorted, stamped, checked, separated,
transfered, stowed, seated and we're ready to go!</p>
