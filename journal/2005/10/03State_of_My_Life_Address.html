<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I am nearly ready to leave Japan for Palestine.  I don't
really know what I'm getting myself into, and I'm a bit nervous, but
mostly happy/excited/optimistic.</p></li>

<li><p>I have no girlfriend, no pets, no car, no house/apt, no idea
what I will do after PB 52nd voyage, and very little idea what I will
do between Palestine and P/B.</p></li>

<li><p>I am living at Kellie's house and have been for the last
month, basically. I leave on Wednesday (2 days away).</p></li>

<li><p>I've gotten all 33 tapes from the 49th P/B voyage
transcribed, but I haven't gotten all my photos incorporated into my
journal.  I'm running out of days, but I really want to do that still;
I am sure the importance will plummet once I'm in Palestine.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been playing ultimate frisbee for the past three Sundays
on the far end of the baseball fields near Futakotamagawa station.  I
enjoyed playing and meeting cool people.  I look forward to playing
again once I get back in Tokyo.</p></li>

<li><p>I've downloaded <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>, and have
enjoyed talking to Niveen free of charge, and to Fred very
cheaply.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been talking to Niveen who has assured me many times that
everything will be fine; she's given me advice on what to wear and
what to bring.</p></li>

<li><p>Just today I received the PIN for my credit card so I can get
cash out while in Palestine.</p></li>

<li><p>I enjoyed a great okonomiyaki food-antics party at Millenium
House last night with Jen, Shoko, Ikumi, Cyrus, Keiko, and others who
were randomly in and out of the room.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't had a proper job in months, and my bank accounts are
showing it.  I've got basically $1200 (US) to my name.  That's
supposed to last until April 2006.  Good thing my return flight is
paid.</p></li>

<li><p>Supposed to meet Hitomi tomorrow; she will hold my summer
clothes so I can have them for the 52nd voyage, but not worry about
them until then.</p></li>

align="left" /></a> I have released my skates and helmet.  I feel a
bit bad for Ikumi who held them for me while I was on the 49th voyage.
But I'm sure that was easier for her than releasing them was for
me.</p></li>

<li><p>In a way, I am super close to being done packing and stuff, but
I think I will unpack all the shiznit I have in the suitcase and
repack according to the list I wrote.</p>
