<p>On the bus to Nablus now, with Ayesh, David, Sarah, Chris and
Carola.  We just attended a pretty effective ISM meeting during which
I took notes.</p>

<p>At one point I offered to teach people non-violent communication
skills (from m men's group) and it seems I'll be doing that on
November 8th.</p>
