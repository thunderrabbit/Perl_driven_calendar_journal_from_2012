<p>Near our apartment, a relatively tall tower towers over the
surrounding buildings.  Standing happily on a mosque, this tower
features a ring of (eight ?) loudspeakers looking out over the
city.</p>

<p>This morning, and probably every morning, at approximately the
deepest part of my sleep, the loudspeakers blast into life with the
singsong voice of a man perhaps praising Allah, and/or telling
everyone to wake up and/or stop eating (being that it's Ramadan and
Muslims may not eat during the day for yet a few more days).</p>

<p>He finished, and I eased back into sleep.</p>

<p>Then he started again, a new song with a new message, and a newly
awoken public to listen.  I eased back into sleep during the song,
which finished after a bit.</p>

<p>Then started again, waking me up briefly.  I think I can get used
to this and he won't wake me up at all after one or two nights here.
If I stay that long.</p>
