<p>Oh</p>

<p>My</p>

<p>Gosh</p>

<p>We have just played the most fabulously awesome Silent Football
game in the past three years of my life!!</p>

<p>Original players included Mr Oliver (who chose not to play after
the first break (requested by Sarah to see fireworks that happened to
be visible outside our window over the old city (probably beyond the
old city))), Ms Sarah, Mr Ben, Miss Serena, Miss Rochelle, Mr Marcus
and me.  We were joined by Mr Dave who rememebered the rules quite
well, having only heard the rules of the game once (yesterday) but
never having had actually played the game.</p>

<p>Dictators included myself to start, then Mr Ben (who quickly gave
it to) Mr Dave, and Ms Sarah, who called herself Madam Titator.</p>

<p>It's been a reallly long time since I've played as a
non-dictator.</p>

<p>They both held superb dictatorships, with lots of funny punishments
and creativity.  Ben having to do 10 press-ups (and then Dave having
to as well for making an error).  Ben gave himself a noogie (most
dramatically) and gave us a display of muscles like a peacock.</p>

<p>Dave as dictator kept calling me Mr Ben, so I was quite pleased
with myself when the actual Mr Ben raised Mr Ben's own hand and was
addressed correctly by Mr Dictator, "Mr Ben?"</p>

<p>So I said, "Mr Dictator, Mr Rob did not have Mr Rob's hand
raised," with the implication being that he was calling on me again
as "Mr Ben."  Genius!</p>

<p>I had my nose touched my Miss Serena's toes, and Madam Titator did
a Fwap-a-Fwap dance, and Mr Marcus became Mr Clock after repeatedly
reversing the direction of the fwap.</p>

<p>Such great great fun; I am *so* glad everyone had a great
time!!!</p>
