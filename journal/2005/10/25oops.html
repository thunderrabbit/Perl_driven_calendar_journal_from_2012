<p>I gave Rochelle a bit of a neck rub just as she was about to go to
bed.  At the end I was like, "thank you for being so tall and
beautiful," and she kinda said, "aww" and gave me a hug then went to
her room.</p>

<p>Then I noticed in my brain a little thought that said something
like she might not appreciate me just complimenting aspects of her
that she cannot change.</p>

<p>Went into the bedroom where she is staying.</p>

<p>"I mean 'thank you for being sweet and funny.'  I realized I should
change it."</p>

<p>And she said something like, "good; it's less offensive."</p>

<p>Yikes stripes!  I realized it wasn't the best thing to say, but I
didn't think it was *offensive*!!  Man; I gotta understand the logic
behind that one.</p>
