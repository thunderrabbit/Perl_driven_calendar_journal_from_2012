<p class=dream>On top of a super tall balcony and needed to get down
to the hotel below, I knew I should be able to control my descent due
to unknown reasons (*).  I stepped off the ledge and fell pretty
quickly but was able to swoop around to the left and then back upward
to make my entry into the hotel.  I was off course the first time, so
I went upward through the trees or roof of some building and tried
again.  The second time I was on track and went straight through the
doors and into the hotel where I landed safely.</p>


<p>(*) I didn't think, "this is a dream," but "I know I should be
able to do whatever I want in this world, but I'm a bit afraid to
try, but I just gotta trust and do it."</p>
