<p class="date">11:59pm IST Sunday 23 October 2005</p>

<p>I am almost finished with the changes to my daysold code.  I now
have it set up so I can enter my birthdate and it will calculate how
many days old I am.  I've got a form set up so anyone can see how
many days old they are.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I plan to fix the form so people can predict when they
will be a certain number of days old.</p>

<p>I will be 13,000 days old in 4 days!!</p>

<p>Whoohooooo!!</p>

<p>Once I get this code sorted, I'll make my /index.html default to my
journal; there won't be any static html page for my root index.</p>

<p>I've added a thing that says

<pre>
         Get Ready!
Rob will be 13000 days old on
      27 October 2005
</pre>

to the top right corner of me website.</p>

<p>But the cool thing is, the date is specifically being calculated
as my birthdate plus 13000 days!</p>
