<p>Laughter and tears and joy as I discover an envelope of money that
I had stashed in a drawer and forgotten.  Surprising thing is that I
stashed it at the end of P/B (I think), but don't have any
memory of it.  I either stashed it then or *before* P/B, which
could well be because I had been feeling pretty flush with cash at
that time.</p>

<p>In any case, it's a welcome addition to my life.</p>
