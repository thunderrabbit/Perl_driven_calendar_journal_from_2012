<p class="dream">Underwater in a pool with Sally, we were able to
breathe on the bottom of the pool doing a bit of foreplay, but there
was a bad guy trying to distract us by throwing snow on us.  I told
her to meld her mind with mine, and together we could stop the snow
from hitting us.  Like in the _Belgariad_, we created a dome around
us, and could feel the snow hitting, like the bad guys probing for
our existance.</p>

<p class="dream">Eventually we came out of the pool and I was driving
along a highway for a bit with Forest, who told us he knew who had
been trying to disrupt us, and that guy was just jealous of our
lovemaking because he was so mean no one would be with him.</p>

<p class="dream">We arrived in this warehouse, where Daniel found the
head of a bird costume shaped like Toucan Sam, and wore it while
climbing around in the warehouse.  The warehouse owners were all upset
that he was doing this they tried to chase him but he did a James Bond
down a rope, and I followed him down, using Hitomi's camera case to
protect my hands.  The guy chasing us couldn't get down that quickly,
so we were able to get away to the train station which was merged with
a roller coaster track and we made it look like we had taken the
roller coaster option, given that we had had the bird head
costume.</p>

<p class="dream">I got a bit lost on the train; Daniel had gotten off,
and I didn't pay attention to where we had gone before that, so I
asked a soldier on the train how to get back to where we were, but
then I realized I didn't know the name of the area where we had
started.  I tried to describe it to him - a place with a roller
coaster, but he still wasn't sure what I was talking about.</p>
