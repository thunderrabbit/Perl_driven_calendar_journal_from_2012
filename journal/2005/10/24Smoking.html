<p>Sigh</p>

<p>Mohammed (semi-manager of the hostel) has declared the non-smoking
room also a non-laptop room.  He didn't really say why except having
"so many people" (usually 0 or 1, frequently 2, sometimes 3, rarely 4
people) on the couches using laptops is "too much, ya know?"  There
are 10 couch seats in the non-smoking room, and I've never seen them
all filled because most people chill in the smoking room, smoking.</p>

<p>I requested permission to sit in the non-smoking room to use the
internet.  He requested that I try the smoking area to see if it's
okay for me.</p>

<p>I'd rather have no internet than sit in that smoke.</p>

<p>I'll use this as blessing to get myself off the internet and
working on Rami's documents.</p>
