</ol>

<p>Hmmm.  I visited my credit card thing online, but they say they are
unable to assist me at this time; please call 800-xxxxxxxxx and I'm
like, "wtf?"  is it my card or their system??</p>

<p>Okay; I'm going to escape my computer soon.  Go secure a charger
for my phone, send postcards and contact Rami at Pal Vision.</p>

<p>Cool day today.  Helped Rami by writing a first and 1.5 draft of a
grant proposal for a cool project he had in his mind, but hadn't
gotten down on paper.  Also edited a pretty well-written paper about
the results of a youth training program to thank the Ford Foundation
for their grant money.</p>

<p>Met Noor (who will give me an arabic textbook tomorrow) and
Mustafa, who told me why it's so challenging to have an
Israeli-Palestinian discussion anywhere in this area.  Basically the
checkpoints and culture won't allow the two groups to mix.</p>

<p>Bounced emails back and forth with Hitomi for about 1.5 hours.</p>

<p>After that, Sarah, Asa and I spent a lot of time looking out the
window, watching the activity of soldiers running around and riding
horses with flashing red and blue lights.  Pretty neat.  In a scary
messed up way.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will go back to PalVision from where Anna, Noor and I
(and others?) will head out to Nablus.  Hisham was saying we may get
trapped in the city if the Israeli soldiers lock it down before Yom
Kippur.</p>
