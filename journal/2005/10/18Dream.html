<p class="dream">A newlywed couple rode away on their motorcycle with Andie the
woman, driving, her husband behind her on the bike and then another
woman.</p>

<p class="dream">I was also quite fond of Andie and shouted something
encouraging as they rode by.  Then two kids ran after them and passed
them in a symbolic "we're faster than you" flirtatious way.  Everyone
loved Andie.</p>

<p class="dream">Andie drove faster to pass them, and then her husband
for some reason jumped off the motorcycle but totally hit his head.</p>

<p class="dream">I ran over to help him, and Andie stopped, but for
some reason wouldn't come over because she had stuff to do.  I ran
over to her and asked for 50 NIS to give to her husband cause he
needed to buy some clothing.</p>

<p>I had another surprising role-shaking dream, but don't remember its
premise nor details.</p>
