<p>I opened my computer to put two last tweaks on my daysold counter
and found an email from Matt, the GET-Teacher-coordinator for the 52nd
voyage.  He was like, "this is the first introductory email" and
"welcome to the team" and "let me introduce everyone."  First - the
repeating teachers _____, ______ (*), Rob, and Petra from the
49th.</p>

<p>And I was like, "WHAT????" cause I had *just* chatted with Petra
last night and she didn't make a peep!  I didn't even know she was
applying to be on the voyage!  Wow wow wow wow!!</p>

<p>Then a bit further down the page, <em>Carla</em> shows up and I
totally lose it with giddy joy!!  I *love* Carla!  In the most
platonic way I have ever loved anyone, Carla is way (**) up there.
She's just completely incredible!</p>

<p>I already knew Kellie was applying and got accepted, so I have
recovered from that shock of learning that we will get to rock around
the world together...</p>

<p>I'm really super duper uber pumped!!!!</p>

<p>(*) two teachers who I don't (really) know from previous
voyages.</p>

<p>(**) way way way</p>

<p class="date">10:30am</p>

<p>Okay.  I plan now to (attempt to) read the rest of the email.</p>

<p class="date">10:31am</p>

<p>Haha - in the back of my brain I was thinking about continuing
work on my "who" page - a little description of all the important
people in my life.  Because I move around so much, I have never
realistically attempted it.</p>

<p>I was thinking about how to uniquely identify people without giving
away their last names, but in a way that I would remember.  About
Carla, I thought, <em>I could name the file carlton</em> because that
name certainly won't be as common as another Carla.</p>

<p>There's a dude name Carleton on the voyage (though he goes by
Carl).</p>

other news, traveling, riding my bicycle, wondering what I want to do
when I grow up...

What are you good at?             : giving neck and back massages,
listening, telling stories, playing Silent Football, starting
projects, daydreaming, getting sidetracked

Who's your hero?                  : That divine part within all of us

Most highly anticipated port      : The ones on the little islands with
names I've never heard of!!

What are 3 fun facts about you?   : 

1) I told my dear friends Kellie and Carla about P/B because I
thought they would love it and knew they would be excellent...  AND
THEY ARE ON THIS VOYAGE!

2) I have a stuffed rabbit named Francois who has been photographed
around the world, including scuba diving in Acapulco!

3) I don't celebrate the annual anniversaries of my birth; I just
celebrate the 500 day anniversaries.
