<p>I'm in the Project Hope apartment for the next two nights.  30 NIS
per night, but it's far larger than Faisal.  But no free
tea/coffee/internet.  But there's free internet at the Project Hope
office.</p>

<p>After arriving in Nablus, I met Ayesh, and I am a bit embarassed
about my reaction to having to pay for internet.  I thought they were
just letting us use the internet while we were waiting; they didn't
ask, "would you like to use the internet?" they just said, "come;
please sit here," and I kinda laughed in my head at the idea of weary
travelers wanting Internet first, and not Food nor Water.</p>

<p>Then the guy put a little "2:00" note by my computer after I had
written an email to Kellie and one to Forest (OMG!).  I realized that
must mean they want me to pay, so in a somewhat passive aggressive
move, I just jumped off the computer and started writing my SoML on
my Handspring Visor again.</p>

<p>Then it became time to go, so the guy came up, "oh, are you
finished?" and I was all, "yeah; I didn't realize you wanted me to
pay; I'm not paying for internet..."</p>

<p>And they were like, "can you pay 2 shekels for internet?" and I
was all, "no way man" and pulled the change out of my wallet and like
chunked it all onto the counter, like I've done in Japan when unable
to get around paying for train tickets when I'm trying to scam the
system.</p>

<p>Quite abrupt and unnecessarily aggressive, so I'm not too proud of
the move, but at least I more quickly became aware of it.</p>

<p>I was a bit embarassed and couldn't really figure out what to say
when Ayesh paid for it for me.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We walked around a bit and I stopped by a bank, but the ATM
wouldn't give me money on my credit card.</p>

<p>Ayesh was distracted on the phone and the other woman with whom we
were walking wasn't saying much, and I wondered if she had been
turned off by my little hissy fit.  After the bank, he was like,
"well, what are you going to do today?"  I was like, "I thought I
would help you guys," and he was like, "there's really nothing we can
do.." and I had to trust it was due to how late in the day it had
become, and not an issue about my attitude.</p>

<p>But, I hadn't exactly gotten warm vibes either, so I was happy to
go hang out with Masada from Project Hope.</p>

<p>I was invited to breakfast with everyone in the Project Hope
center, so I looked forward to chowing with them.  They laid single
sheets of newspaper over all the tables and then put out a rather
large spread of chow and we all started chowing.</p>

<p>Before the dinner was ready, I put together my SoML from my
Handspring Visor, and I got the pictures incorporated into my entry
from yesterday about Bil'in.</p>

<p>Met a few guys (all of whom preferred French for speaking) and a
couple of women, including one native English woman named Kate from
England, specifically Wales. (*)</p>

<p>(*) What??  She has been telling everyone England because no one
knows Wales, but then tonight someone was like, "oh really?  Where in
England?" and she goes, "Wales," and I looked up all, "what???"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I got to tag along when Kate and three Palestinian guys went to a
bar.  It was a (I don't have a word) water pipe bar, where every table
was given a water pipe like corn chips at a Mexican restaurant.</p>

<p>We talk talk talked, and I learned some Arabic and took some nice
shots of Nablus with Hitomi's camera.</p>

<p>It became bedtime [ana tabaan], so we left and they dropped us off
here at the Project Hope apartment, where she has lived for the past
2 months, and I will be for the next two nights.</p>

<p>Starting.... now!</p>
