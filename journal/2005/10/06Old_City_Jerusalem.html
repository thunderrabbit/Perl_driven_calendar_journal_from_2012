<p>I'm staying in a hostel that has an (angled) view across the street
of Damascus Gate, a large arched portal into the Old City of
Jerusalem.  After becoming settled, having put together the last 24
(timezone affected) hours of travel, I accepted an invitation from
Sarah to go explore the area.</p>

<p>Streets are well-paved, but dirty, with rubbish focused on the
sidewalks and back alleys.  Vendor carts covered variously in fresh
breads, fruits, drinks, knick-knacks line the sidewalks.  The vendors
generally paid little attention to us, neither trying to have us
sample their wares nor tantalize us with good prices.</p>

<p>Sarah bought a small bread loaf for 1 NIS, which she suspected was
a ripoff price, but I must say I've no idea.</p>

<p>Across the street and then into the Old City, a set of narrow
bustling streets and markets accented with narrow quiet streets
branching off toward churches or blocked off areas.  Walking slowly
with the foot traffic, again being generally ignored by the vendors,
we exchanged travel stories and comments about the various wares.</p>

<p>A quiet staircase appeared along one side of the street, so we
ascended into the quiet courtyard area with copious litter tossed over
the fence onto the roof over the sidewalk where we had been.  We found
a church built in 325 AD that featured large green doors and some sort
of echo-chamber hymn room that we didn't actually seek.</p>

<p>On the way back to the steps, I was taken by the numbers of fences
crisscrossing the roofs of the city.</p>

<p>Back down into the main sidewalk we turned left and found the dome
of the rock, and headed that direction.  We found ourselves in an old
tall-arch hallway with small skylights periodically along the ceiling
and vendor booths along each side.  I wondered when someone had the
great idea to convert this grand church wing into a glorified souvenir
shop.  Sarah guessed it had always been a market.</p>

<p>I looked up at the skylights and discovered they had become
skybricks.</p>

<p>At the end of the hall, some steps led up to what is apparently an
entrance to the dome of the rock.  Cool!</p>

<p>Just before we arrived at the steps, a machine gun endowed Israeli
soldier waved his hand at us.  We were not allowed to go in.</p>

<p><em>Hmmmm.</em> "Can we come up the steps and look?"  I
queried.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>I didn't try to plead/flirt/debate past that point; we just turned
around and headed back down the hall.  A left turn brought us through
an arch and into a bit of a foot-traffic jam near an entrance/exit
featuring a metal detector.  For some reason, a bunch of people went
in through the exit, including us.</p>

align="left" /></a> We found ourselves in the large generally-quiet
courtyard overlooking the Wailing Wall, which Sarah said was part of
Solomon's temple rebuilt by David.  People are allowed to approach and
even touch the wall, though it's apparently (one of) the holiest
places / items in Jewish faith.  However, the wall visitation areas
are gender separated, with the women given about 1/3 or less of the
available length of wall.</p>

<p>Hasidic Jewish men (with shaved heads except for sometimes-curled
long tails on both sides, wearing two hats each (the bowl shaped
form-fitting hat and the black top hat looking one) and long black
coats and pants) read prayers / scripture in Hebrew that sounded like
a low murmur while doing a repeated rocking bow type motion toward the
wall.  I wanted so much to get a picture of them specifically, but
didn't think it would be appreciated.</p>

<p>We generally headed out of the city, stopping for humus and pita
plus vegetables and drinks.  It was scary to see the Israeli soldiers
walking by with enormous machine rifles slung over one shoulder.</p>

<p>I also didn't take pictures of them.</p>
