<p class="dream">I found my flash cards on a keyring and flipped
through them to make sure they were mine, and was hilariiously
surprised to find someone had drawn a little animation of a little
worm rising up to shoot the bad guys and have terror rain down around
him as vehicles were destroyed and he ducked down and then when it was
all over he got up and wormed away.</p>

<p class="dream">Later, I was on a train along a river surrounded by a
steep tree covered valley and surprised to find myself cuddling with a
man that I had just met.  He had his arm around me and was caressing
my leg and I was equally but non-specifically entwined with him.</p>

<p class="dream">We got off the train at the end of the line inside
this restaurant tha t overlooked the valley and had a cool water
fountain inside.  I said bye to him and then headed off to find my
train back home.</p>
