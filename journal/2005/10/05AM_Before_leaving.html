<p>Aight: super fast: I checked TJ Bike and he seems fine.  Tires are
a little low, but by no means flat.  I turned his wheels 1/4 turn and
left him at that.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Hitomi for holding my stuff while I'm gone.</p>

<p>Gotta collect my junk, mail some junk, then get the funk outta
here.  And tidy Kellie's room a bit.</p>

<p>Didn't get all my pics from PB49 incorporated into my journal.</p>
