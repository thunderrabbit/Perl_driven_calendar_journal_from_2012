<p class="date">11:34am Jerusalem Thursday 6 october 2005</p>

<p>Awesome.  I made my way to Jerusalem, and Damascus gate, and to
Faisel hostel, and have met Hisham, a quietly smoking man who manages
the hostel.  He's apparently pretty popular; a large "WE LOVE HISHAM"
poster hangs above the counter in the tea room.</p>

<p>I met Meri (sp) from France (and heading back in 5 days after being
here for months (since Feb in the country) and Olivier (sp), about
whom I know very little.  They are eating cheese and bread at the next
table.</p>

<p>Hisham said he'll show me to my room soon.</p>

<p>I was a bit lost once I emerged victorious through customs and
baggage claim.  ain't go no money, no map, no idea where the
shuttle/train to Jerusalem might be.</p>

<p>Found an ATM, but it wouldn't give me cash on my card.  Same with
another ATM.  Same with a third, and fourth (but they were the same
companies at the first and second).</p>

<p>An actual bank, however, put an end to my cashless situation.
Pulled out 400 NIS (the website said expect to pay 100 per week) in 50
NIS notes.</p>

<p>Found the trains and shuttles.  Train to Jerusalem was 19 NIS.
shuttle driver wouldn't quote me a price but I ended up taking it
anyway, trusting I would end up closer to my destination that some
train station in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>After quite a lot of antics featuring people with distinctly two
sets of outfits (that I will grossly stereotype as Arab and Jewish),
yabbering in Hebrew (not enough of that coughing sound to be Arabic (I
think!!)), getting on and off and on and off the shuttle, (during
which time I began to visualize my luggage and I safely arriving at
Damascus Gate for 20NIS, and I felt through the fears welling up in my
brain,) we finally left.</p>

<p>After quite some distance traveled through open desert and rugged
hilly terrain, a guy asked me where I was from and where I was going
and stuff.  I told him United States and Damascus Gate, respectively.
He made sure my destination was communicated to the driver (who I
thought had already been told by the guy on the curb who I told in the
first place), and then said it was all good.</p>

<p>We dropped off various people at various places and then I was
asked to get off and transfer to another shuttle in the middle of the
street.  (Just like in Acapulco on those crazy cool bumpin' buses...)
I gave my driver a 50NIS note (as the other passengers had been, and
got 5 NIS back.  I trust (and have a bit of evidence (when two guys
got off, they gave the driver 100NIS and got one coin back) that) it
was the right price.</p>

<p>Changed shuttles, didn't go but about a kilometer or 2 and then was
dropped off at what could have been the middle of the edge of a city,
and I had no idea where to turn.</p>

<p>Asked some guy for directions to Damascus Gate and he pointed me
down a street.  I didn't get too far when I saw a couple about my age
and appearance.  Meri and Olivier, and they were headed to the same
hostel.</p>
