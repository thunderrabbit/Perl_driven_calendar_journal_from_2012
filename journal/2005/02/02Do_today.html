<p>Last weekend, I wrote down my goals/chores and did them.  Before I
wrote them, they seemed insurmountable, maybe in that I didn't have a
grasp on what was important.</p>

<p>To do today:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do laundry using hot water</li>
<li>Buy groceries</li>
<li>Eat</li>
<li>Go through the (short) stack of papers on my desk</li>
<li>Ask Richard or Shoko to help me put knotboards for sale online</li>
<li>Go to Shibuya to see the guy who's riding around the world on his bike</li>
</ol>

<p>Yikes; gotta hurry!  The Shibuya thing is at 7pm!</p>

<p>Okay.  I got the laundry started (hot water in both washers), and
I even took my suit to the cleaners.</p>

<p>Next: groceries (cause I'd rather not do it)</p>

<p class=date>1:09pm</p>

<p>Shopping finished; cooking finished; eating Roboyaki in
progress.</p>

<p class=date>2:00pm</p>

<p>Eating finished; dishes washed; laundry put away.</p>

<p>Richard is about to help me get my stuff listed on Yahoo
Auction.</p>
