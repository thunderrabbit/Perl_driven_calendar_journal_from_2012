<p>Genki Man Dan is in town!  He arrived at my room at 6:30 or
something; I was in no state to wake up really, but gave him a hug
and offered to have him come in and chat until I wake up.  He chose
to go downstairs and chill.</p>

<p>Yesterday he called me from Kei's cell phone and asked me to email
him Jen's phone number to that number, but I have my phone in
Japanese mode and thought he had called from a 03 number which is not
possible to mail to, so I thought he meant his yahoo account.</p>

<p>Nightmare.  But oh well; it was just a silly thing piled on top of
other silly things that kept him out for a night with kei instead of
hanging with us.</p>

<p>He's going to visit OM with us tomorrow.  Actually he and Tetsuya
are ; it'll be a party!  OM is out of town in OZ this weekend..</p>

<p>This morning I had a dream after Dan woke me up.</p>
