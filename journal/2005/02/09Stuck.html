<p>My brain is stuck.</p>

<p>possible things to do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Work on journaling my trip while it's fresh in my mind</p></li>

<li><p>Reply to emails that are piling up. (I already replied to
Jackie's.)</p></li>

<li><p>put things for sale on yahoo (I got the missing piece)</p></li>

<li><p>work on the video from Jesse-Takako-Rob adventures at the park
during New Year's break (cause my disk space is low, a lot taken by
those video clips)</p></li>

<li><p>eat</p></li>

<li><p>Try to track down my GPS (ironically) that I had sent to my
dad's house, but hasn't been forwarded to me, and for some reason my
dad hasn't replied to email nor phone calls for many many
days.</p></li>

<li><p>take a shower</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that I'm clearing space on my hard drive, not just by
editing those video files.</p>

<p>I'm consciously deleting Marble Blast OSX, which is a game I
enjoyed for several days, and even edited some of the levels</p>

<p>Argh, no I'm not; I still like this game even though I haven't
played it for months; the idea that massive storage is right around
the corner makes me loathe to erase it.  gmail, to me, proves that we
shouldn't have to delete things; just index them well.</p>
