<p>My brother and I call it Airplane Day. But, there is a problem.  I
know it's old news and all that and maybe everyone knows already, but
I don't see that a 757 hit the Pentagon.</p>

<p>This picture is from Space Imaging's <a
href="http://spaceimaging.com/gallery/9-11/default.htm">Airplane Day
series</a>, and I must say, there is no hint of an airplane in the
wreckage.</p>

<p>I just scanned through Google's results of <a
href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22hit+the+pentagon%22+2001">"hit
the pentagon" 2001</a></p>

<p><a
href="http://physics911.ca/modules/news/">physics911.ca/modules/news</a>
is a good primer.  This is wack.</p>

<p>For the record, <a
href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/pentagon.htm">Snopes</a> says
otherwise, but, in this case, I don't believe them.</p>

<p>Simon (DJ Shamus O'Flannigan) from Gaba sent me <a
