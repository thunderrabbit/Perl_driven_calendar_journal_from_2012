<p>I wonder if this is the inner workings of a spam message gone
awry...  Is this from a newbie spam script kiddie whose variables
didn't get replaced before being sent?</p>

<p>I received it a couple days ago.  I googled <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=http%3A%2F%2F%25URL%2Fd%2F1.php">"http://%URL/d/1.php"</a>
and this template seems to have hit the internet as early as 23
January 2005.  Each template that I've seen has a random singe letter
character after the closing %ASSHOLE tag.</p>

<p>For the record, google found 3 matches on www (5 actually, but 2
were omitted) and 8 on groups (usenet).  0 matches in images, news,
froogle, answers.</p>

<p>I didn't find any references to it on the wider internet (searched
theregister.co.uk, cert.org, slashdot.org, wired.com, theinquirer.net,
wikipedia.net and others) except in what appear to be spam traps. No
articles about it.  No human written comments about it except on
usenet.</p>

a short variant of what I'm writing now on one of the usenet groups.
The only thread written in English by humans who were curious (not
angry) about the message and not posting off-topic in something like
rec.fan.sf.vampire</p>

<p>I'm quite curious to know.. does this seeding the net with failed
spam represents one single botched campaign???</p>

<p>I wonder what the (unexecuted) code looks like.</p>

<p>My hilarious brother Fred said I should reply and ask.</p>

<p>Ah, cool.  I found an exact pattern matching spam.  It's one of the
lonely housewife spams I've been getting.</p>

I know it might seem a little desperate, but how would you like to keep me some company?
I am getting divorced from my Husband, and need a part time man in my life.

Write me back here: http://godatetonight.com/d/1.php

Sincerely Yours,

<p>Oh, but hmmmm... using ASSHOLE as the closing doesn't make
sense to me.</p>
