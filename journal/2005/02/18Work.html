<p>Today at work, Akiko was my last student.  In my gaba tracker I
described her as verry smiley.  I like having lessons with her.  Today
she said something I had never previously heard in Japan.  "I really
like Japanese."</p>

<p>Wow.  Simon and I were both impressed with this.  I
thought <em>wow; I wonder if her enthusiasm would help me be more
enthusiastic to learn???</em>.</p>

<p>Only one way to find out.</p>

<p>Kumiko was my second to last student.  I showed her how to do have
been and had been, and she was like, "wow!" all totally impressed and
saying that I explained it perfectly.  Yayayayayayayyyy  I'm really
happy to have been able to do that for her.</p>
