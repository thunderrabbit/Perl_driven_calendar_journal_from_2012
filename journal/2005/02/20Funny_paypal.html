Hello

I am the son of wealthy DR KLAUS KRINGLE SR of North Pole Toys Unlimited
Ltd.  We have in a 733T bank in the currency of Quintarks of the planet
Hakodate around the 4.982321432241324x10^402th star in the galaxy Uw a sum
of one hundred meellion jillion gabajagajillion Quintarks.

Our star is planning to go nova soon, so we need to get the money out,
pronto.  This sum of money might be a little difficult to write in the
currency of Quintarks, so we searched for a currency more easily exchanged
on your planet.

Please find our intergalactic ambassador Mustang Salliapadopalous, who will
soon make a intergalacti^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hcontinental trip to the far away
island of Nippon, where some reports say they have no electricity.
