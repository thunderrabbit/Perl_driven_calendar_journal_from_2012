<p>(It's 5:17am; I assume the torrent of email has stopped.  167MB =

<p>I cooked two things of roboyaki to add to the pile of food for
Richard's byebye party.  It was well received, and I felt really
happy.</p>

<p>Riki, Tanya, Hitoe, Matteo came (previous residents (Tanya was a
frequent guest, actually)) Aaron, me, Richard, Jackie, Ikumi, Jen,
Tetsuya, Hitomi, Katrina, Olivia (just moved in!), Shoko, Yuki, Dean,
Shoko were all downstairs at one point.  Very lively.</p>

<p>We played Draw-Hiragana-With-Your-Butt, and Hitoe was able to
identify my ¤Ê on the first time I drew it.</p>

<p>Aaron told me he'd bet me $1000 that Bush would be president
in <em>six</em> years; he says lawmakers are working to either suspend
the constitution during war or to say that since he wasn't elected the
first time, but just selected by the courts, he has only been elected
once so far.</p>

<p>What a fuckin' nightmare.</p>

<p>People were planning to go to karaoke, and I was planning not to,
cause I was done being with people and I didn't want to be trapped in
a smokey room.</p>

<p>Matteo flirted inappropriately with someone <! Ikumi > and his
girlfriend <! Hitoe > got really mad and didn't come to Karaoke.  I
wanted to be able to help, but the timing didn't work out.</p>

<p>Went to Karaoke with Richard, Tanya, Aaron, Matteo, and Yuki, and
it was pretty much great fun.  I performed Eminem's "Business" and
"Without Me," plus Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back," and Deee Light's
"Groove is in the Heart" and maybe others I can't remember.  People
said I did well, though it was hard for me to accept their
compliments as more than just drunken ramblings.</p>

<p>Matteo and Yuki left a bit early and didn't pay.</p>

<p>Tanya was super drunk on the way home.  She was tooootally trying
to go the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Got to talk to Hitoe some after arrival home.</p>
