<p>Surfing back through my journal, I found a critical flaw in my
indexing scheme.  Spent some hours figuring out what was happening
(filenames were being split by my REGEX where \d\d matched in the
middle of the filename) and fixing it.</p>

<p>At the same time, I added a (secure (obscure)) way for me to view
private journal entries, which I've not been able to do for over 2
years.</p>
