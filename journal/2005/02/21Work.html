<p>Work was fun.  Had two lovely lessons with Makiko, who is even more
beautiful now that she is pregnant.  I agree with Jay who described
her as stunning.</p>

<p>She has one last lesson at Gaba.  And she's chosen to have it with
me tomorrow.  I'm so honored.  :-)</p>

<p>Kimiko, who I rarely see, chose me for her Level Up Test.  She
failed it.  53%.  Afterward, the teachers in the breakroom were like,
"you failed her on the test?" as if it couldn't be done.  We're
always supposed to be uplifting and encouraging.</p>

<p>I was like, "she failed the test.  I'm not going to lie to her and
tell her she is learning English without studying."  That would be a
disservice to her.</p>

<p>Had a guy named Yu.  I resisted every and all puns that came to my
mind.</p>

<p>"I'm Rob."</p>

<p>"I'm Yu."</p>

<p>"(No, I'm me.) Nice to meet you, Yu."</p>

<p>"Nice to meet you, too."</p>

<p>"Nice to meet you, too, Yu."</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>"Okay, Yu, I thank Yu for a great lesson."</p>

<p>"Thank you, too."</p>

<p>"I just did."</p>

<p>"See you later."</p>

<p>"You'll see Yu sooner than I see Yu."</p>

<p>etc.</p>
