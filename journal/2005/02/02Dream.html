<p>Oh man my dream was terrible!</p>

<p class=dream>Walking with some new friends over a bridge; I was
walking near (not with) the girlfriend of another guy; she was a bit
ahead of me and she didn't notice steps were not where steps should be
and she fell (splat), into highway traffic (smoosh), to her certain
death.</p>

<p class=dream>Oh God I was mortified (*)!  I looked to my friends
for some assurance that they saw it; I hadn't pushed her; she just
fuckin' didn't look and she fell.</p>

<p class=dream>They agreed that I had not pushed her so then we were
trying to comfort the boyfriend of the couple.  My dad was there and I
said, "my dad is a good counselor," so the guy talked to my dad.</p>

<p>(*) no pun intended</p>
