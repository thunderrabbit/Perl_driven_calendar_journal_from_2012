<p>In the hostel now, but not yet allowed to go to our rooms.  It's
nice and warm inside.  Snow is blowing around in little balls, like
round styrofoam, but it's not styrofoam cause it melts into water.</p>

<p>The hostel is a four (at least) story modern building with at least
fifteen rooms per floor. (except the ground floor which is hangout
area.</p>

<p>Right now, it's basicaly vacant; only me an Hitomi, a woman
cleaning the place and the receptionist and her little radio (tuned to
an English station) are here.</p>
