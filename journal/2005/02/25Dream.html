<p class=dream>I was with Laura from Castle of Dreams and I had
climbed the large tree in the middle of the living room, to look for
Thunder Rabbit's old burrow.  I found it, but the tree had grown
around it.  I tried to uncover it and scads of rotten wood came
pouring from the tree into the living room.  Like 1000 cubic yards of
mess gushed forth.  My mom was not impressed, and I wasn't sure how I
could clean it up.</p>
