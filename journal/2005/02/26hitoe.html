<p>I talked to Hitoe a bit after Shoko's show at R in Kawasaki.  She
was like, "how are you able to write all about your life online?" and
"do you write everything??"</p>

<p>And I explained (1) that if I ever become famous, and people are
all like, "oh Rob you're so great; I could never be as cool as you," I
can point to my website and be like, "look; I'm a big fat dumbdumb
just like everyone else.  You can do whatever you want."  (2) if I
ever have kids, and they have kids, my grandkids can read my diary and
be like, "wow; grampa was a bad kid just like us!"</p>

<p>We all have problems and issues and stuff; here are some of mine.</p>

<p>But, there is a hidden 5% that I don't write.  All my sex addiction
stuff and fixation on sex and fixation on women and how recently I've
been thoroughly wonder/ponder/thinking of Hitomi vs Satoko vs Sally.
I could easily happily date Satoko, but I told her that I'm not in a
place where I can have a real relationship.  I could easily happily
date Sally, but we happen to live on opposite sides of the Atlantic.
I am currently with Hitomi, but I have told her that I definitely
won't marry her.</p>

<p>My entire life seems to focus on the search for the perfect woman,
a creature that exists only in my mind, and who will always trump
those who I meet.  I don't like that I have been this way with Hitomi,
but that doesn't seem to be stopping me.  I don't like spending hours
searching for just the image that will send me over the orgasmic edge,
but that doesn't seem to stop me.  I don't like the idea of being
drunk and out of control with alcohol.  And that has absolutely
stopped me from drinking too much.  I don't like the idea of tainting
my body with drugs.  That has stopped me from ever taking them.  But
sex... you are the perfect drug.  (Thanks, Trent.)</p>

<p>Thanks Hitoe for giving me the guts to begin writing my 5%.</p>
