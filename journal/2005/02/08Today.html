Sapporo now, chillin' and oh my gosh I'm occassionally getting
wireless access.</p>

/></a> Today we scoped a couple of ice sculptures, but generally found
them to be boring except for one which wasn't boring cause it was a
bit morbid with actual fish frozen in it.</p>

<p>We headed back to Nakajima Park, with plans to dig another tunnel.
Today we much more successful; we selected a good spot and both worked
together to extract the snow.  Quite fun, actually; I'm really glad we
did that instead of going to see more boring snow things.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Yukimatsuri_2005/new_hole2.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Yukimatsuri_2005/thumbs/new_hole2.jpg" /></a> <a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Yukimatsuri_2005/new_hole.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Yukimatsuri_2005/thumbs/new_hole.jpg" /></a> I started digging a hole next to a light post, and then realized I
could dig out the ice adjacent to the marble base of the light post
with ease.  We reached the ground next to the base and connected that
area with my original tunnel.  We made quite good progress and noted
that the ground was sloping up, matching the hill of snow underneath
which we were digging! (snowfall on hills makes hill shaped blankets
of snow)</p>

<p>We were approached by some people who offered us shovels (!) which
really helped our spirits as much as our digging, cause there wasn't
much room to manuever a shovel.</p>

<p>Some kids were sliding down a nearby snowblower-made hill and they
invited us over to play as well.  I was basically done with the hole;
it had filled (no anti pun intended) its purpose, and I was ready for
a break.</p>

<p>However, one of the kids wanted to help dig, so I stayed to watch
him in case the snow collapsed on him or some such thing.  He was
probably 9 years old and did a decent 9-year-old job of digging out
snow while keeping the basic tunnel shape intact.</p>

<p>He ran off and was replaced by a 6-year-old who couldn't quite </p>

<p>oops gotta hurry.</p>

<p>He couldn't dig snow out of the tunnel really at all so he saw the
much easier to reach snow: the top of the tunnel, and worked at
hacking the top of the tunnel into the bottom of a bigger hole.  I
didn't tell him to stop, but I did say it wasn't much of a tunnel
anymore, so he tried to dig out from the tunnel again, quickly
abandoned that as too hard and I left as he began tearing the tunnel
apart again.</p>

<p>I joined them on the hill and slid down a couple times, the first
time I slid super fast (low friction with all innertube and no butt)
and had to put my foot out to stop from hitting a hand rail on the
stairs near the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>The second time I was like "who needs a tube?" and slid head first
on my back, using my YRUU hoodie as a snow shield.  Awesome.  But I
crashed into a kid on an inner tube.  I didn't see her there when I
started; I'm not sure what happened there.</p>

<p>I was beckoned back to the hole by the first kid, so I went over
(not knowing where he was taking me) and stayed for a bit.  Missed any
further chances to slide down the hill, but overall had a great
time.</p>

<p>Time to continue the deconstruction of the tunnel so Hitomi buried
me and got pictures.</p>

<p>And then she walked away, leaving me to freeze.</p>
