<p>Somehow I've misplaced my keys effectively enough that I believe I
don't have them with me on my way to work.  I was going to take TJ
Bike, but if I can't lock him up, then he ain't going.</p>

<p>I walked to the station and used my GPS to determine my high-normal
walking speed is right around 4 miles per hour.</p>
