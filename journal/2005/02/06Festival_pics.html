<p>I'm finally putting together pics from the festival.</p>

<p>Most of what I've got were taken in Sapporo.  Most were all along
the street that has the TV tower on it.</p>

<p>First, all the big ones.  I don't know much/anything about these:
who designed them who made them who likes them who knows what?  I
don't know.  But they were pretty neat to see.</p>

/></a>This one was close to the TV tower, and close to where I met
Miss Hong Kong 2004.</p>

<p><a

align="left" /></a>Here the magic was kinda taken away: I can clearly
see the lines where layers of ice were put together.  Seems like there
could be a way to blend these more seemlessly.  Like allowing water to
freeze between the chunks.  Ah well.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Yukimatsuri_2005/slide.jpg"><img src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Yukimatsuri_2005/thumbs/slide.jpg" /></a> <a

/></a> A bunch of kids all in line waiting to slide down this hill
reminded me of sledding down hills with Fred back in the day.  I
couldn't imagine having to wait in line for such a short little hill
as this one was.  But still I guess it could be cool to little
kids.</p>

/></a> This one was my second favorite.  It had neat 3D curves and
shapes not present in the others.</p>

src="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Yukimatsuri_2005/thumbs/my_favorite.jpg"
align="left" /></a> This one was my favorite.  I liked how it wasn't a
stage.  It didn't have any way to generate money.  No indication of
who made it or who would profit.  Just art.  A beautiful rendition
that reminds me of the architecture around the Imperial Palace in
Tokyo.  Except a lot smaller.  And made of snow. </p>

<p>Now, all the medium sized ones.  These were made by teams
representing different countries.  They had a certain number of days
to work, starting with a rather large block of packed snow, and
finishing in time for a panel of judges to select a winner.</p>

<p>We didn't get to see m/any of them finished, but.</p>

<p>There were many others, but they didn't make the cut.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>And then there were the little random projects, not in competition.
I think these were all done by local groups.  But, some of them were
definitely cooler than others.</p>
