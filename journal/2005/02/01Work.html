<p>Today at work I've had three students so far, and now I'm on a big
three hour break, which I arranged for myself when I was feeling so
pooey that I couldn't <em>imagine</em> being better ever, much less
by Tuesday.</p>

<p>But, I'm pretty much 99% perfect now; I coulda done a full day
worth of lessons.</p>

<p>I chatted with one of my favorite students, Mari, who has only 1
more lesson left!  I'm thankful that she chose me for one of her last
two lessons.  I gave her my email address; she's going to Cambridge
for three months starting in about a week!</p>

<p>Then I had a student who doesn't study, so I was my usual
impatient-with-students-who-don't-study (sometimes hypocritically so)
self.</p>

<p>Next, I had Makiko, my current favorite student, whose pregnancy is
beginning to show.  She has only four lessons remaining, and wants to
choose me for at least a double lesson to get through Lesson 11 of her
book, which she has decided is tricky.  Lesson 11 is the one that uses
this grammar.  I just thought of a way I can teach it to her
easily.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'll remember the way I'm thinking or think of a
different way when the lesson time comes.</p>

<p>Right now I'm chillin on the staircase at Tokyu Store with Hitomi,
who met me for cheap dinner during my three hour break.  We bought
pitas from Katsu and wandered over to Yamada Denki to chow.  I ate
mine inside, but she didn't think it would be polite for her to do the
same, so we tried going to Sweets Forest to eat on one of their many
benches.  But they were closed so we sat while she ate at one of the
tables outside in the cold.</p>

<p>We found these benches in Tokyu Store which woulda been perfect for
chowing (and are super close to Katsu's shop), but weren't remembered
when we first started looking for a place to eat.</p>
