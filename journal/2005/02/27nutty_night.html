<p>Met Hitomi last night and went to one of Tokyo's countless
countless love hotels.  It seemed she was not in a good mood, and I
surmised it was from something she read here, but she wasn't
talking.</p>

<p>It came out after we came.  She told me that she didn't appreciate
the way I've been treating her.  I go out with other women (no sex,
though) and Hitomi doesn't like it.  I've known she doesn't like it
and I've talked about it with Jen for hours on end (gotta do something
at work).</p>

<p>Hitomi pretty much let me have it and I just fell into an infinite
(countably infinite) pit of despair, like "I am a horrible person"
"why would you ever want to talk to me much less by close to me" slash
"don't touch me get away from me" "I just want to be alone."</p>

<p>I basically finished crying and was ready to watch the rest of the
tsunami documentary on NHK (public TV) and I put on my glasses and sat
back to watch.  I could see a bit of fog on the left lens of my
glasses and Hitomi saw me and laughed a bit.  I apparently wasn't
emotionally ready for that and was like, <em>why are you laughing at
me? I still feel like a horribly shitty person.</em> and I ripped off
my Japanese style bathrobe (literally ripped the two tie strips from
the fabric) and headed for the solitary sanctuary of the bathroom and
gooshed into the rather large bathtub in which water remained, just a
bit cooler than before.</p>

<p>I was just blubbering crying disgusting snotty tears gushing.  She
slammed the bathroom door shut and I was almost happy with the idea
she had left me alone in the hotel, so I could just cry and take care
of myself. (that's all I want, really) but a few minutes later, she
came in though I was still crying and still wanted to be alone.</p>

<p>We had a miscommunication (she was explaining why she had laughed
[I laughed because] and I was still crying and she thought I was
saying something and had interrupted her and she said, [what?] and I
said, [nothing] which I think she thought I was implying the
end of her sentence ("I laughed because" "nothing (who cares why you
laughed?)") but I just meant, "I was not interrupting you, please
continue (even though I want to be alone; can't you see???? why do you
think I came in here to cry?)") which is not surprising since we can
hardly talk about real stuff when I'm <em>not</em> gasping through
tears and she left again, leaving me contendedly gasping for breath
and just having a good cry.</p>

<p>Then soon came back in and got into the tub with me.</p>

<p>(This is not my idea of being alone.  Just my opinion,
but:) <em>Jeezus what are you fucking doing?  I already told you I
don't want you to touch me and that includes not wanting you nakedly
lying on top of me in the bathtub!</em></p>

<p>I had been happy in the water just as it was, just a bit cool and
slowly filling with my snot and tears.  She turned on the hot water to
warm up the tub <em>I was happy with the water the way it was!</em>
and opened the drain to let my cool water whoosh out, subsequently
reducing her bouyancy and crunching more heavily nakedly on me and I
was like, <em>get the fuck off of me</em> and gently rearranged us so
she was sitting on that side of the tub but then my legs fell over
toward the (super) hot water and she was like, "be careful!" <em>leave
me the fuck alone! if I want to scald my leg, I can do it; let me
indulge in a bit of self destructive behavior, aight?</em>

<p>She turned on the jaccuzi to whoosh the water around to
redistribute its heat and that just put me over the edge, but not into
anger/pain/sadness, but into peace.  Through my infinite tears, I
somehow remembered that there is more to this situation.  <em>I am an
infinite soul having a human experience</em> and I just felt the water
become cooler on my right and warmer on my left, and noticed Hitomi
was only doing what she thought best, and allowed myself to cry.
Crying crying crying and then without warning, I just inhaled for the
next expulsion, and just stopped.  Like the crying switch had been
turned off.</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised.  I just sat there in the moment and felt the
moment and everything seemed fine.  Usually I stop crying consciously
(in my men's group, or whereever else) but this time I was
specifically in the tub and specifically had all night; this was my
space and I wasn't going to let any bathtub visitors stop me.  but it
just stopped.</p>

<p>I lay my head to one side relaxing in the tub and went through a
little series of forgivings.</p>

<p><em>I forgive myself for judging myself bad.</em></p>

<p><em>I forgive myself for judging myself... bad.</em> (I couldn't seem to think
of more interesting words.)</p>

<p><em>I forgive myself for judging myself ..  .. bad.</em></p>

<p><em>I forgive myself for judging myself hurtful.</em></p>

<p>Hitomi asked if we could talk and I was like "not yet."</p>

<p><em>I forgive myself for judging myself unable to talk.</em></p>

<p>And so it went for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Then I was like, "テレビの後話せます。" meaning "after we watch
[the tsunami show on] TV we can talk."

<p>Got out of the tub and piled onto the bed.  Saw a few tsunami clips
I hadn't seen before and some before / during pictures to show how
deep the water was.</p>

<p>We talked after watching the rest of the tsunami documentary.</p>

<p>I'm leaving out the part about how we made up and both agreed we were
fools for doing this to each other.</p>

<p>She said amidst tears, [when you leave in May, I'm going to miss you.]</p>

<p>[I'm going to miss you too.]  more tears.</p>

<p><em>oh man what a weird choice I have chosen.</em></p>

<p>I told her that I'm making a muffler for her.</p>

<p>"Thats's the secret?"</p>

<p>[yes.]

<p>[sometimes I hate you.  sometimes I love you.]</p>

<p>"I know"</p>

<p>"and I'm going to work on the muffler in the morning. and hopefully
finish it for when I see you Monday night."</p>

<p>We talked about how I am mean to her because I see her all the time
and I want some space on occassion.  She seemed to think it is for a
different reason that I'm not aware of and she could be right, but I
don't see it.</p>

<p>words words words</p>

<p>In the morning I planned to get up when she left for work; I like
having my space/peace in the morning; I think I grew to like this
while living with Tammy and then with Wende; they would get up early
for work and I'd have the place to myself..  but Hitomi didn't leave.
I grew to hate her <em>just leave me the fuck alone; I don't want you
to wait for me or wait on me or anything; I just want you to take care
of yourself and I'll find my own clothes and it will be great.</em></p>

<p>We headed down to the station and I headed toward the Tokyu line
cause I my phone told me that was the way to go to Yoyogi so Hitomi
went in but I had to buy a ticket (arg) and then I went to see which
line in fact was for Shinagawa.  It wasn't this one, so I went to the
other and it wasn't that one.  So I went back to the first and it
still wasn't that one. Oh my fucking god where is Shingawa?  I thought
I read that when I asked my phone which way to get to Yoyogi, but I
had misread the kanji and or soomething and there was no Shinagawa on
the Tokyu lines from that station (Kamata) though Hitomi was already
in the gates and a woman came up to me while Hitomi was coming up to
me from the other side of the gates and the woman spoke relatively
great English and I answered in Japanese [I'm trying to go to
Shinagawa] and she was like, "oh you need to come over here to a JR
line" and I'm thinking, <em>but I've got a little neko on the other
side of this gate.</em> and I just left Hitomi and let her fend for
herself cause I couldn't be bothered (British and Australian
expressions are creeping into my lexicon) and the woman was really
nice and showed me where we were on the other map and how to get to
Shinagawa and I was just so ARG (cause now I had a 110 yen ticket that
I didn't need (thank goodness I hadn't bought a more expensive one,
but maybe I would have noticed before buying a ticket that there was
no Shinagawa)) that I couldn't even thank her before she vanished and
I was talking to Hitomi about who cares about the fucking 110 yen
ticket I bought; it's just 110 yen and I don't give (much of) a shit
about that I just want to have been in Yoyogi by now (actually within
10 mintues of that time) and the woman vanished (thank you for your
help) and Hitomi came with me on the other train line though I still
wanted to be alone and I'm like <em>jeez I've got to explain this</em>
and was like [where do you need to go?] and she expalained
(effectively) that she could use either line and she knew that if I
used the Tokyu line I could use Gotanda and if my phone had said that
was the right way then so be it, and if I used the other line that was
cool too.</p>

<p>and I'm like "Gotanda!"  <em>I shoulda known... Maybe that was the station I
had been looking for (not Shinagaa) and Gotanda is a stop or two closer
than Shingawa to Yoyogi.</em>

<p>But her logic made sense and I still don't know what my phone had
said, but was like, "an example of you being a strong woman is you
going to work when you need to go."</p>

<p>Damn myself for being so Japanesely-non-direct, so I told her that
I liked having my time alone when I lived with Wende and Hitomi
understood and agreed she had been foolish, and in fact, that she
hadn't gone to work on time is what she had been referring to earlier
when she said she was a bad girl this morning.</p>

<p>ah; yes that makes sense.  I might have thought of that.</p>

<p>I got off alone at Shinagawa, got a seat on Yamanote line to Yoyogi.</p>

<p>Arrived at Saori at 10:25.  which is argueably 10 am, as I had told
them I would be there at 10 (it's coser to 10 than 11).</p>

<p>Walked in and the woman was like, [hi.]</p>

<p>[Hi.]</p>

<p>[Uh, wasn't it supposed to be Tuesday?]</p>

<p>Blink. [Why yes. I'm sorry; it was Tuesday.]</p>

<p>[Is Tuesday okay?]</p>

<p>[Yes; no problem.  Sorry!]</p>

<p>I was supposed to come tomorrow at 10.  Not today.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>
