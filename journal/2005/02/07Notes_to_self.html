<p>I plan to expand this to a full blown couple of entries, but in
case I don't, I'll at least have something.</p>

<p>We came back to Sapporo and walked around the 11 blocks featuring
snow things.  I got a photo with Miss Hong Kong 2004.  Sweet.  She
was whisked away before I could get into any more trouble.</p>

<p>As we were nearly back to our hotel, I saw a sign indicating an
observatory 450 meters away.  Kick ass.  Thinking I could pick
something up for Miss Jackie Purdy, we headed that direction.  But
couldn't find anything like an observatory.</p>

set of bicycles that had been parked before it started. </p>

<p>I discovered I had the opportunity to try and fulfill one of my
lifelong projects: dig a tunnel through the snow.</p>

<p>Things I figured out before starting:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't stand (and therefore pack down) the snow where you want
to dig.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Things I figured out after starting:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Waterproof gloves, jacket, pants, boots are good for this type
of venture.</p></li>

<li><p>Start digging away from the beaten path so people won't fall
 into the hole (*)</p></li>

<li><p>Have warm food available for chowing; this is not easy
work.</p></li>

<li><p>Once</p></li>

</ol>

<p>(*) no one slipped into the hole, but I didn't feel comfortable
leaving the tunnel until morning; I smushed it into a not so deep
hole before leaving.</p>

<p>Never finished this entry, but here are pictures from digging my first hole.</p>
