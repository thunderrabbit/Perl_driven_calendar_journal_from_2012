<p>Interesting to see how my knowledge of perl has increased over the
time that I've used it.  Not that I'm a ghod by any measure, but, I
found some code that I had written as</p>

<pre>
foreach $n (0..$#array) {
  &do_something_with($array[$n]);
}
</pre>

<p>Instead of</p>

<pre>
foreach $line (@array) {
  &do_something_with($line);
}
</pre>

<p>Further, I was able to retool my old code to do in one page what I
had been doing with frames.  I even used CGI:: stuff to draw the
forms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all this time was spent in the pursuit of online
porn.</p>
