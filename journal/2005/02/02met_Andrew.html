<p>Tonight Richard and I went to Shibuya and met Hitomi at The Pink
Cow and got to see Alistair, the cat who is riding around the world on
his bike.  I got to meet him and got some good bits of advice: (1)
though he had to scrap his plans, he had gain a lot of wisdom about
how to do visas and stuff during all his planning.  That knowledge was
useful for him. (2) just do it.</p>

<p>On a more approachable level, I met Andrew, a guy who bicycles a
lot around Japan.  He is part of <a
href="http://www.beejapan.com">beejapan.com</a>, an organization that
encourages renewable living instead of throwing away as many plastics
bags as humanly possible in a day.  They will ride from the northern
to southern tip of Honshu from August to October.  If I'm still here,
I might like to join them.</p>

<p>But he gave me the confirmation of what I had suspected: I can just
get on TJ Bike and go.  He said I need a bike bag to bring TJ Bike on
trains, but he can suggest several cool places to go by train and
then ride ride ride.</p>

<p>He's about to leave Japan, so he said he can sell me a lot of his
old stuff cheaply.  Awe.some.</p>
