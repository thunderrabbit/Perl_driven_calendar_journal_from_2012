<p>I've basically farted around on my computer all day, emailing with
Dude and Fred.  We made up a new google game, and this one is better
than variants of "return exactly one match" games because posting the
entries won't skew the results.</p>

<p>It's the Google Calculator Game!</p>

<p>Using google's calculator function, enter only operations on
bizzare units (no numeric constants), and try to end up as close to 1
as possible. </p>

<p>Generally, good entries use four units.  Using three is acceptable,
but not as cool.  Using five or more is awesome.</p>

<p>Hmmm, how can we score these simply, giving bonus points for more
units?</p>

<p>Scoring is kinda flocked up cause in one case we are trying to zero
in on 1, and in another case, we're punishing (moving away from 1 ?)
for not using enough units. But then it becomes tricky describing
which way to punish, depending on the sign of the result.</p>

<p>I'm not online right now, or I'd look up the examples that we
thought of today.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Once we decide on a scoring method, I think I can write a
script that accepts and scores the results!</p>
