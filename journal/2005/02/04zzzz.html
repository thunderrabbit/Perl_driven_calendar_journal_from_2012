<p>I've been doing computer stuff; tweaking the format of long
forgotten journal entries and sending out 7 gmail invites (Jimmy
accepted already!) cause they just boosted me to 50 invitations and
reading old school private journal entries.  My patterns change slowly
over the years.</p>

<p>In a few hours it's wakeup and go to Hokkaido time!</p>
