<h1>Steit of Mai Laife A Dress</h1>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>I live in Millenium House in Motosumiyoshi, but I'm planning
to possibly move soon.</p></li>

<li><p>However, my plan has shifted to maybe riding my bike around
Japan a lot, using Motosumiyoshi as a base at first, and then breaking
free of the apartment and then breaking free of Japan altogether when
Maggie gets married in the fall and going to see her wedding.</p></li>

<li><p>Two nights ago I met a man who is 3/4ths of the way around the
world (on his bicycle).  I also met Andrew, but I haven't met him
since that night.  We plan to hang out soon and he may sell me some
travel-by-bike gear that I'll need, as he is leaving Japan soon(er
than me).</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is my Mac 667 MHz PowerBook G4 with 1 MB L3 cache,
512MB RAM, 30GB HD with 708MB free.  OS X 10.3.7</p></li>

<li><p>I have some knotboards that I want to sell on Yahoo Auction,
but I haven't been able to get past a certain point in the
registration process.</p>

<p>I also have some drawers that are unused and good for sellin'.
Same problem.</p></li>

<li><p>I don't have any pets.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitomi and I plan to go to Hokkaido for 4 days and 3 nights,
starting tomorrow..</p></li>

<li><p>I still work at Gaba every Monday, Tuesday and Friday.  My plan
is to keep that up until March 15th.  I will talk to my manager about
extending that; I'll need to sign a new contract, but I'll tell him
that I might not be there all the time.</p></li>

<li><p>That way I could get a visa extension for ayear and be legally
able to roam around Japan for a while longer.</p></li>

<li><p>I have TJ Bike and MimiBike, but I haven't put the stickers
that Tomoko made for me on TJ Bike.  TJ Bike lives in my room these
days.</p></li>

<li><p>My room is a mess but is getting better.</p></li>

<li><p>I still work at OM on the weekends.  Do very few quintarks
now; mostly just data entry.</p>

<p>I was sick last week, but OM paid me anyway.  And he'll pay me for
when I'm gone to Hokkaido.  Nice.</p></li>

<li><p>I had tonsillitis last week.  Oh my god that was
painful.</p></li>

<li><p>I ordered a GPS a long time ago and had it sent to my dad's
house (cause they wouldn't send it to an address that didn't match my
credit card) but he hasn't forwarded it to me.  Or at least I haven't
gotten it yet, and he hasn't responded to my email asking wtf it
is.</p>

<p>I just called him and left a message to see if he's received it and
if he's sent it.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm not sure if I will take my computer with me everywhere
around Japan, but that is why I should practice for a while first.
Get used to wazzap and make it happen.</p></li>

<li><p>I use thunderrabbit@gmail.com to store my email (54 megs (5%)
so far) and rob@robnugen.com as my primary email address.</p></li>

<li><p>I've recently gotten an email from Wende, who I hadn't heard
from in a while.  I was glad to get reconnected.  She's less addicted
to email than I, so she doesn't write as often as I do.  It's still
nice to have the connection again.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been in pretty consistent contact with Fred and Dude via
gmail.</p></li>

<li><p>Haven't felt any decent earthquakes in Tokyo in a
while.</p></li>

<li><p>I've all but given up the idea of volunteering in Tsunami area;
I may just go there for a vacation to help their economy that
way.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to get my Pboat appplication done and sent in.  It's
due in early March.</p></li>
