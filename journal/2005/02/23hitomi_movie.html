<p>Met Hitomi to see Phantom of the Opera, which I didn't really care
about seeing until I saw the Making Of and was intrigued by the
behind the scenes story.</p>

<p>We just saw Kaori outside Cinecitta; she is going to see the movie
as well but at a different screening.</p>

<p>Tonight Hitomi and I are tickling each other as punishment for any
spoken English.</p>


<p>I haven't seen Kaori in quite some days; maybe I'll email her
soon.</p>

<p>Oh, we also bought (or ordered) a waterproof compressable jacket
that matches the pants Hitomi bought me before we went to
Hokkaido.</p>
