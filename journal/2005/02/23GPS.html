<p>Today while waiting to meet Michael at Harajuku, I set up my first
waypoint right on the tile mosaic bridge over the Yamanote line.  I
understand that in nice weather on weekends a lot of people dressed
in various コスプレ costumes gather.  I'd like to see that sometime.</p>

<p>I marked the waypoint and then used my GPS to navigate back to
that point.  Pretty amazing.</p>
