<p>We're on the free bus to Sapporo, which left *at ten AM* which is
why we had to be so speedy this morning.  On the bus beside us are a
couple who were being very patient as their kids behind them  babbled
Japanese kids stuffdd andd were 

They were getting a bit annoying and more rambunctious until they
started to climb over the seat to  irritate the mom even moree and
then the ligttle one lost his grip and slipboom onto the bus walkway.</p>

<p>I saw it as it was happening and I had to chuckle a bit.  I guess
it was a bit like a mean old man chuckle "that will shut them kids
up" but it doeesn't feel that way so much as look at how gently and
safely you feel to learn this lesson 
to learn this life lesson:  "Hold on when you climb."</p>

<p>The seats are all padded and the floor is rubberized slip mat not
concrete the fall was hands first, no blood, but a little head bump
probably.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But, get this: as I was writing, the mom put the kid in the seat
where the momhad been, and I see the kid is a girl, not a boy.</p>

<p>How very sexist of me to feel a bit more compassion for her
falling, but that's what happened.  At this stage, I can only say I
noticed the difference, but I don't see the root of it.</p>
