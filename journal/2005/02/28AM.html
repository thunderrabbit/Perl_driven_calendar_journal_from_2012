<p>Though I left Mimibike next to Motosumiyoshi station, she was still
there when I came back this morning.  This confirms that Monday is
okay to leave bikes there in the morning.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I did a kickout and bent the back wheel.  Crap.  I
was able to bend it back into a workable shape, but not enough that it
doesn't rub the brakes once per rotation.  Had Mimibike been taken
this morning, I would have claimed the wheel had been fine when I
parked her and demanded to know wtf happened.  I imagined (they might
fix it, and) it would be like a sweet revenge for them repeatedly
removing my bike from illegal parking areas (the jerks).  But, but,
but, I was happier to find Mimibike waiting there than having to go
through with tracking her down (Jen says the bike jail has moved) and
paying 2500 yen and maybe lying about the wheel.</p>
