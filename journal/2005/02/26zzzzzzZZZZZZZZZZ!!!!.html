<p class=date>3:04am JST Sunday 27 February 2005</p>

<p>Hitomi texted me after midnight and I didn't see it.  Best I can
understand, she wanted to know what time I could meet her tomorrow
after I had already told her 7pm.</p>

<p>Then, at 2 fucking 45 in the fucking morning she texted me AGAIN,
cancelling our date for tomorrow, I believe because I hadn't answered
her.</p>

<p>My last text message (8:30pm ish) I tried to say, "I don't know;
let's talk about it tomorrow."</p>

<p>This is so stupid; I just want to sleep now.  nevermind.</p>
