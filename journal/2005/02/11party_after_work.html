<p>Billy and Kellie were instrumental in getting people a bit hyped
up in the Valentine's Day party after work.  I'm just so loathe to be
the first to speak, but if I'm asked to do something in front of the
group, it's no problem.  Weird.</p>

<p>Met Joaquin (he says, "Joaquin, like walking," and I go, "except
it's spelled a lot differently.") who raps and records rappers in his
own studio or some shit like that.  Wow.  Traded digits with him and
maybe maybe we'll hook something up, but I fear I'm out of my league.
"I just copy other guys raps; I don't write my own."  But that's not
actually true; I'm just nervous to think about doing it in a
studio.</p>

<p>Billy acted a lot silly and turns out he used to be a stand up
comic ("no, a sit down comic," he says) but he doesn't like performing
in the stinky smokey bars of Tokyo.</p>

<p>We played a stuffing marshmallows in mouth game and Seth won (as I
predicted) and I got second place, which is surprising to me
considering I wasn't playing at the start of the game.  Michael ate
his marshmallows immediately so I replaced him.</p>

<p>Joaquin was doing quite well but then lost it at the very end.</p>

<p>They had a trivia game to give away an iPod, which is pretty cool.
We English teachers weren't allowed to play.  I would have won because
I recognized that neither of the two options given for the first
question were the correct answer.</p>
