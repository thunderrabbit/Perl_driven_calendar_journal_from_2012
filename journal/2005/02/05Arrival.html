<p>We're on a train now.  This train has a more advanced heating
system than what's in Tokyo.  Maybe.  The temperature differential
was quite noticable when I got on the train.</p>

<p>Everything is smothered in snow, well, covered in snow, and it's
snowing. even more.</p>

<p>We barely made this train, so we had to sit in separated seats.</p>

<p>Hey the train beside us arrived after us and is leaving just
before us.  I wonder if we are on a local, but that train arrived
just seconds after us, so it's different than in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Snow snow snow snow!</p>

<p>Train stations we've stopped at (inconsequential) Minami Chitose,
Chitose, Inowa(?)</p>

<p>I'm mesmerized by the snow;  which is blowing around as if it owns
the place.</p>

<p>I wonder how the train tracks are kept clean.  Each train with a
snow plow on front?  Only the rails are visible.</p>

<p>Just before Eniwa there was construction for a highway over the
traicls. between   between Eniwa and, get this Sapporo-beer-teen
station. We didn't stop at that station.</p>

<p>Life still seems to go on despite this snow which would definitely
shut down Houston like oh my god.  Trains and cars are running.
trucks.  this train is full of people.  parking lots are full of
un-snow-stopped cars.</p>

<p>It's only -1 degree according to Hitomi, which matches my
observation that snow is beginning to slough off some rooves
some of the steeper rooves.  I occassionally see this.</p>

<p>There is a lot of space here in the outskirts of Sapporo. Large
expanses of snowy fields with leafless trees waiting for spring to
make their next move.</p>

<p>Cool; we are about to arrive in Kita Hiroshima (North
Hiroshima).</p>
