<p class=dream>Living in a new house with a bunch of new people who
were basically all younger than me, but still considered adults.
There was a completely beautiful girl there who I had met the
previous Wednesday.  At that time she had said she wanted to learn
all the lines of her play by the next Thursday, or even the next
Wednesday, if possible.</p>

<p class=dream>Now it was the next Wednesday and we were talking about
whatever, and she mentioned her play and I quoted her on having said
what she said the previous Wednesday.  She was all, "wow; you
remember!" and her boyfriend was all, "that's cause you're beautiful;
people will do anything to make you happy."</p>

<p class=dream>I concurred.  Then he was all bragging, "well I got to
kiss her nandake," and I'm like "from that point of view, you can't
see her, so it doesn't matter, plus I'm not sure it's polite for you
reveal the details of her private life."</p>

<p class=dream>They went to their bed and then another woman came in
looking for people with whom to watch a cartoon movie.  I was like,
"cool" but then thought "oh man; I haven't written a journal entry
about what just happened [I'll have to remember all the details]"</p>

<p class=dream>We seemed to be the only ones interested, and I
realized I was only interested because she was attractive.</p>

<p class=dream>Oh, Rob.  and I woke up.</p>
