limited number of exhibits, but it wasn't too crowded, so we had a
generally decent experience.  Into the main castle where we were
greeted with a large vertical aquarium with several varieties of fish
milling around.</p>

<p>Riding two escalators to the third level, we overlook two large
tanks with ray looking things in one and shark looking things in the
other.  Third floor features tanks with starfish, rays, those round
crabs that look prehistoric and some others, all of which we were
allowed to touch.</p>

<p>(( In the Houston zoo, there is an exhibit where we can touch the
starfish.  Before introducing our hand and stinky human oils in the
water, we are asked by the docent carefully monitoring the animals to
wash (rinse) our hands.  I never really thought a quick rinse would do
much good, but perhaps it does a lot, and probably it is better than
nothing. ))</p>

<p>There is a sink available for us to wash our hands, after we touch
the animals.  My sensibilities were offended by this seeming
backwardness.</p>

<p>Only one animal looked suprising to me: flat underwater frogs.
They truly looked like squashed flat toads (no protruding guts),
except they were living underwater.  Not that they were moving, but I
guess they were alive.  I forgot to get a picture of them, though.</p>

<p>We scoped the dolphin show and I thought a lot of Erika in
Connecticut; I wonder if she leads shows; I think she'd be great at
it: tall, genki, and beautiful.</p>

<p>Zipped through the reptile house and I photographed some of the
turtles.</p>

more entertaining than the dolphins.  The dolphins are stronger and
can jump way higher, but the sea lions are way way more
dexterious.</p>

/></a> The sea lions played basketball and volleyball, walked on their
front flippers, did flips and did awesome spins while balancing a ball
on their noses.</p>

/></a> One of the funniest thing was after they walked across stage on
their front flippers.  The girl had them balance up on their flippers
and then follow her as she walked backwards to the other side of the
stage.  She was obviously watching them during their performance.  We
all clapped wildly cause <em>oh my god their flippers must
be <b>strong</b></em>.  They rested for a moment as we clapped and
then she was talking to the seals, [oh, they liked it!  Let's show
them again.]  The seals nodded in agreement.  So she was like, [okay,
UP!] and they balanced on their flippers again.  She turned around and
led them to the other side of the stage.  As she turned around, they
immediately dropped onto their bodies (no flipper balancing) and slid
behind her.</p>

<p>She turned around and discovered they hadn't walked, and they all
dramatically folded their necks over sideways and hid their faces
behind their flippers.  So funny!!</p>

<p>I'm really happy that I got some of their coolest tricks on video.</p>
