<p>At Shibuya station, we saw this incredibly talented musician who
could play digeridoo or flute with circular breathing.  He played
digeridoo and drums at the same time.  He played a bamboo jews harp.
He throat sang Silent Night.  He played finger piano and digeridoo at
the same time.  I got a video of him playing drums and dij.</p>
