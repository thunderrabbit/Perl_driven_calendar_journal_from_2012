<p>Joined Michael and Misato and Yumi for lunch at a restaurant owned
by a guy who lives in Michael's building.  The food was okay, but not
great, but definitely better than any restaurant I have ever
owned.</p>

<p>Afterward we went to an art studio to scope Kevin Olivet's art.  I
know which Kevin it is now.  He used a technique of scibbling to
create images of people as God sees them; all connected but separate.
Pretty cool; I hope he makes made cash with them.</p>

<p>In another room a woman was sitting amongst a lot of hand woven
fabric jackets and skirts and stuff.  She was like, "konnichiwa" and I
said HI and looked around a bit.  I scoped the loom and she asked me
if I wanted to try it.</p>

<p>Blink.</p>

<p>Yeah!</p>

do more than just a single row, so she showed me how to insert the
little bit of light blue thread that someone had started.  Then she
showed me I could basically insert any random thread for an accent.</p>

<p>In not too much time it seemed, I had finished the first shuttle of
color. and she offered to let me choose the next color, and taught me
that they could be blended, and I began to see even more
possibilities.  Chose three colors and she showed me how to load them
onto the shuttle and gave me some more random ideas with a pile of
scraps of string on the side.</p>

<p>I got into a rhythm of sorts and soon enough I got an idea for a
litle pattern of sorts that I could make with the skillset I had so
far.  Not much, but it was something.  Diagonal lines and then turning
the turquoize blue into the main string instead of the accent
string.</p>

<p>I felt pretty content while weaving/looming/creating whatever it
was I was doing.  I finished probably 10 inches worth in what seemed
like 10 minutes, but whas probably more like 30.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>Here's me and Misato and then the results of my shuttling.  Mine
starts about where the inner edge of the left hand loom leg is hidden
behind the fabric.</p>
