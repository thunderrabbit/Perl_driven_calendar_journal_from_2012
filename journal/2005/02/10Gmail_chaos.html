<p>I'd like to have known how to do this (it's so simple!) back when
I first got my gmail account, but I'm doing it now because there
won't be any time in the future where it's easier to do.</p>

<p>I'm forwarding all my thousands of messages that I had on my
computer to gmail.</p>

<p>Most of the thousands are from janette.</p>

<p>All of the thousands are going into my gmail inbox, and they are
all timestamped as received today.  Everyone I've found online agrees
there's no way around this.</p>

<p>As of the last check (around 15 minutes ago), I had 139MB used in
gmail.  Before the big dump, I had been using 56MB.</p>
