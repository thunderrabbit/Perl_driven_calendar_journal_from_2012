<p>We're headed to Noboribetsu now.  Things seem to be emotionally
stable; we're having fun, even.</p>

<p>We're on a diesel powered train, my first such experience in
Japan; I wonder  why this train is that.  Maybe electric trains
aren't able to go to Hakodate.  Maybe it's cause of the cold.  But
there are electric trains running today.  Right now we are on tracks
with an overhead electric power supply.</p>

<p>We're on a super express train, and have only stopped once so far
(shin Sapporo)</p>

<p>We're headed to Noboribetsu and will be stopping at Minami Chitose
next, the station at the airport.</p>

<p>Holy cats.  I just saw a weird tube looking thing that went out of
a building, up and curved back in, much like a roller coaster arc
might look.  The building is called Nagasakiya, and the station is
Tomakomai.</p>
