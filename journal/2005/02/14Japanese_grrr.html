<p>My Japanese may not be great...</p>

<p>but I think I can fucking dictate numbers in Japanese.</p>

<p>Cat was like "more slowly please."  Fuckin hell man, can you speak
Japanese or not?</p>

<p>PLUS, why the hell do I go back to my room after being downstairs
watching a movie and find a delivery notice on my door?  What happened
to announcing the arrival of the package?  Fuckin fuck why am I so mad
about this?</p>

<p>I imagine the package is my GPS.  If it is, I'll be happy to know
that my dad is apparently still alive; I was getting worried.</p>

<p>Plus, he was like "tomorrow..." wanting to know when they could
bring it again, and I'm like "ni ji no mae" before 2.  My
pronunciation is not horrible.  Is there something wrong with my
grammar?  Please tell me why no Japanese can understand me.  This
country is a nightmare.</p>
