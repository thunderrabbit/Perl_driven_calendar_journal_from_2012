<p>Today is Makiko's last lesson, and I took some time to figure out
just what to do for her.</p>

<p>Wrote a little note in my best Japanese and wrote a coupon for a
free pita at Katsu's Kebab Farm, a little nook of a shop from which he
sells what we call giros in the US.  I stamped it with my hanko, took
it to his shop on the way to work (on TJ Bike) and he stamped it with
his hanko and signed it and I paid him 400 yen for her pita.</p>

<p>Went to the convenience store and bought little cookies which I
have laid out on a plate and got napkins and we're set.</p>

<p>The lesson party was nice.  She seemed really happily surprised to
receive cookies, etc.  Yay.</p>

<p>I wish her the best with her husband and new baby.</p>

<p>Mieko was my next student; I hadn't see her since before I
cancelled our last scheduled lesson due to having tonsilitis.  I
explained what that was and we talked about her dwindling supply of
lessons (7 remain) and her not knowing what she wants to do.
Marriage/job/school/dance ???</p>

<p>She invited me to crash at her parent's house in Yamanashi.  She
said there's a waterfall next door, a temple nearby and monkeys all
around.  Wow.  I'll definitely try and hook that up.</p>

<p>Next lesson was a new student named Shota.  He's pretty good and
could catch / correct most errors.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in a free lesson.</p>
