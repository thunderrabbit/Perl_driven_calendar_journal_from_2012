<p>Work was pretty good today.  OM kept calling from Australia to see
how things were going, but we handled it all and got all settled fully
an hour before we usually do.  Sweet.  I rocked out of there early; I
had gotten 4 units of data entry done.  (Usually I can get 2 or 3 done
per day, but these were smallish.)</p>

<p>Jen talked a lot about Dan being back in town.  He and Tetsuya may
come visit us tomorrow.</p>
