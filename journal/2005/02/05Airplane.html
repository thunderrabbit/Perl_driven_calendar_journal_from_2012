<p>The plane is about to leave.  Due to snow in Sapporo, we might
have to land in Hakodate or come back.</p>

<p>The dude next to me reeks of cigarettes, but that's okay cause I
have fart stinkbombs lined up to counteract his stinkiness.  I don't
know what's got me so farty, but it's very convenient right about
now.</p>

<p>Also, we are on the second floor of this plane.  Cool.  Also, I'm
really tired.  Also, I forgot the other thing I was going to say.  I'm
really thankful for Hitomi putting this trip together.</p>

<p>Arrival. From the second floor of the airplane it's really a
different view.  I look out and think we're not moving that fast (for
a taxiing jet) and then look closer to down and see we're going pretty
fast (for a taxiing jet).  Wow.</p>

<p>Man, that stinky dude is wack.  He wanted to sit by the window,
slept throught he flight and then wanted to be out of the plane
first.  Stupid crap; if you want to be off the plane first, sit by
the aisle.  Get a brain, jack!</p>

<p>This is the plane we flew in on.</p>
