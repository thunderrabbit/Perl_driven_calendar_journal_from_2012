<p>Decently good day at OM today.  Went to the quintark windows three
times for a total of 4.2 quintarks given and 4.8 returned.</p>

<p>OM was wacky at times, but generally tolerable.  Jen was a bit
sick; she thinks she's getting the flu so I advised her not to get
tonsilitis while she was at it.</p>

<p>Watched a guy on FOX totally dis his interviewer, or not dis him
but call him out for not sticking to the plan, leaving the
interviewee in a lurch of sorts.</p>

<p>Data entered three days worth of quintark exchanges.  Bluh.</p>

<p>Even so, I'm thinking of working here longer (April) and riding TJ
Bike during the week.</p>
