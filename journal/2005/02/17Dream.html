<p class=dream>Flying like a jet really fast.  I was going mach 1 over
a city, and I was losing altitude so I bet the sonic boom was pretty
bad.  I tried to gain altitude by adding more power.  Mach 2, mach 3,
mach 4; the digits were turning on my little mach ometer.  I tried to
take a picture of it, but I couldn't control the plane and the camera
without crashing into the city.</p>

<p class=dream>I landed by some trees and talked to Fred and janette.
Told them what I was doing and they gave me some ideas on how I could
do it.  "Fly over the water, that will be safer."  Fair enough, so I
ran toward the water and jumped and began to fall, but I knew I should
be able to fly, so I put on the jet speed again and was like szhooomm
out over the water, this time with the city (and adjacent mountain
range) to my right.</p>

<p class=dream>I watched the machs tick up and then I realized I
didn't have my camera, so I used my cellphone camera, but couldn't get
a high quality picture that included a view of what I was seeing.  I
wondered about different ways to do this and then realized it was not
worth too much thought because I won't be able to bring the pictures
with me to show anybody when I wake up.</p>
