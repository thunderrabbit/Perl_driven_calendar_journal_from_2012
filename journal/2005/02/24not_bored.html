<p>I have to give big props to Hitomi for helping me get my knotboards
listed on Yahoo!AuctionsJapan, but limited to low props to Yahoo! for
making it pretty fucking difficult to do.  It took her a full hour to
understand all that they were requested us to enter, and at the end of
that time, we got timed out due to lack of activity.  BUT(!) upon
opening a new window and cut-n-pasting the same text over, I didn't
have to enter my password again.  Poor programming on their end.</p>

<p>But we got them listed and it's all good.  Especially if someone
wants to buy them.</p>
