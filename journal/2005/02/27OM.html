<p>Oh man.</p>

<p>Jen and I have done everything perfectly yesterday and today.  And
childishly hedonistic OM had the impression that it would benefit
somebody (him) to accuse us of not having done a good job because we
couldn't see a number that paid professionals couldn't see.</p>

<p>Yes, I know I have not given any details of this job, but suffice
to say he is not on my Christmas list.  I would quit now but that
would leave my friend Jen in a quandry to find someone else and I want
the money, but .... man, OM.  I hope you're enjoying your
vacation.</p>
