<p>Several weeks ago, I grabbed a promotional flyer for an optiscope
(maybe there is a different name for it) that allows people to see
around corners using the magic of fiber optics.</p>

<p>The promotional image cracked me up, and I decided it would be
good for a caption contest.</p>

<p>I put it up on the whiteboard in our entry, and wrote "かわいい"
(so cute!) below it.  Someone added "かわくない" (not cute) and
someone else "I can see my brain!" and someone else, "before now I
didn't know I had one."</p>

<p>No more entries went up, and the contest had grown stale, when Riki
came by and wrote a message to everyone on the other side of the board
(and did not write an entry for the caption contest).</p>

<p>I erased the caption contest entries and reframed it:</p>
