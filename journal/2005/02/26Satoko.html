<p>I was certain that Satoko had asked me if we could hang out
tonight, the 26th.  I replied back affirmatively but didn't hear from
her during the day today.  I called her and she was like, "today?"
and says she never sent such an email.  I'll look again; I wonder
if/who I'm supposed to meet..</p>
