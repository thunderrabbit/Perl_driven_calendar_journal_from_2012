<p>Wow.  This is Japanese style.  Bellhops are women in kimonos.
Their job title is "nakai" = なかい = 仲居. They bow for all incoming
visitors and grab our bags and ask our name and run to the desk to
announce our arrival so the desk clerk knows who we are.</p>

<p>Our nakai made tea for us in our room as we arrived (water in the
thing was already hot) and brought me large size robe and indoor
shoes.  They asked what time we want dinner served in our room.
Wow.</p>

<p>The room is floored in tatami, so I can easily see just how big it
is and how my small room compares.  My room is 6 tatami.  This room
has 10 tatami mats, plus a carpeted "living room" area (which is
actually just an extension of this room but with different flooring),
and a large alcove thing for TV and a shelf.</p>

<p>Hitomi is down at the baths now.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that is hesitant to exit this room; I don't
know how to respond to any attention paid to me by kimono clad
bellhops.</p>

<p>A tip for couples at a ryokan (Japanese style hotel): don't try to
have sex before they put the futons out.  We've been interrupted by
nakai like every 30 minutes or so to fuss with dinner and clearing the
table and bringing more food and clearing the table and serving
dessert and clearing dessert and bringing new water since they started
serving dinner at 6:30.</p>
