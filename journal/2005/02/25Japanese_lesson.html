<p>Today's lesson was cool; I'm beginning to be more relaxed at my
lessons; just talking instead of having her direct things.  I'm still
not nearly able to be peraperapera, and I still guess that she can
predict most things I'm going to say after I utter the first few
words, and I sometimes imagine she's bored, but (!) I'm getting
better.</p>
