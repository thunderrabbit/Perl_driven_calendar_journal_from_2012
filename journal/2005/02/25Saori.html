<p>Went to Saori again today after my Japanese lesson; wasn't able to
finish Hitomi's scarf, but I was able to put a green square in the
middle of a brown field, and made some vaguely interesting
checkerboard patterns by slowly swapping single colors when using a
triple colored thread sets on each side.</p>

<p>I will go back on Monday and hopefully finish it; they said it was
okay just to leave the project incomplete; they would archive it for
me.   I'm not sure how that works, but I'm guessing they have a
system in place.</p>

<p>Made it to work on time; I was a bit worried.  I left Yoyogi after
2pm, went all the way back home, changed clothes, ate some and now I'm
in Jiyugaoka.  3:22pm.</p>
