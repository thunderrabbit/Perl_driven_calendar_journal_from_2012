<p>The morning hasn't brought genkiness to my life; I don't really
want to get out of bed, even to go pee.  There is a hint of a problem
with my left tonsil slash left ear, and I don't know if it's just due
to the dry weather or cold or what.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There was a tall western girl yesterday, with light complexion and
long curly auburn dyed redish locks, who spoke apparently awesome
Japanese.  She seemed really into the fun; chatting with everyone and
all that.  She spoke a few words of English to me, and her accent
sounded Australian at first, and then English.</p>

<p>I felt simultaneously envious of her Japanese speaking ability, as
I have this overall loathing of speaking Japanese myself.  I don't
know that I like the way the language forces everyone to be indirect
and indecisive.</p>

<p>The first thing that upset me yesterday was tied in to this.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask Hitomi "do you want to go outside?" but I don't
know the word for outside, so I used English: "outside に行きたい？"
and she didn't understand so I asked, "雪のばしょに行きたい？"</p>

<p>And she goes, "you don't want to go?"</p>

<p>(blink) <em>What? I never said that I don't want to go; I asked if
you want to go.</em></p>

<p>Because in speaking Japanese, people are indirect, Hitomi took my
"do you want to go to the snow area?" question as a possibility that
I *don't* want to go.</p>

<p>This is so completely opposite what I learned with the Mankind
Project, where we speak directly and truthfully and don't hold back
anything at the sake of our integrity.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go to the snow area?"</p>

<p>"Yes I do."</p>

<p>That's what I wanted. I'm just practicing Japanese language; I
don't want to *be* Japanese.</p>
