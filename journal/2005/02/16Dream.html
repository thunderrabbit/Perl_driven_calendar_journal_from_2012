<p class=dream>Large area for onsen 
cavernous multi story house wealthy Hannah church</p>

<p>I can't seem to remember that one.</p>

<p class=dream>Walking my friend to her class and she told me some
historical info that I hadn't heard before.  Hitler had come to Rice
University to speak and was driving across this field a before he was
assassinated later that night.  I was like, "Wow!  I had never heard
that.  It's nice to get some more context around historical
stories."</p>

<p class=dream>Actually walking her to a study session; we had to
travel through a semi-labyrinth of houses and gardens.  Up and down
stairs weaving through a high wall on one side and trees and houses
closely packed on the other.  I didn't meet who she was meeting for
the study thing; we were not super close friends, and this was her
first time to meet them, so we didn't want to give the (first)
impression that we were dating.</p>

<p class=dream>On the way back, I saw a large great dane nursing
(actually wholly biting, but it was in a loving mothering way) her
puppy.  I scratched her on the head and she seemed to enjoy that and
stood up for more.  I talked to her and she responded as if she could
understand me, and then it became apparent she could understand me,
and for some phrases, actually answer back in an understandable
manner.  I was like "Oh my god!  A talking dog!" and I wished I had my
tape recorder with me.  Then I realized why she could talk.</p>

<p>(it was because I was dreaming)</p>
