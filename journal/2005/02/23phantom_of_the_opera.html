<p>The music still resonates through my brain.  I thought of Chez a
lot during the movie; the symbolism seemed to be something she would
appreciate.  I was a bit scared throughout th emovie that the phantom
would flip and pull a Hannibal and disfigure someone to death.  I'm
glad he didn't.</p>

<p>Showed Hitomi my GPS on the way to drop her off at her station and
upon saying bye to her, I was <em>immediately</em> approached by a
woman offering me a massage.</p>

<p>Uh, no.</p>

<p>On the way out of the theater, we got some funny pictures.</p>

has since returned), she and Jen were out having a few drinks, as
they do.  A woman came up to them randomly and was apparently
inspired by the music: "shall we dancing?"</p>

<p>They were like, "what?"</p>

<p>"Shall we <em>dancing</em>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, *dancing*.." of course!</p>

<p>They were entertained by this for a few days.  I saw this sign and
covered up the e in case it would make it seem possible the sign says
"Shall we dancing?" but it really doesn't.</p>

way to ride it.  Hitomi pointed out we should get a picture, so I went
back up (the up escalator, of all ways) and then came back down, just
in front of some people.  I ran down the escalator a bit to set up for
the photo, and the man came down as well!  Hitomi was like, [there's
someone behind you!] and I was like, [I know!  hurry and take the
picture!] and then apologized to the guy over my shoulder.</p>

<p>He stared (glared?) at me after he got off the escalator and went
on his way.</p>

<p>Though his legs look funny below my legs (it would be great if we
had the same color pants on), I ran up again for another shot.</p>
