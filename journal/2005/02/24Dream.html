<p class=dream>I overheard a man talking to a prostitute. "I want you
to make it look like an accident."</p>

<p class=dream>"Of course"</p>

<p class=dream>He had requested that she have his daughter killed.</p>

<p class=dream>I was like, ??? no way, and I walked over to him,
ripped the freshly lit cigarette out of his mouth, and was like, "why
are you blocking your emotions?  You need to really feel what you
have done.  Don't run away from it."</p>

<p class=dream>And he was like "oh god you're right," and he ran down
to look for the woman to whom he had given the order to kill.</p>

<p class=dream>I regretted that I had taken too long to decide to
tell him what I did; maybe it would have been easier to find her.</p>

<p class=dream>We looked in the hotel lobby; I didn't have a good idea
of what she looked like since I had just overheard the conversation.
There was no one in the lobby, so I screamed up into the atrium into
which the rooms overlooked, "prostitute, come downstairs in five
minutes!" the idea being she wouldn't have to reveal herself to anyone
by coming down right *now* and the guy could be the one to meet her,
so she wouldn't be identified by talking to me, *and* he needed to be
the one to call off the hit.</p>

<p class=dream>I went up to the top floor and onto the roof where I
saw a cessna and an airliner flying so they appeared to be quite close
to each other, but I knew it had to be an illusion.  I watched them
for a bit and the airliner made a long slow turn out of sight and the
cessna made a sudden sharp plummeting turn and crash (gently) in a
field.  The pilot was staggeringly drunk as he got out, and police
were onto him immediately.  I was watching / staring at him and his
cohort got mad and threatened to take a picture of me watching him,
and I was like, "wha???  I'll go get my camera and take a picture
of <b>you</b>, crazy threatener man."</p>

<p class=dream>I ran upstairs, but then realized I was already on the roof,
so I ran downstairs.</p>

<p>I don't remember ever getting my camera.</p>

<p class=dream>I was at a railroad crossing, with the crossing guard
arm down.  Some kids were playing with the arm by hanging on the
counterweight to raise the arm.  I thought it would be funny if I
held the arm down while the big kids tried it, but let the arm go up
when the little kid did it.</p>

<p class=dream>Never got a chance to do that; the train arrived and
people went over to it, but there were no ladders to get into one of
the cars.  People filtered over to the other cars that had ladders,
and I decided to challenge myself to jump up into the ladderless car,
while some other people were trying to figure out how to get in.  I
got a bit of a running start and just as I was ready to leap, I
realized I had forgotten my backpack.  I knew I didn't have enough
time to go back, get my backpack and still challenge myself with this
strangely ladderless car, so I wondered if I had enough time to jump
into the car and jump back out before the doors closed.  I decided it
would be not worth the risk of leaving my backpack for such a stunt
that honestly I knew I could do, but was just secretly wanting to have
had the experience of _Jumping_Into_A_Train_Car_Without_Ladders_ and
impressing the few people who were still trying to work out how to get
into the thing.  I went back and got my backpack and woke up.</p>

<p class=dream>For a moment I was like "crap; I should have jumped
into it; I wouldn't have lost my backpack after all!"  Then I was
like, "it wouldn't have counted because it was a dream."</p>
