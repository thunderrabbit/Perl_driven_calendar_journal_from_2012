<p>I'm going to Shinjuku to check out the Saori shop/school/location
to see if I can weave some sort of something.  I have a plan, but I
don't know if I can even weave anything today, much less what I have
in mind.  I'd like to make a muffler for Hitomi, and weave her name in
kanji into the design.  After a bit of critical thinking about it, I
recognize it wil be easiest to write her name as vertical kanji; this
technique will require the fewest concurrent colors.</p>

<p>I imagine it will be easy enough if I write a template on paper
and simply superimpose it and the weaving.</p>

<p>I looked up their Tokyo office, which is located near Shinjuku as
Chie indicated yesterday.  Called them up and, in Japanese, was
basically able to explain that I want to make a muffler after having
seen their exhibit in Harajuku.</p>

<p>One thing that threw me was the woman kept saying "はい" which I
took to mean "I understand (what you want to say)." but she meant it
as "I understand (you so far; keep going)."  But I couldn't really
keep going with her saying "はい" all the time.</p>
