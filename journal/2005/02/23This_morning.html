<p>I put together the Makiko Party entry this morning, including
figuring out how to make ImageMagick draw that white circle over
Katsu's hanko.  I don't know how sensitive an issue hankos are; I just
didn't want to post his on the web in case it's a big deal.</p>

<p>Headed now to Harajuku to meet Michael Hetherton and Yumi ????
from work to see Kevin's art show.  I don't know which Kevin it is,
and Michael answered "the other Kevin is gone."  While I do know which
two Kevin-named people are in question, I didn't know one of them
left.  And I still don't know which one we're visiting today.</p>
