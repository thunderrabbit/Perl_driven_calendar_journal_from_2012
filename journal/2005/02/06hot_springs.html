<p>I don't know that they were actually springs, but I'm sure at one
time the water has emerged from a spring.</p>

<p>We went down to the public baths, where gender separate we all get
naked and walk around in a big steamy room with knee deep warm to hot
water in various pools.  I spent most of my time under a falling
stream of water that was similar to Fred's shower head in his previous
apartment in Austin, except a larger volume of water and a higher
altitude spigot.  It was definitely nice, but not as nice as the huge
volume gushing water thing at Tabacon near Arenal, Costa Rica.</p>

<p>I ventured to the pools outside cause Hitomi said I should, but was
quickly shooed out by a woman who seems to have spotted me going in.
Or rather, out.  I felt bad cause there were three other guys already
out there, and maybe she hadn't seen them except when she went out to
chase me back in.  Ah well.</p>

<p>I sat in a realllly hot tub for a bit - not all the way in, but
just my legs.  I got used to the heat and then considered sitting all
the way in.  I lowered myself down and was like, <em>nevamind</em> and
got back out.</p>

<p>Wandered around a bit and then came back to the room cause Hitomi
had apparently already snagged the door key.  But she wasn't there
(here) so I went back down and one of the guys with a pile of keys
let me in.</p>

<p>Turns out she had gone back up to meet me there, but we must have
passed each other along the way.  I went down the steps while she
went up the elevator.</p>
