<p>Man.  I pretty much can't read the Japanese on the Yahoo Japan
Auction: New Item Submission page.</p>

<p>I got through the picture upload part, and the title/desription
part, but that's just cause I know computer stuff.</p>

<p>I think I figured out the payment information part using
worldlingo's free online translator, but some of the translations were
wack, and I'm not confident I understand what the translations are all
talking about anyway.</p>

<p>Below that it gets into escrow services and all kinds of pricing
stuff that I just don't want to cut-copy-paste-translate all of it,
when some translators will be in my building later tonight.</p>
