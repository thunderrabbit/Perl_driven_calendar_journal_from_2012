<p>This morning came more quickly than I realized because the sliding
door was closed over the windows.  When Hitomi said it was 8 am, I
knew something was amiss with the light, cause it ws dark.</p>

<p>Quick romp then zoom down to breakfast where nakai, this time
dressed in yukatas, not kimonos, greeted us, and said goodbyye quite
effectively, but seemed loathe to clear trays of dishes from the
tables.  I guess that's cause they were close to the end of breakfast,
and would be giving everything a good clean soon enough.</p>

<p>After breakfast we proceeded to the public baths, which were more
ccrowded than last night, but not too croded.  Actualy not even
really more crowded; it was just the locker area that was more crowded.dd</p>

<p>oops falling asleep. </p>

<p>I jut want to get one thing:</p>

<p>Getting into the outdoor hottub challenged my sensibilities.</p>

<p>The outdoor air was super cold and the bath was super hot.  I felt
the burn of the water boiling my skin off and cooking flesh, but the
air outside was hardly bearable, with shivering wind goose pimpling
my already wet body.</p>

<p>I was like, <em>this is a huge conflict of interests!</em></p>

<p>I got in anyway and actually relaxed into the heat, a feat which
required my feet and hands out of the water for temperature regulation
as handy temperature regulators.  I got out red, but not boiled.
Whew.</p>
