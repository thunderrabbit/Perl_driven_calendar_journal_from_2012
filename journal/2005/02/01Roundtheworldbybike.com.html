<p>Kickass.</p>

<p>Jen showed me an article in Metropolis about a guy who is riding
around the world.  He'll be in Shibuya tomorrow night for a

<p>This helps me probe my brain about the possibility of my plan.
Start with small trips first; that worked for him.  It's possible to

<p>I recognize I don't want to seek any sponsors; just do it for me.
Support and sponsors can come if they choose.</p>
