&lt;p>I first heard about HAM radio from Mr Hamm.  I was never interested
in it, but I kinda am now.  Only in the slightest way, though; I don't
want a full blown operator license; I just want to be tracked via APRS
while TJ Bike and I tour around the country.  Did some research and it
seems that I can get a call sign without taking a test; just gotta buy
the right equipment and sign some kinda form that they'll process.&lt;/p>

<p>Nice margins.</p>
