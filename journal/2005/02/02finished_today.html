<li>* Do laundry using hot water</li>
<li>* Buy groceries</li>
<li>* Eat</li>
<li>Go through the (short) stack of papers on my desk</li>
<li>* Ask Richard or Shoko to help me put knotboards for sale online</li>
<li>Go to Shibuya to see the guy who's riding around the world on his bike</li>

<p>Got the first three done, but didn't do the stack of papers.  Could
hurry and work on that now.  Neither Richard nor Shoko was able to get
me completely hooked up with YahooAuction.  I got registered, did
yahoo wallet, entered credit card and all that shit, but there is one
more field that they want me to enter and none of us knows what to put
there.  Crap.</p>

<p>But!!!!  I've gotten much further.  Though now Yahoo is going to
charge me 294 yen per month for the premium edition of some bullshit;
we couldn't find a way around it.  Jerks.</p>
