<p>Went to <a href="http://thepinkcow.com">The Pink Cow</a> with
Satoko last night.  Ate super yummy guacamole chips and beef stroganof
(with rice instead of noodles.  Satoko was like, "noodles???" when I
told her how I've always had it before).</p>

<p>We happened to come just as the restaurant was opening (5pm), when
they were setting up for a slide show.  We got to see the
pre-screening.  The slide show was pretty cool, including two types of
slides: underwater, with all its organic beauty of shimmering light
and painted fish; and fighter jets in the air, with all their sharp
corners and the ability kill things (not shown).</p>

<p>There was one particular slide taken from one jet, looking at
another jet, during takeoff.  He said, "this picture is supposed to
be impossible."</p>

<p>I was like, "why is it impossible?  Cause you can't take off and
hold a camera at the same time?"</p>

<p>"No; cause there's not enough light."</p>

<p>Ah.  I asked if the image was another of the 8-second-shutter-open
pics he had been showing us (though obviously it was not; it wasn't
smeared), and he said something like, "my methods of taking that
picture are secret."</p>

<p>And I laughed it off, but his words kinda hurt.  <em>Garsh, I'm not
going to steal your idea; it's not like I can fly.  Much less fly a
jet.</em></p>

<p>This morning I realized I am losing my men's group skills; I didn't
immediately figure out how to explain my feeling in a non-threatening
way.  Not that I would have; I don't know / care about that guy.</p>
