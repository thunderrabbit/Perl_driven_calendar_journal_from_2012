<p>Japanese TV has some strange shows.</p>

<p>I don't know if I'd classify this as a game show, and I'm not sure
what market they're trying to reach, but... here is the setup:</p>

<p>Five male comedians, two pairs and a solo act, go to a sushi bar.
Not cheap kaiten sushi, but an expensive place.  They'd like to eat
sushi, right?</p>

<p>Here's the rule: a sushi serving is served to a guy if he can
fart.</p>

<p>Each time one of them farts, the farter gets a serving of
sushi.</p>

<p>Cut a fart, get sushi.</p>

<p>They've got microphones behind each man's stool (no pun intended)
and a camera watching from the ceiling and one or two guys walking
around with cameras.</p>

<p>Each time one of them feels a fart coming, they signal so the
cameras can watch his ass while the TV subtitle says "屁コミング"
[fart coming].</p>

<p>A guy in the background does a celebratory drum roll each time a
fart is achieved.</p>
