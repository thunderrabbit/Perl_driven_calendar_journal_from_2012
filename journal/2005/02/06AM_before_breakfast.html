<p>It's snowing.</p>

<p>Snow in meter deep drifts covers (everything shorter than a meter
and) tree supports and trees and everything.</p>

<p>There's a mesmerizing quality to the fractal paths taken by the
snowflakes.  The paths are not quite predictable, but hardly
random.</p>

<p>If I kknew (a lot) more about describing fractals, I could assign a
number that describes the level of rqndomness in their patterns.  I'll
just imagine it's 1.5.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Not that I've seen the snow festival (really) yet, I'll say that
it's not what I expected.  I thought there were structures made of
solid ice, into which we could venture.  What I see is forms of
packed snow.</p>
