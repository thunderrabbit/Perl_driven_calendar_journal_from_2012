<p>I felt like a lunky sack of shit for being so mean to Hitomi for no
apparent reason.  She's nothing but nice to me and she's always
thoughtful, but I don't always see it that way and I'm like <em>shut
the hell up and leave me alone</em> when I get to the point where I
just want to be alone, and she's just like, "why don't you want to
talk to me?" and I'm like "I see you all the time; compare seeing you
three days a week to seeing my other friends one day per month or 6
weeks."</p>

<p>Fight fight fight and I tried to turn it around and talk about
something *real*; she wants to talk, fuck talking about how cold it
is outside, so I asked her for 60 different answers to "who are you?"
and she argued that it ought to be "what are you?" (an English
teacher) so I changed it to what are you and she answered a few, but
we never got to anything good.</p>

<p>Then she's like, "okay, do you want to go to sleep?" and though my
desire to go to sleep had been the topic of discussion for some time,
I gave it some thought and then said "yeah."</p>

<p>Then she goes, "wait!"</p>

<p>And I go, "(sigh) what?"</p>

<p>And all she wanted was to give me my clothes and crap that she
packed in her suitcase, and I just felt like such a shit for having
her take care of me, but me not appreciating it.</p>

<p>Maybe I need to not have anyone take care of me like that
anymore.</p>
