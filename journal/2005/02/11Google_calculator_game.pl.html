<p>I sorta started writing a google_calculator_game.pl script.
Realistically I fixed a problem with cookies in my setCookie.pl code,
cause it wasn't working after I made http://www.robnugen.com refresh
to http://robnugen.com</p>

<p>Had to use ENV{'HTTP_SERVER'} or something instead of something
else.</p>
