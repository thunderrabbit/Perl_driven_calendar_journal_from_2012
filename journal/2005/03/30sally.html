<p class=note>Tonight Sam taught us a drinking song:

<p class=note>Here's to Jasmine she's true blue.
<br>She's a piss pot through and through.
<br>She's a bastard so they say.
<br>Tried to go to heaven but she went the other day.</p>

<p class=note>Drink it down drink it down drink it down down
down...</p>

<p class=note>This was our day today:</p>

<p class=note>First we woke up and went into the outdoor onsen at the
hotel in Hakone. Then we went and saw a controlled burn. It was boring
but everyone else seemed to get a kick out of it. Then we spent 45
minutes trying to decide what to do. Rob and Hitomi were going to go
do the circuit while the rest of us went to another onsen or followed
Kelly back to the black egg souvenir shop or something. So we all end
up on the same bus to go to the boat docks. We went across the lake on
the tallship again, this time down below and gossiping, then we split
up at Gora.</p>

<p class=note>At one point, waiting for the boat, I totally cried for
some reason. Rob was kind and lent me his shoulder and his kleenex. I
was feeling frustrated by Kelly and Jasmine having come to Japan
because it is sometimes overwhelming to make plans so that everyone is
happy. Sometimes I think it would be so much easier if it were just me
'n Rob 'n Satoko kickin' it. None of this Hitomi/Jazzy/Kelly b.s. But
each experience I would not trade for the world, despite the
occasional frustration.</p>

<p class=note>I love this trip. It is just heaven. I really like
Japan. The food, the people, the way people sleep on the train, don't
look at each other on the street, carry 3 kids and one mom on a bike,
the cute cute children, oden oden oden, jaded english teachers at
millenium house, the smell of incense at senso-ji, the sound of the
rain while i was praying at the temple, rob's smile, jazzy's
silliness, kelly's witticisms, sam's drinking songs, the squatting
toilets, the lack of trash cans and paper towels, rob's jacket, the
warm scarf jazzy and allie gave me that keeps me snuggly in the cold,
snow at Hakone, doing the Charleston on the boat, sake sake sake,
umeshu, no-pan, don't touch my moustache, playing at Satoko's jazz
practice - not rehearsal mind you.</p>

<p class=note>Tomorrow we might go to Kyoto. I can't wait. I love
meditating and praying and soaking up silence. I felt like I was in a
dream this morning at the onsen listening to the sound of the water
trickling over the rocks and into the outdoor onsen - Jazzy and Satoko
floating next to me - steam rising from the water surface - cool air
rustling the plum tree leaves.</p>
