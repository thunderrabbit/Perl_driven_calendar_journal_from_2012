<p>While I was at work on Tuesday, my website seemed to crash.  But
then I noticed that it said something about Gaba's servers, so I
guessed that they had blocked the domain.  Turns out that's what they
did, or my website came back up by the time I came home.</p>

<p>I use my website so I can remember my students more easily.  I'll
use silentsurf.com to connect to the site.  But, I have to deal with
cookies in a different way; basically not use cookies, but use hidden
fields to pass the username and password parameters.  For some reason
silentsurf.com doesn't handle the way my student tracker sets
cookies.</p>

<p>I'm at a hotel now without internet access, so I likely won't be
able to hook that up before I go to work tomorrow.  Perhaps I can do
it this weekend.  Perhaps I won't worry about it at all; the only
reason I want to is to thumb my electronic nose at Gaba.  Block my
website.  Feh.  I can get around it.</p>
