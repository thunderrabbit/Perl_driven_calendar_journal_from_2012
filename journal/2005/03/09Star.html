<p>The * astrisk above was when Hitomi informed me again that she
would like to live with me.  I told her I could not, and she said
something that was like bargaining, and I just was like, _______ and
couldn't say anything.  If I say no; that's it; done; I don't want to
slash can't live with you.  Done.</p>

<p>Why do I feel this way, and why do I feel like such a heel for
feeling this way?</p>
