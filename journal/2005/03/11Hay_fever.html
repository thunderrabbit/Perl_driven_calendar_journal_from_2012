<p>One thing that I find interesting: my students this time of year
are like, "do you have allergies?" (using the Japanese pronunciation
of "alugee" and I'm like, "not recently" and they go on to say that
this is the prime time for allergies in Japan, and I see lots of
Japanese wearing masks designed to stop allergens and many Japanesse
with snotty noses, but(!), though my nose seems perpetually ready for
a good day of gooshing snot everywhere, this season in Japan does not
adversely affect my allergy response.</p>

<p>this is the third time for me to be in Japan during this season.
No problems all three times.  (I specifically remember when I arrived
I was pleased that my nose wasn't snotty at all.)  (I don't specifcaly
remember last year; I'm just making a wild assumption.)</p>
