Hi Sally.

Some weeks ago you said something like, "if you need to spend time
with your girlfriend, I understand."   I basically tried to squirm my
way past that little situation and have you while putting her on a
proverbial shelf.   When I consider the bigger picture, I know this is
not the right thing to do.

I recognize my own sex addiction and my desire to have the convenience
of more than one woman at a time.  I recognize that if I have you
sleep here, I am not respecting you nor Hitomi.  Therefore, I must not
have you sleep in my room while you are here; we will make other
arrangements.

I'm sorry to be such a nutcase about sex.  I'm thankful/hopeful that
you understand.

    With Love
      - Rob

<p>I am most afraid of this possibility: Sally never considered the
possibility of having sex with me while she is here.  I always felt
an underlying possibility, given emails that had been sent.</p>

<p>I am second most afraid that Sally will be like "fuck you then,"
and not want to come, given that I'm "choosing" Hitomi 'over'
Sally.</p>

<p>But if I can't trust Sally to be cool with this, then I am not
trusting her to be the type of woman I'd like to hook it up with.  If
she's not, then she's not.</p>

<p>This brings to mind what That Guy Jon said, "the most important
thing is trust."</p>

<p>Sally still hasn't written me back.  I'm really... just like ....
fuckin' wishing I hadn't sent that email.</p>
