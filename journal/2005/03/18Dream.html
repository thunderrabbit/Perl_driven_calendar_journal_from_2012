<p class=dream>One of my students said, "move house" and Andrew
interrupted, "or just move, if you're American," and I was like,
"yeah, we were having a fight recently about 'move' vs 'move house.'
If you're in England, you move house.  If you're in the United States,
you move."</p>

<p class=dream>The student was like, "so do I move or move house in
Japan?" and I suddenly woke up.</p>

<p><em>I've got a Japanese lesson today!</em>  Three minutes ahead of
my alarm.</p>
