<p>I just wrote this to Ryan in China:</p>

<p>I will begin my bicycling adventures soon.  It's warming up in
Japan.  Very slowly, but warming.  I recently got some maps and stuff
for a great price from a bicycling guy who was getting rid of all his
junk so he could leave the country.</p>

<p>I've got to do the same soon.  I plan to quit my apartment after
April (during April I'll only have a weekend job and do practice
bicycle trips during the week); I sent a box to janette recently.  My
brother was at her house when she opened it, which was quite
convenient because I had included some stuff for him.</p>

<p>I have a few contacts collected for places I can stay in various
places.  Awesome.  I hope to balance (! time to relax in a safe place
(@ overstaying my welcome (3 getting on with my trip ($ getting stuck
in one area (% parenthesis (^ access to internet / electricity for
journaling (& breaking free of digital chains)))))))</p>

<p>I am also not sure what's next for me.  Though I imagine riding my
bicycle around Japan counts as a cool project, it is temporary.</p>
