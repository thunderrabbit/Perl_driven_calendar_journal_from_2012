<p>This is my first trip to Akihabara on TJ Bike.  I'll be leaving
shortly.  The goals today are to</p>

<p>1) arrive</p>

<p>2) get a solar panel for my GPS receiver</p>

<p>3) get a way to mount the GPS thing on TJ Bike</p>

<p>4) meet my friends in Hamamatsucho</p>

<p class=date>1:48pm</p>

<p>Wow; three hours.  Number 1 accomplished, though I haven't actually
found the station yet.  I have parked TJ Bike between a rail and a big
transformer box; double-locked to the rail.  Thanks for being safe, TJ
Bike!</p>

<p>Cool things about the trip: I rode past two places I recognized I
had been via train: Tokyo American club (where Louise's plays have
been), and Ginza: Apple Store and Ginza Lion restaurant.  Nice.</p>

<p>Next: step 2.</p>

<p class=date>4:37pm</p>

<p>Step 2 was aborted around 3pm.  I found one guy who had a solar
panel, and it would probably work, but I'd like to shop around a
bit.  It was 2000 yen for 3 / 4.5 / 9 / 12 volt output and a battery
charger to boot.  So conceivably I could just keep swapping batteries
and charging them with the solar thing, instead of connecting it
directly to the GPS.</p>

<p>Step 3 will happen later or so, though the GPS seemed to work
pretty well in my pocket, and I referred to my map more often than to
the GPS.  Maybe a way to mount the map would be preferable.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I overshot Hamamatsucho station on the way back.  I turned around
and asked for directions which sent me right past a police station
where I had specifically considered asking, but didn't ask for
directions.  It was right at that station that I needed turn where I
hadn't before.</p>

<p>Getting back on TJ Bike after walking around Akihabara was like
"ouch; my legs are tight."  Maybe I should stretch after long
rides.</p>

<p>While riding, I was often humming or singing or otherwise being
happy.  Awesome.</p>

<p>TJ Bike is near Hamamamammamatsucho station, locked to a thing and
I am across the street chowing a bit of a snack at a coffee shop with
a separate room for smoking.</p>

<p>Holy cats.  I just saw a woman on a nice mountain bike and she
parked it but didn't lock it at all.  Just left it near a post.</p>

<p>Ah.  Only for about 1 minute.  She's back now.</p>

<p>It's colder now than it was during the day.  And windy.  I'm not
sure how happy I'll be on the way home tonight.</p>
