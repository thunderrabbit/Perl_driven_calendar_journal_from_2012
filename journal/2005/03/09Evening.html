<p>Met Tomoko, Sumidasan and Hitomi for monjyayaki and okonomiyaki
dinner at a restaurant called Kura in Tsukishima (Hitomi met us at
Kura).  Hitomi's choice (pork and cheese) was my definite favorite!
For some reason the pork tasted like tuna.</p>

<p>Sumidasan gave Hitomi and me two bags of rolls (triangular dough
rolled up so they look kinda like croissants)</p>

<p>We are going to karaoke now.</p>

<p class=date>12:34am</p>

<p>Home.  Showered.  Eating a few of the rolls cause officially it's
tomorrow and this can be considered breakfast.  Kinda.</p>

<p>Karaoke was fun.  I always feel honored by Sumidasan and Tomoko
when I go cause they always ask me to do Eminem and always say I do a
good job at it.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Hitomi and Tomoko were really funny doing a set of songs by Pink
Lady or some such.  Peppaaaaaa kebu!  with hand motions, but no
apparent meaning to the words.</p>
