<p>Vegged out last night watching Myth Busters (I love that show and
I'm sure they love doing it!) where they tried to get sucked down in
the vortex of a sinking ship and to train goldfish how to go through a
maze.  Fell asleep watching Mysteries of Egypt or something and woke
up when the show ended.  Barely dragged myself out of the couch to get
ready for bed.</p>

<p>Slept in my new warm cozy sleeping bag for four hours until it was
time to call Sally.  We had exchanged a few emails since I sent the
one I regretted, and the conversation confirmed that everything was
100% A-OK; no worries; super perfect; yahooo!!</p>

<p>Went back to sleep then did a ton of email, including a repeated
complaint to gmail, so they'll fix the NASA press releases so they
don't appear as attachments.</p>

<p>About to meet Satoko at Kosugi to talk about plans for
Sallytime!!</p>
