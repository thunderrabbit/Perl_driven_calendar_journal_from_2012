<p>Kozue, the only Japanese I know without kanji for her name, helped
me look for video cameras for TJ Bike today!  I met her in Shinjuku
where we scoped cameras in Sakuraya and Bic Camera.  We came upon a
likely solution for what I'd like to have: a small camera up front
with wires to a recording device elsewhere.  The solution could be a
small camera up front and a normal sized video camera being used just
for recording via a video line-in.  Kozue's job is all about video, so
she knows this stuff mo' betta'n me, so I really appreciate her help.
And of course her Japanese linguistic skills blow mine away.</p>

<p>This solution is even better than I had envisioned; I was thinking
of somehow hooking the camera up to my computer or some such, but I
couldn't imagine that would work very well.  Having the other camera
record is great cause then when I'm *off* TJ Bike (for example on
P To Da B!) I can record stuff with the hand held camera.  Sweet!</p>

<p>We chowed kaitenzushi and then walked around Kabukicho a bit and
then over to the other side of Shinjuku with which I am much more
familiar just so (for the *first* time in my two years here) I could
get their arrangement sorted out in my head.</p>
