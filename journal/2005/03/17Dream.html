<p class=dream>Sally had arrived (only took 1 minute!) and I was
chilling with her and some other friends in a different area.  They
had a craft project with yarn or something and when it got late we
were all cuddled in a puppy pile relaxed manner.  Sally was happy and
I was happy though we weren't right near each other.  Still
connected.</p>
