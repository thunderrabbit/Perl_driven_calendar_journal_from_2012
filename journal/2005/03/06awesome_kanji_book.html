<p>Man, this cool kanji book is cooler than cool; it's awesome!  In a
day of non-constant work, I have locked into my brain 65 kanji (so
far).  Now, I must must must admit that some of them were already in
there.  But this new technique of connecting them to meanings in
English makes a damn lot of sense.</p>

<p>Previously I had been learning the sounds of words via hiragana,
and then once I had the sound locked in my mind, learn the kanji as
an arbitrary picture for that hiragana, sometimes simply by adding
bits of previously known kanji together.</p>

<p>This book starts with simple kanji (or elements of kanji) and
gives them meaning in English.  Then stacking the parts together to
make more complex kanji becomes easier.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, in the Introduction, the author says "The more
you try to combine the study of the written kanji through the method
outlined in these pages with traditional study of the kanji, the less
good this book will do you.  I know of no exceptions."</p>

<p>I am not really studying written kanji in a "traditional" way that
I know of; so I'll take the risk and imagine this book will help
me.</p>
