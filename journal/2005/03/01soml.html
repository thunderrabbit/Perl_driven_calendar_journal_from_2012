<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I have just finished making a muffler for Hitomi.  I pretty
much like it.  I hope she will like it.</p></li>

<li><p>Ironically, I lost the hat she knitted for me this morning.  I
assume I'll get it back at Motosumiyoshi station later today with no
problem, though.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm in the Apple Store in Ginza, on the fourth floor and have
been waiting for my chance to talk to the guys at the Genius Bar to
see if I can get a new power cord for my Mac.  The end of the cord
that is bent is fine; it's the other one that's messed up.</p></li>

<li><p>I live in Millenium House in Motosumiyoshi, near Tokyo Japan.
Also in the building: Jeff from Texas, cute Shoko, Katrina from OZ,
Roger from India maybe, Jen from Perth, Colin from Canada, me from
Texas, Dean from England maybe, Yuki, Olivia from Melbourne, Ikumi,
David from Ireland or Scotland, Jackie from OZ.  Richard moved out
recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I wrote on the whiteboard an announcement that we will play
Silent Football with a weblink to the rules.  I wonder if anyone will
come.</p></li>

<li><p>Dan is back in town!  Maybe for good.  He's bunking out with me
or Jen depending on the night.  We haven't played HSJ yet.  He has
written a ton of journal entries but doesn't have them online yet.  I
will help him do that if he wants.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been talking to people at Gaba about my upcoming bike
adventure, and Mieko invited me to stay with her parents near Hakone
or somewhere rural.  There place sounds awesome.  Waterfall nearby,
shrine with monks chanting at 4am, monkeys, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitoe invited me to stay with her parents in Wakkanai, which is
awesome because I specifically wanted to visit that city.  It's in far
north Hokkaido, so a bit cold this time of year.</p></li>

<li><p>Computer: Apple Powerbook G4 667MHz, with 512 Megs ram, 30 Gig
HD, 15 inch screen (I think).  Case recently replaced (50,000 yen)
cause I broke one of the old-style-easily-breakable hinges
again.</p></li>

<li><p>I use Firefox 1.0 as my browser.  Apparently an update is
available, but I couldn't find it for OS X.  Strange.  Haven't tried
in the past few days, though.</p></li>

<li><p>I will have my last day at Gaba on 15 March.  I inquired about
getting a visa extension, but they won't sponsor me unless I write a
letter of intent saying I will work 120 lessons per month.  That's not
so many, but it wouldn't allow me to ride TJ Bike for days on end.  I
won't write the letter while intending not to teach the
lessons.</p></li>

<li><p>I think it would be awesome to have a laptop with detachable
keyboard, so I could type while seated with good posture.  Or just
lose the keyboard and have awesome voice recognition.</p></li>

<li><p>I just put together a couple of links that show the Pentagon
was not hit by a 757 on Airplane Day.  I really really wonder what the
US Government is up to regarding that.  It's crossed my mind to
uncover it all, but I'm not sure that would keep my interest very
long.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't done (started) my application for P_B.  It's
due on Friday and must be mailed.  I assume hand delivery is okay.
Arg.</p></li>
