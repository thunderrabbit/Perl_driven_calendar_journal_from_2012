<p>Today is Hakone Day!  I'm still sore after last night, but am
trying to keep my shit together.</p>

<p>I took Charlie's Angels to Yokohama to meet Satoko, who took them
to Odawara to get started on their Hakone adventure.  I wanted to wait
for Hitomi (who had to work a bit this morning) so I came back
home.</p>

<p>On the way home I got the knit cap she made (it had been returned
to Hiyoshi) and sent in the first confirmation FAX to P To Da B.</p>

<p>Offered to make Roboyaki for Hitomi, but I'm hardly in the
mood.</p>
