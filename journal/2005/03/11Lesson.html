<p>Headed to Japanese lesson now.  Ayana said she would print the
Japanese journal entires I've written online here.  There's not a
million of them, but enough that I don't think we'll be able to read
them all in one lesson.</p>

<p>I considered making a "printable version" of my journal, but
decided against it; I don't have the specs in my head yet.  (Should I
allow more than one day at a time?)</p>

<p>Wow; the lesson seemed longer than it was.  Maybe.</p>

<p>I read and Ayana made corrections to the three pages i wrote last
night and two pages worth of journal entries.  Some of my more
complicated grammar forms are surprisingly correct.  Wow.</p>
