<p class=dream>In the entrance of a movie theater, Meg Robinson was
watching a moving/living model she put together of a music
performance she had seen the previous week.  I had bbeen therer too,
actually and she asked me which song I liked best.  I was like, "the
one that went 'Bahhh  bah bah bah bahhh bahhh bah bah bah bahh bahh
bah bah bah bahhhh'" and she was like, "no, that was the other band,"
and I'm like, "oh, well, it's a good thing I remember anything at
all; I usually don't."</p>

<p class=dream>I asked her to sing part of the song she liked best,
and when she did, I recognized that I had seen that band as well.
"Ah," I said, "they played at the front of the building."</p>

<p class=dream>Earlier, I had been talking to some ultimate (Saturday
Night Specials) and KTRU people about someone who was in trouble with
the police and Jon (who used to live drunkenly next to me) was there
telling some wack story to Genki Man Dan, who knew that Jon would
just blather on for hours, so Dan interrupted him and asked me a
question to change topics and I was glad Dan recognized the amount of
time Jon could talk, but didn't want him to think we didn't care to
listen to him.</p>

<p>Or something like that.</p>
