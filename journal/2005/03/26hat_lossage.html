<p>Crap.  I left the cap Hitomi knitted for me on the train.</p>
<p>Again.</p>

<p>I feel like an idiot for this.</p>

<p>I am at Motosumiyoshi and they are going to search the train whie
it's waiting in Jiyugaoka in about 10 minutes.  I was able to tell
him what car, what side, etc I had been on.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about this is I don't know fo sho that I
lost it on this gtrain.  It could have been the other train line.
Keikyu line.</p>

<p>If they don't find it in Jiyugaoka, I will ask the Keikyu line
guys tomorrow on my way to work.</p>

<p>I had been super focused on reading my P To Da B materials
(timeline) carefully making notes as to my questions etc.  I will
make a check sheet in my calendar and online and make sure everything
goes perfectly smooothly for my great adventure around the world!</p>

<p>We will meet the teachers from the previous voyage to get the
inside scoop from them about what happened, etc.  That will be pretty
close to leaving time, like within a few days.</p>

<p>Right about now I am going to head to my crib and get started on
putting my checklist online.  updatelog.com</p>

<p>Found this site through a free todo-list site sent by Dude, who
hoped that google would incorporate such a thing with gmail.  That
would be definitely fly.</p>

<p>After that I will meet Hitomi and we'll check in with Sally, Kelly and Satoko in Asakusa
area to see if we should rock up there to hang out with them.  They
wanted to see a kabuki show, which I pretty much have had no interest
in seeing cause I've heard reports that they are totally boring, like
opera with no singing, but een less intelligble.  Even Japanese
people watching fell asleep, reported Jen (who fell asleep.  P</p>

<p>Phone here at the station, maybe that means they found my hat!
Whooo!</p>

<p>Nope.  No hat was found.  They will look again in Shibuya and I
will talk to Keikyu tomorrow.</p>
