<p>Pretty easy today.  Four transactions.  End result = -0.7 Q.</p>

<p>Hahaha Jen got me: I plugged in my computer to let it charge.
There are some guys here today so I plugged it in over in the kitchen
area, and put it on the sink strainer.  Later, I moved it over so I
could do the dishes.  I put it on an electric grill thing (after
verifying with my hand that the grill was off).  Later later, Jen was
like, "ah!  that's on!  It's always on!" pointing to the grill.</p>

<p>I looked over and saw that she was talking about my computer
cooking on the grill.  Saw the orange light glowing and freaked.</p>

<p>Oh wait; that's the orange light of my computer's power supply.</p>

<p>Oh, Jen!  You're such a kidder!</p>

<p>I told her the story about Wende and the CD player laser.</p>
