<p>In Jen's room, Dan had his computer and we watched The Office, a
two part thing about <em>The Office</em>, a documentary about an
office that was broadcast on BBC 2, according to The Office.</p>

<p>It was pretty funny and I felt sorry for the dumpy David guy.  Dan
told me a bit about the history of the show.</p>
