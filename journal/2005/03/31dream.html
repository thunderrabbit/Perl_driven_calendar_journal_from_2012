<p class=dream>Going to OMs office, to meet Hitomi who was already in
there.  Walked down the hall and it was the second door of three
rooms all in a row.  The first door was ajar and I could see in it as
I opened the second room.</p>

<p class=dream>I was wearing a pink tie and I had just put my pants on
while Jennifer waited for me to get my stuff together as we got off
the elevator from the previous scene which involved eating in a
cafeteria maybe.</p>

<p class=dream>I opened the door, ready for some lovin' with Hitomi,
and was surprised to find my dad was in there as well.  I played it
cool like I always wore my shirt this far unbuttoned with my pink tie,
and I was glad I had my pants on.  I said HI to him and moved over to
a different bench than where I normally sat.</p>

<p class=dream>The room was shaped like a semi circular lecture room
and I had come in from one side with the desks curving away and to the
right.  My dad was sitting on my left in the back of the circle and
Hitomi was sitting near the front of the circle.  I came in the middle
row of desks and was surprised to see my dad, but was glad I was
wearing clothes and moved toward the front inner desks and saw a video
about back when the place when the very room we were in was being
built and how a kid was being abused and forced to work on the
flickering video, and I tried to recognize something from the video
that was still in existance today, but couldn't necessarily do it.
The phone rang and it could only be OM so I went to the phone and they
were talking and eating and being loud and I was like, "be quiet, stop
eating you're not supposed to be in here," and they stopped and I
answered the phone but it got dark just at that moment and I was like,
oh crap how can I see anything and I was trying to figure out if I
could let on to him that it was dark and what he would think was
normal.  But then I woke up.</p>
