<p>I'm choosing not to go to Kyoto with Sally, Jazzy and Kelly; I
basically will be constrained by lack of a JR Rail Pass so that will
keep me from as easily going anywhere around the city.</p>

<p>Plus this will give me some time to continue gettting ready for
P To Da B and TJ Bike adventures.  It's only 66 kilometers to Hakone
(according to my GPS) so I can get there in a day (if I don't get
lost).  It will be my first adventure climbing many big hills.</p>

<p>My stomach was all knotted up before telling them I didn't want to
go.  I had told them I would go, and specifically had told Sally I
wanted to go wherever she did.  But that has changed now.</p>

<p class=date>9:03am</p>

<p><em>There</em> we go.</p>

<p>Got some of the tension out.  I had come into their room, and was
sitting, basically afraid to talk to Sally cause I didn't know what
would be her reaction.  I had shown Jasmine a diagram of how to get to
Shinkansen stations, but didn't show Sally cause I believed she was
deep in thought in her book.  I gave Sally the list of phone numbers
Hitomi had given me, but (I realize now that) I didn't give her much
help with it; there are three prices listed, which Hitomi had
explained to me, but I hadn't explained to Sally.  I simply explained
which hotels spoke English.</p>

<p>I started checking my email, a nice safe way to pass the time, and
saw a link of places to stay in Kyoto sent to me by Sally.</p>

<p>Showed her the list, but things were set to break.  Sally said she
wanted Kelly to help because I wasn't willing to help (and was just
sitting there like a dickhead (scared to talk; fair enough)); Kelly
said no.  I said I would help.  Sally said no; that I was just shut up
and leave her alone.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Crap.  I wonder how things would have been different had I told
Sally I wasn't willing to go when I had come down to the kitchen to
find her.  My stomach was all knotted up and I just couldn't.  Too
afraid of how she might react to whatever I said.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So now I'm alone in my room.  I think Kelly is alone in their room;
Jasmine had already gone downstairs; I think Sally went out just after
I did when she told me to shut up and leave her alone.</p>

<p>Would it be helpful to find Sally and listen/talk/argue with
her?</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Just as I wrote that, Kelly came into my room and asked me to call
some numbers to make reservations for Kyoto and Hiroshima.</p>

<p class=date>9:54am</p>

<p>I can hear Kelly and Jasmine leaving now; they turned off the
electricity to the room, so I'm guessing Sally is with them, or has
already left.</p>
