<p align=right>NUGEN 3 of 7</p><pre>Working as an English teacher in Japan, I see how big the world is and how much potentialwe have for positive change.  On P_B's 49th Global Voyage, I can continue thevolunteer work I did in the United States to help the world become an even better andsafer place to live.Before coming to Japan, I volunteered weekly for six years in the youth program at mychurch. The youth program promotes an atmosphere where everyone, regardless of creed,race, or religion is allowed to come together, forming a healthy respectful communitybased on common sense and humanitarianism.To this end, we had conferences around the Southwest United States twelve times per year.At each conference, we participated in an exciting social action activity.  These includedplanting trees, picking up litter around neighborhoods, revitalizing neglectedneighborhoods, volunteering in women's shelters, rebuilding homes, making lunches anddelivering them to elderly, collecting canned food for Food Bank, writing to our politicalleaders and countless others.We also invited people with unique professinal and educational backgrounds to giveseminars at our conferences.  They addressed topics including anti-racism, personalhealth, ethical treatment of animals, freedom of speech, distribution of wealth and power,among others.After spending years working with the youth, I decided to combine this work with my lovefor travel.  I will lead youth group trips around the world, allowing youth theopportunity to learn just how huge and incredible the world is.  I chose to live in Japanso I could learn the "ins-and-outs" of living here, then lead youth group trips betweenthe two countries!  This will help foster cross-cultural communication, expand the mindsof youth around the world, and ultimately make the world a better place to live.  PB activities embody the volunteer work I love, so I was ecstatic to discover I can dothese things around the world!I look forward to helping P To Da B promote this type of work on a world wide scale.Thank you for selecting me to volunteer on the 49th Global Voyage aboard P To Da B.      In service      Rob Nugen</pre>
