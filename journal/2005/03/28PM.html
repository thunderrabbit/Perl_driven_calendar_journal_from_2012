<p>Yesterday was absolutely amazing.  Hung out with Sally all day, and
once I released the need to take care of Jasmine and Kelly (I had been
trying to coordinate a way we could meet, but I wrote the wrong
station name on a note I left for them with a map; asked Jen to snag
it from their room where I left it) I was able to have a lovely fun
time with Sally.</p>

<p>Went to Asakusa to see Senso-ji and walk around in the sprinkling
rain with crowds of people that were smaller than what would have been
there in nice weather.</p>

<p>Chowed ¤ª¤Ç¤ó and talked a bit to the shop owner as he showed us
the mugs that change colors when they change from room temperature to
hot drink temperature.</p>

<p>Headed back home via Shibuya where we spent a couple hours in
Starbucks just talking talking talking talking talking talking about
everything.</p>

<p>I invited Satoko to join us, but then realized it was kindof a
waste because we were about to leave, but oh well and we chatted with
her as we headed back home.</p>

<p>Invited Hitomi to join us at Skylark (Gusto) for dinner and I
chatted with her as Satoko and Sally talked.  Totally lovely.</p>
