<p>Wow; we're here at Satoko and friends/bandmates/fellow-musicians
practice jam session.  I can't actually identify all the instruments,
except that they're brass.  trumpet, and trombone and then saxophone,
and tenor sax (Satoko).</p>

<p>Jen joined us and got about an hour of chat time with everyone
before we arrived.  She chose not to stay for the jam session because
it wasn't helping to relieve her headache.  I definitely understand.
Sorry that she got all the way out here (30 minute walk from Kawasaki
station) just to find she couldn't stay.  I'm glad that she took care
of herself, though.</p>

<p class=note>They're playing And That's That. I'm not sure who it's
by. It's really hesetfunny to see these guys rehearsing in their socks
in a makeshift dance studio. It's also interesting that they are
practicing with a metronome, 8th grade band style. They are tight, for
an amateur band. The saxes are REALLY together, attacks and releases
are RIGHT ON. Laughter and music are international languages.</p>

<p class=note>So are metronomes.</p>
