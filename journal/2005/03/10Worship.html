<p>I'm worshipping the fucking computer, wondering how to write
everything I did today, which amounted to a lot of nothing; I almost
called Hitomi to try and have her come over; I need to learn how to
deal with this angsty feeling</p>

<p>It's like</p>

<p>I want to medicate with women or porn or food or computer</p>

<p>Positive ideas are shot down: ride TJ Bike (too cold (plus dark));
go outside - go for a walk (argh); study Japanese (ugh; I'm sick of
it); work on P To Da B lesson plan - I chose present continuous
(ugh; it's only a 10 minute lesson; I can just wing it (I know this
excuse won't stick))</p>

<p>I'm thankful that I noticed I was calling Hitomi before I actually
called her.  I had phone in hand and words in mind and was
like, <em>wtf???</em>  I didn't notice the actually thoughts that led
to that close call (pun nearly intended (pun not intended)) but I'm
glad I noticed before I called her.</p>

<p>I had been thinking I should meditate; everything seems too crappy
or useless or meaningless.. Dan, this is me feeling depressed.</p>

<p>Why'd you have to go back to England?  I miss you, man.</p>

<p>Okay; I'm going to relax with my brain for a moment.  It's 9:20pm
now.</p>

<p class=date>9:28pm</p>

<p>Aha.  I got to something:</p>

<p>Had Hitomi called me today, she would likely have reminded me that
I had a lesson with Takako.  I had let myself rely on Hitomi as a
crutch for remembering my schedule.  So that's why I wanted to call
Hitomi (back into my life <em>please take care of me, er, my
schedule</em>) tonight.  Also, she would have helped me study.</p>

<p>SO: I'm going to ride Mimibike to Saizeria where they have an
unlimited drink bar (of a limited selection) and study.</p>

<p>Not just study; also plan my transition out of my apartment and
into TJ Bike / P To Da B (May - August, if I get it)</p>

<p class=date>10:09pm</p>

<p>Hitomi called as I went down to wash the bowl I used for
lunch/dinner/snack (corn cream soup) and I was really happy to hear
from her.  She may or may not come over; she wants to, and knows it's
not in our best interest.  I want her to, but I know it's not in our
best interest.</p>

<p>I talked to Shoko about it.  She said I should make a decision
about what I want and tell Hitomi.  Good advice.  I've already done
it, though.</p>

<p>Haven't I?</p>
