<p>Today has been zooming by.  4 lessons down and 4 to go.  Sadly, the
first two lessons were a double blue booking noshow by Motoko, who is
really cool and looks just like Barbie.  And by Barbie, I mean my
cousin Barbie who is beautiful but looks nothing like Mattel's
Barbie(tm) doll.</p>

<p>Second (third) lesson was with a high level guy who knew that
Fermat's Last Theorem was proved 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Most recent lesson was with Kimiko, who I have fantasized about
kissing, but have successfully not given her my contact information.
Even when she gave me a dirty look after I told her today is my last
day.</p>

<p>I have realized something after two years of teaching in Japan.
I'm more often attracted to the low level English speakers
partly|primarily because the verbal communication gap lends itself to
using the language of love instead.</p>

<p>What a great thing to figure out on my last day.</p>

<p class=date>12:00am</p>

<p>My last four lessons were equally lovely.  I had Sachiko for the
first two, during which we spent a fair amount of time looking at the
code for perfect numbers and finished 1.5 lessons worth in the book.
I hope she wasn't feigning when she said she didn't mind the amount
of time spent on the program.</p>

<p>Kozue was next; we arranged to meet on the 21st, during which time
she will give me some advice for getting a camera mounted on TJ
Bike!  I've really enjoyed having lots of lessons with her over my
year at Gaba.</p>

<p>Last was Ruri, who's ruri cute and has a pretty high level grasp
of grammar.  We worked on reported questions.  She could do
everything quite well, but had a bit of trouble when the questions
were present perfect and had to be reported as past perfect.  have
--&gt; had.</p>

<p>She asked me how it felt to be finished with Gaba.  I knew at that
moment I was reallly glad I had gotten rid of whoever it was who had
been put into my last lesson but hadn't chosen me.  Ruri had chosen my
lesson and I felt appreciated by her.  Awesome.  I told her I felt a
bit sad, but also excited to begin a new phase of my life.</p>

<p>Gave her my email address, after making her report the conversation:
<br>"have I given you my email address?"  
<br>* "you asked me if you had given me your email address."
<br>"no you haven't."
<br>* "I said you hadn't."
<br>"it's rob@robnugen.com"
<br>* "you gave it to me."</p>
