<p>Okay; today I'm going to ride TJ Bike to a station name I can't
pronounce, but I know where it is on my map.  But it's my big wall map
of Tokyo; I'll need to bring it with me or photocopy it; my Mapple map
is just not detailed enough to rock around Tokyo's tangle of
streets.</p>

<p class=date>1:20am JST Thursday 17 March 2005</p>

<p>I'm back.  Just got back.</p>

<p>Biking-wise, I rode TJ Bike from Motosumiyoshi, around the
Emporer's island, over to Shinjuku, down past NHK to Shibuya and back
home.</p>

consulted my map a few times (I brought the wall map) to get to where
Highway 1 turns left when it encounters the Emporer's island.  Was
nearly able to get to Jimbocho station, but then realized I was really
close to Korakuen!!  Got well-lost on the way over there, but was
really close when I asked a guy where it was.  Rocked over there and
got this picture of TJ Bike near Thunder Dolphin, hopefully the first
of a long series of TJ Bike pictures.</p>

On the way back, I saw the same guy and his friend; he offered to take
a picture of me, which I gladly accepted.  One really cool thing is
he read 全然大変じゃない on the side of TJ Bike.  Whooo!</p>

<p>Got lost-ish on the way back to Jimbocho, which surprised me; I
must have missed a turn or something.  Got there at 5:45 and texted
Hitomi, who arrived at 6:10.</p>

<p>She escorted me to ICI where I bought a tent (40,000 yen) and a
sleeping bag (15,000 yen) after testing both of them out in the store.
The tent was more than I expected, but it's -*|<em>Gortex</em>|*-
whatever the hell that is, three layers, and supposedly waterproof.
The sleeping bag was less than I expected.</p>

<p>I was able to set up and collapse the tent and sleeping bag by
myself.  I checked all the seams in the tent and sleeping bag and
tried flipping and flopping around in them to see if I'd be able to
sleep with no worries.</p>

<p>Everything seemed cool, and I was excited to have them, so *bang*
I bought them both.</p>

<p>Was happy to find they both fit in one of TJ Bike's bags.
Awesome.</p>

<p>Hitomi joked that it would be her room in my room.</p>

<p>Nearly said bye, but zipped over to Denny's and chowed; I went for
super high calories and told Hitomi how Wende used to not eat all her
ice cream and give the rest to me after I had finished mine, which
became a joke after a while cause she always got flavors I didn't like
and since I had finished mine, I was stuck with her ice cream
aftertaste instead of my own.</p>

<p>Dropped her off at Jimbocho station and then rode to Shinjuku
pretty directly; had to ask for directions only once.  However, I
arrived at the back side of Shinjuku, so I didn't really know how to
get to the main street that I know between Shinjuku and Shibuya.  Got
pretty much lost going to Shibuya, but finally got there (also via the
back (NHK building) side) and rolled slowly through all the crowds
with yamamba radar on, but saw none.</p>

<p>Once I reached Shibuya, I perfectly knew the way home, so I was
surprised when I *didn't* perfectly remember.  After the Suzuki shop I
didn't effortlessly remember where to turn left.  With a bit of time I
found myself choosing one direction which turned out to be right.</p>

<p>Got home, rested in the entry for a bit before pushing TJ Bike up
the stairs.  He was heavy.</p>
