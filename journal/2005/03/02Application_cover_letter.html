Working as an English teacher in Japan, I see how big the world is and
how much potential we have for good. I would like to continue the
volunteer work I did in the United States to help the world become an
even better and safer place to live.

Before coming to Japan, I volunteered weekly in the youth program at
my church. The youth program promotes an atmosphere where everyone,
regardless of creed, race, or religion is allowed to come together,
forming a healthy respectful community based on common sense and
humanitarianism.

To this end, we had conferences around the southwest United States
twelve times per year. At each conference, we participated in an
exciting social action activity. These included planting trees,
picking up litter around neighborhoods, revitalizing neglected
neighborhoods, volunteering in women's shelters, rebuilding homes,
making lunches and delivering them to elderly, collecting canned food
for Food Bank, writing to our political leaders and countless others.

We also invited people to give seminars at our conferences. These
included anti-racism, personal health, ethical treatment of animals,
freedom of speech, distribution of wealth and power, among others.

P To Da B activities remind me of the volunteer work I enjoy doing. I
was ecstatic when I found P To Da B does these things around the
world!

I look forward to helping P To Da B promote this type of work on a
world wide scale. Thank you for selecting me to volunteer on the 49th
Global Voyage aboard P To Da B.
