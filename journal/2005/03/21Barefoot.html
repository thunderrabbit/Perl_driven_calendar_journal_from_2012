<p>Weather is beautiful today so Hitomi and I went to Tamagawa to play
frisbee.  She was terrible at first, but improved quite quickly and
was making accurate tosses to me despite the blustery wind.  It would
change direction without notice, which made for some fun frisbee
throwin'.</p>

<p>I didn't think at first to lose the shoes, but when I started to
get hot from running around, I recognized I had been less sure-footed
with my shoes on than I woulda been with them off.  So they came
off.</p>

<p>It's been several months since Mutsumi and I played frisbee out by
the river; that was the last time I've run around barefootedly.  The
time before that I was in Texas. (basically 2 years ago!!!!!)</p>

<p>There were horizontal bars there (of various heights) and I
wondered if I could do a sole circle....  I could not.  My arms aren't
strong enough right now.  We'll work on that.</p>
