<p>I felt bad for Hitomi having waited for an hour for me to finish
work; she says I told her 10pm as a finish time.  Well, I meant
11.</p>

<p>Last lesson was with Kyoko.  She's one of my favorite students and
she chose me for two lessons today; our last two lessons together.
The first was for her level-up test, and she got 82% on it so I told
her she needed to review.</p>

<p>She took it in stride, and I made some flash cards for her, with
tender loving care.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>

<p>I was hugging on Hitomi to give her warmth.</p>

<p>We got to my room and, though I was checking email, I was hugging
on her and giving her kisses.</p>

<p>In return I got bites on the cheek.  Hard bites that hurt.</p>

<p>What's wrong?</p>

<p>_ ____ ___ _______ ___ _____ ____ __ _______ ___ _ _____ ____ ___
__ ____ _____ ____ ___ _____ __ _____.</p>

<p>I thought about it and recognized she was right.  So I wrote to
Sally and told her that she could not stay in my room while she's
here; it wouldn't be respectful to either woman.</p>

<p>I then recognized that I could no longer sleep with Hitomi; I
haven't been respectful of her even so, so I need to not just use her
for sex.  I told her this and she was like, "okay."</p>

<p><em>wtf?  Don't you even care a little bit?</em>  Apparently
not.</p>

<p>What's even more, she was like, "feel free to hook it up with
Sally [if that's your decision]."</p>

<p>Oh my holy catfish, Batman; this is wack.</p>

<p>Now there are apologies coming my way.  I don't understand this
shit <em>at all.</em></p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I am so adamant about not letting anyone in that I just can't say
how much I am that.  But the apologies are throwing me for a loop.
What a fucked up fucking Fucky McFuckerson.</p>
