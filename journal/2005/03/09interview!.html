Dear Robert Nugen,

Thank you for your interest in the 49th P To Da B cruise.  We are
very happy to invite you to interview for the position of Volunteer
English Teacher on P To Da B 49th Voyage.

Interviews will be held at the Takanadobaba office on March 18th, 19th
and 20th 2005.

Your interview has been scheduled for Sunday March 20th 2005.  Please
be aware that it is very difficult for us to change the day that you
are scheduled for.  We can accommodate only a certain number of
candidates per day.  We ask that you take this into consideration and
be here on the day we have allotted for you.

We will start promptly at 10:00 and should be finished by around 18:00.
Please arrive by 09:50.  It is very important that you come on time.
 

The interview will be conducted in three sections:

1.  An explanation of P To Da B and the GET Program.
2.  A 15-minute individual interview.
3.  We ask that all candidates teach a 10-minute model lesson showing
your own method of teaching.  This should exhibit some of your
personal style and flair in the classroom.  The lesson will be taught
to a group of around eight volunteer staff members and they will all !
be beginners.  Please plan your communicative lessons around one of
the following structures/topics:

    * Present Continuous
    * Shopping
    * Adverbs of Frequency
    * Comparatives
    * Travel

Bear in mind that GET is a communication-based program.
Correspondingly, your model lesson should reflect this philosophy.

In between your model lesson and your interview, you are not required
to be in the office.  There are plenty of places to get lunch or
coffee within the Takanadobaba area.

Please reply by Friday March 11th to confirm your receipt of this
message and include the following in your reply:

1. Which of the above lesson topics you will be teaching 
2. Where you will be coming from on the interview day (we will take
this into consideration when scheduling interviews within the day)

We look forward to hearing from you soon and also meeting you in person!
