<p>Went to Takabakabaka station where P_B office is located.  I
wanted to put the sheets into a big envelope, so I went to a
stationery store to buy one.  The store had packs of 6 available.  I
asked if I could buy just one, expecting them to say no.  I recognized
that I have some at home, and I coulda used one of those, so I felt a
bit dumb for having to buy more.</p>

<p>As expected, they didn't allow me to buy just one.  I bought the
pack, walked toward the door and stopped by their copy machine where I
took one envelope out, left the pack of five envelopes on the copy
machine.</p>

<p><em>They can use them more easily than I can,</em> I reasoned.
They can give them away to the next person who buys a pack of 6 (and
who wants more than 1).  They can insert 1 into the next five packs of
6, making them packs of buy 6 get 1 free.</p>

<p>Instead of leaving the pack on the copy machine, I coulda been
malicious and left the pack of 5 with the other packs of 6.  Like many
Japanese packages, this one was resealable; no one would have been
able to easily tell it had been opened.</p>
