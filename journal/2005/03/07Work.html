<p>It appears that I've got a noshow this lesson.  That suits me; I am
content to write or study, and I don't know who the student is; when I
had her last time, I wrote in my personal notes "did well" According
to the history of the final student I'm scheduled to have today, she
will probably noshow as well.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I got a little sense of what it would be like to ride my bicycle
around Japan, occassionally squeezing between guardrails and light
posts, occassionally zooming between traffic and the curb.  I don't
really get an adrenaline rush from it anymore, or at least I didn't
today.  Or I didn't crave doing it, though I did enjoy zooming down
hills, which often happened while I was in well trafficked areas.
(what areas aren't in Tokyo?)</p>

<p>I have now ridden as far away from Motosumiyoshi as Kawasaki,
Yomiuriland (with Hitomi!  great job to her, cause she was on
Mimibike, which is not a long distance bike!), Yoyogi, Shinagawa,
Higashikanagawa station, and two unnamed places on Tamagawa (Tama
River).  I'm interested in plotting these places on a map.
Automagically.  With GPS or something.  Gotta get data cables (to
connect GPS to my computer), which Hitomi will help me with soon.</p>

<p>And a solar panel to keep my GPS batteries from getting chowed.
Maybe I can zip out to Akihabara on Wednesday before meeting Tomoko;
that would be cool.  I will mount my GPS on the new-to-me handlebar
extension that I got from Andrew.  With a securely mounted thing to
which the GPS can be mounted with a thumb screw.  Awesome.  Solar
panel on a ball socket bracket so it can be pointed at the sun.
Shweet!</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will affix to TJ Bike the stickers Tomoko made for me.
Killa.</p>

<p>Need to replace the back wheel on Mimibike; I bent it (badly) when
I showed Jen what I meant by kickout.  Oops.  That reminds me of the
time I tried to impress Lucy cause I could spin a plate on my finger,
but the plate had just been in soapy water so it was wet and soapy and
immediately fell and broke in the sink.  Impressive.</p>
