<p>Chowed Kaitenzushi in Kawasaki and then went to Cinecitta and to a
photo booth which was more fun than a barrel of monkeys with funny
hats!</p>

<p>Hitomi headed home on Keikyu line and Satoko got of Nambu line at
Kashimada.</p>

<p>We stopped by a grocery store on the way home from Kosugi and got
stuff.</p>

<p>I am just really happy to be close to Sally.  It just feels so
good with her.</p>

<p>Arrived home and found Jen and Katrina arguing pro-life vs Andrew
voting pro-death for the to-feed-or-not-to-feed woman all over
US/world media.  Sally says the courts shouldn't be brought into it;
this is a family issue.  Not a judicial or political one.</p>

<p>I agree more with Andrew and Sally than Jen and Katrina.  Let god
and the woman choose together.</p>
