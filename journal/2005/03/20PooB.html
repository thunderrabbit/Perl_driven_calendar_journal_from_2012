<p class=date>7:16am JST Sunday 20 March 2005</p>

<p>Happy and genki this morning.</p>

<p>I've slept well and woken up naturally.  Every conscious thought
has visualized different scenes, all of which include me being chosen
for P To Da B's global voyage.</p>

<p class=date>4:39pm</p>

<p>My first time alone now; I've been in this group of 7 interviewees,
6 of whom are female.  Chatted mostly with Nicole (from Brisbane) and
Vivian (from LA).  Nicole reminds me of someone whom I can't quite
place.  Maybe that's why she said she thinks she met me before here at
the P_B office.</p>

<p>The first part of the interview was a demo lesson during which I
had a great opening and middle, but my closing was unmoney.  Hadn't
really thought about it and hadn't thought to come up with anything
for the ending.  Oh well.  The others had equally challenging
situations, so it's all good I imagine.</p>

<p>We chowed curry after that and have been chatting as one by one
applicants go back to where the interviews are held and come back to a
chorus of cheers.  Most everyone seems nervous.  Except me. I'm going
last cause I wasn't in a hurry to get out of here; Vivian is in there
now.  Nicole went before she did and said she was unable to answer
"why do you want to go on P_B?" in Japanese.</p>

<p>I guess that's a good reason to go last, especially if they ask me
that question.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Vivian told me about a book _Catfish and Mandala_ about a cat who
rode his bike the length of Vietnam.  That gives me hope that after I
ride around Japan, I'll have enough material for a book.</p>

<p class=date>5:21pm</p>

<p>Interview was money.  I'm really optimistic!  They asked some
questions in Japanese, but not that many.  Where do you live?; how do
you study? (which I answered "what do you study" oops) and when do you
study?</p>

I'll keep my fingers crossed for your interview.  I don't think you missed
our birthday by very much.  Probably since you are almost a day ahead :)

Thanks, mate!
The interview went awesomely well!   I'm really optimistic!   :-)!!!!!

Yeah, basically I was like, "okay, today is the twin's birthday; I
need to remember to email them *tonight*" and I forgot.  Silly future!

But, I'm not far enough in the future to know the outcome of my
interview.  That will be Friday for me; Thursday for you.  That's the
