I was able to set up a cron job to archive my journals every night.
My basic archival technique is to make a tarball of all my journal
entries (5.5 megs compressed (I'm sure this includes pictures)) and mail
them to myself @gmail, @yahoo, and @yahoo.co.jp.</p>

<p>I tried to set up a free account in Germany, but I couldn't get
past their snail address checker.  I tried looking up legitimate
addresses and using them, but that didn't work.</p>

<p>mail.lycos.com only allows 5 MB of space, so I can't use their
server.  hotmail.com claims there is a virus in the tarball, so while
I can save my file there, I'm not allowed to download it.</p>
