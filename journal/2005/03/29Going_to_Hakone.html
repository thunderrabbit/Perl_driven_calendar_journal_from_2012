<p>Hitomi and I fought some on the way to Hakone; I fell asleep on the
train between Hiyoshi and Kikuna.  She felt sad, thinking that I would
have been awake had I been with someone else, and it came out as
anger.  I got really angry and was like fuck you and all these
thoughts like punching out every window on the train as it came to a
halt <em>a la</em> Terminator, or throwing her and myself into the
next oncoming train (to make her talk to me, along the lines of "hey
Rob, there's a train coming").</p>

<p>I didn't do either of these things, but we did spit angry words at
each other on the platform after we each believed the other didn't
wait for us after buying a ticket.</p>

<p>On the train we were facing each other in opposing seats and
like <em>rar</em> back and forth for a bit.  Then we stopped and I
just played an anger driven version of the no-blink game at her for a
bit.</p>

<p>Subsequently, she patted the seat next to her when it became
available, and I offered her some chocolate mushroom shaped candies,
with little crispy bread things for the stems, which I bit off so she
could have a more fully chocolately snack.</p>

<p>We got far better from there, including joking about being
alternately mad and happy with each other while she sat in my lap.</p>
