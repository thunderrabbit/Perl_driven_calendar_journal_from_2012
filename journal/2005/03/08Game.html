<p>Dan and I played a new game today.</p>

<p>One person lies on his/her back, looking directly up at the light
string-pull thing, the other person raises then drops the string
toward the lier's face.  The game: don't flinch.</p>

<p>We each did poorly at first, but got better.  On his last attempt,
Dan mockingly cringed like he was about to be flattened by a sumo
wrestler.</p>

<p>We don't yet have a name for the game.</p>
