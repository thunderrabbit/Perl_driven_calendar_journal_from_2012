<p>Sally and I are hanging out today; Kelly and Jazzy went to meet
Jasmine's dad, and seem to have discovered something exciting, for
they haven't shown up.  Two hours late.</p>

<p class=note>Rob is totally awesome. He is working so hard to
coordinate everything for us. There is good to be seen even in messed
up communication days like one!!! I'm feeling completely restless to
something today which is making my patience wear thin but ROB-U just
fixed everything and we're off to Asakusa!!!
YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
