<p>Tired.</p>

<p>Rode TJ Bike home and met Dan, Kei, Lubo, Jen, and Tets at DWs in
Motosumiyoshi.  We sang, ate, drank, harassed Riki the ramen vendor,
went to karaoke, sang on the way back, got pictures on the train
crossing with a construction guy (Jen's camera) and had fun fun fun
fun.</p>

<p>Dan said we had to sing until we got back and took off our shoes,
so I took off my shoes at started talking to him.  Dan was somehow
funnier when he did the same thing; like he did it randomly while I
had done it obstinately.</p>

<p>We went to the karaoke place on Tsunashima street cause it's
cheaper than the one near our house, but the one near our house has a
better Eminem selection.</p>

<p>I commented to Jen that I really want Sally to meet Dan, and when I
thought about why, I realized it's because I am genkier when I'm
around Dan.  So somewhere in me I find genkiness; therefore I can do
it when she is here and Dan is not.</p>

<p>Dan is on a thin futon in my room and we're chatting a bit; he
said he might come to Tokyo for a weekend (cheap flights) and work at
his old kindergarten class and a private student and be 1000 yen
ahead overall.  Awesome.  And get to see Sally.</p>
