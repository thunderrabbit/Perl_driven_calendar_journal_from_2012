<p class=dream>I was in McDonald's, which advertised they not only
served food, but served smiles as part of their fare.  I wanted to sit
over to the right somewhere (probably a cute girl or something) but
when I received my order, I also got a seating assignment.  Seat
number 54, and the woman said, "it's over here ," gesturing to the
left, "it will be your first empty seat on the right."</p>

<p class=dream>I was a bit upset that I couldn't choose a seat, but I
had to admit it was a cool customer servie add-on for me to not have
to go wandering  around  the restaurant with a tray full of food
looking for a place to eat.</p>

<p class=dream>I was startled to near wakefulness by a squeaky
alarm.  Like a whistle with a fan inside it that makes it go
shhweeeeewww.  I thought it was a strange alarm noise.</p>

<p>Turned out it was my nose.  Dry air made my buggers into a fan
inside my nose or something.</p>
