<p>I came up to my room after saying HI to Shoko and found Dan in my
bed.  He was *just* almost set up for a hilarious joke.  He planned
to be pretend-sleeping and wake up all groggily and say, "hey mate,
what you been up to?" knowing full well that we just finished
watching The Office together.  Funny!!!!</p>
