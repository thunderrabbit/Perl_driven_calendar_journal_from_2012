<p>Really enjoyed my Gaba byebye party; Michael was the definite star
of the show; sometimes I want to be as popular as he seems to be.  By
the end of the night, the people at the next table knew his name.</p>

<p>Really surprised that I was asked to chip in for my own byebye
party.  I was told I didn't have to when I was first asked, but then
Yoshiko asked Hitomi to cover my portion of it.  I'm really no
impressed with them not asking me directly.  Totally inapproriate to
ask Hitomi for my money.</p>
