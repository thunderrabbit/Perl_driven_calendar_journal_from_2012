<p>I've heard from Sally.  She was 100% cool and I'm really relieved
but not surprised.</p>

<p>I downloaded Discovery Channel's _SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES_ via
bittorrent.  It was pretty good, but didn't really tell me anything
new.  Just one bit about how heated gas falling into a black hole
could trigger star formation; I hadn't thought about that before.</p>

<p>Also downloaded some Simpson's and Southpark episodes, but haven't
watched them yet.</p>
