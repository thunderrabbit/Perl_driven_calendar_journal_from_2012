<p>Met Satoko so she could give me a new pocket calendar for 2005.2 -
2006.3.  We chowed ramen and then sat by the small river where I
rescued a tennis ball floating downstream.  I tried to bounce it
against the rocks across the river, but most times it ended up back in
the water.  I rescued it probably 8 times from the stream.</p>

<p>I also removed several other floating things; 3 bags and a ピルクル
carton and a couple of other wrapper type things.</p>
