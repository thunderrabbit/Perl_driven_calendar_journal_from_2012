<p>I've still kicking myself for having sent that email.  Jen agrees
that it was not the easiest email for a person to receive, yet it
could just be that it hasn't been read yet.</p>

<p>Also today I forgot Akiko's lesson and she called me 20 minutes
into it.  I was watching Bad Boys with Andrews and giving Shoko a
shoulder massage.</p>

<p>I charged Akiko 1/2 price.  1500 yen.</p>
