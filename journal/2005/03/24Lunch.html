<p>Had a nice spot of lunch after being handed a set of coupons for a
nearby KFC.  Five batter-fried pressed chicken parts for 180 yen.
Bought a drink at the conveni: Royal Milk Tea (Coca-Cola bottling
company).  Went up a hill to see what I could see and sat on a bench
kinda overlooking a parking garage and intersection.  Lovely.</p>

<p>As I arrived home, I got a call from Jesse and met him for lunch as
well.  He paid, which was a pleasant surprise.  Unfortunately, he may
have to look for a new apartment soon; I wish him well with that.</p>
