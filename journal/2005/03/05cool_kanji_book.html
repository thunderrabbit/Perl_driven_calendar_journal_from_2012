<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Jeff gave me a set of cool kanji-learnin' books, which describe the
origins of the meanings of the kanji, and their stroke order, which
could be quite a boon given the way my brain memorizes things.</p>

<p>Jeff is giving them away cause he is heading out soon.  Outta
Japan, back to Texas.</p>
