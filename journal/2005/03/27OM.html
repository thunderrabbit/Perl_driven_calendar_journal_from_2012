<p>Easy day at work today; the internet was down so we did a bit of
troubleshooting (logged into our ADSL router/modem from this side and
saw that it couldn't authenticate with the PPPoE server) and
determined that since the ISPs customer service is closed on Sundays
(weekends?) we couldn't do anything today.</p>

<p>Rocked on back and here we is.</p>

<p>Talked to Jen a lot on the way back; music and relationships and
internal psychotherapy and where these wacky brain messages come
from.  "So who in your life have you not trusted?"  "Are you
projecting those messages on this situation?"  "How has that
protected you in the past?"</p>

<p>All of these questions helped me get a grip on things.</p>
