<p>Jasmine and her dad showed back up at my room not too much later;
I was super impressed that she made it to Motosumiyoshi alone!</p>

<p>We chowed ramen near the station, waiting for Sallitachi to arrive
back from Kabuki.</p>

<p>JazzyDaddy had to go back and chose not to go to karaoke with us.</p>

<p>Two hours of huge fun at karaoke box in Motosumiyoshi.  We wanted
to extend, but were not allowed cause someone had made a
reservation.</p>

<p>Dropped Kelly off at home and went to karaoke box on Tsunashima
street for three hours!  Utterly incredibly fabulously fun!</p>

<p>I will freely admit I was in seventh heaven sitting on cloud nine
singing karaoke with these beautiful genki women.</p>

<p>The songs are still dancing in my head.  The huge bouncy genki
smile on Hitomi's face was priceless.  More priceless than any AmEx
commercial.</p>

<p>This, for me, is fun.</p>
