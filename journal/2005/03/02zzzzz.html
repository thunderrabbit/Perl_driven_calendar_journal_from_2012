<p>I asked Hitomi not to call me after midnight.</p>

<p>She called me at 11:52pm.</p>

<p>We talked for 15 minutes and then we hung up and she called me
again.  Now, granted I had said "yes" to whatever it was she said when
we hung up the first time.  She took it to mean that she had
permission to call me back.  I turned off my phone and then realized
that I wasn't being direct with her so I turned it back on.  If she
called me again, I would tell her that I didn't want to talk to
her.</p>

<p>She called back, I told her, but I had to ask/tell/plead with her
to get her to say bye.  For some reason I wouldn't just hang up on
her.  What is going on here?</p>

<p>I was really mad so I wrote an email like, "Don't call me anymore.
Don't email my phone anymore.  I don't want to see you anymore," etc.</p>

<p>As I was finishing the email (and realizing I shouldn't send it)
Ikumi knocked on my door; she had printed the P To Da B applications
and stuff that I wrote today.  I had her read my email and we changed
it a lot.  It's not what I would have written (obviously), but
includes a lot of Ikumi's suggestions.</p>

Hitomi

When you are not jealous, I like you.  You are a good person, and I
will miss you when I leave Japan.  But when you are jealous I don't
like to talk to you.

- - - - -

When we talked about what it means to have a real relationship, we said

1) be nice to each other
2) be respectful of each other
3) wasureta

but tonight I did not feel respected by you.  After I say no, please
don't ask the same question again.  It makes me feel sad to tell you
no again.

Even if I don't have time to meet you, I still like you.

Tomorrow I will bring your muffler to Starbucks in Shibuya.  If you
want to meet me, I will give it to you.  We can study in Shibuya if
you would like to.  If you don't want to meet me, I will give it to
you later.  I want to sleep alone tomorrow.

        See you
        - Rob

<p>I'm falling asleep.</p>

<p>Dan is here for the night and will be here tomorrow night, so the
last sentence is almost a lie, but though it's true, I'm still letting
Dan sleep here, but not letting Hitomi do the same.  My room; my
choice.</p>

<p>I showed Dan the train cards I've collected for him since he's been
gone; the pile grew quite substantially while Hitomi and I were in
Sapporo.</p>

<p>Dan and I laughed a lot.  Nice.</p>

<p>Oh, tonight also I hung out with Satoko; we watched Kill Bill uabwmaah.</p>

<p>uabwmaah is a code I used in my journal when I sat under a blanket
with my arm around her, where her = Maggie, back in college days when
I was with Tammy.</p>
