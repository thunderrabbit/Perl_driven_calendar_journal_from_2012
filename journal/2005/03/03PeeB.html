<p>Dropped off the envelope at P_B and they thanked me.  No one
made a fuss that I hadn't mailed it as requested on the application
form.  I assume this means they just don't want faxed copies or
emailed copies.  I can understand that.</p>

<p>Dropped them off the Yuko the (current) coordinator for the next
P_B Global Voyage.</p>

<p>My mood is a bit dampered since they didn't accept me the first
time.  But we'll see about this time.</p>
