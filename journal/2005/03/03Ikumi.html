<p>I met Ikumi for lunch near her office so she could give me the
printouts for my P To Da B application.  Everything looked good but
then I realized they would be better with my name on each page.</p>

<p>So she invited me to make the changes at her office, which I did.
At first tried copying them down to her local machine to make the
changes, but found it easier to ssh to my server.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Ikumi for helping me get it all printed!</p>
