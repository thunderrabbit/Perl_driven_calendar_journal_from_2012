<p>I called Fred on 2speak.com, but the service cut out
occassionally.  2speak is too cheap.</p>

<p>I called him back and he gave me some ideas about my P To Da B
interview.</p>

<p>As a result, I had an email that looked like this:</p>

<pre>
To: support@2speak.com
Subject: poor line quality

I just used the service to call 512-[fred's number]

on the pb we all want to meet people.  so today we are making discussing plans

hand out list of things on schedule

I AM dancing tomorrow at 3.   what are you doing at 5?

we are meeting at 4 tomorrow.

<p>He told me about some wiggidy wack 2 Point Theory that even he
doesn't understand, and I described how I've considered cracking the
system at OM, but haven't found an undetectable / non-risky way to do
it.</p>
