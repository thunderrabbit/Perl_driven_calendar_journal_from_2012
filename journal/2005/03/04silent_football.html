<p>Tonight is Silent Football night at Millenium House!</p>

<p>I wrote a note up on the whiteboard (that "everyone" uses to make
general announcements) and a URL to the rules and invited a few
people to play.</p>

<p>Everyone I spoke with had other things planned.  I guessed that at
least Jen and Olivia would want to play; we had big fun when we played
in the past and when I've mentioned it to Jen during our OM
adventures, she has said, "yeah!" or something similarly
encouraging.</p>

<p>I'm learning something about advertising and starting new
traditions.</p>

<p>No one but me has come to play.</p>

<p>That's okay; I didn't bring an alcoholic beverage, assuming no one
else would play, and if they did, that I never specified it was an
British <em>alcohol</em> drinking game, but just a British drinking
game.</p>

<p>Also it's okay, because I don't really want to play with people who
have to be coerced into playing.  I want the SWD YRUU Rally version of
Silent Football.  But no one else here has been in YRUU.</p>

<p>For this occassion, I'm wearing my YRUU hoodie, black SWD YRUU in
blue writing and YRUU chalice on the back.</p>
