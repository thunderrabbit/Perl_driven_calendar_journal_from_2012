<p>This morning is super beautiful weather; clear sunny just a slight
occassional breeze and the perfect balance of cool air and warm sun to
give an aparent temperature of ? degrees, and it feels great!</p>

<p>TJ Bike is basking in the sun after his sponge bath.  I cleaned the
spots where his stickers will go.  Need to get pics.</p>

<p>Wow!  Looking on the Mapple I got from Andrew, I see how to get to
Yokosuka, which is where Rene lives (US Navy base)..  I'll ask him if
I can crash at his place one night.  Maybe that can be my first
overnight stop.</p>
