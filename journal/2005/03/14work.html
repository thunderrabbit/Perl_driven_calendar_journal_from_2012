<p>I had a double chosen lesson with Haruna, an woman with an unusual
Japanese name that turned out to be the same Haruna who I knew from
Kawasaki Nova!  I guess it's more likely for me to meet the same
person at two different schools than to meet two people named
Haruna.</p>

<p>During our lessons I was explaining the difference between
"lottery" and "lottery ticket."  I made some lottery tickets with some
strips of paper and sold both of them to her for two black beans.
After the lesson I mused these lottery tickets were nearly as valuable
as actual lottery tickets.  I presented them to Jay in this way to
have a laugh and he seemed ready to buy them.</p>

<p>Kerim popped his head over the cube wall to see what kind of
shenanigans we were doing and I said, "I'm trying to explain that they
have no value, but.."</p>

<p>Jay bought them from me for 100 yen each.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I decided to make them a bit more valueable: I wrote my email and
journal addresses on them.</p>

<p>Went to lunch and Kyoko called me!!!!!!  She called to thank me for
the double lesson in which I said she did not pass the test and needed
to review, and I helped her review and made her some flashcards and
all that..  She took the test yesterday and got 92% !!!!!!!!!
Awesome!!!</p>

<p>The rest of my day was at least as nice.  I had Kozue for a chatty
lesson (and noted that she filled in my 9:15pm lesson for tomorrow
(the last one I had available) which is a nice blessing; she's
definitely in the top 5 list of people I'd want to choose me).</p>

<p>The guy from Canon said he was happy to see that he had caught me;
he thought I had already left and was surprised to see my name for his
lesson.</p>

<p>Akiko finished out my day and I wanted to invite her to eat dinner
with Michael and I, but chose to leave it at just giving her my email
address (for the Nth time), but this time also giving her a sample
email that she could send me given that she said she didn't really
know what to say in English in an email.</p>

<p>Also gave her a hand written lottery ticket plus her choice of
Rody horses.</p>

<p>Went to chow with Michael and Seth, who creatively wrote his email
address for me.  Riki happened to be in Kosugi station, so he joined
us.  I accidentally bought a pizza ticket so I gave it to Seth.</p>

<p>I'm tired.  Turns out Riki's first name is actually Nobuo.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
