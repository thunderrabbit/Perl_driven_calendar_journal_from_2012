<p>Today I had Motoko for two lessons.  She looks exactly like my
cousin Barbie!</p>

<p>During my unplanned break after those lessons (I showed her TJ Bike
and) while taking a nap, I heard Jesse call me into the break room
where he and Kelly presented me with a vibrating stuffed Rody!  He's
small, but huge compared to my other Rody teaching assistants (as
described by Ayami yesterday).</p>

<p>We had a bit of a celery eating party until time for the next
lesson, for which I had Kimiko.  She's tall and sexy (but smokes and
has some fake teeth) and she never studies outside Gaba, but we always
have fun together.  Today we worked on "for" in the context of "I did
this for you."  I teach that 'for' generally means 'why'.</p>

<p>Now I'm on my planned break eating my traditional Kebab Farm pita.
Delicious!</p>
