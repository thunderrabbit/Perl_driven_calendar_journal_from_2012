<p>Hitomi called me after the lesson and apologized for having called
me so late last night.  She said she doesn't remember the phone calls
cause she had been drinking so much.</p>

<p>Funny: Hitomi's English was much better while she was drunk, to the
point that I couldn't tell it was her talking; I thought one of her
friends was using her phone.  She laughed a lot when I told her.</p>
