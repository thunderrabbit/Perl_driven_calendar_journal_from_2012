<p>Watched S1M0NE with Hitomi.  She somehow went from genki to so ill
she can't bear to leave my room.  God this is frustrating.</p>

<p>I wrote defeated because that's what I told her I was when I was
like get the fuck out of here and she said no and stayed and I'm like
jesus this is exactly the kind of fighting that I don't want to do;
can't you see that what I want is for you to go away; to give me time
alone?  I'm fucking defeated here in my own room.</p>

<p>I tried twisting the head off the stuffed Rody horse that Jesse and
Kelly got me at Gaba and Hitomi was like, "no, me.  Please kill me,"
meaning please strangle me.  She even put my hands forcibly around her
own neck.</p>

<p>I swear on a stack of all my dead grandmothers ashes and bibles
that is exactly what she said and did.</p>

<p>For the record, I didn't kill her.</p>
