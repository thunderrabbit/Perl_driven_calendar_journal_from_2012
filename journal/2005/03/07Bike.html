<p>TJ Bike and I went to Higashikanagawa today; it took about 1 hour
each direction.  Tsunashima Street (Highway?) goes all the way to
Highway 1, which (at that point) runs basically along the train lines
that are vaguely near the coast (nothing like Highway 1 in
California).</p>

<p>I arrived at that intersection (Tsunashima Highway and Highway 1)
after having climbed and descended a big big hill (I dunno how many
meters tall) and went right (southish) along 1 until I got to
Higashikanagawa (not too far) at Highway 12.</p>

<p>Looking at the map, I saw 12 goes right along Tokyu Toyoko line (my
line) which is basically flat, given that it's a train line.  I
guessed correctly that 12 would be less steep than Tsunashima Highway
had been, and I didn't really want to go up that hill again.  Going
down would have been fine.</p>

<p>Jen called and invited me to lunch with her and Dan just as I had
begun my trip back, which allowed me a pretty good gauge of how long
it took to get back.  Just as I arrived 1 turn from my house, I
caught up with Jen and Dan who were just back from lunch.</p>

<p>Dan had a spin on TJ Bike.</p>
