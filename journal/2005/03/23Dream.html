<p class=dream>The Bad Guys were in a brick house with glass windows
in front, and they were shooting at us in the street and two of my
guys had guns shooting back at them, but I had no gun.  I was using a
telephone pole as a shield and the bad guy shooting at me with a
shotgun, couldn't seem to hit me.  I had climbed the pole a bit and
would keep moving so as to keep myself on the other side of the pole
from him.</p>

<p class=dream>I had an idea to find out how they got started, so I
would know where their weakpoint was.  I went back to the TV and
watched an interview he had given and found out they started by
bribing elementary school substitute teachers for office supplies.
Like they would give the teacher money so they could steal a few
sheets of paper without being caught.</p>

<p class=dream>Wow; that's a pretty long history; I had no idea how
to exploit a weakpoint there, so I decided to be one of their old
substitute teachers by going back in time, and I told them NO; they
could not have any supplies.  I came back to the present and they
were selling flowers in front of their house.  It worked!</p>
