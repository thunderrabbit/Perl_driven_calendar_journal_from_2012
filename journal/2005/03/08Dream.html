<p>My dreams felt so *serious* today, like I shouldn't wake up.  But
there was nothing I could really write; none of the images stuck in
my mind; just the gravity.  Before I got up, I gave a little mental
blessing to let the dream come back when necessary.</p>

<p>"if it's so important, they'll call back."</p>
