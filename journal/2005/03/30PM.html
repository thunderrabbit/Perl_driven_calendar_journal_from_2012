<p>Kelly, Hitomi and I trekked a bit around Hakone; Hitomi had never
been on the steep cable car, nor the big hanging gondola cars.  She
has been to Hakone many times, but always just for hot tub
festivities; never doing the Hakone circuit, so I thought it was neat
I had done something in Japan that she hadn't.</p>

<p>We got to the top of the big gondola place, but had no time to zip
to the gift shop for Kelly to get some Hello Kitty stinky egg and some
raunchy shot glasses that she had seen the previous day.  Too bad.  It
reminded me a bit of the first time I came to Hakone and made it as
far as the same place.</p>

<p>We took a bus back, thinking it would take us all the way to
Odawara.  It would have, had we stayed on it, but it wouldn't have
been free.  We took it as far as Yutopia and got off there to wait for
the next free bus.  Two women were having trouble negotiating the
busses, so I was really glad Hitomi could help them confirm they could
get back to Odawara.  I translated and they totally thanked us and
it was great.</p>

<p>They were trying to get to the Odakyu line in Hakone Yumotso
station by 18:45, but this bus probably won't make it that quickly.
But I assured them we'd be able to get them back to Shinjuku
tonight.</p>
