<p class=dream>Flying a hot air balloon was the plan.  But first we
had to find an appropriate place from which to launch.  For some
reason, no one had done this before, so we weren't sure what to
expect.</p>

<p class=dream>There was some theft or vandalism nearby, and I had to
crawl through the kitchen window to get into the house before going
out the front door to the other side, but janette helped me so that
was no problem.</p>
