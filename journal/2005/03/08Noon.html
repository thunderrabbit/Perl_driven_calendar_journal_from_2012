<p>Went to a local bike shop to buy a new back wheel for Mimibike.
The guy basically said it would be less expensive to buy a new bike
(Mimibike is a US made bike, so he'd have to order new stuff) so we
talked about using a hammer to BHANG the wheel back into shape, but
he settled on just tweaking the spokes' tension to fix it.  The bend
was lateral, not vertical.</p>

<p>The wheel is amazingly straight now!  Only 200 yen; less than the
price of a small lunch.</p>
