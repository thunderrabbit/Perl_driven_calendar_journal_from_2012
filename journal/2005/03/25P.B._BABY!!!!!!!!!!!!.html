<p>I'm on the way to pick up Sally and Kelly and I got a phone call.
<em>Who could that be?</em>  I checked.  "p_bo" on my caller ID.
(they didn't misspell it; I programmed that name for their phone
number)</p>

<p>Basically it's super rude to talk on the phone on a train.  I
don't think I would have answered it for anyone else.</p>

<p>"Moshimoshi"</p>

<p>"Hey Rob this is Audrey from P to the B.  I'm just calling
to .."</p>

<p>By this point my brain was like
<em>"eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" what is the next key word
she is going to say????????????  If I was rejected, she wouldn't call
me, right?  But, maybe she's just being polite; there weren't that
many people to call.</em></p>

<p>" congratulate you.."</p>

<p>OH YES BABY!!!</p>

<p>".. get to go around the world on P To Da B!"</p>

<p>OH YES BABY!!!</p>

<p>"Oh my god Audrey I am totally pumped!  but I'm on a train so I
can't freak out right here, but on the inside I am freakin' out,
dude!"</p>

<p>"blah blah; check your email this weekend; send you a thing; read
it and sign; words words words words words words words"</p>

<p>I'M GONNA BE ON P TO DA B!!!!</p>
