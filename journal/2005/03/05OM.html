<p>Exciting times at the OM today.  I told Jen she should be excited;
"it's like living through an earthquake."  After it, we can be all,
"whooo what a ride!"</p>

<p>Due to a problem with the quintark supply company, OM may have to
suspend operations until he gets another supplier.  There was a
problem with the one company.</p>

<p>Jen seems a bit worried about having to leave Japan due to lack of
a job.  I can understand this; she has more to stay for in Japan than
I do; plus I'm planning to leave soonishly anyway.  But, I don't think
she'll have to leave.</p>
