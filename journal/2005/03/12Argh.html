<p>Why am I such a big mean jerk?  After a nightmare conversation
with Hitomi, which really wasn't a nightmare; I'm just calling it
that, I was all like practicallly challenging people to get in my way
while I walked to the train station.  "get the fuck outta my way you
fuckin piece of fuck"</p>

<p>And I'm like, "God," as in requesting a conversation with Her,
"how do I release this anger in an appropriate way?"</p>

<p>God says, "give it to me."</p>

<p>"Alright you fucking piece of shit God why the hell do I have to
go through all this fucking bullshit, bitch?"</p>

<p>And She says, "no no; that's not 'giving it to me' in the sense I
intended.  You are clutching your anger, trying to throw spears at me
and your earthly companions in order to release your anger." or
something like that.</p>

<p>She continues, "when I say, 'give it to me,' I mean like a gift.
Give me your anger as if giving a loved one a present that you have
taken time to carefully select, and carefully wrap.  Offer it with
love as a gift to me.  It's the <b>love</b> that allows me to ta
release you of the burden of your anger."</p>

<p>"Man, God; you're pretty smart for a girl."</p>

<p>"Haha; Thanks, but I'm not a girl in the sense you mean.  You are
.. amazing.  I invite you to believe that."</p>

<p>"Thanks, God.  Do you mind if I still hate you ?"</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"Man, you're hardcore.  It's not like I actually hate you; it's
just that I hate something, and you're a good scapegoat."</p>

<p>"Many people think the same thing."</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a bit much for you to write in its pure form, but
basically I think people are expecting too much of me but they won't
do anything for themselve to let me help.  People want me to fix all
their problems, but they love their problems and don't actually want
to change.  The world is going through an adolesence; world cultures
are like siblings that have grown too big for their own play areas and
they want to fight over resources indlucing energy, food, land, water,
air, all the natural resources available to you.  The world will take
care of herself; I'm not worried about her.  You guys think you're in
control, but actually just on the edge of quite a shocking era.  You
may see it as devastation; Earth will see it as clensing."</p>

<p>Wow; I wonder if I typed that or if God did.</p>

<p>"Think of it as a combination platter."</p>
