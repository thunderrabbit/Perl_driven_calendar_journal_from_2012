Hello friends and family!

TJ Bike and I are closer to a big adventure; recently I bought a tent
and sleeping bag.  TJ Bike now has stickers that say "TJ Bike" and 
全然大変じゃない.  I have quit my weekday job at Gaba, and changed my visa
status to Visitor.  I will leave Japan sooner than later.

But first, *tomorrow*, I will find out if I have been accepted to ride
P To Da B's 49th Global Voyage!  I have been visualizing myself on
the boat, happily and positively affecting those people I meet, plus
playing Silent Football on a regular basis.  The itinerary is here:

Again, it's not yet confirmed that I'll be on it, but I have quite a
good feeling about my chances.

The same day I find out about P To Da B, Sally and friends will come
to Tokyo for a 10 day visit!  She and her homegirls Kelly and Jasmine
all decided to visit Japan before the next big stages of their lives
(school, family, etc) so it will be like a huge party here!  They are
going to stay in my building, in the room next to mine, for quite a
better rate than staying in a hotel.  We plan to have an all night
karaoke party, visit Hakone, explore places around Tokyo, possibly
Kyoto, maybe Kamakura, have picnics under the lovely Spring cherry
blossoms, and generally have a huge blast!

Last mass email I said I decided to go over and help tsunami-affected
areas.  I looked for organizations that would support such a venture,
but they were generally too expensive; about 80,000 yen or US $800 for
2 weeks (including airfare).  Not exactly an efficient use of
money/resources as far as I can tell.  I may just go over as a tourist
and help their economy that way.

I'm increasing the speed with which I'm getting rid of stuff from my
room; I've shipped a boxful of stuff to Dallas and nearly gotten rid
of some big furniture (chest of drawers and shelves).  Next will be
more books and clothes.

It's strange to look around and see that it's not all that much stuff,
but it *seems* like a lot of stuff.  I'm not sure how that works.

After Sally and the gang leave on April 5th, TJ Bike and I plan to
take some practice trips around Tokyo during April, and then release
my apartment completely and ride around in May.  That will be until I
go around the world on P To Da B, or until I leave Japan by bike, if
I'm feeling up to the challenge.  I may just get tired and come home.

I hope this email finds you and yours happy and well.

      With Love
      - Rob!
