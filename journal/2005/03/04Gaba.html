<p>Only 1 (one) lesson at Gaba today.  At 9:15pm.  The student chose
me, but I don't know yet who it is; from home, I can only see that
I've been chosen, but I can't see who chose me.</p>

<p>Because I'm using the Perl CGI object to make my forms, it was
nearly trivial to add hidden fields and have those be used instead of
cookies.  I didn't change any parameter-retrieving or setting code; I
just added the hidden fields to each form and they are automagically
populated with the like-named cgi variables.  Perl rules.</p>
