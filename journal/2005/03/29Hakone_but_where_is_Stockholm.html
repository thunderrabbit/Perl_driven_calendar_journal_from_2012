<p>Met Jazzy, Kelly, Sally and Satoko at Gora station, after they had
made a complete circuit of the Hakone loop.  I snagged a waypoint at
Gora station on my GPS receiver so I can ride TJ Bike there next month
and then we bussed to a restaurant that was a bit expensive, but quite
delicious!  Huge shrimp the size of long cucumbers and little shrimp
the size of sliced cucumbers and other shrimp the size of cucumbers
sliced the other way.  Plus egg pudding and miso soup and sashimi and
beef cooked over little flaming whatsits and Jasmine looking so cute
on the opposite side of the table from me as she enjoyed sharing food
with everyone around the table.</p>

<p>A woman who looked grandmotherly age approached us and asked if we
spoke English, and we were like "yes" and she looked really relieved.
I jokingly said "how convenient for you," because I had made the
assumption she only knew English.  But it turns out she is from
Stockholm, so she probably knows English and Swedish and I'm showing
my ignorance here cause I don't know what languages are spoken there.
Her accent was very slight; I had assumed she was from the US and knew
only one language. I felt a bit embarassed after I found out her
details (she's traveling alone in Japan, starting from Osaka and now
Hakone and headed for Tokyo) and became really impressed with her
awesomeness.</p>

<p>We directed her to the restaurant we had just left, and then took a
bus to our hotel.  Sally talked about the time we took Salsa lessons
in Austin together and I seem to have no memory of it, which is really
surprising to me, but it's to the point that I'm thinking she must
have me confused with someone else.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.  After chillin' (cookin') in the gender separated hot
tubs, we had a bit of a drinking party in the room.  Kelly was
sleeping but the rest of us downed a bottle of Çß¼ò¡¡¡Ê¤¦¤á¤·¤å¡Ë(sour
plum wine) which was super flavorful like "wow that's sour!!" and
chowed a couple bags of snacky cracker type stuff and some caramel
popcorn.</p>

<p>We explained to Jasmine what most (Sally says all, which is nearly
true, but truely not always true) guys are interested in when they
offer a back massage.  And we said it can be turned around as an
invitation device she can use if she's interested.  ("But don't tell
your dad I said that!!!")</p>

<p>Satoko is already asleep!  zoom</p>

<p>I got some great pics of a new fashion statement in Japanese
American casual wear.</p>

<p>We talked about Nopants Shabu Shabu after the girls told me they
had been talking aobut Commando and Nopan as their new style.</p>

<p>Fun times.</p>
