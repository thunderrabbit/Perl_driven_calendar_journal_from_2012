<p>I closed the window near the beginning; people were too noisy.  I
fell asleep before he said we were at Focus 10, but then came back to
Focus 10 at that time.  However, I didn't maintain that for long and
was asleep as he was describing ways to recall events and stuff.  I
wasn't sure if he said front or back, but I dreamt that I tried to do
what he said, "place your fingers lightly on the front/back of your
head and you will be able to recall anything you have ever
experienced."  I think he says two things; one for the front, and one
for the back.</p>
