<p>Wow!  Knock on the door (harder than I expected for Jasmine nor
Sally) and it was Jasmine's dad!!  Wow!  I'm impressed that he got
here without a map; he just kept asking people for directions to my
address.  Quite a challenge for one who doesn't know Japanese.  But he
can read kanji; he grew up on Hong Kong til he was 19.</p>

<p>Talked to him probably 30 minutes and now he's headed back to the
train station to wait for Jasmine who we think could take another hour
to arrive.  Hope not; we'll see!</p>
