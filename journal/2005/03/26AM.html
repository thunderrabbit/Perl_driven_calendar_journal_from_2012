<p>Made Roboyaki for Hitomi, Sally, Kelly and myself; included a
banana version which Hitomi didn't like, but I liked just fine.  She
said bananas are okay with pancakes, but not in an omlette.  Er,
Roboyaki.</p>

<p>Hung out and chatted and they looked for what they want to do
today.  Kabuki.  Satoko met us at Kosugi station and they are going
to scope the kabuki stuff.  Hitomi headed home and I'm headed to
work, where I plan to coordinate my calendar with the deadlines for
getting ready for P To Da B adventures!!  I still haven't 100% read
the email sent yesterday.  Got the general idea.</p>

<p>This morning walked with Sally and Kelly to a convenience store to
get stamps and knick knacks.  Kelly bought some Pokky for everyone to
share.  (chocolate dipped cookie stick things)</p>
