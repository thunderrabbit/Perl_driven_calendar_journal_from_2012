<p>Today I've been cleaning my computer's hard drive; tossing all the
emails (that have been copied to gmail) and I created a gmail account
just for archiving files.  It's 3% full now.  I can't email files over
10 megabytes though.  Yahoo!BB (broadband) says I can't send files
that big.  It may also be a gmail limit.  I'll see about sending them
via robnugen.com and if that doesn't work, I may try using tar on the
files to cut them up.  But then I just gotta untar them later;
