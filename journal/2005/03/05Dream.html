<p class=dream>I was at Northwoods church for some dinner thing and I
saw Jesse from *my* YRUU days.  I went up to her and was like, "HI"
and gave her a hug.  We were never the best of friends during that
time, but she  was happy to see me and answered all my questions
happily enough.   I gave her a bit of a massage while she was sitting
/ lying on a table and a random youth asked what we were doing and I
said playing silent massageball.  He looked perplexed, but chose not
to ask anything else and wandered off.</p>

<p class=dream>I asked Jesse about her current situation and she said
she was in college and had a mathematics major that she sorta chose by
default.  She didn't really like it, but / because it was a self
guided curriculum, and I tried to show her the bright side; that she
could take anything from pure statistics (which by the way, I
confided, I hate) and in fact I bet she could take pure staticstics in
a subset like, "the statistics of sets that are ony populated with
data points in a certain type of variable distribution."  She agreed,
but still didn't seem too impressed with her choice.  Or, I continued,
she could take something as broad as topology, describing curves and
shapes.</p>

<p class=dream>I looked at some pictures and they had a Nathan Staples
look-a-like contest (I gues that's one of the first proofs that one is
famous: having a look-a-like contest in your likeness) and I couldn't
tell immediately which one was the real Nathan Staples.  Duncan was in
the background of the picture, not trying to look like Nathan Staples
more than he already does, but implying that he was part of the
competition, and losing.</p>

<p class=dream>Jesse turned into kT as she told me a bit more about
her college days.</p>

<p>I can't seem to recall the next bit of dream I had.</p>
