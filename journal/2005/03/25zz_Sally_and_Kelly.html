<p>Oh my gosh it is so amazing to have Sally in town.  I can just
gaze into her eyes for ever.</p>

<p>I wondered if it would be strange to see her again as a little bit
different than the Sally in my mind, but it's perfect.  It's so
relaxed and Sallyrific with her.  Wow.</p>

<p>The airport was super busy so they took 2 hours to get through
customs.  Usually it takes 1 hour.  0.5 hours to get money exchanged.
2.5 hours to get back home.  So I had to keep pushing back the
guesstimated time of arrival, trying to coordinate with Hitomi and
Satoko, who both wanted to meet both Sally and Kelly.  So good to be
next to Sally on the way home!</p>

<p>Walked with Kelly and Hitomi to Tokyu Store while Sally chatted
with Satoko.  Bought food and cheap water and chowed in their room,
talking about naked butt pictures and eating carrots and celery with
peanut butter, and outfits and stuff and more stuff.</p>

<p>Super tired now.</p>

<p>Satoko might stay in their room tonight; there are three futons
because Jasmine will come tomorrow night.</p>
