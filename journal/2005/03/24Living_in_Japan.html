<p>Living in Japan can be like floating through a dream where every
question is answered; every detailed thoughtfully preconsidered so
that when the moment of question comes, there is no question; only an
answer.</p>

<p>Or it can be like fighting some huge unthinking robot of mindless
unstoppable madness, where nothing makes sense because the robot
doesn't care what is appropriate now, only what was deemed probably a
good idea back when it was originally considered.  Everything must be
squeezed into an impossible configuration to match what is allowed,
and it results in a wack bowl of crap.</p>

<p>I often fight the robot.  It's useless.  That fuckin' robot is
*big*.</p>

<p>Today I got my status changed from worker drone to visitor.  My
worker drone status was good until 27 March.  However, that was
cancelled because I came today, which is before 27 March.  The robot
says, "you come in today; your new status starts today."</p>

<p>It does not start when the old status expires.</p>

<p>SO, Japan, you piece of shit robot, I'm leaving you.  Either via
P To Da B on 21 May (and then I'll come right back 100+ days later)
or I'll leave you before my visitor status runs out (secret date).</p>

<p>Oh, and the robot charged me 4000 yen for its services.  Stupid
robot.</p>
