<p class=dream>Long distance riding on TJ Bike; I had passed the
competition going down and then back up a hill and was at the Four
Corners intersection in Tomball and was going to take a break, but a
cute girl was like, "you're doing great!" and that energized me to
keep going.  I yelled back over my shoulder "thanks for helping me!"
or something and she asked me how much further I had to go, and I was
like, "to [zip code] 77019" (back home) and told her it would take
about 45 minutes.</p>

<p class=dream>I suddenly came to a river about which I had apparently
forgotten, but remembered I had crossed it before.  A train tressel
went across the river, but it was a bit different this time; a new
section was being built and I could conceivably go all the way across,
but I would have to ride about 1 mile on a 1 foot wide section of
black rubber pads on which the rails would be set.  I didn't think I'd
be able to do that at night, plus there was a helicopter flying around
looking for people trespassing on the tracks.</p>

<p class=dream>I had taken my pants off to ride TJ Bike through the
river directly, but then the helicopter came, so I hid within the
structure of the bridge supports.  I knew they were shining a bright
light, but I couldn't see it reflecting off my clothes so I knew they
couldn't, but they were homing right in on me; they must also be using
infra red, I decided.</p>

<p class=dream>Next thing I know, I had been taken before my dad who
was like, "if you wanna eat a rat for a hundred dollars, that's your
business, but swimming nekkid across the river is inappropriate."</p>

<p class=dream>And one of the helicopter guys was like, "man I wish
 more people wanted to pay $100 for a rat; I'd be rich."</p>

<p class=dream>I was angry that he thought my dad meant it literally.
I barked at him like, "Don't you think that if I want to eat a rat, I
would just go get one from the pet store?  Doesn't it make more sense
that I had planned to ride my bike across the river?  I have been
across this river several times before, before you guys were ever
asked to protect your silly tressel; I don't need it, nor you to help
me cross that river."</p>

<p class=dream>I totally shut him down and then left that scene and
saw a movie poster advertising "Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry and
James Bond as 007, the early years: 25 years of tough guy filmmaking."
I thought my dad my like a copy of that movie.</p>
