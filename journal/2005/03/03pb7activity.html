We will have a talent show(or a portion of a 'normal' talent show) in which the participantslearn their performance entirely on P To Da B.  Example: I can't evenstrum a guitar.  I'll try to play a song.</p></li><li><p>Two posters go up somewhere:  One is a list of names of peopleand a talent they are willing to teach.  The other is a list of namesof people and a talent they would like to learn.  These posters remainup for a few days to collect names and talents.</p></li><li><p>People are encouraged to read the posters and look for talentsthey would like to learn or can teach.  People find their partners andspend a few weeks learning / teaching the talent.</p></li><li><p>Teach A Talent Show night!!  Everyone performs, possibly well,possibly badly, but *always* to a huge chorus of cheers for theircourage and great show of self improvement!</p></li></ol></pre>
