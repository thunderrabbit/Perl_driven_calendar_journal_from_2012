<p>Tonight Hitomi and I went to see _Six Characters in Search of a
Hamlet_, featuring Jimmy Da Magnet as Laertes.</p>

<p>I could barely understand the dialogue.</p>

<p>I said HI to Ellie (sp) who played the doll in A Doll's House; her
character was super frightening at the end of that performance, and I
didn't say HI to her then.  But I told her how it affected me.  She
seemed to appreciate the compliment.  I like her voice, and I don't
know if I would say that had I not seen the play; as I listened to her
talking, I felt the play ringing around in my head.  Mmmmmmm.
nice.</p>

<p>Tonight Hitomi and I worked on my example schedule that I'll use
tomorrow at my P To Da B interview.  I'm really happy with it and
excited about the interview.  Money.</p>
