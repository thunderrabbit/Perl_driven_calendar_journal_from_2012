<p>Just had dinner with Rika and an Iraqi woman.  The short version is
that they are not safe walking around in their own city.  The standing
army (not Saddam's personal army) was relieved of duty when the
Americans came in, so the security of Iraq was instantly jeapordized.
The borders became insecure so anyone who hates the US could come in
and fuck shit up.  The number of US troops sent over was lower than
some guy said we would need.  Total chaos in Iraq now.  How do we
restore security?  She said that's all the Iraqis want now - just to
be able to walk around and feel safe.</p>

<p>How can I support the correction of this situation?</p>
