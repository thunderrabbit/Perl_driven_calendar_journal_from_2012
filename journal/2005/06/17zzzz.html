<p>After Silent Football, Hitomi asked if I could burn movies to CD
for her.  It turned into movies from three different cards plus her
camera.  Fortunately it all fit on one CD.  Annoying, though.</p>

<p>I can only imagine it wasn't very comfortable for her either; I
was not in a talkative mood - just falling asleep as I waited for
each set of movies to be copied.</p>

<p>Natalie mentioned to Katt that she (Natalie) had intended to
come watch stars with me tonight, but never made it.  Katt called
my room, woke up Shinji just as I was walking in.  I was like "hello?"
and Katt put Natalie on.  Cool.  I zipped down to their room to
chat and get a much needed hug.</p>
