<p>We are now near the pyramids.  They are big.  If I look at they
pyramids, I'm like, "they're not that big." but if I look at the
people along the bottom of the pyramid, I'm like, "woah." cause I
realize each rock is big.  About 4 feet tall.</p>

<p>Holy fuck that is a lot of rocks.</p>

<p>I'm standing with Francois.</p>

<p>In Egypt.</p>

<p>On (the first step of) the great pyramid.</p>

<p>People are milling around like little ants.  I look up, and the
stones just disappear into the distance.</p>

/></a> There is an opening that is not exactly an old school opening,
with steps carved into each stone to allow non-climbing people to
ascend.  The hole was blown into the side of the pyramid in like the
1800s by some guy with dynamite and a desire to enter.</p>

hole, providing lighting.</p>

<p>As usual, we don't have enough time; we gotta be on the bus in 4
minutes.  I am wearing a skirt/dress thing that I bought in Port
Said, so I can't jump around like a monkey.  But I made it back to
the bus on time.</p>

<p>We are headed to see the pyramids from a parking lot with camels
available for rides and photos.</p>

<p>Now we are headed to the Sphinx.</p>

really hard to climb down.  I would still like to try.  We are at
lunch now, being fed a feast and a half.  We all agreed, though: we
would prefer to be a bit hungry and have had more time at they
pyramids.  Maybe just have a little lunch instead of a feast.</p>

pyramids.</p>
