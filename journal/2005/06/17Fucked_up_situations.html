<p>Oh dear.  I have just learned that my Silent Football game has been
translated to "silent soccer" (in Japanese).. That has got to
change.</p>

<p>We are nearly to the Suez Canal.  I have given up on transcribing
while on the boat.  There just won't ever be time.</p>

<p>During lunch, Natalie and Greg were talking about their visit to
the Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan; they went there for that tour.
It sounds like it's just a totally fucked situation for them (the
refugees).</p>

<p>They didn't have much time to let the experience sink in.</p>

<p>While they were floating around in the Dead Sea, there was an
explosion near the wall being built in the area.</p>

<p>I'm not upset that I didn't go, though I am sure it would have been
amazing..  I know I will be doing helpful things after this voyage.</p>

<p>(But I would like to go to the Dead Sea sometime.)</p>
