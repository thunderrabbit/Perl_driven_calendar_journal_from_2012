<p>I'm working on my lesson for tomorrow.  Been playing around a lot
and not doing lessons in advance.  I'm thankfully using a lesson that
Natalie created on the 47th voyage.  It was in the old format so I'm
updating it to the new format.  Definitely helpful for other teachers
if they want to use the lesson as well.  Specifically Natalie, I'm
guessing.</p>

<p>But I still need to create a new lesson for my other class.  They
want to talk about writing in diary, letter or email.</p>

<p>I updated Natalie's lesson and wrote her a note of thanks, plus a
request for a copy of the song "Imagine" by John Lennon.  I need to
get some posterboard for my other class so they can write hopes and
dreams.</p>

<p>We came to a new timezone tonight.  AST is for Mecca, Saudi
Arabia.  Cool!</p>

<p>I've come upon a new way to do journal entries, mixing using my
computer and using tape.  This technique intends to solve the problem
of knowing the correct timezone/date/day for when the events
occurred, and keeping everything in order.</p>

<p>I'll make just 1 file per day, adding to it via transcription or
realtime typing, and just keep the timestamps in order in the file.
Later I can split the file into logical sections.  This also allows me
to write about the same event both ways and not have confused
filenames.</p>
