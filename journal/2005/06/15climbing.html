filename, I think it's in Wadi Rum, not Petra.</p>

two sets of rocks and several people took pictures of me and Francois,
my newly named rabbit.  I enjoyed the sudden attention, but was a bit
worried that I would get in trouble, either by simply being where I
wasn't supposed to be, by being barefoot and having someone complain,
or by having someone climb after me and get hurt in the process.</p>

<p>Fortunately, none of these things happened, and I actually climbed
to a point remote enough that I couldn't see the end of the line for
all the others on the tour.</p>

<p>On the way down, I tried to go quickly so people wouldn't think I
was a wuss, but I had to be careful so I wouldn't end up falling and
breaking my skull.</p>

<p>Careful descent worked, but then on the very (very!) last step I
kinda miscalculated and hit the bottom of my foot in a painful way.
But... no blood: no problem.</p>

<p>I staged two photos of Francois doing his own rock climb.</p>

entertaining.  He seemed to know answers to every question we asked
him.</p>
