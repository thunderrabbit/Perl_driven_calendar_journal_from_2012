secretly I kinda gave up on learning all their names.  I couldn't keep
the syllables straight in my head.  I know four names, well five.  I
know three of the guys and two of the girls names.  I just ran briefly
off the boat to give them my yellow name cards.</p>

<p>I saw one of the guys at the door and was like, "can you give these
to the Sri Lankan students?" cause they were standing right there at
the bottom of the gangplank.  He was like, "aw yeah, go ahead.."</p>

<p>"What?" ... "kickass!!" so I got to run off the boat *after* the
absolute deadline for getting on the boat!  Whooooo!!</p>

<p>We are leaving the Gulf of Aqaba.  Lots of screams and "we love
you!" and "I can't believe we are leaving!!"  People are in huge
spirits, chattering at hundreds of meters per second.  Now Jasna,
Eilat, and Niveen are on the boat.  Jasna has been on the boat many
times; she is the person in charge of coordinating meetings and stuff
for Eilat and Niveen.  Eilat is from Israel and Niveen is from
Palestine.</p>
