<p>I'm in a bummed mood; Singapore might be my worst port.  It has to
do with me wanting free internet access and use my computer which has
a wussy battery.</p>

<p>The good things: I was smart enough to write my Rob Update on
McDonald's computer (gmail) before using my computer to send it.</p>

<p>Then I tried to set up my Rob Update Sender so I can use it in
insecure internet cafes.  It stores the password as a cookie and I was
working on a way to erase that cookie when my computer died.  Now, I
can't use Rob Update Sender <em>at all</em>, because I was in the
middle of mucking with the code when my computer died.</p>

<p>I bought a case of water: 12 X 1.5 liters.  I look forward to
goodnesses like Silent Football and Sri Lanka.  I visualize myself
getting this taken care of today, on the boat no problem.</p>

<p>Oh crap!  I haven't mailed anything yet.</p>

<p>I was able to go get some groceries (chocolate and root beer and
laundry detergent).  I'm going to go to McDonald's now and get my
code.</p>

<p>Awesome!  I'm in a lovely happy mood; I got mail!  I got a
postcard from Kellie; it says 2 of 4 postcards sent.  So, I don't
know if I've missed one or if the other ones are in different ports
but, I got one, so it's awesome, and I'm really happy about it.</p>

<p>Also, I was able to get my thing corrected, (thanks to the
incredible awesomeness of Perl!), it was easy to do.  The crap that I
did was a real kludge, but Perl saved my butt and gave me an easy way
to make it work, so that's good.</p>
