<p>I just finished my sixth lesson for Cheerful Dancing Fellows.  We
haven't really used our class name yet.  This was a lesson for which I
had not prepared any worksheets.  It was a worthless worksheet I had
cut-n-pasted from so we didn't use it.  We practiced using gestures to
do things they will need to do tomorrow.  Like how to order coffee
-vs- tea in a restaurant, etc, because tomorrow is All Silent/English
day so they will be required to use only gestures in the morning and
then only English or gestures to do what they need to do in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>Aki made an awesome card for Shunji.  I'm really impressed.  It
includes his picture and spaces for all of us to write notes to
him.</p>
