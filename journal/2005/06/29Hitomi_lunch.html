<p>Just had lunch with Hitomi cause she happened to be near me while I
was headed to lunch.  Parts of the conversation triggered painful
memories of conversations from our past where no communication is
happening except "what?"  "what?"  "what?"  "what?"</p>

<p>She said, "どうでした？" which I would translate as "how was it?"
but I didn't know what she was actually asking about.</p>

<p>I said, "I understand 'how was it?' but I don't know what 'it'
is."</p>

<p>She replied, "I didn't say 'it.'"</p>

<p><em>Oh god.  This is going to kill me</em>, but ultimately we got
past it.  It turns out she had been asking me about my trip in 1997 in
Costa Rica.  I, for some reason, thought she had been asking about
something on PB.</p>

<p>In the end, I was teaching her some ASL alphabet.  I'd like to
relearn slash learn ASL a bit more.</p>
