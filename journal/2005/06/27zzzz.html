<p>I am basically ready for classes tomorrow and am taking the
laminating maching back to the GET office on 6th floor.  I have just
set up two good things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(for everyone) the schedule of open classes with everyone's
name so we can write down our plan and what happened.</p></li>

<li><p>I set up the attendance sheet for my classes and gave a copy to
Natalie.  I told her she'd have to pay me 15 minutes of kinky sex.
She goes, "five minutes."  "10 minutes."  "okay, deal."</p></li>
</ol>
