<p class=dream>I was in a large hallway, and giving a piggyback ride
to a girl to climb down a thing next to my room.  I was outside my
room, facing my room and using it as leverage to lower myself down
with her on my back.  The first time she had tried to get on my back
at the wrong location; the first time I told her to get on, she was
like, "no" and then then she tried to get on in an all fucked up way
and I was like, "no get on like this" and I was lowering her down and
bracing myself and going down a little hill with little steps like d d
d d d d d and we were going down a long hallway and I had a blue laser
light pointer and I was shining it on the ground and tried to shine
down the hallway but I couldn't see that far away.  There were some
science experiments and some audio science experiments so I was
shining the light on a rotating record inside this enclosed thing and
the guy who was monitoring it was like, "oh, please don't do that,"
and I was like, "ah shit; I'm sorry; I thought it was just audio and
wouldn't be affected," but I didn't get a response from him, but oh
well.  I walked back down the thing and Josh from PB arrived,
and his beard was really long and I ran up to him and was like, "Josh!
Josh! Guess what?  I can tell you and Joel apart!" but he didn't
respond to me, and I was like, "oh (sigh) oh well" and I went back to
the main food area to get food, but he had just taken it away,
although to be clear, he had asked me first; he was like, "hey Rob; do
you want anything else? I'm about to take it away," and I was like,
"naw; I'm okay" because I was busy at that moment and I didn't want to
make him wait.  So I went in there and there was no food, but I knew
Coral, who I had helped; she was like, "ooo ooo you're so strong blah
blah blah" and I put her hand on my calf and I flexed it for her and
she was like, "wow" and then my alarm went off.</p>
