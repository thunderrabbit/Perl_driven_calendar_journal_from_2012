of our room.  The rooms were arranged in stairstep rows as if we were
hampsters living in stairs of a staircase.  Therefore it was trivial
to go up the stairs between the rooms and walk onto the roof of the
room below.  I sat with Rie and a couple of others on the edge of the
roof, watching the sunset playing shadows on the tall rock
backdrop.</p>

<p>Though the pebbles on the roof were not exactly feather soft, we
took a nap up there for a bit.</p>
