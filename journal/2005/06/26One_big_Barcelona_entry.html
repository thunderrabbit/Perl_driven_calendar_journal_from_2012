Near the port, there are some cool stacked chrome arches that look
sorta like soap bubbles and would be really cool to climb.  At the
port end of La Rambla, the famous kiosk/shopping/tourist street in
Barcelona, there is a rather large statue with rather large lions that
are definitely climbable.</p>

walked down La Rambla, where these wildly costumed performers did
their shows for money.  We saw a mean devil, a nice butterfly, two
soldiers, Arc du Triomf, Picasso Museum, bus to Sagrada Familia,
climbed 340+ steps (I wanted to race), got lost trying to go to Park
Gruell via bus; ended up taking the train, I walked up those steps but
didn't count them, then headed back on the train.  Found Allison and
Dave in La Rambla and chatted with them, gave a postcard to Lawrence
(easy for me to remember his name cause he looks like Lawrence
Fishburn (glasses and bald head)) from the 47th cruise who came to
meet up with rock star repeaters, because I need it to get to Norway
before we do: I'm sending it to Niveen.  Back on the boat with 5
minutes to spare.</p>

<p>Notable things in Barcelona:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They allow bicycles in the train station!  Whoooo!!</p></li>

<li><p>There is a KFC right across the street from Sagrada Familia,
which is interesting only because I heard there was a KFC across from
the pyramids in Giza.  I didn't see a KFC there, but I see one
here.</p></li>

<li><p>We saw a guy running with a bag and a slightly overweight
security guard chasing him.   I think I could have caught him, but I
chose not to get involved with local issues.</p>

<p>I would only want to get the bag back, but not punish the
thief.</p></li>

Hello from Barcelona, Spain!

I actually haven't been off the boat yet, but I'm saving a bit of time
by writing before I get to the internet cafe (hoping I can find one
on this Sunday *and* national holiday).

Been super busy over the past couple of days getting my curriculum
prepared for classes; it's due at noon tomorrow.  I'm a good 1/2 way
finished, especially if the computer didn't eat my document last
night when it locked up.

Last night I talked at length with Niveen, a woman from Palestine.  I
asked her questions to get my bearings straight in the situation with
Israeli occupation of her country.  I had never really understood it
more than some people fighting over the rights to an area.

She spent at least an hour telling me some of the history of the
nightmare situation that she lives in every day.  Consistent
checkpoints and flying checkpoints (randomly set up) with Israeli
soldiers require her to wait for 45 minutes or an hour in lines (on
foot or in car) and stop and answer questions.

Her version of the story is basically the Israelis (Jews displaced
during the German Holocaust) have (with American support) invaded her
country and taken her rights with the intent of ultimately erasing the
Palestinian identity.  Palestinians are forced to live in camps
separated from each other around Jerusalem.

She is nearly forced to disown her Palestinian identity because, for
example, she can hardly travel in Egypt if she says she's from
Palestine.  (( The more detailed story: she was born in Jordan so she
has a Jordanian passport, but isn't allowed to get a Palestinian
passport and doesn't want an Israeli passport.  When she presented her
Jordanian passport in Egypt but said she was Palestinian, they nearly
took her passport from her. ))

She wants to be Palestinian.  I imagine they want consistency in
passports' written and passport holders' spoken identities.

She said I really should come to see for myself what it's like.

In any case, it sounds like a nightmare.

So now I'm wondering about living in Palestine after PB.
