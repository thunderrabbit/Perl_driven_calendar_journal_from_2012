<p class=date>8:10am ICT Sunday 05 June 2005 (day before Sri Lanka)</p>

<p>I am an hour early; I hadn't set the time back on my phone; I'm
thinking I'll just stay up cause I am awake.</p>

<p class=note>2:20pm JST Monday 05 September 2005:  right now I am
listening to Tape 5 and am wondering what day all this happened on.
At this point in the cruise I wasn't careful to say the date each
time I made a new entry.  That's surprising because I think I woulda
learned that lessson after I learned it when I had my hand written
diary with days on end without the full time date month and year.</p>

<p class=note>Right now I'm listening to a huge blank gap in the tape where
apparently it was in Play mode and just wasted tape riding around in
my pocket.  The good thing: it's easy to transcribe.</p>

<p class=note>I've got my blue schedule book that Natalie made for us
(I laminated mine (and most teachers did theirs as well)) so I can use
that to compare with the tape to see if I can tell when things
happened.</p>
