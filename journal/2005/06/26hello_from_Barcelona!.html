<p><b>hello from Barcelona!</b></p>

<pre>Hey Guys!

I´m in Barcelona, where the / is a - and the ' is a ´, and the USB thing doesn´t
work so I have to write from scratch.

Thanks to everyone for emails;  I read them all but don´t have time to reply... 
but keep saying HI!

In Italy I couldn´t find an internet cafe at all, but went to Taormina (in Scicily)
where we climbed maybe 300 meters to the top of a hill with lovely view of the
crystal clear blue water and hundreds of shops from which we could buy ice cream!!!
And postcards and clothes and food, but most importantly that delicious Italian ice
cream which they call gelati...  So smooth and lovely and delicioso!

I´ve been hanging out with Niveen from Palestine, and she told me the nightmare
story of living in an occupied area.   That´s what I wrote about on my USB
keychain...  My version of her story is the Israeli´s came in with US support and
just seized land and houses and now she must go through checkpoints every day just
to go to work or school or anywhere interesting.   I´m wondering about living there
and getting my own perspective and seeing what I can learn/do/help etc.

Today we have been walking down La Rambla, a famous shop filled boulevard, like a
quaint version of Champs Elysees in France.  Will be looking for stamps to send
postcards next.

On the boat, we´ve been busy preparing our curriculums for the second term; they
are due tomorrow at noon!  I am about 1/2 done with mine.   Most nights I get about
4 hours of sleep (approximately 1 sleep cycle, so it´s short but not too
disruptive) due to staying up late chattering with various people slash dancing
slash working on teaching materials.

Haven´t seen any exotic aquatic wildlife.  No whales, dolphins, jellyfish, giant
squid... but we have eaten fish for dinner on many nights.

Was supposed to meet Caesar today in Barcelona, but didn´t hear from him.  I hope
you´re well, mate!  Don´t sweat it; we´ll have big fun in this lovely city!

Slavena and Kremena, the cute near-twin Bulgarian women got off the boat in Greece.
I didn´t get to say bye to them, but I imagine they´re enjoying some well deserved
time off.

Speaking of time off, I gotta get off the computer.

    Be well!
    Love Love
     - Rob!
