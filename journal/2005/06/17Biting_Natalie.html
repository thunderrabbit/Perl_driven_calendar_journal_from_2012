<p>Good thing today is a holiday cause I am tired and I haven't really
slept yet.  Natalie massaged my hand and I fell asleep.  The rest of
the guys were debating gun control as I fell asleep.  Natalie
suggested that a group of us go to the front deck to watch the stars.
Natalie and Greg were out there when I arrived after brushing my
teeth.  I gave them a "lecture" of sorts about where shooting stars
come from (comet dust).  Greg left and then Natalie and I fell asleep.
I tried to kiss her a bit, but I was too tired.  Good times.</p>
