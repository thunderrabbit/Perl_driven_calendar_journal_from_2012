<p>Tired as fuck.  People are upstairs about to party it up, plus
tomorrow is a holiday, so I'm going to go play with them instead of
write on my computer now.  And become more tired.  Cause that's what
PB is all about.  Fuckin' havin' fun.  It's money.  Tons of
fun.  You should come.</p>

<p>I'd rather be with people I can talk to instead of drunk people,
but, it turns out that a drunk Yuuka is a cuddly Yuuka, so it's funny
to see her in that state.  Nothing happened, but for Japanese, even
just a hug is a lot.</p>

<p>We left late, I think.  We're having an "I'm sorry party" for some
reason.  Shawn is recording people on video to see how we liked the
ports.  I told him Sri Lanka and Vietnam were both super money.  As
of now, I won't make a decision between which one I liked best; they
were both over-the-top super cool.</p>
