<p>I don't think it's related to the rocking, but I've definitely got
diarreah. Not sure what it could be.  I'm pretty sure it's not from
the rocking, but I have a guess that's a bit more related from not
drinking enough water yesterday.</p>

<p class=date>7:40pm</p>

<p>During the GET meeting I got up and went to the restroom and
diarreahed and then vomitted.  Got up, cleaned up, rinsed my mouth
out, then went back to the meeting.</p>

<p>Now I'm in the infirmary waiting waiting waiting waiting.</p>

<p class=date>8:07pm</p>

<p>They didn't know I was waiting.  I'm feeling chills and chillin'
on the doctor's toilet before I'm stuck on the bed for an hour while
I get an infusion.  The doctor looked in my throat and said he didn't
think I was dehydrated.</p>

<p class=date>9:25pm</p>

<p>I'm squinty eyed, looking at the clock.  I've just had my infusion.
The first time she tried to insert the needle, it was like fucking
KILLER pain like I don't know where the hell she was trying to stab me
but it felt like right into muscle and everything.  I was like, "oh
god why does it hurt so bad?" and she readjusted and when she tried
again it was no worries.  I wonder how much it will bruise.</p>

<p>She said I can sleep for an hour so I'm like yay.  Good night.</p>

<p>Nurse should be back soon.  I just had another diarreah festival and
nearly passed out again.  There's this process that happens, like I
get really really woozy and the sweat just starts to pour out, just
gushing out.  I wonder why it happens, but it's pretty interesting to
feel my skin activating like that.</p>

<p class=date>11:45pm</p>

<p>My energy seems pretty low.  Nurse Yuki let me sleep for another
hour.  I told her I diarreahed again, and she was like, "poor thing"
but I wasn't telling her to get attention; I was telling her to help
give her information about my status.  She said I should have someone
cover my classes tomorrow.  I don't intend to do that, but I do
intend to go to bed now.</p>
