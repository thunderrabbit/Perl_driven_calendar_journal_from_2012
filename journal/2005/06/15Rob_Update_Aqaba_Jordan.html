<pre>Hey Everyone!

Until 1 hour ago, I could not say I had ever been served a whole fish.

We are in Aqaba, Jordan, and I have 10 minutes before zipping back to the bus for
our adventure to Petra, the ancient site that was the setting of climatic ending of
the Indiana Jones adventures!  I'm super excited to see this site; it's been on my
list of places to see for a long time.

Been super busy on the boat, super fun times all around!

I recently won a costume contest: yellow and red vertical striped clown pants, blue
police jacket, and monkey ears!

Mostly it was me jumping around like a monkey that did it (I hope).  I was picking
and eating imaginary lice from peoples' heads, and squatting on various benches and
decks eating real food with my hands.   Hilariously fun.  I wanna be a monkey at
every costume party from now on.

Did The Alphabet Game with a beatbox backup; it was really awesome and better than
I thought it could be!

The Red Sea is deep beautiful blue.  Not red.  Around the Gulf of Aqaba is like
Palm Springs, California: lots of palm trees and dry bright air.  Buildings here
are old, worn and busy.  Property prices are going up up up, if you're in the
market.  It's beautiful here, and good diving.

Gotta zoom!

    Love Love Love
