<p>We are rolling into a harbour now, with a gondola that goes over
the bay.  That's kick ass.  I'm transferring the contents of my
camera to my computer, and I'm in my room which is kinda weak
compared to being up on top taking pictures, but my camera battery is
low; I need to buy another battery.  I just added that to my list.</p>
