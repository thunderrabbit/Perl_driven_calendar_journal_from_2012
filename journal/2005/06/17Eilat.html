<p>I'm at the meet-the-guests, where we will hear about/from Niveen
and Eilat.</p>

<p>Eilat said something like, "I got involved in social action work
when I was about 14.  Many Isrelis find it easy to ignore it and not
be involved, but once you get involved, it's impossible to quit -
like a disease that takes up the rest of your life."</p>
