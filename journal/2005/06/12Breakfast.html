<p class=date>11:20am GST Sunday 12 June 2005</p>

<p>We're going to be in another timezone tonight!  A good thing this
morning: I was like, "damn G how can it be 8:50am already???" after my
phone alarm went off a few times.  Turns out I hadn't set its clock
back; I had an extra hour!</p>

<p>I was up by the time I realized it so I got to have a pretty chill
breakfast with Nic (Nicole) from Brisbane, and who was on my original
interview day on that Sunday back in March.</p>

<p>Taught Greg's class after that, working on introducing friends and
then worked on a troublesome grammar ("she likes to shop" or "she
likes shopping" (not "she likes to shopping")) by leaving the class
and identifying what people were doing.</p>

<p>She is walking; she likes walking; she likes to walk.</p>

<p>He is carrying plates; he likes carrying plates; he likes to carry plates.</p>

<p>Like dat.</p>

<p>In Greg's class: Su, Hirobumi, Yasuko, and Keiko.</p>

<p>I had met Keiko on the morning I felt ill.  I didn't remember
until after she mentioned it.</p>
