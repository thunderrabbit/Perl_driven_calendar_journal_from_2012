<p>I didn't walk around Cairo at all.  Just uploaded a blob of
entries that I may or may not try to chop up later.  We will be back
in Port Said in a couple or three hours.  Bye, Cairo!</p>

<p>There are guys in white suits with pistol grip machine guns.  I
just waved Francois at them.</p>

<p>Cairo traffic is messed up, but an effictive way to get away from
people I don't want to talk to.  One cat kept trying to be all, "hey,
my friend where are you from?"  and I felt kinda uneasy so I stepped
suddenly across the street using the traffic to block him from
following me further.</p>

<p>It seems that everyone we see has been or knows someone who has
been anywhere we name as our home.</p>

<p>"Hello, my friend!  Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"I am from, uh, Fastidia."</p>

<p>"I was in Fastidia for two weeks last year, studying geometry.  I
lived just north of Fastidia."</p>

<p>"Really?  You lived in the acid wasteland? That's amazing!"</p>

<p>I'm back, safely in my room.  It's kindof a trick to get past the
vendors who all have something for sale for a dollar.  I wanna go
back out and get some ice cream or food, and maybe some souvenirs.</p>

<p>Speaking of ice cream, I saw this on the way home. <a
