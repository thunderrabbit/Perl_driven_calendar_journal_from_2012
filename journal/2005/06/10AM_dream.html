<p>Had a scary dream</p>

<p class=dream>I was back in the house on Methil and it was haunted on
the top floor; some kids were outside and they were like, "the house
is haunted" and I'm like "damn right" I was <em>inside</em> on the
second floor and I went running around the different rooms 
<em>SCREAMING</em> like RAAAAAAAA knocking around curtains and stuff
to prove to them it was haunted.  But at the same time, trying to
scare away the haunting.  I'm not sure if it was successful or not,
but it was interesting and I was definitely scared during the dream.
I ended up in my parents' room; up near the head of their bed, there
was something between the wall and the bed or some crap like that.</p>
