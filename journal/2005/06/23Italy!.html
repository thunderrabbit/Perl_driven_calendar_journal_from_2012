Jasna, Audrey, Natalie, Allison are out and about in the markets.</p>

<p>The markets were *crazy*... All variety of fish, with my favorite
being long eel-like chrome silver fish.  Totallllly amazing.</p>

<p>I've been talking to her plenty; she has a lot to say, but maybe
just doesn't have a chance to let it out.  I'm really inspired (?)
impassioned (?) by her stories.  But who knows how long that passion
will last.</p>

<p>Haha - Niveen asked for some sugar and the guy pulled a sugar
packet out of his pants pocket.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh I just took a picture of Niveen with a Niveen
look-a-like right behind her.</p>
