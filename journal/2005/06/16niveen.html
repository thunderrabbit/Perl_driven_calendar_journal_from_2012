her for a couple hours about everything.</p>

<p>Niveen lives in a nightmare situation every day.  Having to avoid
guards and checkpoints on her way to school.</p>

<p>We talked about religion and god and everything.  She said she
would love to believe what I believe about god.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in Sunshine Bar with Natalie, Brandt, Matt, Adriana,
Angie, Shawn, Petra, and two women I've not met before.  And me.  They
are partaking of a water pipe.  It's not actually *smoke* but it's
close enough that I am choosing not to join them.  I had one puff, and
it wasn't all *that* good.</p>
