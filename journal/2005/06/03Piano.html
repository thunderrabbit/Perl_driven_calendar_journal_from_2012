<p>I haven't found a plug I can use, which kinda sucks, but I have
found a piano I can listen to.</p>

She's doing really beautifully; I wonder if I can sneak a picture of
her without her stopping.  Nice.  There are a couple of old guys
chillin' in the seats for the concert.</p>

<p>I got two pictures of her from the back, and I went up to the front
to see if I could get pics that way without bugging her but then I saw
the old guys and thought it might bug <em>them</em>, so I chose not to
take the pic.</p>
