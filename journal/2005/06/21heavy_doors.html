<p>Some big big big big ass doors are being put on the ship, though
the ship is moving a bit due the waves, the door on the ship is lower
than the dock by a few feet, and the door sections are super heavy
and super big.</p>

<p>I took some pictures and got in trouble with some guy for
intruding on their personal space.</p>
