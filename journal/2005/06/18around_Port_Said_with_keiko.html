rail and ended up talking to her for quite a while.  I told her I had
been nearly married, and we played the "well, how old do you think *I*
am?"  game.  We are nearly the same age (minus
three-months-plus-four-days) and live(d) in nearly the same
neighborhood in Japan.  Within walking distance of one another's
houses.  And she visited her friend in Dallas for three weeks before
hopping onboard PB.</p>

<p>We ate dinner in Topaz Dining, and then got ready to head out.
Because Audrey had told us that Egypt is the only country in the world
where she has been flat scared, and we should put our money in
separate pockets, etc etc, I went for a bit of extra cash protection.
I put my wallet in my shorts pocket and then put pants on over my
shorts.  So basically no one could pick my pocket.  I trusted we
wouldn't get mugged.</p>

<p>We walked around Port Said, and I was in guard dog mode with the
meanest mean look I could muster.  We had to ignore all the guys in
the street saying, "hey my friend" and "only one dollar" and "where
are you going?" and "have a seat here, my friend" and "where are you
from?  Really?  My brother lives there!" etc etc.  Keiko actually
pulled me away from one guy from whom I was trying to politely detach
myself.</p>

<p>I had six postcards I wanted to mail, so I asked a guy who was all,
"take a taxi to blah blah blah" etc and I was like, "Dude; the stamps
are on the cards; there has *got* to be a mailbox closer than a taxi
ride away.."  He was like, "oh, just walk down the street."</p>

number of cell phone shops, equal number of dress shops, and a few
other shops like perfume and music and ice cream, but saw no mailbox.
We found an official looking building with a well-lighted foyer and a
few guys behind the front desk.  I went in there and showed them my
stamped postcards.  He looked up slowly, like Lurch from Addams
Family, and slowly looked through each card.  He didn't even look at
me, but just gestured the cards over his shoulder, and gave them back
to me.</p>

<p>Wow.  I thought that was about the funniest thing I could ever have
seen!  I walked back to Keiko on the sidewalk and was like, "check
this out" and we moved away from the windows so he couldn't see us.  I
mocked what he had done.  She looked over my shoulder and he was right
behind me!  EEeeek!!  I felt so bad for having been caught, and hoped
hope hoped he didn't think anything of it.  He walked us about 1/2
block to the mailbox on the corner.  I probably would not have seen it
without his help.  Profusely thanked him and bowed and mailed my six
postcards.</p>

<p>Now we are overlooking the canal in Port Said.  There is music
blasting from loudspeakers.  Not drum-n-bass, but a harmony of voices
being played far too loudly for the loudspeakers.  Keiko guesses it's
something for prayer.</p>

<p>Now there are a couple of guys speaking / reading something.</p>
