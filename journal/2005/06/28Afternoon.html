<p>This was the first day of classes.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a cool ass amusement park ride.  I was
alternately on the ride / watching the ride / watching the ride on TV.
There was an enormous water slide with dudes coming down the slide and
rubber rafts everywhere.  Some could fly and tried to sabotage the
other rafts.  People were not getting hurt, per se, no broken
bones..   They were going down mountains and up mountains and all
this crazy stuff.  I was racing some guys and trying to slide down
faster than them using some cheats like grabbing legs and pull myself
down, etc.</p>

<p>I just got trounced in GO by my teacher who has played for 25
years.  I was like, "I haven't played in 5 years and I have never
played a human."  He didn't teach me shit, just was like, "that's a
bad move," when I tried to make moves.  I don't even remember all the
basics.  I can't even tell if stones are dead or alive.  These are
pretty basic issues that must be resolved before I can play.</p>
