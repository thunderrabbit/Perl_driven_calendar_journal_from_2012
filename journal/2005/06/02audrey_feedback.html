<p>Just got feeback from Audrey about my curriculum, which I have not
finished.  I judge she is not the type of person for whom I can do a
'makeup' (as in my men's group), and I'm not sorry to Audrey; she had
said get it done by 10 am and I didn't get it done.  I don't know who
I'm out of integrity with.  I guess the students, but, I dunno.</p>
