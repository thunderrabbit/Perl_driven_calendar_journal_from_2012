<p>Back on the bus; too tired to mail postcards.  Hopefully we will
find another place later.</p>

<p>We arrived at our little ice cream stopover place on the way back
to the ship.  There was a truck accident; a truck was turned over in
the middle of the highway.  Hitomi said the tire was still spinning
when she saw it, so that shit just happened.  Holy crap.</p>
