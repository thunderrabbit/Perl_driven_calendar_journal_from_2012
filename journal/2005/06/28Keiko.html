<p>At 9pm I met Keiko back at Sports Bar.  She taught me a bit of
salsa, but I soon busted back into Rob's crazy dance.  I was there
about 30 minutes doing crazy dance and then scooted out, but not
after inviting her to meet me at a lecture in Broadway, about fighting
over oil.  He said production will peak in 2006.</p>

<p>Brandt showed up in Broadway as well, and gave me my blue schedule
thing which I had left somewhere, so I was really thankful for that.
To the girls, he was like, "hey let's go to the movie on top deck,"
but I had forgotten about the movie. (Whale Rider, about a maori girl
who became a chief.) This time I arranged it so Keiko sat in front of
me and I gave her a massage.  She scooted over after a bit and since
Riko had sat in front of Keiko, she was now in front of me.  I scooted
Riko back and massaged her about 45 minutes during the movie.  She
massaged my calves and I massaged her back.  It was cold so I had
towels over my shoulders.  Keiko asked me if something was wrong with
Brandt, who got up and walked away.  I had a good guess as to why *I*
would have been upset, but I didn't suggest that as an option.</p>
