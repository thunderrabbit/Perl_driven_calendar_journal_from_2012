<p>I've been sick lately: diarreah mostly.  Yesterday I vomited once
and passed out nearly 2 times.  One of the times I didn't pass out
because I crumpled to the toilet, allowing blood to my brain.  The
first time I did the same, but passed out anyway.</p>

<p>I took a nap between my classes and then after my second class
before Study With, where I am now.  No one has come in to study with
me though Mimo answered, "Rob" to a question just as I was coming up
the stairs.  I guessed the question was, "who's doing Study With?"
because they were waiting right outside GET Street.</p>

<p>Definitions:</p>

<p>GET: Global English/Espanol Training</p>

<p>GET Street: a set of ten numbered rooms in one hallway which have
been specifially allocated for GET classes</p>

<p>Study With: a time/place during which students can study and ask
any random questions.</p>
