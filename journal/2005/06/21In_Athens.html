<p>I just bought eight 90 minutes TDK tapes for 6 Euros.</p>

<p>While waiting near the train station, I saw two medium sized dogs
running loose in the street.  They barkingly ran into the train
station proper, barked a while, then ran back out.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>Inside the station in Piraeus, I think:</p>

<p>Been walking alone around Athens (I think), which seems pretty darn
close to Piraeus, where TSS The Topaz floats waiting for midnight to
arrive.</p>

I had been barefootedly rock-hopping.  We got pictures taken
together.</p>

<p>I wore no shoes while walking around Acropolis, and therefore was
disallowed entry to one of the sites.  I neither felt like arguing nor
relenting when the woman said I would have to wear shoes before I
could enter.  The building cannot be described as "inside" nor sterile
nor anything else I can imagine would require shoes.  I simply put
away my wallet and left.</p>

<p>I don't feel like putting on shoes.</p>

shop next to which I had previously seen a turtle) sedated my grumpy
brain while I wrote a few post cards.  I headed back to the train
station where I had begun my walking around the area and bought some
snacks for tonight's After Greece Chow Party: cheese and crackers,
cherries and peaches.</p>

<p>Fell asleep on the train back to Piraeus station and noted how the
ticketing system require a great deal of honesty among the passengers,
who can easily bypass or ignore the gates.</p>

<p>On the way back to the docks, I felt tempted a few times to buy a
porn magazine.  Visible at every kiosk along the street, they proudly
flashed boobs for all to see.  I resisted the urge to buy.</p>

<p>However, I did not resist buying a Vanilla Cream Frappacino from
Starbucks, and I enjoyed slurping it when I met Chiko along the way
back, when she asked for some assistance in crossing the street.  The
lack of crosswalks seems to have thrown a spin on her good
sensibilities.  We crossed the street without a crosswalk and without
incident.</p>

<p>The vanilla cream on top of the Frappacino tasted thick and
delicious.</p>

<p>The dock entry area appears to have closed or suffered a blackout,
for darkness trumps lighting, and the vendors' wares no longer beckon
outside the shops.  I felt thankful to purchase one more stamp from
the closing shop.</p>

<p>I saw two guys ticketing parked cars.  One would write the ticket,
and the other would remove the license plates.  I imagine this method
is quite cheap for the city and quite effective!</p>
