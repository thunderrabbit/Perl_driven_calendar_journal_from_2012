<p class=date>7:52am ICT Saturday 04 June 2005</p>

<p>I had one sleep cycle last night and dreamt I was super tan but
parts of my skin were still light, like I had been creased and I got
tan on the parts that had been visible and the wrinkled parts were
white so I was like a tiger.</p>

<p>Yesterday we raised $1500 by selling books and Lely Heyslip said
she would match the money we raised, so in the last 20 minutes in the
sale we doubled our amount from like $700 to $1500 * 2.  She was like,
"write a goal on the whiteboard" cause she is an expert fundraiser.
and she just energized the group like zoooom; I am like wow wow wow
wow..  I was inspired; I put in 3000 yen ($30 ish).  I'm tired.
Gotta get up and get goin'.  Peace out.</p>

<p>Also last night I dreamt I kissed one of the girls.  Carissa or
Maryann maybe.</p>

<p class=date>8:17am</p>

<p>It seems like we've been on the ship for a month.  I just now
realized it's been only 14 days.</p>

<p class=date>8:55am</p>

<p>This is the morning I learned how to say "set yer clock forward"
and "set yer clock back" and "the clocks are set forward" and "the
clocks are set back." すすむ and stuff.</p>

<p>今夜は戻るだから私は戻す予定です。時々進む。その時私は進める予定です。</p>

<p class=date>9:21am</p>

<p>Oh shit I almost forgot my class!  This is only the second day of
classes, but I was transcribing my journal.  This term, my first class
(Class Q) starts at 9:30.</p>

<p class=dream>11:25am</p>

<p>The second day of my first class was great.  We're gettin' into a
genki groove and it's fun...  I was trying to get a schedule set up
and needed to do a transform on some cells in a table like this:</p>

<pre>
A B C          A 1
1 2 3    --->  B 2
               C 3
</pre>

<p>So I was trying to read the Japanese commands on this computer (not
*my* computer, but the computer in my room (9) on GET Street) to see
how to do that.  Brandt suggested I go get his computer from his room
and we can compare menu systems.  He gave me his keys and I ran down
to his room, found his computer but when I went to lock the door,
realized I had lost his keys.</p>

<p>(they had fallen into his bag)</p>

<p class=date>5:18pm</p>

<p>Just had <b>SO Much Fun</b> in the Sri Lankan preparation
workshop.  I taught 20 some-odd people </p>

<pre>
Joy to the World
To all the boys and girls
Joy o the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
pick-it-up! pick-it-up!
Yum yum bumblebee bumblebee tuna
I love bumblebee bumblebee tuna
Yum yum bumblebee bumblebee tuna
Love a sandwich made with bumblebee
two three four
</pre>

<p>That last part I didn't teach them, but I taught them Joy to the
World and sign language for all the words in the song, some of which
is actual American Sign Language.  It was tons of fun and I'm super
pumped and they did really well, and people were like, "wow!  I can't
believe you taught them so fast!" and I was like, ".... thanks!"</p>

<p class=date>GET Meeting 6pm</p>

<p>Lely was bummed that she had a lot of extra money left over after
Sri Lanka.  Shawn goes, "yeah, but at least it's really pretty money."
and when she said she only had 1 hour off the ship, Shawn goes, "but
it was a really fun hour [with all that money to spend]."</p>

<p>Shawn is so funny!</p>

<p>Kamau just did an incredible rap/poem called Lone Gunman and I am
bummed that I didn't record it.  Just mesmerizing, but he has it on
CD and everyone wants to buy a copy.  1000 yen each.  I will give him
20 CDs and 20,000 yen and he will burn copies for us.</p>

<p class=note>(as of 10:43am CDT Tuesday 02 August 2005 (as I'm typing
this) only 1 person (Nicole) (and maybe one other teacher) has paid
me.  I have the CDs in my safe and am contemplating selling them at my
own little kiosk on the ship.)</p>

<p>We get an extra hour tonight.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This tape (Tape 4) includes Lely Heyslip telling us her vision of
a Peace University where people can attend at very little cost so
long as they help teach peace in some corner of the world.</p>

<p>We discussed ways to maintain contact with pb (GET) activists
around the world, allowing help to be activated as needed in various
places.</p>

<p>Lely's son Alan thanked us for our efforts and invited us to come
to Vietnam at any time.  Basically I can extend this invitation to
anyone who would like an amazing experience, who wants to help raise
money and help build schools, orphanages, etc.</p>

<p>Look for Global Village Foundation online to find ways to contact
her.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>It's so incredibly exciting to just have my life open up to so
many options!  I wanna grow up to be as cool as Lely.</p>

<p>Kris suggests starting a "don't know what the fuck to do after
PB club" cause there's just so much to do, and talk about
what we've found, etc.</p>

<p>Lely says she needs a grant writer (my UH friend Sara or my brother
Fred, perhaps).</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Natalie has little mirrors on her dress, and she's like, "yeah I
can check out my nostrils!"</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p class=date>10pm or so</p>

<p>Lely's five goals include Health, Education, Revolving Loans,
Relief, Clean Water</p>

<p>We chatted (mostly listened to Lely tell us) about Global Village
Foundation and her visions for helping the world.  I look forward to
helping, and on a different level, I look forward to doing my own
thing, but I have a guess that there's more for me to learn, yet.</p>

<p>Lely is saying 15 or 20 million dollars is not really big money;
she just needs to find someone who has it.</p>

<p>Maryann was asking if non-violence must be associated with a
religion.  I'm thinking it does not, but people who have positive
spiritual connection, possibly through a religion may be more apt to
be non-violent.</p>
