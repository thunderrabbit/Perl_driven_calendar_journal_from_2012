<p>I now know how to lock a door.</p>

<p>Get a heavy steel door.  Close the door and tighten large wing nuts
along its perimeter to hold it closed.  Then, get five strong men to
use a chain/wench/pulley system to heave a huge heavy steel post into
slots on the top and bottom of the door.</p>

<p>Do that again with another equally huge post in the center of the
door.</p>

<p>Then do it again with a third equally huge post on the other side
of the door.</p>

<p>Spin threaded bolts (even bigger wingnuts) through the posts to
press against the door, using about 60 ft/pounds on each one.  Three
per post (9 altogether).</p>

<p>The door should stay closed.</p>
