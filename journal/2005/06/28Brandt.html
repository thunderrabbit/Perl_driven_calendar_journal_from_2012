<p>It seems I am always competing with Brandt.  I see in him the
things I don't like in myself.  It just pisses me off when he gets
the girls that I had been going for.  His Japanese is way way better
than mine.  I met Keiko in Port Said and we danced in the street and
it was tons of fun.  Now he is in the belly dancing workshop with
Riko and Keiko, et. al.</p>

<p>During Audrey's Thai massage workshop, it was Brandt, Keiko, me,
and some guy all in a row-ish.  When it was time to find a partner,
Brandt was all, "well, I don't mind being your partner, Keiko" or
something and I was like <em>release release release</em> and went
straight for the 40 year old guy, who massaged me and hit every bone
in my body in a painful way.  Argh.  but it's all good.</p>
