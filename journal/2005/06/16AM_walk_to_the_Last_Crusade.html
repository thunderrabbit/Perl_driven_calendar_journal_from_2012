<p>We are now walking from our hotel in Petra: the Crown Plaza Resort,
Petra to the facade that has been made famous by the third Indiana
Jones movie.  I am walking barefoot, cause I like it that way.</p>

<p>We are in a refuge of sorts, like a national park.</p>

<p>I seem to have misplaced my frisbee.</p>

<p>Found it; well the restaurant manager found it and had it behind
the register.  I had remembered correctly where I had left it.</p>
