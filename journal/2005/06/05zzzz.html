<p>We will arrive in Sri Lanka in a little less then 7 hours.  I was
just listening to Kin play piano again, this time in Winjammer.  She
has been playing for 20 years (and she is 23 years old).  Pretty
awesome.</p>

<p>Ah shit; I have to do one more thing tonight. copy pictures.</p>

<p class=date>12:18am</p>

<p>I have decided not to copy the pictures tonight; I'll sleep for 6
or 7 hours and then do it in the morning.  That way my brain will be
on and I won't miss anyone who may still add pictures at 1am.</p>

<p>Tonight Kin taught me some vocabulary.  She obviously has little
teaching practice, but she taught me ¤æ¤ì¤ë the verb that means the
ship is tilting.</p>
