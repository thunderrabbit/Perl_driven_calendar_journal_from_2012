<p class=date>am AST Tuesday 21 June 2005</p>

<p>I'm completely fucked in my brain, and I cannot even bear to get
off the boat.  I'm just so upset about Hitomi.  fuck fuck fuck fuck.
I can't bear to be with anyone and I am just like
GGRRRRRrrrrrrrrrr.</p>

<p>But through all this madness, I can still feel myself wanting to
flirt with Keiko, and it's just a fucking nightmare.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Brandt was flirting with Keiko, and I felt a bit
jealous, but I checked that and let it go.</p>

<p>I wanna get my shit sorted and relaxed so I can concentrate on
teaching instead of being all fuckin' distraught over this fucking
Hitomi situation.  Fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p>Further, I don't know what I'm going to do in Japan.  I know I've
got to escape the city, but what about my $900 bicycle?</p>

<p>I wonder if I can go to Athens and let the wisdom of the ancient
city wash over me.  I'll go do that.</p>
