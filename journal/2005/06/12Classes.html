<p>Greg's classes were cool.  Only four students in the first class
and five in the other, including supercute Mariko whose face I enjoy
viewing.</p>

<p>I worked on designing an evaluation for my students and came upon a
pretty good solution: two die rolls to determine one of six
"questions" from one of six categories.  They answer/perform the
question correctly and get a point, then mark that question as
complete.</p>

<p>I still need to print images of signs that I've taken on the
ship.  Actually need to take one more picture.</p>
