<p>Have just been sharing stories with Katt; it was nice to tell
stories about Fred and a lot of the entertaining things that we've
done.  Adventures in Dallas exploring houses and fun stuff.</p>

<p>Katt has a good laugh.  It was nice to make her laugh.</p>

<p>Just before she was to be presented at a welcome to Japan ceremony,
she had a million hickies on her neck and had to cover up with turtle
necks and stuff though it was hot in July.</p>
