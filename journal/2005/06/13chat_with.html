<p>The chat with Dr Waqar and Fadi was good.  I recorded about 1 hour
of it on video, but my battery conked out and there was not a working
electrical outlet that I could find.</p>

<p>Only a bit of the discussion didn't get recorded.</p>

<p>Chatted with Katt and Kim; told them a bit about The Bead Lady
skits that Fred, Peter, Katie and I would do.  Rolled down to find
someone with whom to study Japanese and remembered I have Chat With
at 4:30.  Holy shit I nearly forgot!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I just talked to Hiroshi, who says he likes American culture
because Americans seem to think for themselves.  Hiroshi's hairstyle
reminds me of Koizumi's.</p>

<p>I just explained the plot of Pulp Fiction to the next student.
That was a bit tricky, cause I was doing it after not having seen the
movie in a long time, and doing it in chronological order, not movie
order, plus I was having to tone down my English into simpler grammar
and less colorful vocabulary.</p>

<p>I just talked to Kazumi for about 30 minutes.  When she asked how
old I was, she began to cry; her soon who would be my age died of
Leukemia at age 16 or so.  I held her hands across the table for a bit
while stoically got her Japanese composure back.  I gave her my email
address.  This was one moment I will always remember, and ensures I
will remember Kazumi for a long time to come.  She said she had come
on PB looking for a new life, and I told her what seemed
appropriate.  She talked about life cycles 12 star signs and 5 cycles,
so at age 60, she is back to the beginning of her cycle.  She seemed
really inspired at the end of our chat.  I could only say "awesome,"
not "you're welcome," cause I didn't really do anything.  I'm thankful
to have been present while she found something for herself.</p>
