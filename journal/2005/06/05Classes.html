<p class=date>11:10am ICT Sunday 05 June 2005 (day before Sri Lanka)</p>

<p>We had a good class today.  It's interesting; the All Girls' class
has gelled less than the mixed class.  I'm not sure if it's because
they are all girls or if it's cause they are all girls and I am not,
or what's the dealio. I have a brainwave that says it's not whoohoo!
because I put them together hoping it would be whoohoo! and that they
would bond having lots to discuss, but they just don't want to
discuss anything in front of me.</p>

<p>I trust they will gel and be awesome today.</p>

<p class=date>11:42am</p>

<p>My computer is importing digital video tape that I took in Vietnam.
I haven't done laundry in a while so I'm free balling.  Heh heh.</p>

<p>I saw Hitomi a little while ago at the tour desk, but she didn't
seem to see me.  It's happened before that I've seen her but she
didn't see me, but after that occassion she was like, "aw no, I wasn't
mad.." I dunno if it's the same this time, but that's the way it
was.</p>

<p>The last transaction we had included me telling her how to do her
journal online, and that I was going to do a tour and therefore not
scuba diving with her in Jamaica, so she may be mad about that.  I
dunno.</p>

<p class=date>12:22pm</p>

<p>8 minutes to class; I gotta run down to my room.  Just had lunch
with Greg and Kanae, and for a moment, Mariko (with braces(!)), and I
was like ":-)".. Man.</p>

<p>I'm in my room to get my computer, which is still not done
downloading digital video from my camcorder.  7.3 gigs free.  It has
several clips to download.</p>

<p class=date>4:12pm</p>

<p>Class was great.  Everytime they wouldn't say anything, I'd be
all, "so what do you guys think?"</p>

<p>And they would be all,</p>

<pre>















</pre>

<p>And I was like, "you guys have *got* to say *something*" so I told
them to stand up and sing, "if you're happy and you know it, clap your
hands..." and we did the whole song with three versus (clap yer hands;
stomp yer feet; say hooray!), and I was like, "okay, anytime you guys
won't say anything, we are going to stand up and sing this song."</p>

<p>And *TWICE* I made us all stand up and sang the song cause they are
just like, [silent]</p>

<p>After class I went to salsa lesson with Adriana and Natalie up on
Sunshine Bar.  Now I'm about to go to the pool.</p>

<p>Some of the video clips from Vietnam are cool.</p>

<p class=note>(but as of this transcription process (5 September 2005)
I don't know which ones nor where they are nor if I even have them any
more)</p>
