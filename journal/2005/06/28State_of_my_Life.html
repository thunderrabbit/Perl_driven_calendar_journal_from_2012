<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>I figure that I need to have these more often, as time is
strangely affected while onboard.</p></li>

<li><p>Since the last SoML, we have been to Athens, Greece; Catania,
Italy; and Barcelona, Spain.</p></li>

<li><p>I called my dad from Barcelona cause Allison gave me the rest
of her unused phonecard and his number is the only one I have
memorized.</p>

<p>I was really glad to talk to him and he seemed really happy to hear
from me.  Sometimes he seems too busy to talk, but not this time.
yay!</p></li>

<li><p>I've been chatting a lot with Niveen, who has become like a
little sister to me.  I've listened to her stories and given some
feedback / advice on handling some issues that have come up.</p>

<p>She has told me some of the history of Palestine and the Israeli
occupation of her country, plus given me a list of Arabic characters
so I can start studying a new crazy language.</p></li>

<li><p>Part of me is considering moving to Palestine so I can see
what's going on there.</p></li>

<li><p>We've played a few games of Silent Football, but they are not
much like the games we played in YRUU.  We don't have the Senor
Schlong Spud rule for addressing the dictator, and the native Japanese
speakers have been too timid to try really expanding all sorts of
convoluted tattles.</p>

<p>We have played with wormholes though, especially tonight when we
only had three players not including Dictator.</p>

<p>Niveen is the only non-Japanese player who has played.  Audrey came
to watch today, but there was only one other player at that time so I
just told Audrey a brief version of the rules.</p></li>

<li><p>I couldn't find Francois today.  I remember having him at
Niveen's lecture, but not after that.</p></li>

<li><p>Last night I was basically up all night finishing my
curriculum.  Got it done 4 hours before it was due.  Tomorrow starts
Term 2 of classes.</p></li>
