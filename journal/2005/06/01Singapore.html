<p>I'm not really impressed with Singapore trains.  I may be spoiled
on Tokyo trains...  The trains in Singapore are okay if one is not
used to trains, but !) the driver of the train I was on didn't stop in
one continuous deceleration @) the ticket vending machines can't
dispense ample change (I couldn't use $10 to buy a $2.40 ticket,
whereas in Tokyo I can use 10,000 yen note to buy a 110 yen ticket;
that's 2 orders of magnitude different!  Here in Singapore it's not
even 1/2 an order of magnitude.) and 3) there were only 3 ticket
vending machines and one of them was broken.  I had to wait
unnecessarily long to do my little transaction, then found out I had
to go to a different window to get change for my bill.</p>

<p>I've come back to Harbour Front station to use the internet in
McDonald's here.  I haven't checked to see if it's available here;
didn't see any signs; I'll check now.</p>

<p>Argh.  This is frustrating: either the internet is not free or it
requires a login, but in either case this fucked up useless flash
animation is pissing me off.</p>
