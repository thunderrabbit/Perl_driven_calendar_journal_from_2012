<p>And soon it's time for Silent Football!!!!</p>

<p class=date>1:06am AST Saturday 18 June 2005</p>

<p>Silent Football was fun-ish, though it got a bit boring for me
cause they kept missing errors slash not tattling on errors due to
lack of language knowledge.  I wrote on the whiteboard some different
sentences they could use for tattling, but it wasn't enough.  or
something.</p>

<p>Hitomi, Kin, Manako and Emiko came.  And Francois, the rabbit.</p>

<p>Some teachers said they would come after the Soul Flower concert,
but none arrived.</p>
