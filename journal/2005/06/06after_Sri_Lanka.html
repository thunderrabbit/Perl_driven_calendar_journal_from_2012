<p>Sri Lanka was fun.</p>

<p>After writing my mass email update, Dave and I took a 3-wheeler to
the Galle Face Hotel (or something like that) where we took some pics
and chilled on a checkerboard tile patio out in the lovely breeze
with a view of the setting sun.</p>

the sea wall where we could order some foodage.  Big chowtime and
super duper incredible funtime with Josh, , Katt, Kris, Carissa,
Brandt, Audrey, Dave, Yuuka, Kim, and a Sri Lankan woman whose name I
didn't hear.  Most of them got happily drunk.  We sang variants of Joy
to the World, gave cheers to ourselves for another successful day
around the world, a blessing to Dave's newborn niece Chantelle (sp),
and generally partied it up.</p>

<p>During the meal I got to sit next to Josh, who seemed to just bask
in relief and good vibes of the complete success of the day; we GET
teachers who were there saw it as flawless and can easily argue that
all the participants did as well.  Everyone smiled and beamed during
the day despite the rain; big fun was had by all.</p>

<p>In the end, we cut it realllly close gettting back to the boat,
including some bit of a financial fiasco getting US dollars and Sri
Lankan rupees combined to make 19,000 rupees for the meal (about
US$150).  We had to show a passport in order to pay for the food,
which I think is pretty damn ridiculous; none of us had one save Josh,
who has been in Sri Lanka for a week setting up this single day event.
Fortunately, he didn't have to be back at the ship at a certain time,
so when we accidentally left his passport behind, he had very little
stress going back to pick it up.</p>

<p>Just three minutes before leaving time, I realized I could benefit
by letting Josh know I had been unable to find my camel pack and
gilligan hat that I had left on the bus (with the blessing of those in
charge).  I ran downstairs and wrote a note in a frantic rush and then
ran back upstairs to throw it to him.  I realize now I could have
included a blessing to him for a successful day and a thanks and 100
rupees to help pay for his three-wheeler back to the hotel to get his
passport.  It hadn't been given to me, but I was there at the time we
left it.</p>

<p>Lesson learned: bless those around me, especially when I'm asking
for help.</p>
