<p>Now we are passing endless fields.  We could be in West Texas.
Shrubs, grass, power towers.. Occassional old buildings..  a stadium.
We are going along the Suez Canal, I imagine.  I saw a ship in a rice
field and thought it's more likely that there's a canal going through
the rice field with a ship in it, than a ship in a rice field.</p>

<p>I just took pictures of everyone on the bus.  Everyone is sleeping
except for Katt, who is putting on eye makeup.  Angie's
borrowed-from-Petra camera battery is dead.</p>

<p>I took many pictures through the window, but most of them turned
out poorly.  Here is one that is sorta neat and representative of
'normal' architecture in Port Said area.</p>

<p>Some people are feeling sick on the bus.  I'm thankful that I'm
not.</p>

<p class=date>9:39am</p>

<p>We are in Cairo at a stopping point that includes a view over the
treetops of the pyramids.  There's a horse carrying water down the
street.</p>
