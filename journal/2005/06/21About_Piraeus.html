Although not really attractive to tourists, the confusing, bustling
port of Athens is the departure point for hundreds of island ferries
and cruise ships...

<p>I didn't write this, but stole it from <a href="http://www.athensguide.com/pireaus.html">www.athensguide.com/pireaus.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
I walked to the monastiraki metro station and got on the train to
Piraeus. As always I was there in about 15 minutes and as usual it
took me another 15 minutes to cross the street. For 20 years I have
been wondering about this.   [...]

How difficult would it be to build a bridge from the metro station to
the dock so people can reach the ferry without risking their lives?
And how is it that nobody has thought of this?

<p>So it seems basically that Piraeus main port is not a great place
to hang out, but the smaller yacht marina is nice.</p>
