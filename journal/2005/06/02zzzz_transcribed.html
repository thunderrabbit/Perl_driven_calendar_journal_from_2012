<p class=date>12:53am Friday 3 June 2005 headed toward Sri Lanka</p>

<p>Today, down to the wire getting all our lesson preparation stuff
done done done.  Everyone has great ideas and everyone is sharing
ideas, so that is really awesome.  That's it.  Have a great night.
Gotta be up for my first lesson at 9:30.</p>

<p class=dream>I forgot this morning I had a very vivid dream: I was on
PB and feeling quite overwhelmed with everything and like I
wouldn't be able to do everything.  Kim Sawyer was there and as my
personal coach, gave me feedback.  He was like "you're spending too
much time on the computer recording things and not enough time just
living and being on PB."  I was like "rar rar rar" and got
really mad "wtf do you know about anything?  what are you doing here
on PB?"  I yelled so loudly that his chair flew backwards and
he crashed to the ground and he was laughing at my question.  "Because
you *asked* me to be here!"</p>

<p class=dream>I was laughing too, in the end: all *blah* upset, but
really we're still cool; we're still alive, etc.</p>

<p class=date>1:26am Friday 3 June 2005</p>

<p>Tonight is the night I wrote "10 dollars feeds a child for a week;
a book feeds a mind for a lifetime." and I designed the poster Matt
drew of money and book coming together to the hands of happy children.
It's for the book selling fundraiser tomorrow.  This is the one for
which Kellie donated THREE BOXES of books!!</p>
