<p>Some passengers came up to me, all "where's Francois?"</p>

<p>"He's sleeping."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>"Actually, I forgot him."</p>

<p>"What???  You forgot him???"</p>

<p>Yeah..  He is a stuffed rabbit.  Not real.  He doesn't sleep.  How
can they be unsurprised that I said he was sleeping, but super
surprised when I said I forgot him?</p>
