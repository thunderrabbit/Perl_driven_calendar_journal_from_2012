<p>I met Cheerful Dancing Fellows at Hemmingway tonight. Aki, Yama,
Koji, Shunji.  Shunji bought me orange juice and Sandy (waiter) gave
me orange juice because I had let him use my cell phone as we left
Japan.</p>

<p>I've been looking for Kamau to give him 20 CDs and 20,000 yen to
burn a compilation for us.  He said he would put something together
for us.  Awesome!  He performed an incredible rap called Lone Gunman,
depicting the time he and his crew in San Antonio split up over
creative differences.  He says he was ready to work and they were
still in the drug scene.  The rap kicks ass.</p>

<p>I was super bummed that I didn't record it at the time he
performed it for us.</p>

<p>I made a video that I need to give to Lely; that will take some
time but I can do it.  Doing so much; we are so busy; four hours of
sleep last night and 5 hours of sleep scheduled for tonight.</p>

<p>Oh, also today I chatted with Petra, telling her of the magical
relationship I had with Wende, the way we found our house and the way
we were engaged and all that.  Tonight I went up to do laundry, but
the place was closed already.</p>

<p>So much fun doing Joy To The World and I'm really happy people
enjoyed it so much!</p>

<p>The ship has been really rocking and I'm loving it.  I keep
thinking about Ikumi and how much she would be scared and hating
it.</p>

<p>I fell asleep in GET Room 9 for a bit being so tired planning
lessons for tomorrow.</p>

<p>I think I'm buddhist.</p>

<p>I also told Petra about my transition from shy in high school to
Recycling Day in college.  I also got the Ocho Rios tour in Jamaica,
and Hitomi was quite upset by my cancelling of our plan to go scuba
diving there.  I helped her get her diary going on her computer.</p>

<p>Lely told us that we have karma like in a bank, and I was like "who
keeps track of the karma?" and she said "we do; our souls
remember."</p>
