<p>I thought I was all genius when I wished Keiko a happy birthday the
day before her birthday and she invited me to join her (and Riko and
Eri) for dinner (tonight).  I showed up at her room, lookin' all
sharp.  Then, three minutes later, guess, just guess who showed
up.</p>

<p>Brandt walked in, lookin' all sharp.  If I coulda cancelled at that
moment, I would have.</p>

<p>But I was like, <em>aight; fair enough.  I thought I had had my own
little good idea, but Brandt has his own good ideas, too.</em>  Brandt
sat beside Keiko and bought her a glass of wine, after asking me
if I wanted to split with him a bottle of wine for the table.  I was
all, "no, I don't drink."  Soon after the wine arrived, an bottle of
champagne came to the table anonymously.</p>

<p>Brandt, in making conversation, made references to legs and above
and below and between the legs, and Keiko was like, "Rob, tell him to
stop," and I was like, "dude, stop," and he didn't, so I kinda blew it
off like, "welp, I can't control Brandt."</p>

<p>He put bits of icing on her face though she tried (not too hard) to
resist.  Three times.  He definitely was rewarded; she made him lick
the icing off her face.  I was jealous, but was like, <em>good
job</em>.  I believe I would not have done all that in front of him,
because it would have 'meant' more to me, and not been just like,
"hey, I'm licking cake of Keiko's face," but more like, "oh yeah,
baby, I am right here in kissing proximity of a beautiful woman.." so
I wonder if it doesn't mean that to him, or if he is unphased, or
what.</p>

<p>The party turned into an "アー　パーチ" (ahh party) where
participants "say 'ahhh'" and have ever larger pieces of cake fed to
them.  Riko fed me a piece and Keiko was like, "hey; I'm supposed to
be first," since it was her party.  I had already chewed the piece
pretty effectively, but I pretended like I would spit it out so she
could be the first to feed me.  Keiko put out her hands and I almost
did it, but she pulled back, and I pulled back, and then she was like,
"no for real," and much to my delight, I blahed the chewed ball of
cake into her hands, much to the disgust of most of the table.  Brandt
acted grossed out, but I don't know if how much he actually was.</p>

<p>Right now I am in Eilat's lecture (it's about to start) and he is
still with the girls.  I took care to come here because I judge in
the big picture, this is more important for me.</p>

<p>However, when I said bye to her, she said "thank you for the
card," because I had written her a card (which, ironically, she had
seen before I had written it), and I was like, "oh, I have another
card for you," and gave her a 1 hour massage coupon.  I didn't give
it to her in front of the group; I want to be on the inside scoop.</p>

<p>Let the party happen and let cake be licked, but I want to be the
favorite. though at the same time I don't want to commit.  Interesting
common theme in my life.</p>
