<p>My first class today was the last of the semester for Cheerful
Dancing Fellows.  We played a game for our evaluation.  They did well,
and it really showed me the differences for some of the students.  We
went to Hemmingway for cake and drinks for Shunji's 72nd or 73rd
birthday.  Koji funded everything, so that was really nice of him.
The cakes were big, and she brought out 3 so we were like, "cool; we
can share these and it will be the right amount."  Then she brought
out FOUR MORE - one each for all seven of us.  We were like, "goood
Lawd these are biig!!" and were pawning them off on people who walked
by, to Natalie and her class table nearby, etc.</p>

<p>Aki presented her card to Shunji on which we had all written
little notes.</p>

<p>Ai walked up and had some cake and it was all good.  I had had Aki
translate part of the self evaluation to Japanese.</p>

<p>Just grabbed lunch and am about to go to last class of the
semester of my other class!</p>
