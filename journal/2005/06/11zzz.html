<p>I'm tired.  I'm kinda in a tired-cranky-ish mood.  Fun awesome day
today, but I haven't got shit done on my journal.  But it's cool cause
I'm having fun, and it can all be transcribed later.</p>

<p>This afternoon I hung out with Katt telling stories, many of
were from hanging out with janette, the rest of which related to
skating or Fred.  She seemed to enjoy listening, and I enjoyed making
her laugh.</p>

<p>GET Introduction, then GET Meeting, most of which was filled with
what's recorded on the end of tape 6 side A: the Palestinian refugee
camp tour in Jordan will not be a cakewalk.  In fact, due to political
pressures, it might not happen at all.</p>

<p>Interesting, though the guy was saying "this was the best tour of
my life, etc," I have no interest on going on the tour.  I plan to go
to Petra, where Indiana Jones 3 climaxed!</p>

<p>Dinner with Sri Lankan students and I nearly have all their names:
Neshan, Thisha, Anusha, Gayali, Shalini, ???, and Mario.  Anusha's
birthday was today and I got a video of her song and cake fest.</p>

<p>Worked on lesson stuff (getting my curriculum/reality caught up,
and planning for tomorrow) and then went to the Sri Lankan
get-to-know-ya thing, which was mostly answers to questions about the
Tamil Tigers, religious differences, racism and affects of the
tsunami.</p>

<p>Joel (the CCC (Communication Coordinator Coordinator (or Chocolate
Chip Cookie)))'s birthday party is tonight (I made his card today) and
I chose not to go because I wanted to finish my lesson stuff, I felt
tired and need to take some ROB time, and I don't want to go into
sports bar cause it's stinky with smoke.</p>

<p>Plus, the main reason I'd want to go is to flirt with the Sri
Lankan girls, which doesn't seem like a wise thing for me to do.</p>

<p>I do feel sad at the missed opportunity and sad at turning down
cute women.  There's the truth.</p>

<p>I didn't go outside today.  Well, I did for a bit, but not
long.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm teaching Greg's classes tomorrow for Guest Teacher Day.
His classes are lower than mine, so that's good cause I won't have to
plan too much.  I'll do introductions and then introduce-a-friend,
which Greg says they haven't done yet.</p>

<p>I'm looking out the portal now, and the sea is calm; it's just like
dark blue and then next to the boat is dark water, but then a 20 foot
wide strip of white cause the front of the boat pushes the waves out
and they crash right there, leaving a white swath on each side of the
boat.</p>
