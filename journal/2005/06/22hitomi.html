succeeded in breaking my character: I was the bouncer for Mafia Night
and she kept talking to me and asking if I liked my job and why I was
doing this job and how I was selected and when I would be finished and
if I would talk to her after I finished, etc etc etc and I finally was
like fuckit and I walked away from my post and talked with her for
over an hour, including tears on her part and little empathy on my
part.</p>

<p>I chose to throw a quarter of my Mt Fuji staff into the ocean (I
broke it by slamming it onto my bedroom floor after Hitomi wouldn't
let me leave my room until I talked to her about not wanting to go
scuba diving with her in Jamaica) and she saw me heading that
direction and asked if she could go with me.</p>

<p>I gave her half of the quarter and she threw it over and I threw my
half of a quarter over and we talked for a while and now I'm in GET
Room 9 officially working on my curriculum, but I can hardly stay
awake to even write this.</p>

<p>It just feels unfair that I "have to" deal with Hitomi now.</p>
