<p>We are in this beautiful restaurant.</p>

<p>The sky is gently shifting from puke brown to tan to sleepy dark
blue to dark with stars.  Dogs are barking in the background.  We are
chowing down on a buffet to beat all buffets.</p>

<p>Walking through Petra and Hitomi is mocking the wailing speakers
that seem likely to be broadcasting prayers.  The night is warm; we
don't need a jacket.  There are bigass rocks that remind me a lot of
West Texas.</p>
