<p>Watched a slideshow and a presentation on Peace in the Broadway
Lounge (big room in the back of the boat on 7th deck).  He made one
interesting point about which I had not previously thought: world
peace is not just about humans, but we could benefit by making peace
with animals, plants, oceans, atmosphere, earth.</p>

<p>The slides were nice, too.</p>
