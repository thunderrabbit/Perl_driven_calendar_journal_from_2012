<p>Amazingly, all the streets are blocked in Port Said so our convoy
of busses with police escort can leave the city together.</p>

<p>It's kinda spooky to me; I want to apologize to all the traffic we
are going past.  Some buildings are destroyed, but I can't tell that
they are directly destroyed by war.   There is a cop on the bus for
security.  This was explained that tourism is the most important
industry, so they want to keep us safe.  Awesome.</p>
