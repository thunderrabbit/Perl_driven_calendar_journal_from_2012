<p>Today was our Cinderella play in rude Japanese.  I was glad to have
memorized all my lines, so I didn't need a piece of paper or to read
off my hand.  But, I forgot a line in Scene 3, so I broke character
for one second until I recalled it.  I'm not able to ad lib in rude
Japanese.</p>

<p>Shawn got it on video; I wonder if I'll get it on here.</p>

<p>Now it's work work work on curriculum time.</p>
