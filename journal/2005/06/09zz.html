<p class=date>1:27am MVT Friday 10 June 2005</p>

<p>MVT, by the way, means Maldives Time.  Nice.</p>

<p>Today I finished being sick, basically; although still a bit of
diarreah, I've stopped feeling ill.</p>

<p>Super duper special thanks to Kris for doing so much work toward
the All English / All Japanese / All Silence day posters!  Tomorrow
from 2pm to 10pm we GET teachers are only allowed to speak Japanese,
unless required otherwise by job responsibilities.  On the 11th,
students and others who choose to participate are not allowed to speak
at all from 5am to 1pm (including lunch, by design) and will have to
use gestures to communicate.  Then from 1pm to 10pm will only be
allowed to speak using English (and gestures).</p>

<p>Crap; that reminds me: I was supposed to look up the ASL signs for
brother and sister today.  I forgot to do that... Should I go down
and look for them on Encarta?</p>

<p>ps: Encarta is *really* cool.</p>

<p>Katt painted my toenails green tonight, in preparation for the
formal dinner tomorrow night.  She asked me what color tie I planned
to wear (so that she could more properly choose a nail polish color)
and I was like, "I don't know; I don't even know what color ties I
have here."</p>

<p>I'm not super tired now; I'll go down and scope Encarta.</p>

<p>pps: I am super far behind on transcribing audio tapes.  Like 2
tapes behind.</p>
