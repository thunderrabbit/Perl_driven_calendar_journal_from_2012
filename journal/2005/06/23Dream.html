<p>While in the shower, I remembered my dream.</p>

<p class=dream>I saw my dentist, and was all, "hey man; how's it
going?  Sorry I haven't seen you in a while.."</p>

<p class=dream>I also saw Eddie Murphy and joked about not remembering
which black comedian he was.  "Yeah yeah, he's Bill Cosby; he did that
movie Brewster's Millions.."</p>

<p class=dream>Eddie Murphy was all, "heh heh heh" with his trademark
laugh.</p>
