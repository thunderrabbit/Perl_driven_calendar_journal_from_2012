<p>I just wrote a significant amount in my journal about Sri Lanka.
I don't know if I'm really allowed...  I know I'm not allowed to do
this, but I'm leaving my computer in my GET classroom.</p>

<p>I ran upstairs and found Kin, who has written several things in
Japanese for me to learn.  I just ran upstairs to get my Japanese
notebook.</p>
