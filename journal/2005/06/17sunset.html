Kim lost her headband (after we had been talking about losing things
that way) (I would like to buy her another somewhere), and we were
alerted to stop jumping by someone whistling at us from the captain's
area: He mimed "people could be sleeping in the deck below."</p>

<p>Chowed dinner in the Yacht Club (almost got there too late, but
Natalie was there and the guy said it was never too late for her), and
watched the sun set.  Clapped when it said as per the restaurant in
Texas where Maryann used to work.</p>
