<p>Just finished our GET meeting and are about to go to dinner.  I
gave Kamau 20 blank CDs and cases and 20,000 yen and he gave me back
20 not-blank CDs and 0 yen.  Nicole just gave me a 3000 yen IOU.</p>

<p>Just played Silent Football with four of the girls from Happy
Wonderful Girls class.  They were making very few errors, and were
like boom boom boom just slammin' the football around.  Very
impressive.  But, of course, they didn't tattle upon one another.</p>

<p>I recorded Kamau's _Lone Gunman_.  It's far too fast and too much
for me to be willing to transcribe it.  It's about 5 minutes into
side B of tape 5.</p>
