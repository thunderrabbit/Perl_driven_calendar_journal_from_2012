<p>Although my schedule book says "SLEEP" from 11pm to 6:50am, I have
not yet slept, but instead just totally kissed someone.  We maintained
good control and all clothing remained fastened and in place.</p>

<p>We had been chatting and then I said I need to go sleep, but she
was like, "what?" and we ended up starting Bite Club.  "You point to a
part of your body and I'll bite it."  Yes, I am a genius.</p>
