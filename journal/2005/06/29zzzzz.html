<p>I just talked to Allison for 40 minutes and *now* I am going to
bed.</p>

<p>Oh, the magician had a cool trick earlier today.  He would shuffle
cards and then flip through them very quickly and then we would choose
a number and he would tell us what card that number was.  He did it
twice, amazingly, <em>except</em> he was off by one card both
times.</p>
