<p>I ran upstairs and found Kin, who has written several things in
Japanese for me to learn.  I just ran upstairs to get my Japanese
notebook.</p>

<p>I recorded several minutes of carimba and flute performance on this
tape (tape 5)</p>

<p>Though nothing is recorded textually, I have pictures from swimming
this day.  Kris and I had fun with my underwater camera.</p>
