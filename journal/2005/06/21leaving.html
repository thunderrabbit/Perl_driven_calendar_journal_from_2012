<p>Time for bed, but first a few words about the boat:</p>

<p>People were smoking upwind from me and Kin while we watched the port
sail away, so we moved to the front deck.  It was super cold up there
so she stood in front of me and my jacket sorta covered us both (but
mostly covered me).  She helped me practice Japanese.</p>

<p>Downstairs, chatting with Shawn, Petra, and Greg in Shinji, Shawn,
and my room.  Shawn busted out the camera and asked us about Greece.
The topic strayed to art: is modern art as good as classical?</p>
