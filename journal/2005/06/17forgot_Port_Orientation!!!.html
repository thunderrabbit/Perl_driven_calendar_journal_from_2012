<p>Nightmare today before the GET Meeting.  I thought everything was
all cool: chillin' with my new Japanese teachers (that Pat sorted out
for us) and 25 minutes to go before the GET meeting when Audrey came
out of the room all, "the port orientation started five minutes
ago..."</p>

<p>My heart dropped like a stone.  I'm in charge of the Port
Orientation today for this port.  I thought it was supposed to be
tomorrow.  Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p>I went down to my computer to get it printed, not even remembering
where I had left off last time when I was researching.  Copied it from
my computer to the network (with printer), printed it, and went to
copy it.  The machine was in Japanese mode, so it took about a million
years to figure out how to get it into English mode so I could see how
to copy 1 -&gt; 2 sided.</p>

<p>Got it switched to English and started it copying.  It's a fast
machine but it was taking forever and ever and ever and I could just
have *died* from embarassment at what was being printed.  I had done
hours of research online, but not sorted through it nicely; I had
planned to do that today / tonight / tomorrow in our ample free
time.</p>

<p>Yuuka came down to help and stapled some of them for me; I'm
thankful to her for that.</p>

<p>Headed up, dreading what Audrey was going to say.  ((( Now let me
be 100% clear on this: Audrey is Awesome.  She is a hero to me for all
that she can do and all the plates she keeps juggling and spinning and
all her genki energy is just inpirational.  She would never (far as I
know) say directly, "you were late/wrong/bad/etc" but always says
things in a very respectful manner and totally empathising with the
person who didn't get something done on time.  But to hear, "hey guys,
it would be good if you could try to keep an eye on the schedule and
just be ready when your time is coming up, that would be really
great.."  ..  oh my god I was totally dreading it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>But it never came.  She didn't say anything like that at all.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>After the meeting: the port orientation, and GET meeting, Petra
told me "thank you for putting together that information."</p>

<p>I just started to cry.  Just her little bit of appreciation tipped
my brain over and air escaped my nose like a little laugh at the
cosmic irony of how someone could possibly thank me, a man who felt
like total poo.</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" she asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head no.</p>

<p>"Let's go upstairs (to the top deck) and talk."</p>

<p>I nodded my head.</p>

<p>I escaped the room without anyone letting on that they could see my
angst.</p>

<p>Petra started talking as we left the area, "you missed the
discussion while you were gone, but,"</p>

<p>And I wondered what she could possibly say that had any relevance
to the situation at hand right now:  Was it one more thing to add to
the schedule?  Something about getting around Cairo?</p>

<p>"we talked about it and no one else knew it was today either."</p>

<p>Oh my gosh.  Hearing that one thing helped a lot.  I didn't even
make it up to the top deck; just made it to the stairs before I
started to cry hugging Petra.  Kim came too; I really appreciated the
support.</p>

<p>Told them how I felt and how I had been unable to concentrate for
the remainder of the meeting.  Got everything synchronized in our
calendars (I lamintated mine today) and it was all good.</p>
