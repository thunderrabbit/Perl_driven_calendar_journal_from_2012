<p>I'm copying images and video to CD for Lely Heyslip.  I'm glad
people added stuff to the pile.</p>

<p>We are in Sri Lanka, another 4th floor exit, meaning they don't
have the facilities for us to exit into an air conditioned building.
They gotta bunch of cranes and shit, corrugated roof warehouses, and
looks like four story apartments over there.  It's raining like
crazy.</p>

<p class=date>9:05am LKT Monday 06 June 2005</p>

<p>On the GET Challenge Tour bus and the guy is telling us the
history; he's telling it in such a complicated way that I can't keep
track and Josh, doing the translation is having to simplify and water
down the history into abridged footnotes of what he is saying.  I
don't even know wtf he is saying.</p>

campus tour.  It's raining pretty effectively ..  Well, no that's not
true; it's sprinkling, but the rooves are collecting rain and dumping
it down in concentrated areas.  I don't know the name of the campus
yet, but we just met a professor who is teaching MS word today.  I
think he said this entire set of buildings is dedicated to the MS
Office package and I'm thinking, <em>man; do something *real*, like
some more peaceful operating system like Macintosh or something.</em>
but they have *classes* on MS Word and Excel and the whole bit.  He
said they are teaching VB and Java and C++ depending on which
department they are in.  Same as any university in the United
States.</p>

<p>The walls feel like concrete and are all painted a flat yellow,
like light beige.  There's a Sri Lankan flag that's all faded.  My
rabbit (from Colleen) thinks he should be on it instead of the
lion.</p>

<p>"Magenama Rob" (Spanish pronunciation) in Sri Lankan = my name is
Rob.</p>

<p class=date>10:27am</p>

<p>We are supposed to be back in 3 minutes.  Ha.</p>

<p>We've been doing an abbreviated campus tour due to the rain,
although a lot of the time it was just sprinkling, but that kept many
of this group from venturing outside.</p>

<p>Some magnolia trees here by the library are beautiful and lush,
though for some reason the ground below them has very little grass.
Do they block that much light?  The ground has turned into little
muddy rivulets carving paths through the red clay soil.  I'm basically
soaked, but still in good spirits, though a bit worried about my voice
recorder.  I trust it will continue to be all good.  I've kinda got it
protected with my hat.  Which means my head is not protected.  Some
passengers tried to give me an umbrella, but I have no way to carry it
and my tape recorder and my hat, plus this little bit of rice
something something (roti) I got for lunch.</p>

<p class=date>10:42am</p>

<p>We are standing underneath this roof, and it is *definitely*
raining now.  I am impressed with the intensity.  It's pretty windy,
too.  The rain is coming down at about a 35 degree angle.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We are sitting in the stands of a stadium that I think is a
cricket pitch (if pitch is the right name for cricket games).</p>

<p>The woman addressing us has a lilting accent that slurps up to a
high pitch at the end of some sentences.  She's telling us about
stuff, including that educatiion through university level is free.
Yuuka is translating her lecture into Japanese.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>We are standing in the middle of the cricket field, and we are
definitely in the path of any raindrops that happen to come down this
direction.  There is a small covered area to which everyone will
flock if it starts to rain.  Like, "shoooop"</p>

<p>We are learning some traditional dance thing.</p>

<p class=date>12:36pm</p>

<p>We just did Joy To The World, which everyone seemed to enjoy, and I
was reallly glad that the practice session went so well when we
practiced it the other day (was that just yesterday?)  I want to trade
contact information with the dance instructor.  He
is <em>awesome</em>.</p>

shaped like Os and then a cool dance which I continued to do during
the part where they showed girls how to put on the skirt things.  I
put one on anyway; they said it was okay even though I was soaked in
sweat.</p>

<p>We are on the bus now and Josh had to walk with a different group
to a bus that had to park on the street.</p>

<p>The tour leader guy is saying the water pulled back about 1/2
kilometer on Tsunami Day.  Yikes.  I wonder what it would be doing
normal waves at that juncture.  Seems like it should.  Hmmmmm.</p>

bowls made of some baked tortilla type things.</p>

<p>Architecture in Colombo reminds me of Mexico.  I don't have any
basis for saying that since I have only been to one border town.
There are no really tall buildings - maybe four stories..  Lots of old
buildings with brick base and facing coming off the front.  Lots of
variety - tile, digital printers, salons, hinges, beauty suppy,
lumber, grass, 1 story hotels, banks, houses with trees, ..  I can't
really distinguish this from Vietnam, but there are more cars here and
fewer motorcycles.  And the written language is different.  Stuff is
nicer here; I can say that.  There is a parking lot full of backhoes I
just saw, but we wouldn't see that in Vietnam; at least not in Da
Nang.  There's just not enough money to have that.  Lots of trucks and
busses.</p>

<p>We just said bye to a bunch of students who joined us from the
campus for dinner.</p>

align="left" /></a> We went to a temple in the middle (?) of the city.
I had been pretty interested in seeing it; Buddhism sounded like a
pretty fly religion to me.  something I could get into, for people
aren't worried about nothin' and just live their lives and allow what
comes to come.</p>

<p>Or so I thought.  I was surprised by the number of abject people
begging quietly for money.  I am sure I'd be begging for money slash
food if I suddenly gave up all my stuff, but.. I dunno; I was just
surprised.</p>

<p>The temple was quite beautiful, to be sure.  I was impressed with
the big tree, representing the one under which Buddha sat when he was
enlightened.</p>

<p>I just saw a railroad track as we crossed it, and it was being
used as a sidewalk by people, though it looked like trains could
still use it.  No trees or big plants growing through the ties
between the rails, and no rust on the rails.  How often do trains
pass here?</p>

<p>I've seen very few people smoking, it seems.  Bamboo scaffolding.
Dogs in the streets with extra long teets.</p>
