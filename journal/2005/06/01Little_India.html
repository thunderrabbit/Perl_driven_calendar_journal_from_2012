they are shopping.  All variety of fabrics and necklines and spangles
and littlebitty bittyitty bitty cutsie wootsie.</p>

<p>I walked around a bazzar with Carissa and Katt: lost Nat and
____ (I forgot who we were with!)</p>

<p>Carissa is explaining we (they) are in survelliance mode, and there
are *differences* between all these dresses.  I say it's just random
and nutso.</p>

fish and stuffs all laid out for the chowing.</p>

<p>The shopkeepers here are not as genki nor forceful as in Vietnam.
They're just chillin'.</p>

<p>We're below the dress-shop nightmare between all tons of little
side by side by side shops selling Indian, vegetarian, Chinese, etc
etc food.</p>

<p>Wow; mango juice is really nice here.</p>

<p>Roti John is yummy.  Bread, egg, meat, spicy sauce (sweet chili
sauce, says Carissa).</p>

<p>I ditched the girls (I let them know first).  It may be illegal to
chew gum and throw it on the ground, but it's definitely not a full
blown deterrent.  Gum and dirt and trash is all around.</p>

<p>Ooops!  I just walked into Little India station past the no eating
/ no drinking signs $500. I was carrying a drink.. oops.</p>

<p>In Tokyo I can put in 10,000 yen and get a 110 yen ticket and
change.  In Tokyo there are tons of ticket machines.</p>

<p>In Singapore I couldn't use $10 to buy a $2 ticket.  C'mon, man!
Tokyo allows *orders* of *magnitude* difference!  In Little Inda there
were only three machines, one of which was broken.</p>

<p>The driver in Singapore couldn't stop gently; always a big jerk at
the end of the deceleration.</p>
