40-ish minute train ride away.  We ended up going with a group:
Natalie, Audrey, Allison, Rika, Adriana, Niveen..  I don't remember
who all went.  The area was gorgeous.  I was eager to climb (not pay
for a taxi to ascend) a hill upon which many stores and shops and
hotels enjoyed the charm of Italy with a great view overlooking the
sparkling clear ocean.</p>

<p>I mailed postcards and bought water and chose not to buy another
ice cream as I was running low on funds.  The area was so beautiful!
Audrey decided she would live there when she retired, doing yoga in
the morning, creating art in the afternoon.  It certainly would
support such endeavors.</p>

<p>On the way back, I was pretty stressed about being late, but the
girls negotiated a taxi, but it seemed to take fucking forever for us
to reach a concensus.  I kept saying, "I would prefer just to walk
back" cause I knew how long it would take, and I knew I could make it
to the train, and I knew how much it would cost.  But I kept finding
myself walking with Audrey; I was just unable to break myself away
from her.</p>

<p>In the end, the taxi proved to be more fun than the train would
have been, plus we got to spend time in the water on a beautiful
beach.  I'm thankful for this opportunity to take risks and take a
taxi instead of the train.</p>

<p>At the same time, I was hoping Niveen would choose to come with me
so that I would feel like she was ... thankful for my leadership?
yeah, that sounds about right.  I wanted to feel like a good
leader.</p>

I didn't have trunks.  I nearly stripped my shorts off, but was like,
"hey - those are underwear!!! (not trunks!)"</p>

<p>The water was astonishingly clear.  It looked like drinking water,
so I tasted it.  It was salty.</p>

<p>d'oh.  My $10 sunglasses were broken during the beach adventure.</p>

<p>Heading back in the taxi now: 140 km/h.  Mt Aetna is on the right,
and I'm so so thankful that I'm on this fabulous PB adventure.
Oh my gosh.</p>

<p>Upon arrival back at the port, Niveen and I ate some more ice
cream as I tried to teach her the phrase "off da hook!"  She was cute
and kept saying "hook" more like "huck"</p>
