<p>We are in front of the Suez Canal, ready to rock in there.  I got a
video of the anchor chain being raised.  Someone said we are the next
ship to enter.  There seems to be a lane through which big-ass cargo
ships are plowing through.  A big HYUNDAI marked ship passed us; I
wonder if the more massive ships get precedence or something.</p>

<p>The front deck is packed with onlookers, taking pictures and
chattering about whatever.  There isn't a lot to see right now, but I
can see the entrance of the canal.  It's bigger than I guessed.</p>
