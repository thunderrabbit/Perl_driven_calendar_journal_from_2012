<p>On the bus in the back seat of the bus, sitting next to Ai
(pronounced "I") on my left.  I totally should have brought my
handspring visor so I could type this out instead of record it.</p>

<p>Seeing a bunch of warehouses without roofs, and there is a
hugemongously incredibly huge flag!!  Oh my god it is fantastically
huge!</p>

<p>Red is our tourguide, saying that real estate is an excellent
investment in Al-Aqaba, Jordan.  Palm trees on both sides of the road,
this huge ass hotel and lots of space for people to come in. Reminds
me of Palm Springs, California a lot.</p>

<p>This is also an excellent diving location, apparently.</p>

<p>This is the tour where I asked Ai to suggest a name for the rabbit.
Without thinking she said, "Francois."</p>

<p>I balked.  "No no; I mean a real name."</p>

<p>She suggested "Hiroyuki."</p>

<p>I cringed.  "Um.. actually Francois is perfect!"</p>
