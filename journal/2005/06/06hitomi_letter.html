Dear Rob

How about life of a ship?

Probably you are working busy and having enjoyable time.  I'm sorry
that you upset for I get on PB, but please don't misunderstand
that I got on PB for I'll chase you.  I want to learn something 
on PB.  I want to look a star filled night sky on the sea.  I
want to look the sunrises and the sunsets from the horizon on the sea.

I hope that this voyage is good experience for you.  Let's enjoy 49th
voyage by PB!

I hope you can understand my strange English.

ps: to tell the truth, sometimes I want to spend with you.

Hitomi

<p>Oh Hitomi.  Just give me space.</p>
