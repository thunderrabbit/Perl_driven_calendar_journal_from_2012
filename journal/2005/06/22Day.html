<p>We get an extra hour tonight, which is a blessing.  I've been
stressed today about getting my curriculum done.  I specifically did
not help with preparations for Mafia Night tonight, but I am supposed
to be the bouncer, a job which should be pretty fun.  I need to
create homework for five of my students who will be on overland tours
starting soon.  One is leaving tomorrow so I have to do hers
tonight.  The others can wait.</p>

<p>Dammit; I don't have a collar shirt to wear so I'll be wearing a
white T-shirt.  Gotta find some black socks, too.</p>

<p>I've been writing postcards in Japanese, and I'm supposed to meet
Niveen tonight cause we are going to Italy tomorrow and she and I are
supposed to hang out; we just need to make a plan for meeting.  I'm
looking forward to that.</p>

<p>I fell asleep during a great portion of the Okinawa lecture though
it was translated by the CCs.  I'm not sure what I missed, but oh
well.</p>

<p>I heard a rumor that Shinji is trying to kidnap Francois, so he is
hidden inside my pillow.</p>

<p>Hmmmm. my outfit looks aight, but it's easy to tell this is a thin
white shirt.  I'm wearing a dark suit, and my dark leather (worn /
faded, but dark) slip-on shoes to be a bouncer tonight at Mafia
Night.</p>
