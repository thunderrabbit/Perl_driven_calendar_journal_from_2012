<p>Hung out with Kim, Kris and Kris' class today at T-time.  They
asked me age and girlfriend questions and then taught me some
kanji.  Fun times.</p>

<p>We did little puzzles with toothpicks: move two toothpicks to put
the olive outside the glass and move one toothpick to make this a
correct equation, and move three toothpicks to make four equalateral
triangles, etc..</p>

<p>I talked to them originally because I wanted one more gesture for
my final review thing tomorrow.</p>
