<p>The boat is really rocking, and I'm totally lovin' it.  I just had
lunch with three women, but I only knew one of them (Kuni).</p>

<p>Kuni suggested that I go to Cafe Latino to have salsa lessons
(there are far more women than men who show up (because the women are
mostly over 50), and Natalie always encourages guys to join), so I
will probably do that, to get some salsa pointers and get good points
with Natalie so I can get Francois back; I left him at a lecture
recently and she picked him up, but has been pretending not to have
him.  But tomorrow we will be in France, and Francois not in France
is just unacceptable. </p>

<p>I had Superbeginner and Beginner lessons today, but I had been
scheduled to do the Intermediate and Advanced.  Petra caught the
mistake and got it sorted so everything appeared normal for the
students.</p>

<p class=date>3:07pm</p>

<p>I went up to the top deck and watched the hot tub POURING water
over onto the top deck.  It was reallllly cool.  I recorded some of
them, but missed the best ones.</p>

<p>So I went to salsa, and it turns out we will be <em>performing</em>
in a few days, which totally petrifies me, cause I can't salsa
for <b>shit</b>.  But I can do it, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Met one of the girls there who looks Japanese but has really good
English.  Turns out she has been in the US for a while in high
school, and I'm like, <em>really???</em> cause she looks like early
20s to me.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Her name is Miki.</p>
