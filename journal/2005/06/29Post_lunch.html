<p>Was writing postcards today when I realized I haven't seen Kin nor
Mariko with braces in a long time.  (Long by PB standards,
where we see everyone every day (except those people who we never see
(those people who we see for the first time while watching videos of
the trip after it's all over)).)  I decided they must be on one of the
overland excursion tours (about 100 passengers are off the boat now
from Scicily or Barcelona to France).</p>

<p>I have written 25 post cards that I need to send in France.  I
wasn't able to send any in Barcelona because it was a Sunday and
holiday, so I couldn't buy stamps.  The streets had a slightly eerie
ghost town look to them cause they were all closed up.  I'm sure it
would have been a way different experience to go on a non holiday
Saturday.</p>
