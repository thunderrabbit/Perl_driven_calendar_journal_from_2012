<p class=note>(9:04am ICT Saturday 04 June 2005)</p>

<p>We are arriving in Singapore and I'm on the top deck, having just
finished transcribing the previous tape.  I just saw a dragonfly a
moment ago.</p>

<p>There's a few people along the rail watching the drab olive green
water slowly roll by.  The sky is just about overcast and it looks
like rain over there.  Visibility is not 21 kilometers.  People on
the ship seem sleepy.</p>

<p>People are scouting out over the front deck.  Shinji says we
should arrive at noon.</p>

<p>It's my first time in Singapore, and all I want to do is use the
free internet access in McDonald's.  I'd like to download some star
and galaxy information from the web for me-an-Kim's self-planned
event.</p>

<p>We're super far from anything, and we're going really slow.  My
GPS says that Singapore is 130 degrees back behind us.  I entered
coordinates while I was at home.</p>

<p>Xianrun (Run) and I are looking out over the deck; he's from
Singapore.</p>

<p>Run tells me that Singapore has no natural disasters because there
are no volcanoes; Singapore is sheltered by other islands from any
tsunami or hurricanes; Singapore is in the middle of the eurasian
plate so there are no earthquakes.</p>

<p>We're seeing lots of ships parked; really expensive for them to
chill out, I'm sure.  Like 20 big-ass tankers (I don't see any cargo).
They are waiting to transfer their goods says Run.</p>

<p>Singapore doesn't import much, but trans-ships stuff to/from Middle
East and Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Xianrun's site is <a href="http://www.blurp.net">blurp.net</a></p>

ship: dudes are on top of the little boat's deck!  Holy shit this is
money!!  We're being boarded by pirates!! There's a ladder out for
them and the door is open, so they must have an guy inside.</p>

<p>I took pictures and was holding my camera with one hand but not
using the strap!  Over the edge and everything...  Yikes stripes!</p>

<p class=date>11:26am SGT Wednesday 01 June 2005</p>

<p>We're heading into a cove thing and there's a gondola over the bay;
we'll be going under the gondolas soon.  Amazing how I can say gandola
and Japanese think it's different than gondola.</p>

<p class=date>11:50am</p>

<p>I'm a bit conflicted; I'm fuckin' around on my computer, copying
stuff to burn to CD, but I should just get outta here.</p>

<p class=date>12:03pm</p>

<p>Delay in something with passports, so we can't get off yet.  I'm a
bit bummed that I didn't go watch the docking process (we docked at
noon) but instead was working on burning a CD.  I was carrying the
computer carefully to the desk and it slipped and flipped the cover
closed, dramatically halting the CD burning process.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The gondola goes *through* a building; it seems like it would be a
challenge to let people get on and off in the building, but overly
silly to *not* let people get on/off in the building.</p>

<p>Kris (and Angie) says it slows down but doesn't stop inside the
building, like a ski gondola.</p>

<p>Kris et.al. are going to eat curry with their fingers in Little
India.</p>

<p>Katt says it's not so hot today.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The ropes extending from the back of the ship go outward to an
extension of the dock thing, as opposed to inward to the dock.</p>

<p>Singapore looks like a cross between Hong Kong and Vietnam, more
like Hong Kong.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>The gangway is long and winding, allowing wheelchair access.</p>

<p>The moving sidewalks are not moving, so I walked up to them and
stood. Waited.  Good joke.</p>

<p>Port-(un)loading cranes are crammed together in the distance.</p>

<p>Dave told us a story about a game of Risk, where a guy broke his
alliance during the game, and his buddies were all freaked out and
would have killed him had he been found that night of drunken
antics.</p>

<p class=date>1:15pm</p>

<p>We're in Harbour Front station</p>

<p>I've extended my butt-cheek-horizons, using my left butt cheek to
slide down a pole on the stairs.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>This train station looks quite modern: marble floors, brushed
chrome, etc.  Fares exclude $1 refundable deposit.</p>

<p class=date>1:25pm</p>

<p>We just got five tickets to Little India.  The trains accelerate
much more quickly than in Tokyo; I don't know if they are shorter, but
they are definitely newer.</p>
