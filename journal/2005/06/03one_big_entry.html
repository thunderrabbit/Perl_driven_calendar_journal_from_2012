<p>Don't have time to get into a new project; though I thought there
was only 5 more minutes on this tape.  Book fair at 3:45 and then
study time at 4:30 and oh my god there is just so much to keep track
of!</p>

<p>Maybe after the 6pm GET Meeting I can transcribe this tape, get
ready for lessons tomorrow and do laundry.</p>

<p class=date>4:22pm</p>

<p>Book sale is underway and I am fucking <em>pumped</em> at the
number of books Kellie donated!!  Took four people to carry them all.
We are selling a chance for people to write their names in the books:
1000 yen and write their name and donate the book plus the money.</p>

<p>I recorded part of Study Time today.  Super low level students and
a pretty high level student came in.</p>

pictures of her most recent fundraising party where she's kickin' it
with movie stars and US Presidents and doing all this cool work and
we'll be chillin' with her tomorrow!  This is <em>totally kick
ass!</em>  Shit is starting to happen.  I'm lovin' this.</p>

<p>Brandt went to sleep cause he didn't know we were having a meeting
to get ready for our Sri Lanka student exchange program - teaching the
Japanese students how to teach the Sri Lankans the steps to the dance.
But now he is translating it for us.</p>

<p>Audrey reminds me of Johnny Wolfe who is continually surfing on
this continually changing to-do list that is written on pages and
scraps and her hand with 500 meetings and different colors and cross
outs.  Her binder is so big it broke her purse strap, and she wore out
her hand trying to sew through leather and fabric.</p>

<p>Brandt's sign language version of boys and girls is grabbing the
crotch and grabbing the breasts.  This is for signing and singing</p>

<pre>
Joy To The World
To All The Boys And Girls
Joy To The Fishes In The Deep Blue Sea
Joy To You And Me.

<p>Super thanks to Audrey for helping us get the Student Exchange plan
sorted.  She is so so so busy!</p>

<p>Man, we are so deleriously tired...  It's 12:26am now and we've
just finished for the night.  Well, Brandt and I have finished, but
Audrey is still kickin' it.</p>

<p class=date>3:30am</p>

<p>Just finished working on my class preparation for tomorrow.
Bedtime now.  Worked on curriculum and lesson plan for each class.
Printed out pictures of my students as well.</p>
