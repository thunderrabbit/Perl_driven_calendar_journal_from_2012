Pretty good climb.  I'm a bit
worried about getting back on time.  I'm up here with Rie and Dani
now.</p>

<p>I'm seriously looking for a shortcut way to go back, but I don't
know which way that would be.  To be safe, but slower than *if* we
were to find a shortcut, we are going back the way we came.</p>

<p>At the same time we were climbing around Petra, other passengers
were floating and reading in Dead Sea.</p>
