<p class=date>5:39am SGT Thursday 02 June 2005</p>

<p>It's the day after Singapore and I'm just now going to bed (after I
*pee*) and I've been working on the lesson plans and curriculums.. I
didn't get it all finished as much as Audrey wants, but I got enough
finished that I think it will be okay.</p>

<p>I'm really tired, but, uh, whatever.  Yeah, okay; good night.</p>
