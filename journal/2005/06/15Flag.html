<p>Next to a fort now, that was shook to shit by an earthquake in
1840 or something.</p>

geometry to figure out its size.  I am 180cm, or 5 feet 11 inches
tall.  I'm looking down at my shadow which seems to be about 65cm
tall.  The height of the flag shadow is 12 paces, which are nearly a
meter each.</p>

<p>Using my estimates and Google calculator, it's <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2890cm+*+12%29+*+180cm+%2F+65cm">30
meters</a> tall.  Approximately.</p>

<p>the length of the flag is not really foreshortened, and I just
counted it as 52 paces, but it's not completely unfurled by the
wind.</p>

<p>I'm guessing the flag is about 30 by 60 meters.</p>

<p>Close.  This <a

Dynasty flag is 44 by 80 meters</a>.</p>
