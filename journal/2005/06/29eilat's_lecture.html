<p>In her lecture, Eilat did not defend the Israeli's actions, but
simply described how it could come to occur that Israeli could
persecute Palestinians for 57 years.</p>

<p>She is saying basically that for 2 thousand years Jews prayed for
Zion, a place they could finally call their own, as they continued to
be expelled around the world.</p>

<p>Finally, they were all called together to become the New Jew - no
longer persecuted, but able to take control of his own future.  A
farm tool in one hand and a gun in the other.</p>

<p>A phrase was used: "a land with no people for a people with no
land," which was not accurate: there were people, but it was argued
that their presence was illegitimate.</p>

<p>In 1947, the UN suggested dividing the land into a Jewish state
and a Palestinian state.  The jews at that time didn't care about the
amount of land, but that there was some land, and that they were the
majority.</p>

<p>The Palestinians were quite upset because, in their eyes, the bulk
of their land was being taken without cause.</p>

<p>In recent polls, 65% of the population were willing to remove
themselves fromthe Palestinian territory, but were unwilling to give
control to the Palestinians.</p>

<p>But the issue, that keeps the war going is not about Jerusalem, the
refugees, the border... it's not so complicated that no one can come
up with a workable solution.</p>

<p>The war continues because someone is benefitting from the war.
People around the world are benefitting from this war.</p>

<p>The Israeli government is maintaining the war via manipulation,
constantly telling the population their security is at risk.  Saying
"security" in Israel is like saying "abra cadabra" in any other part
of the world.  Israeli's are willing to give up their personal
thoughts, their time, their lives, in exchange for security.</p>

<p>The textbooks focus on the suffering of Jews, but does not talk
about the suffering of the people on the land to which the Jews
came.  Palestinians were just called Arabs, lumping them in with 70
other countries that can be called Arabic.</p>

<p>We are taught that all Arabs want to kill all Israelis, and that
Israelis are not wanted in the middle east.  But the truth is most
Jews 60 years ago did not want to be in the middle east.  They were
forced to give up their European heritage and take on a whole new
culture.</p>

<p>Israeli children are required to send presents to soldiers and go
on field trips to fire rifles at camps, to ingrain military service
into their minds.</p>

<p>Anytime the government wants to justify a military action (which
invariably means destroy a Palestinian village) they just need to
say, "there are threats of bombings in _____," and everyone will
support the action.</p>

<p>The Israeli army is depicted as completely admirable, and the very
image of a masculine soldier is used to sell everything from
cellphones to chicken soup.</p>

<p>Most Isreali politicians come straight of the military and replace
their uniforms for suits.</p>

<p>Israeli military budget is far higher than any other government
budget.</p>

<p>Institutionalized military violence shows up in the home with
spouse abuse and other violence.</p>

<p>I was moved to tears after a video Eilat showed.  Real bullets
being used on protestors with no weapons.</p>
