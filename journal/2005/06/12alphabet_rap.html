<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Today there was a summer festival on the top deck: lots of people
wearing yukatas (summer versions of kimonos (basically brightly
colored cotton robes)) and performing different performances.</p>

<p>I saw a bit of an arm wrestling contest and the winners of the
bikini contest (including David in a wig and Petra's bikini bottom (he
lost the top)).  Then we had to break for our GET meeting and dinner,
but then busted up there again for the nightlife version of the
festival.</p>

<p>People (including Yama, one of my students) sang karaoke, performed
dances, improvised stuff and were generally genki and crazy-fun.  I
didn't understand most (97%) of the overgenki screeching pairs of kids
going up on stage (5 x 5 foot wooden platform built over the jacuzzi)
and I was about to leave, but then りえ (Rie), the woman with whom I
was standing, said they were looking for random talent.</p>

<p>I've got some random talent.</p>

<p>I was like, "if you'll translate the introduction for me, I'll do
something."  She was like, "okay," and I set out to find someone who
could lay down some phat voice percussion.</p>

<p>I saw only one other person who I knew knew English: Greg.  He said
he couldn't beat box and that I should look for Shawn.  Then he saw
Sakota and said I should ask him.</p>

<p>Sakota, though in charge of audio, was game.  Money.</p>

<p>It was a bit weird after りえ said [yeah] to answer the MC's call
for talent, and I kinda walked up but the MC said 「ちょっと待って」so
I backed up, cause I thought he was still talking about the previous
act, but then I realized the spotlight was on me.</p>

<p>The MC asked something, and I guessed he was asking my name, so I
told him, and everything seemed cool.  I heard a couple of girls in
the audience shout 「ロブ!」, which I enjoyed.  Then he asked
something else, and I was like, 「わかんない」 (I don't understand)
and he gestured: [do you want to go up on the stage?] and I was like,
"yeah! (of course!)"</p>

<p>Headed toward the stage with spotlight blinding me as I walked
toward and through a bit of the crowd to get to the stage.  りえ came
as well and I introduced her, 「私の日本語はにがて。だから、友だちリエ
はtranslateしましょう。」</p>

can do voice percussion..." and I saw Sakota with his hands up in the
back.  Nice!  "Sakota!  Comeon up here!"</p>

<p>He came up, and then I explained the story behind the rap.</p>

<pre>
My brother and I used to play the alphabet game.  For example, I say
"apple," then he says "apple banana," then I say "apple banana chair,"
and he says, "apple banana chair dog," etcetera.  However, when we
play, we use really long sentences.

One day I was like, "Hey Fred, do you want to play the alphabet
game?"

And he said, "awright."

"awright" starts with A, so I said, "is that your first word?"

He sighed and then agreed.

<p>I had りえ hand over the mic to Sakota (didn't thank her publically
though) and he started his beatbox.  The way he does it includes
miming scratching a record with some appropriate beats.  Nice.</p>

<p>He got into it and I slowed him down to about half speed, which
turned out to still be a bit faster than Fred and I perform it.  I let
the beats roll around to a beginning 8 and I hoped it would go
well.</p>

Awright
Botanical petrified garden inspector says
Camp happy is the place to be
Dogleg curves can kill a man
Eggnog salad does a humjivin' dance
Five fingered Freddy flipped off a frog
G went and got himself a ten dollar cat
Humdigaddidumdigadidumdumdoo
I said to the girl you can't do that no mo
Just last tuesday I want to the beach
Killin' time: it ain't so bad after all
Later with a sunburn, I went to the mall
Maniac drivin' is the best way to be
Nearin' a clearin' I was hearin' a shearin'
On a pink barge I built a saloon
Prolly a hundred people got there by noon
Queuein' a cue, but I sunk it and scratched
Ripped a hole in my pants so I got me a patch
Slitherin' snakes: they use Converse to run
Ten minutes later, Jeff walked in
U is a sheep, but also a dude
Verbal puns have gotten really crude
What, what, what what what what
Xcruciating circumstances permit a misspelling
Yes, I always keep forgettin' your rhymes
Zombie with an attitude says do it one more time

(two times)

<p>To my sheer and utter delight, it was fantastic.  I'd love to see
it on video sometime.</p>
