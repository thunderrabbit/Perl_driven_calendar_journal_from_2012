<p>Today has been a good day.  I've gotten a bit done on my
curriculum: I basically want to use these 15 days to teach the
students a bit of a debate discussion.  I wonder if they'll handle it
easily.  We'll see.</p>

<p>This was the night the magician performed, and the third night of
Silent Football.  We had 11 participants, including (for the first
time) a non-Japanese: Niveen.  Hitomi came and helped CC, and we had
no issues regarding scuba diving or not.  I'm thankful for that.  If
this keeps up, I'll ask her to dive with me in Acapulco or Costa
Rica.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have one more day at sea before Barcelona, during which
time I hope to meet Caesar, though I didn't go to an internet cafe in
Italy so I've not gotten any final details from him.  I can check
internet on the boat, but it's reallly expensive.</p>

<p>I've not put any pictures in my journal entries.  That's a
dramatically time consuming process that I'd like to get started
on.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is our Cinderella play.  I'm evil step sister #2.  I've
learned all my lines I think, and I wrote them all on a postcard to
janette.  If she gets them translated, I wonder what she (and the
translator) will think.  The Japanese is apparently very rude.</p>

<p>Tonight I'm supposed to meet Niveen for another lovely chat on the
back of the boat at midnight.  Before then, I'd like to work a bit
more on my curriculum and lesson plans.</p>

<p>I'm on tape 9 for recording and tape 3 for transcribing.</p>

<p>Niveen has invited me to come to Palestine to work for an NGO
there.   I'm tempted to do it because I'm pretty ignorant of that
part of the world.</p>
