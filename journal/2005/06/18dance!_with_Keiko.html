<p>Oh my gosh.  After we chilled on the wall for a bit, during which
time I was no longer eyeballing strangers in
I'll-kill-you-if-you-try-anything mode, but still in you-lookin-at-me?
mode, we walked back toward the ship.</p>

<p>There seemed to be some sort of commotion across the street from
the entrance.  That commotion included music and cheering, so we went
over to investigate.  It was basically a dance party in the street,
and Keiko's friends Eri and Riko were there dancing and hamming it up
for the crowd!</p>

<p>I remained in hard-intense guard mode for a while, never letting
Keiko (and her gyrating body) leave my sight.  I recorded them on my
little camera, and soon enough, I decided the crowd was harmless.  I
relaxed a bit and recognized that I also wanted to dance.</p>

<p>I didn't want to scare anyone with overly dramatic seizures of
dance, so I just began to wiggle a toe at first.  Then a foot tap
included a little knee shake and it all ignited into Rob's Crazy
Dance.  Little kids tried to out boogie me; older guys, with quite
direct eye contact and slight smiles, tried to show me their own
versions of more hip-wiggling dances, which I tried for a bit, but
just got back into my own groove of the music.</p>

<p>There were some women and young girls in the crowd, all wearing
burqas, and only one older grandma type willing to dance.  I tried
smiling an invitation to some of the others to dance.  Plenty of shy
smiles all around, but they didn't want to dance.  Fair enough.</p>

<p>Some guys left, came back for more dancing, and worked to
communicate across our language barriers.  I was introduced to
someone's someone and we danced and it was great.</p>

<p>I'd be facing one way, dancing with someone and then get a
taptaptap on my shoulder and turn around and be shown the latest
dance move by someone else.</p>

<p>We became so popular in that crowd that it was literally difficult
to leave...  They were literally like, "noooooo" and people trying to
pull us back in for more fun. But Riko and Eri had already left.  I
was drenched in sweat, as was Keiko.  We agreed it was time to go.</p>

<p>For the few people who could speak English, who were all telling me
how greatly we had danced, I was like, "you can do it; you have the
same ability to dance as anyone."</p>

<p>I talked to Kim in the hall once we were back on the ship.  She had
an equally awesome time.  What a great friendly city!</p>
