<p class=date>late late</p>

<p>Fucking talked to Hitomi for an hour and forty minutes.  Basically,
fucking give it up; I don't want to talk to you; I don't want anything
with you; fuck off, but I don't say it that meanly; I try to speak
clearly and fucking use words that make sense to me; I can't say, "I
encourage you not to expect that of me," I have to dumb it down to
"don't think about me" which doesn't even make sense, but it's what
she understands.  I mean, jeez, even like cute Kin gets a single
word, and inconsequential stuff,  "the sea is blue."  Who fuckin'
cares??  We're not talking about relationship issues and free will
and shit like that.  And I have to fucking plan lessons.  Just get
the fuck out of my life.  When she finally leave me alone, all I can
do is cry.  It's a fucking nightmare.</p>
