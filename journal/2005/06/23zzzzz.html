<p>I'm tired.  June 22nd is the night Hitomi cried and said "I'm
sorry; this is your PB; you can do what you want to do."
After that is when I threw 1/4 of my staff into the water.  I let her
throw 1/8th in, and I threw 1/8th.  I haven't done work since that
time, but I had a good day running around Italy.</p>

<p class=note>(what?  I thought that was June 21st.  Maybe it's off
cause I was so tired at the time I recorded it.)</p>
