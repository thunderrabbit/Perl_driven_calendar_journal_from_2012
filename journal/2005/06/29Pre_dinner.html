<p>Today is the day I am going to GET Got by Keiko and her belly
dancing friends.  I'm all dressed in dark suit and tie and dark shoes
and fancy blue plastic 100 yen watch.</p>

<p>Today I missed the France port orientation (oops), but didn't get
any trouble for it.  I have my super beginner and beginner lesson
plan finished for tomorrow, and have already given it to Shinji, my
downbunk mate.  (bunk below mine)</p>
