<p class=dream>Basically I was organizing communication between two
groups who were very upset with each other.  I didn't know the issues,
but people were mad and arguing in the street.  I was in the middle
and they had guns on both side and I was like, "hey, no fighting," I
am an unarmed man in the middle of you guys.  "What's the deal?  Okay,
you get your people together and give me six points of what you want."
I went to the other group and looked for someone to tell the same
thing.  For whatever reason I couldn't find someone, but the point is
I was right there in the middle of this street fight with machine guns
and all that.  Rar.  That was my dream.</p>
