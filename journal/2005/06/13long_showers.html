<p>I've got the perfect costume for tonight's costume party thing!</p>

<p>HAhahaha Shawn and I were just arguing over who gets to go in the
shower second.  "No no; *you* go first."  "No no; you go first.."
Then Shawn, without laughing goes, "my indian name is 'long showers'
.. you go first."</p>

<p>Oh my gosh Shawn is so funny!!!</p>
