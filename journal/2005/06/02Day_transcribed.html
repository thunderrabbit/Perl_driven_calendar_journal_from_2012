<p class=date>1:50pm Thursday 2 June 2005 day after Singapore</p>

<p>Today is a day off for us; usually the days after ports will be
days off.  Today I went to the scrapbooking workshop and made a single
page that said "WASSAP!" in purple glitter, but the glitter partly
wiped off, so I just wiped the rest off and there's just slightly
sticky spots left.  We were told to use a hairdryer to cure the glue.
But I didn't bring my hairdryer cause I don't own a hair dryer.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a nap nap nap and then at 3 o'clock is the fruit
party!  yay!  We'll get to chow fruit.  Aight.</p>
