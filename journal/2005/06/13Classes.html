<p>I'm getting excited about Silent Football; not that it's coming up,
but I was just reading about what I had written before on my site.
Click on YRUU, then click on Silent Football, Foot Motions, Rules, and
you'll see what I'm talking about.  Enjoying YRUU and janette days in
my mind.</p>

<p>I have six minutes before I gotta be in class.  THREE teachers
were late yesterday, so we are all being punished and have to be
there 10 minutes early.</p>

<p>We get four days of vacation, but the rest of the days will be in
ports.</p>

<p>Just did the first class using Natalie's slideshow and "Imagine",
and it went really really well.  But there was no *singing* of
"Imagine" as such.  I'm pretty sure Koji would not be down with
singing of any flavor..  He's not to the point he is so old that he'll
wear a purple hat, but he is old enough that he doesn't want to try a
bunch of new things.  We had a good class.</p>

<p>This morning my first class was lovely; the Imagine song lesson by
Natalie was great great great!</p>

<p>This afternoon my second class was quiet, and 66% of them were (a
little bit) late.  The Imagine song lesson was over their heads.  I
switched to talking about writing postcards and emails.</p>
