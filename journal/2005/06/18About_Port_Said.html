<p>Port Said (<a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/suez/suez14.htm">Egypt
govt</a>) is situated on the north end of the Suez Canal (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal">wikipedia</a>, <a
href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/suez/suez010.htm">Egypt govt</a>), which
runs north-south from the Red Sea (between Africa and the Middle East)
to the Mediterranean Sea (between Africa and Eastern Europe).</p>

<p>The Suez Canal was dug between 1860 and 1870 after Mohammed Said
said, "yo man, hook it up" to a French cat named Lesseps.  It's after
Said that Port Said is named.</p>

<p><a

is the title of the Turkish rulers over Egypt between 1867 and 1914,
so it's interesting to see some sites (<a

<em>Khedive</em> Said authorized the canal in 1859.</p>
