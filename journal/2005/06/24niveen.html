<p>I've just spent two hours talking to Niveen.  We didn't get onto
the topic of Israeli occupation of Palestine, but instead she showed
me the Arabic alphabet.  The fucked up thing is the letters change
shape depending on where they are in the word.  But, that's arguably
true for English - they change shape depending on where they are in
the sentence.</p>

<p>I showed her the hiragana and a few kanji.  ª≥°°¿Ó°°≥§</p>

<p>An interesting thing about the Arabic letters is they have similar
shapes with different numbers of dots around them.  There is some
consistency to the chaos of this language.</p>
