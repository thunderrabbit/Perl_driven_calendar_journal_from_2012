<p class=date>2:01am</p>

<p>I found Natalie in Sports Bar and gave her a 30 minute back massage
in exchange for Francois.  I heard from Dave that Natalie had
Francois, but when I was all, "Natalie, have you seen Francois?  I'm
really worried about him.." and she would cover her bag and say
"nope..; haven't seen him.."</p>

<p>Tonight I was like, "alright, Natalie, I have *got* to find my
rabbit.  I will do anything that takes less than an hour."</p>

<p>She was like, "you can give me a ten minute massage and I will
look for him."</p>

<p>"Ten minutes?  He must not be worth very much to you."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to really put you out just to get your rabbit
back."</p>

<p>Later, I found her and gave her a real hug, and was all, "really
truly thank you for recovering my rabbit for me.  I have definitely
enjoyed working with you since we've been on the ship," etc etc and
she returned the compliments.</p>

<p>I gave her a 30 minute massage in her room, with no funny
business, especially considering all three of her roommates were
there: Petra, Yoshiko, and Katt.</p>

<p>Katt is really really really really really particular.  Today
she was going through earrings, looking for appropriate earrings for
tomorrow, and I don't mean just one pair for the day.  She has like,
all the cutsie stuff that would just drive me bananas.</p>

<p>Right now I am just thinking I will stay local in France, though I
don't know who will be there.</p>

<p>Okay, goodnight</p>

<p>I know I am up super late every night, but I figure I can sleep in
after PB.  One of the guys on the 48th voyage, during the
handover meeting said, "don't sleep; you can sleep after PB;
it goes by soo quickly."</p>
