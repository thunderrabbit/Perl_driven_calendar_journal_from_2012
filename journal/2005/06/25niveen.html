<p>Woah.  It's late.  About 20 minutes ago I walked Niveen to her room
after she spent at least an hour telling me some of the history of the
nightmare situation that she lives in every day.  Stable checkpoints
and flying checkpoints require her to stop and answer questions.  Her
version of the story is basically the Israelis (Jews displaced in the
German Holocaust) have (with American support) invaded her country and
taken her rights with the intent of ultimately erasing the Palestinian
identity.  Palestinians are forced to live in camps separated from
each other around Jerusalem.</p>

<p>She is nearly forced to disown her Palestinian identity because,
for example, she can hardly travel in Egypt if she says she's from
Palestine.  (( The more detailed story: she was born in Jordan so she
has a Jordanian passport, but isn't allowed to get a Palestinian
passport and doesn't want an Israeli passport.  When she presented her
Jordanian passport in Egypt but said she was Palestinian, they nearly
took her passport from her.</p>

<p>She wants to be Palestinian.  I imagine they want consistency in
passports' written and passport holders' spoken identities.</p>

<p>She said I really should come to see for myself what it's like.</p>
