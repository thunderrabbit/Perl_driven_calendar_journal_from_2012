<p>Just finished my second class.  For homework I was like, "write
some statements."  Yuuko asked "how many statements?"</p>

<p>I said, "Five hundred."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask.  You choose."</p>

<p>She used one of today's phrases and goes, "no way,"</p>

<p>"Very good," I said, "natural English for disagreeing."</p>

<p>Then Rie goes, "today's homework: how many statements?"</p>

<p>I ignored the fact that she hadn't understood any of the previous
discussion.  "500."</p>

<p>"What?  Five?"</p>

<p>"No.  Look.  Don't ask.  If you want to learn English, you will
write 500.  If you don't care, write zero.  It doesn't matter to me.
I don't care.  I will read and check any homework you do."</p>

<p>I think I should have bitched at them in Japanese at that point.</p>
