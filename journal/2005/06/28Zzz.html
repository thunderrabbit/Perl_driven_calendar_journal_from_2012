<p>Oh, also today, after GO I was sitting with Shawn on the top
deck.  That was a short chat, but definitely good.  I walked with
Audrey on her walk around the deck, for which no one else showed up.
I guess getting a couple of people to show up for Silent Football is
better than zero.  I wrote a postcard to Bryn.  Actually 2:  one in
English and one in Japanese.  I squeezed in double lines on the
English version.</p>
