<p class=date>6:40am Thursday 09 June 2005</p>

<p>At 4am I got up and pooed a bit then took a shower.  Feelin'
better, but not 100%.  Trying to get ready for classes at 9am.  I'm
wearing my jammie jams out and about in the hall.</p>

<p class=date>8:31am</p>

<p>It sounds like I'm feeling better; I just listened to the previous
entry, but I'm not optimal.  Just took a shower and am no longer
wearing jammie jams.  Didn't get my lesson planned to the degree I had
hoped.  I have some pictures of signs around the boat and I told
students to take pictures of or write down the words of signs on the
boat they didn't understand or thought were interestng.  Plan to
discuss them today.</p>

<p>I synchronized my classes again so I can do the same thing in
each.</p>

<p>I'm going to go eat now, but am not sure what would be good for me
to eat.</p>

<p>I'm actually thinking about Hitomi and her letter that she wrote
me after I told her to piss off.  I don't want her to piss off, but I
just want her to not expect anything from me.</p>

<p class=date>9:00am</p>

<p>Shit.  That was not a fart I cut in the dining room, but I was in
the middle of talking to Keiko and Maho and didn't want to be all,
"oh, would you please excuse me while I go change my diaper?" and now
there is a bit of a wet spot on the back of my shorts I am embarassed
to say.  Back to my room to clean up and then go to class at 9:30.</p>
