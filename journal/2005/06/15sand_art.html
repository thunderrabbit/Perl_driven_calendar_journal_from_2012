and one for my mom.  I considered getting one for janette, but decided
these tapes will be enough.</p>

<p>The guy named an amazing price for putting names inside the jars,
so I was like, "aight" and eager to see how he could possibly
position each sand grain to spell out a letter, much less a name!
Holy crap, how could it be possible for only $4???  The economy must
be realllly depressed here in Jordan.  It's a steal!</p>

<p>He got out his pocketknife and dug out the sand from the top of
the jar I had selected.  Then, in a quick deft of incredible
sand-positioning skill, he took a little toothpick, dabbed some glue
on it and wrote the name backwards inside the jar.  He shook some
sand around and that was it.  Bingo: one name written in sand inside
the jar.</p>

<p>Welp, he didn't say he would postion each grain, and it certainly
is a good use of glue, and a better use of time than doing it the way
I was thinking.</p>
