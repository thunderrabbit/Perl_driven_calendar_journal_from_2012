<p>Most of the GET Introductions have been zany, but this one was more
seriously oriented.  We all answered short questions and then randomly
some of us answered longer questions.  We had very little preparation
(being so busy) and didn't start preparing until 22 hours before it
was to start.  Just threw it together.</p>

<p>One of the questions: "What is a hobby you had as a child, but no
longer have?"  I explained that we had dogs and they had yummy dog
biscuits that I enjoyed eating.  Katt, having just heard some of
my stories and totally lost it with laughter.  I love this picture of
her.</p>
