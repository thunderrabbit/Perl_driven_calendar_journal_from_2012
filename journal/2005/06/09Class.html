<p>Good class today.  Near the end of class a woman came in all, "are
you Rob?"</p>

<p>"yes.."</p>

<p>"How about dinner tonight?"</p>

<p>"Okay!  What time?"</p>

<p>She consulted someone outside the room. "Seven?"</p>

<p>"I might be a little late; I have a meeting until seven.  How
about seven ten?"</p>

<p>More consultation.  "Okay.  In Yacht Club okay?"</p>

<p>"Sounds great!  What's your name?"</p>

<p>「ちぐ」(chigu)</p>

<p>"Okay; see you at 7:10."</p>

<p>I imagine that was part of her class homework.  I wonder which
teacher!</p>

<p>Shunji's 73rd birthday is in a few days and he planned a party so
we are invited to that.</p>

<p>Oh shit I'm not feeling too good right now; a bit lightheaded.</p>

<p>We made a birthday card for him; printed out his picture on the
color printer and I gave it to Aki to make the card.</p>
