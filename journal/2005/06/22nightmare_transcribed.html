<p>Right now I am going to throw one quarter of the stick off the
back of the boat in a theraputic way.  And <em>someone</em> is coming
with me.  I wish she would get her own fucking life and a clue.</p>

<p>I just finished talking to Hitomi and throwing the stick off.  I
don't fucking hate her; I just hate the situation.</p>

<p>What a fuckin' nightmare.</p>

<p>Still have to do curriculum shit.  Can't even focus on anything
except how angry / sad / fucked up I am over having to deal with the
relationship bullshit.</p>
