<p>This morning I called Niveen; we had planned to meet at 11pm
yesterday but I was working as the doorman / bodyguard at Mafia Night.
I was impressed that I stayed for (nearly) three hours at the door,
just saying "password" to those who wanted to come in.  I pretty much
stayed in character the whole time despite several attempts to break
me.</p>

<p>Anyway, I felt it necessary to talk to Hitomi last night so I
didn't meet up with Niveen after Mafia Night, so I'm glad I got her
number during dinner yesterday as a fallback plan.  We're going to
meet at 8am in Yacht Club for breakfast and then meet her other peeps
at 9am in reception.</p>

<p>I'm hoping wander around alone or with one other person.  I'd enjoy
walking around with her so we can continue our discussion of
religion.</p>
