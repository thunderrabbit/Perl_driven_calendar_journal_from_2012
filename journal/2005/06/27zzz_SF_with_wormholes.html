<p>Silent Football was low on numbers tonight; we had a total of 6
people (not including myself), but only a max of 3 other players at a
time.  We therefore resorted to including chairs as players to whom we
could neither fwap nor zoom, and added a wormhole between two human
players (Hitomi and Maki).  Hitomi asked for the wormhole to be
changed after a while and suggested that chairs could be the start of
one way wormholes to players.  We played that way for a while, with a
chair pointing to me and a chair pointing to Hitomi.  I fwapped and
shrugged twice to myself at one point just to play with the
possibility.</p>

<p>We've just had another laminating party: Pat, Maryann, Kim and Greg
laminated their covers.  Greg tried but ultimately chose not to feed
paperclips as staples through the binder.  Pat just wrapped a
rubberband around it.  Natalie is going to use paperclips, and I'm
glad about that.  It's definitely a pain, but gives a much better
product.</p>

<p>I've just whipped out ideas for my three Advanced level Open GET
classes.  Basically discussions, two ideas were my own:</p>

<p>1) Do we need more greenspace in Tokyo?  Why?  What three or four
step plan can we use to bring more greenspace?</p>

<p>2) What would you do if you had a gremillion dollars?  (after you
saved the world and paid your bills)</p>

<p>And then this question that Aaron was asking at Millenium House:
What three ideas have had the most dramatic affect on civilization in
the last 200 years?</p>
