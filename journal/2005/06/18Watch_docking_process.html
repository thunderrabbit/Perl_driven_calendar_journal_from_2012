<p>We are docking now in Port Said, and for the first time that I've
seen, docking on the port side of the ship.  Usually we dock with the
gangplank on the starboard side for exiting purposes.  Good thing the
ship is multi-talented.</p>

<p>We've docked in Port Said, Egypt!!  I'm writing this before
actually getting off the ship; they say the internet cafes have USB
connections so I can upload data that way.  I may copy all my journal
entries online in this manner.</p>

<p>This was the first time I had seen the docking process, since we
have always arrived at like 7am in other ports.  No way am I awake for
that.  I was all excited to see how they do it, so I ran up to the top
deck to squeeze myself through the crowd a bit to get a view of the
docking procedure.  It wasn't as dramatic as I hoped it would be.  No
huge ropes being thrown: A small boat comes to the ship and someone on
our ship drops a big ass rope to them.  The boat takes the rope to the
dock where it is hooked around the saddlehorn looking things.  Do that
a few times on both sides of the ship and then slowly tighten the
ropes, which pulls the ship to the dock.  Effective, but boring.</p>

<p>I'm super far behind (at least it feels that way, though a few
hours of free time would catch me up) in transcribing my tapes: I'm
about to finish recording on tape 7, but my transcription is lagging
on tape 3, back in Singapore.  Or actually the night we left
Singapore.</p>

<p>Today I studied three different languages: Japanese (twice, plus
chatting), Spanish (a bit with Adriana teaching other GET teachers),
and Hebrew (?) (shit; what language was it??) with Niveen teaching
anyone who was interested.</p>

<p>Also today I helped Hitomi with iPhoto on her computer.  Honestly I
wasn't very understanding/really helpful.  I had shown her before and
at that time she seemed to understand it, so this time I wasn't as
happy to teach her.</p>
