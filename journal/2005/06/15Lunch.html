<p>Lunch will be right next to an internet cafe.  Awright.</p>

<p>For lunch we were stuffed with pitas and all sorts of different
dips: babaganoush, yogurt and nuts, something and something else.  But
that was just the appetizer, and they brought out the fish.  Whole
fish.  With heads and eyes lookin' off the plates at us.</p>
