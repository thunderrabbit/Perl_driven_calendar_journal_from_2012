<p>The ship is rocking well.  Some people are seasick.  I'm loving it,
though.</p>

<p>Classes are over.  Basically a storm came in between the first and
second class.  I lost two of my students from the second half of the
second class.  Rie and Toko were like, "later!"  all tossing around.
It was kinda fucked up; I was like, "aight let's go upstairs so you
can get some fresh air," so the girls who were not sick went upstairs
and the girls who were sick left the class.</p>

<p>But the good thing is I just got food in time: class and food
ended right at 2pm.</p>

<p class=date>2:26pm</p>

<p>I wasted no time getting trunks and running up to the pool, but
once I got there they were closing it.</p>

<p class=date>2:54pm</p>

<p>I just finished talking to Armstrong, a huge guy from Jamaica with
strong arms.  He's got a huge handshake.  He said we should definitely
go to Ocho Rios, which is about an hour something from the port.  He
says it's really beautiful.  I love getting the inside scoop
there.</p>

<p>It's a wavy day today.  Oh; I need to change my clock.</p>

<p class=date>3:08pm ICT Friday 03 June 2005</p>

<p>And before we get to Sri Lanka in a couple days we will gain one
hour.  Weird; emacs got flubbed up when I changed the time.  Now when
it gets to the end of a line, it adds some text before the new
line.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, today it's wavy and I ran down to get my trunks to go jump
in the pool but I was denied access.  The guy was putting the net over
the pool as the water was being drained.  The water had been sloshing
blastingly from side to side in rolling waves that crashed against
each side of the pool and sprayed up and everywhere.  I was told I
could go into the kiddie pool or the jaccuzzi, and I was like,
"pleeease; just for five minutes?"</p>

<p>Then I heard a voice from (above-ish) in the life boat:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>spoken not loudly, except just enough to be heard over the general
splashiness and wind.</p>

<p>It was the Captain.</p>

<p>Haha; Homer Simpson's voice in my mind:</p>

<p><em>Oh, I'm the captain, I get to choose if you swim or not.  I
don't want you to crash against the side of the pool and die.  la la
la.</em></p>

<p>Fair enough; sour grapes; do it later.  Get my own cruise ship.</p>

<p>At the very least, I hope to see it again so I can take some
video.</p>
