<p class=date>7:29pm CEST Saturday 25 June 2005</p>

<p>Just hit the internet for 23 expensive minutes (500 yen for each
portion of 15 minutes) and was happy to see some emails from my mates.
I didn't see an email from Caesar, who I'm supposed to meet tomorrow
in Barcelona.  He sent me a copy of his passport so he can get on the
ship, but I don't have any contact info for him.  I didn't think to
email him and ask for his digits or something.  I had expected him to
give some ideas on when/where to meet, but ..  ah well.</p>

<p>I wasn't really impressed with the slowness of the internet, nor
the price, so I scribbled FUCK in the area where I was supposed to
write my initials.</p>

<p>We had our GET meeting outside today!  The meeting was fast (only
45 minutes) and sunny (no clouds in sight).</p>

<p>Chillin' in GET Room 4 now; Nicole (from Brisbane) is talking to
Takako (from Kagoshima, Japan, whose English is decent.  Good
vocabulary).</p>
