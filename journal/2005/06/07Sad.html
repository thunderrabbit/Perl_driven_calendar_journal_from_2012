<p class=date>3pm LKT Tuesday 07 June 2005</p>

<p class=note>Right now as I type, it is 2pm on September 8th.  I was
just listening to the carimba and flute, enjoying it nicely, then got
a huge shock when the next recording was my voice, obviously sad and
crying.  Like, I got chills, and didn't want to listen to it.</p>

<p>3pm or so.  (big sobbing breath) I feel sad.  (sob) Because I do,
um, Hitomi confronted me about not having kept my promise to go scuba
diving in Jamaica with her, and I judge she didn't say it in a very
nice way; she called me names and stuff.  I came to my room, and she
came down and she was like, [knock knock] and she was angry and she
wouldn't let me leave until she talked to me.  I'm like, "fucking go
away leave me alone I don't like you I don't want you on PB I
don't want to talk to you blah blah blah blah blah blah" and she was
like, "why?" and I'm like, "I don't fucking trust you.  You won't let
me leave my room; you didn't tell me [you were coming on] PB
and all this stuff" and she was like, "so?" and I'm like
"jesusfuckingchrist that is the point I don't trust you," and she's
like... I dunno, and then she cried, cause she was basically like,
"wah wah wah" and I just didn't say anything cause I don't fucking
know, and then she left, and I started to cry.</p>

<p>During my angry moment while she was in my room, I grabbed the Mt
Fuji staff that I bought in Fifth Station on Mt Fuji and took it to
Eighth Station then brought specifically cause I thought it would be
cool to have it go around the world with me; it might "add value" to
the stick, and slammed it to the ground in a huge WACK and broke it
into four nearly equal sized pieces right in front of Hitomi so she
could be horrified at how much she's fucking pissing me the fuck off
that I would destroy a beloved possession instead of punching her
sorry ass in the face.</p>

<p>It's just like, "come the fuck on, Hitomi, get the fuck over me."</p>

<p>I don't know why we are doing this to each other.  The karma is
just like a nightmare.  What the fuck is going on.  I thank my angels
for giving me the experiences we are supposed to have; and that we
both grow and learn from our situations, and that we'll both have a
good time for the duration of our PB voyage.  Blessed be.</p>

<p>-- - </p>

<p>During the time that I wasn't saying anything after she cried, I
thought about throwing the pieces of the staff into the water and how
they would float around and how they would slowly be eaten by
water-living stick-eaters, perhaps.  But I don't know if I can toss
it over during the day or of I should do it at night, or if I should
do them one per day or all in one big pile.</p>

<p>For some reason I think it's appropriate to find her in her room
and ask her if she wants to throw them into the water with me.</p>

<p class=date>4:34pm</p>

<p>Probably talked to her for 30 minutes just now, and by talk I mean
not talk to her very much because I can't fucking understand her and
she can't fucking understand me, and that ended up being the crux: I
was like, "I can't understand you," and she's like, "because you
don't try" and I'm like, "because I *don't* want to work hard on a
relationship right now," and she's like, "I'm sorry to hear that,"
and she left.</p>

<p>That is it; I don't want to work very hard on a relationship right
now; I just want to work on myself, but sometimes I judge I don't do
that very well, but that's what it is.  I would like to take a few
minutes out right now to plan my day - the remainder of it; I can't
believe it's already 4:45.</p>

<p>Especially considering that before this chaos, I went swimming and
we had a swimming pool load of fun doing handstand competitions and a
lot of GET Teachers did hand stands and we made a whirlpool in the
kiddy pool and Shawn and Ippei, then Shawn and Dave played Walrus Wars
on the edge of the pool on their bellies to see who could knock the
other into the pool and it was all kinds of fun.</p>

<p>I went to get a towel and I saw Hitomi who I could see was upset
and I was like, "what's wrong?" and she said her stomach hurts, but
then the real reason, "Rob is е╨ел" which means 'fool' or 'idiot' and
I'm like, "aw god" and we talked about how I cancelled our promise to
go scuba diving in Jamaica.</p>

<p>When I was like, "leave me the fuck alone," she could see I was
upset and caressed my hair/face, but it was not done out of
compassion, but as insult, which really pissed me off and I was like,
"don't touch my face."  But then she brought up a good point, although
I don't actually remember this, when I told her I wanted to go on Ocho
Rios tour instead of going scuba diving with her, I could tell she was
upset so, in an attempt to comfort her, I kinda caressed her hair /
face.  Apparently she didn't like it, but she sure didn't tell me at
that time.</p>

<p>But the bottom line is I don't want to fucking do relationship
with her, but at the same time I want to get involved with Kim
because she's tall; she's cute; she's new; she's fun..  I gotta just
get in touch with myself.</p>

<p class=date>4:54pm</p>

<p>That's nice; the staff basically fits back together and I have
super glue, so it's basically fixed.</p>

<p class=date>5:21pm LKT Tuesday 07 June 2005</p>

<p>It's ucky outside and I'm glad it worked out so that we got to play
while it was nice.  It's really crazy rain outside now.  I think.
I'm inside and sometimes it's hard to tell how hard it's raining just
by looking at the water.</p>

<p>It's realllly hard to tell how hard it's raining if we can't see
outside.</p>

<p class=date>7:40pm</p>

<p>I'm feeling better.  I've been busy; haven't really processed, but
I'm alive.  I might be going to dinner with Kim tonight - not sure.</p>

<p>Letter from Hitomi</p>

<pre>
I feel sad that you said words
It seems you try hard to communicate with Japanese on PB
but you can not try hard to do that with me
I understand that.  I think it's personality denial.
When we visited Da Nang we could not talk to much in English with
Vietnamese, but we had a good time with them and I think we were able
to communicate with them.

What is communicate?
What is PB?

What do you want to do on PB?

Hitomi
</pre>

<p>Nice.  I hadn't actually read that before I recorded it.</p>
