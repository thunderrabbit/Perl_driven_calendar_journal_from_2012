tonight!  Most awesome was my costume which I found in the costume
room: a blue long sleeve security guard shirt, red and yellow vertical
striped baggy clown pants, and monkey ears!!  Best monkey costume
ever!</p>

<p>I totally loved being in character: I galloped around with a
pitcher of beer to pour for people; I grabbed food off the trays and
ate with my hands; I picked and ate lice from peoples' hair; I sniffed
and snarfed around some of the other characters and generally just
made a cute nuisance of myself.  I decided I'd like to be a monkey at
every costume party I attend.</p>

<p>Especially if I can climb on more things.</p>

<p>On the top deck, I did a *bit* of climbing; crouching on chairs and
leaping off them, though I had to be careful because they move quite
easily on the rough plastic surface.</p>

<p>Several people wanted to take pictures with me, and I was happy to
do so.  For several of the initial photos, I did huge toothy grin and
squinty eyes, but later decided that it just made me look like I was
in seething pain or really angry.</p>

<p>Oops; getting tired.  I was really surprised to be one of three
costumes asked to compete in a fashion show.</p>

<p>I was super duper excited to <em>win</em> the contest!!!</p>
