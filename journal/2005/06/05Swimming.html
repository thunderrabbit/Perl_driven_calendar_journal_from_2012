<p>Just kicked it in the pool for a while with Shawn, Greg and Kin in
the small pool and then the jaccuzzi today.  We did handstands and
silly stuff; Shawn clapped his feet while upside down and I did monkey
flips and Greg did back flips.</p>

<p>I'm a couple minutes late to help go plan Arabian Night.  Right
about now I'm going to go see what time it is up there.  No pun
intended.  Well, it was somewhat intended.</p>
