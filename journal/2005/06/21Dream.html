<p>Today is Fred's birthday!</p>

<p class=dream>In a shop wanting to pick up a case of drinks cause I
saw some orange sodas available, but there wasn't a full case
available.  I started to put a case together, but realized I was
stacking up little spoon scoops (just the spoon part, not the handle)
that had been used by customers to try samples of some pudding
product.  I figured I could wash them off later.  When I finished
stacking them up, the woman who had been monitoring the table came up
and I was like, "can I take care of these for you?" and she was like,
"no," so I halfway dumped them out and said I was just indicating that
they were not clean so she wouldn't forget. She said not to worry; she
was going to wash all of them anyway.</p>

<p class=dream>I overheard another customer ask her where the sexy
burkas were located, and the woman said they were under the stairs in
a special adult only section.  I didn't think burkas were particularly
adult only so I woke up.</p>
