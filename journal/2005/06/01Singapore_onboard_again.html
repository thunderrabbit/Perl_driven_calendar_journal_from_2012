<p>There's a large ship called The Superstar Virgo across the pier
from us.  Inside the ship I saw two pairs of people walking.  One of
the first pair was wearing a full sized Garfield costume, and one of
the second pair was wearing a full sized Odie costume.  Kanae said she
saw something interesting going on there and asked if it was a Disney
ship.</p>

<p>There are six decks above the entrance deck, five of which have
access to the outside air, plus the very top deck so that's seven
decks, plus those that are below the main deck.</p>

<p>Their lifeboats have roofs, whereas ours do not.</p>

<p>It's a big boat.  Superstar Virgo.</p>

<p>When I talked to Kanae, she was smoking.  Looking back on my
experience at Kawasaki Nova, Benny would sometimes say "hey, when are
you going to stop smoking?" to people he saw smoking cause he had
watched his grandfather die of lung cancer from smoking and didn't
like to see his friends smoking.</p>

<p>I haven't seen my grandfather die of smoking, but I wondered why I
didn't say anything to Kanae.  She mentioned that she was not able to
get something done, and I was like, "aw that's too bad," kinda thing.
She goes, "yeah, I'll just have to give a lot of excuses," and I was
thinking, <em>why excuses?  just say what's up</em>, and I wondered
why I was thinking about that, but ...  the point is that I wonder why
I am trying to change people that I don't even really know; she's
really attractive, and it can be argued that I would like to date her
(if she didn't smoke), but it's not my place to try to change other
people.  Weird.</p>

<p>Been out on the front deck for a while; I thought we were leaving
at 10.  Hitomi thought we were leaving at 11:30; looks like she's more
right than I am.  There aren't any guys on the front deck with the
ropes, so we might not even be leaving yet.  The girls took some funny
funny funny pictures that I'd like to get copies of.</p>

<p>Singapore is a place where we get off the boat into the long wide
L shaped hallway along the boat then turns left into a mall.  Three
story mall.</p>

<p>Vietnam is a place that had no building at all; just a dock with
ropes.</p>

<p>Hong Kong had just one long ramp into a mall, no long L shaped
hallway, and customs was really trivial.</p>

<p>I'm standing at the door and the guys are standing here just
waiting to close up the ship.  Matt, Mariko and another woman ran onto
the ship to go pee and then ran off, just because they can cause they
know the guys (and they needed to pee).  I look forward to a time I
can do that.</p>

<p>Here are funny pictures from Hitomi's roommmates:</p>
