<p>Near the end of the GET meeting Allison and Emi gave us feedback
on the chat we had with our Iraqi guests.  It had gone really poorly,
and the response from some of the teachers was "we didn't attack her!"
in a defensive way, and I was like, "that was it!  That's what we
can't do." but no one seemed to get it.  Later, Allison thanked me
for having said that and for having gotten it.</p>
