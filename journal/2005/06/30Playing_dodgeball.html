<p>Just played dodgeball with a volleyball up on the top deck.  Fun
times, though the Japanese rules are different than what I'm used
to. They use only one ball at a time and catching the ball does not
make the thrower out.  Getting hit by the ball forces a player to the
edges of the opposite side of the court, and if that player ends up
with a ball and can hit someone on the other team, that player is
resurrected.</p>

<p>Now it's time for Niveen and Eilat's lecture.  They have
barricaded the door to make it look like a checkpoint.  I saw it, ran
down to get my tape recorder, came up and found I still was not
late.  The line hadn't moved at all.</p>
