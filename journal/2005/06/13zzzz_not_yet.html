<p>I finished the white chocolate, and I just have two things to do
for tomorrow.  Okay, I can do it super fast.. go!</p>

<p class=date>4:49am AST Tuesday 14 June 2005</p>

<p>I have slept, but I haven't slept in my room.  I slept for a bit
in GET Room 9 (my and Natalie's shared room).  I've been working on a
self evaluation for the students and on my Silent Football worksheet
thing to hand out a simplified version of the rules and language
necessary to those who come to the workshop.</p>

<p>I've scheduled myself for about 13 different dates over the next
while to see if I can Silent Football myself out.  I dunno if I will
still love it or hate it at the end of all that.</p>

<p class=date>5:23am</p>

<p>Going to bed now.  Alarm is set for 7:55, so I can give Yuuka my
jishukikaku (self-planned event (in my case, Silent Football)) date
request.</p>
