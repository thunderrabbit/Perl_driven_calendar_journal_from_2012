<p>We have arrived back at the ship and then left the ship
again.. Hitomi and I are walking from the ship toward the center of
town to see the huge flag and the sea and whatever else we can
find.</p>

<p>This city seems like it has such potential for huge growth.  The
boulevard is new yet not crowded with traffic; there are lots of lots
with some under construction.  Even old houses are still being used.
The Red Sea is utterly beautifully fantastic.  If nothing else, I
could just get scuba training license and teach people to dive here.
If there were enough wannabe divers, I guess.</p>

wrapper.</p>
