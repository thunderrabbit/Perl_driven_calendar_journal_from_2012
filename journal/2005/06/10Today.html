<p class=date>6:33am GST Saturday 11 June 2005</p>

<p>We entered a new time zone last night, and today is a holiday from
GET classes, so many teachers took an opportunity to party it up.</p>

<p>Yesterday:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Toko and Hanayo didn't show up again for class (Happy Wonderful
Girls).  They've missed quite a few lessons considering how few we've
had (6).</p>

<p>At 1:30, Mariko, Yuko, and Naoko left for the Petra orientation,
leaving only Ikuko and Rie.  Ikuko helped Rie catch up with the class;
I'm not sure if it's above Rie's head or what.</p>

<p>I told the girls (during one of their moments of silence) that they
can tell me what's in their heads, even if it's "I don't know" or "I
don't understand."</p></li>

<li><p>From 2pm to 10pm we had all Japanese day to psyche up the
students for all English day, which is today.  We carried sheets of
paper (telling the rules and duration) and people would draw smiley
faces if we successfully spoke in Japanese and Xs if we used
English.</p>

<p>During the day I had relatively long conversations with people in
Japanese, which arguably allowed fewer people to write smiley faces.
Many students tried to trick us by asking slash shouting "hello!" "how
are you today?"  "are you okay?" which was a bit annoying, but maybe
was the limit of their English abilities.</p>

<p>During the formal dinner, I sat by Yoshika, and she asked me a
question to which I answered (in English) "no"  Oops!  I told her it
wasn't English, but the japanese syllable の, pronounced "no."  She
knew I was full of it (and of course I was); there's no conceivable
reason to say の in answer to an English yes/no question.</p>

<p>So I came up with a proposition; I would write a haiku to
discourage the use of "no"</p>

<p>It was *far* more difficult than I thought.  Even ん and っ count
as syllables, and the unspoken final す of です counts as well.  But
Yoshiko helped a lot and we came up with this:</p>

<pre>
いいえって　      iiette            when no is
僕が言ったら      bokugaittara      spoken by me
良い子です。      iikodesu          I'm a good kid
</pre>

<p>I'm not sure if it's customary to have the 。 punctuation or not.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I had 0 Xs and 25 smiley faces.</p></li>

<li><p>I met a woman named Rie with whom I watched waves through the
7th floor window for a while.  She used the word 「あきない」"akinai"
which Yuuka translated as "never get bored."  Rie seemed rather
comfortable chatting with me and using the same window: beyond what I
would consider normal Japanese "customary shyness," and I wonder if
her shyness was affected by alcohol intake, though she said in her GET
class (Peace Text with Kris) she's the least shy person in
class.</p>

<p>I got bored (and secretly a bit motion sick) watching the waves,
so I suggested that we play GO, for there are tables along that side
of the deck with GO boards set up.</p>

<p>She taught me a different game, called gorarena (not called
gorarena) or something (it starts with 'go' and has either 'ra' or
're' in it and I think 'na'), which is quite similar to Pente, which
Fred and I played a lot as kids.</p>

<p>(I'm not done writing, but I have to stop for a sec)</p>

<p class=note>1:02am GST Sunday 12 June 2005</p>

<p>I think the game is called goranabe.</p>

<p>So she whipped my ass, generally speaking, even beating me at
Pente, at which I had planned to beat her.  She probably won 66% of
the games we played.  Both goranabe and pente.  Nice to find someone I
can aspire to.</p></li>

<li><p>Went upstairs and saw the Sri Lankan students stumbling out of
the Sports Bar and up to the Yacht Club.  I met them and definitely
learned Neshan's name: he has a scar on the back of his right hand
where he melted some Legos when he was 5 years old (built a crane then
lit it on fire) and the molten plastic seared his
hand.. Yeouch!</p>

<p>Also met Shalini and Gayani.</p></li></ol>
