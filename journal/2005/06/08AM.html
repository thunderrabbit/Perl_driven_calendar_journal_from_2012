<p>I forgot to mention that my GPS fell into the pool.  Though it is
described as waterproof, it quit working.  It's conceivable that it
will start working after it dries out, but I dunno.</p>

<p>Just finished the fourth lesson for my first class.  There's one
old cat who's funny and old and does his own thing.  He's going to
have a birthday in a few days, so a couple days ago, I was like, "hey
guys, he's going to have a birthday in a couple days; let's have a
party!" and we all agreed that we would keep it a secret, etc.</p>

<p>But then today, at the end of class, the other old guy, who is not
as old, but still older than me, was like, "hey, uh, Shunji, by the
way, I forgot when your birthday is..." and the class went silent
like, <em>that is not exactly the way to keep things a SECRET, you
know.</em> but we ignored it and him as if nothing was unusual, but
it's like, "c'mon man; even if *you* forgot when his birthday is, none
of *us* forgot!"a</p>
