<p class=date>8:04am SGT Friday 03 June 2005</p>

<p>This is the first day of classes.  The first classes have started.
My class doesn't start until 9:30.  I hope all the teachers are doing
well.  I've just woken up.  I'm going to go up to breakfast.  I don't
have a clear brain yet, but I trust today will be a lovely day of
classes, and it will be all good.  Rar.  Like dat.</p>
