<p>Big fun fun fun waving and cheering and yelling from the top deck
of the ship as we left.  Kamau did a call and response "Say HO!"
"HO!"  "Say HO HO!!"  "HO HO!"  I really enjoyed watching him work and
play while he was onboard (and onport).</p>

<p>Shawn recorded some video of GET teachers and their views of
different ports.  He goes, "so how did you like Sri Lanka?"  and I go
"Vietnam was totally awesome," knowing it might be a good ??? to say
Vietnam when he had asked about Sri Lanka. "And Sri Lanka was also
totally awesome.  BUT!  We were in Sri Lanka for only one day, while
we were in Vietnam for two days!"  Kim chimed in, "are you doing the
math here?"  "Now I'm not saying that Sri Lanka was better than
Vietnam; I need to spend more time in both before I can choose a
favorite."</p>

<p>Vietnam and Sri Lanka are the tops of the list for this cruise so
far.</p>

my hair in two days!" but I think really it was just that we had been
out by the sea for some hours.</p>
