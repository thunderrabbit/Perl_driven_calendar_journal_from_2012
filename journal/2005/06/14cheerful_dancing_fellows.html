<p>Just left Cheerful Dancing Fellows after having an awesome dinner
with them in Namihe.  Totally great group and totally forgiving of me
being *late*, which was heartbreaking to me, but I offered a makeup by
writing a haiku for them.  My haiku didn't pass muster: Koji says all
haiku must have an element of one of the four seasons.  It could be a
symbolic relation to the season, but something needs to be there.  So
my haiku, which I've forgotten, didn't pass muster.</p>

<p>We zipped outside for a bit to see the world go by as we slipped
into the small gulf at the northern end of the Red Sea.  On the west
bank, thousands of lights pool their resources to make a somewhat
shimmery coastline.  On the east bank, a surprisingly tall something
is crowned with what seems to be a ring of lights.</p>

<p>It seems impossibly tall for how far away it is, and impossibly
thin for how tall it is.</p>

<p>Or, it's just too dark to see what it is.</p>
