<p>I saw a guy selling sunglasses, and I was like, "I'll give you $10
for them," and he's like, "give me $30," and I'm like, "no - 10." and
he says, "okay, 12" and then I'm like <em>man, you sure dropped
fast</em> "no, 10." and he goes, "okay, $10." and I'm like, "woah;
that was my original price.  Should I have started even lower???"</p>

<p>Right now we are having the bestest freshest meal in the planet -
Audrey bought some huge roasted peppers and cheeses and roast onions
and basil and we are ripping them all apart and making sandwiches
using the peppers as bread.  So fresh; so delicious; so healthy; so
awesome!!</p>

<p>Hahah! Audrey was like, "dig in! I don't like people who don't help
themselves."</p>

<p>I laughed, and she goes, "I'm serious!"</p>

<p>Allison brought bread, and Natalie brought cherries.  So
amazing..</p>

<p>This was just after I had ordered ice cream and the guy was like,
"do you want it in a cup, cone or bun?" and I'm like, <em>whoah</em>
"bun" <em>of course!</em>  It was delicious!</p>
