<p>This evening before departure, some of us walked around in search
of foodage and fruit and souvenirs.  I bought some shampoo (Head and
Shoulders with Arabic instructions) and drinkable yogurt (got two
because they need to be refrigerated, but I could have easily consumed
three tonight.  Probably four).</p>

<p>Was unable to find the cafe where Natalie saw a guy and told him
she'd be back later, but we did find some rather large and
disconcerting inflatable Christmas decorations in a street
intersection with music playing loudly.</p>

<p>Bought ice cream on the way back and I bought my dad a cat for $7
plus a few Egyptian pounds.  The guy had started at $20 and I had
started at $3.</p>

<p>Tonight after departure we hung out in Sunshine Bar telling stories
as some of them smoked a hookah pipe.  Shawn ran from the cops; Greg
knows what happened to the cricket field, I jumped my dad's truck,
Elat learned about music boxes, Natalie knew her brother was okay,
Matt used his ex-work truck to get to Japan, and I can't remember
Brandt's story.</p>
