<p>I am in Topaz Dining with Cheerful Dancing Fellows, and Eminem's
"Mosh" is being played over the intercom.  Hilarious!</p>

<p>I'm physically okay, but not doing great emotionally.  Fuckin'
issue again with Hitomi.  I think I am ready to be done with her, but
apparently I am not.  I dunno what is the deal.  Wah wah wah wah.  I
miss my men's group.  I know that.  I miss talking to janette.  I know
that.  I'm 90% not doing more than flirting with women on the boat.
The 10% is not doing more, but thinking more.  What is the deal with
my brain?  I know I feel sad.  Sometimes it's hard for me to feel sad
on PB because there are very few safe places or people on
board.</p>

<p>I know I'm tired, but I'm more than 1/2 considering not "going
anywhere" tomorrow in Greece, but just hanging out and walking around
the port area, taking time for myself.</p>

<p>Basically two reasons for this: 1) I want to feel a bit more
settled about being ready for classes this next term, and 2) I had a
bit of an issue with Hitomi tonight.</p>

<p>Silent Football was fun (about 8 players at one point) and Hitomi
helped explain the rules and I was really happy and thankful for that.
Then she told me she had been unable to find information about scuba
diving in Greece.  She suggested that it would be better if we could
make a reservation and not waste time looking for a shop.  I was like,
"so how about we go in Acapulco?" cause that was one of the options
she suggested.</p>

<p>I suggested that if we go in Acapulco, we wouldn't go in Jamaica,
and I'd still be able to do the tour.  She said I was a liar (having
not already cancelled my Jamaica tour) and we didn't finish the
conversation before she walked away.</p>

<p>(yes, this is my version of the story, and it's biased toward me.)</p>

<p>Tonight I was happy to help Petra, Angie, and Kim laminate their
schedules at the laminating party.  We also did Kim's roommate's book.
I was a bit sad that more people didn't come, but those who did really
seemed to appreciate the lamination and the idea in the first
place.</p>
