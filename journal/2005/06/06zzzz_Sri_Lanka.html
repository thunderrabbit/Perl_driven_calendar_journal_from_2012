<p>I'm really tired.  I was falling asleep standing up in the
shower.  I got out and sat on Shawn's bed naked wondering how to
resolve the issue that I am clean, but all of my underwear is dirty.
I suddenly woke up all, "ah shit; it would not look good if Shawn
walked in here while I was sitting naked on his bed."  Good thing he
is still partying.</p>

<p>After that, I decided to put on swim trunks cause they are kinda
clean and kinda underwear.  Over those I put on my jammie jams.</p>

<p>Tonight I flirted with Kim pretty much a lot and felt myself
thinking, "hmmmmmm." ........

<p>Oh man I am falling asleep.  Jeramaiah was a bullfrog; he was a
good friend of mine.  He had a dada da da da.....</p>

<p>Oh man I am tired, thinking about a hose being unrolled like the
streamers, but manually, unlike the streamers.  I am really really
really really glad we went to Sri Lanka.</p>
