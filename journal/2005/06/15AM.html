<p>Today we have arrived in Al-Aqaba Jordan.  Last night between 10pm
and 11pm we could see lights on both sides of the ship as we sailed
into the small isthmus (is that the word?) at the top of the Red
Sea.</p>

<p>I hung out with the Sri Lankan students at their final party in
Sports Bar; it was a low key event, which I appreciated: not too much
smoking, and plenty of space on the dance floor.  Though I didn't
really dance.</p>

<p>This morning I've got the Indiana Jones theme music in my head: we
are going to see Petra, where they filmed the final scene of the third
movie...  I've always wanted to visit this place (since that movie?),
and this is the single tour that I decided 100% I would do.  From the
first time Audrey said we'd get to go.</p>

<p>I'm planning to wear cargo pants (so I can carry extra batteries
and tapes and Colleen's rabbit (Beanie Bunny could become his name))
and long sleeved shirt.  I gotta go get my hat from the GET office,
and I hope I can find the small bag Hitomi suggested I bring.  Though
I can just carry my backpack again.</p>

<p>Last night I copied all the videos from my camera to computer, and
burned them all to CD (245 megs).  Also burned the remaining pictures
that I hadn't archived yet.</p>

<p>I'm well-behind my tape transcription.  I'm (not really) typing
Tape 3, and recording on Tape 7.  I'll take Tape 8, ready to go in
Jordan.</p>

<p>I came up to the fourth floor and could smell something different.
The door is open on the fourth floor!  I could smell the difference
from what it is usually like there.  I'm specifically *not* going to
go to the top deck where I'll likely be distracted by the view.
Gotta get my stuff together for the tour today!  30,000 yen overnight
tour to Wadi Rum and Petra!</p>

<p>I'm still a bit poopypants, so we will see how that goes on the tour.</p>

<p class=date>9:57am</p>

<p>I'm in a really laid back mood; I haven't been off the boat yet,
but I'm like "hey man; it's all good," I'm just like thinkin' nothing
is a big deal.  Gotta be in Broadway in 3 min</p>

<p>oh my god</p>

<p>I am just now looking out the window for the first tiime in Jordan.
It is .. oh my god.  I am going to <em>*run*</em> upstairs and take
pictures.  wow wow wow</p>
