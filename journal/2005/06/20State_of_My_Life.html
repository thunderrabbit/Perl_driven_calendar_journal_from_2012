<li><p>Oh man I am falling asleep; I couldn't think of all the
teachers' names just now!  Eeek!</p></li>

<li><p class=date>3:22am</p>

<p>Most nights I stay up late slowly taking a shower and flossing and
brushing my teeth and clearing a spot on my bed to sleep.</p>

<p>But tonight is the night I crawled down my ladder head first to
retrieve my watch which I had left in the bathroom cabinet during my
shower.</p></li>

<li><p>We've (I've) been to Hong Kong, Vietnam (DaNang and _____),
Singapore, Sri Lanka (Colombo), Jordan (Aqaba, Wadi Rum and Petra) and
Egypt (Port Said and Cairo).</p></li>

<li><p>I'm not getting a lot of sleep these days, but having a
blast... I'll catch up on sleep and journaling when I get back.  I've
been wondering where I want to do my catching up.  janette's house
keeps coming to mind, but I don't want anything to be weird since
she's been dating Ira.  I'd choose Fred's place next.</p></li>

<p class=date>9:07am AST Tuesday 21 June 2005</p>

<li><p>We have crossed the Meditteranean Sea and are headed into
Greece today.  I'm likely to just do a 45 minute walking tour of the
area and then just chill out.  I'm a bit tired of going going going
going.</p></li>

<li><p>Plus there's a bit of a let down as we have to rush through
everything to get back to the ship on time.  I understand the reason,
but I just don't particularly like the result: I want to stay longer
in most places that we visit.</p>

<p>My logic above doesn't make the right sense, I believe.  I just
don't like having to rush off when I'm happily exploring an area.  But
I enjoy getting a sense of what areas I'd like to explore for a longer
period of time and which places I could forgo.</p></li>

<li><p>Last night was a Greek Dinner buffet with traditional Greek
dances performed by the Greek crew.  A lot of the GET teachers danced
as well.  At one point I saw Slavena and Kremena outside the circle so
I beckoned them in and enjoyed a moment of just happy happy joy joy
dancing dancing with them both.</p></li>

<li><p>The bottom half or more of the screen on my computer doesn't
always come on immediately upon wake from sleep.</p></li>

<li><p>On quick count, I have 30 white whiskers on my chin.  The rest
(huge majority) are dark brown.</p></li>
