<p>I was a minute or two late getting back to the bus after writing my
Rob Update.  Fuck fuck I hope I don't get into fucking
trouble... release; release; it's all good.  It will be fine.</p>

<p>I just got the thing sent, closed the browser, ran down to the desk
to pay.  I only had a large bill, apparently, and the guy was like,
"ummmm" and tried to pull out some change, but I was like, "it's
okay," and just took what he had given me so far and *ran* to the bus.
I don't really even know how much I paid.</p>
