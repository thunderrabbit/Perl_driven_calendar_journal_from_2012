<p>Just bought a 60 minute cassette tape for 1 dinar.  Got three coins
back, but don't know anything about them yet.  I was really happy with
the transaction.  I had been scared to even approach anyone, being an
American in Jordan, but everybody was normal and I showed them the
type of cassette I wanted.  The guy didn't have one, but took me to a
nearby shop that did have them and explained what I wanted.  They
didn't have a huge selection, but pulled out a tape and I pulled out
my money.  I have no idea the value of dinars, but 1 was enough.  I
used the three remaining coins to buy some banana chips.</p>
