<p>We are in the middle of a fiord, going 9 knots according to the
announcement.  I'm with Kuni on the top deck, watching the water on
one side and an overcast sky above.  Tall hills on one side with snow
on top.  They are not craggly.  I'm impressed with this village with
maybe 100 buildings spread out over a couple kilometers diameter.
I'm hard pressed to imagine a road that reaches this village; they
seem to just be isolated from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>We occasionally see houses on the side of the mountain with no
apparent roads.  Unless that's a road - it's really fuckin' steep.
I've got a jacket on, but still wearing sandals to show off my green
toenail polish that Katt painted for me some time ago.</p>

<p>The sky is overcast, and it's beautiful, but it's not describably
different than being in a lake.  So it's not like Oh My God I've never
seen anything like this before.  It's nice, but.</p>

<p>We had a hot chocolate drinking party of sorts; it started in
Kris' room: Kris, Tammy, and maybe Natalie came and mixed up some hot
chocolate.</p>

<p>I've been wandering around and feeling kinda horny.  I want to hook
up with someone.  Argh.</p>

<p>Katt said, "you need to find a nice Japanese girl."</p>

<p>I joked, "I'm halfway there!"  Katt is half Japanese, half
Kiwi.  She laughed.  I like her laugh.</p>
