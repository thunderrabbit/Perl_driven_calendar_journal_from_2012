<p>Grrr.  I'm just chasing these girls, man.  Fuck.  Kris and
Kim,..  ugh... why why why???</p>

<p>(They're so tall and so beautiful.)</p>

<p>Hanging out with Kris in a Greek cafe across from the train
station in LeHavre, France.  I got a kebab and she got a sandwich.</p>

<p>I'm in a much better mood hanging out with Kris than I was a while
ago.  I flipped a coin in the train station about 4 or 5 times in a
row to see if I should hang out with anyone.  Each time it was like
"no no no no" and then when I asked should I do my own thing?  it was
like, "yes."</p>
