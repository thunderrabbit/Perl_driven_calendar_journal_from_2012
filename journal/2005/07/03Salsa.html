<p>At Salsa now.  Tons of new students so Natalie is teaching everyone
from scratch.  Chaotic, but fun.</p>

<p>Wow.  July 4th.  Three days after Canada Day.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed dancing with Miki.  I like the shape of her
mouth.  Pat was like, "dude, she is sixteen!" and I shouted to the
universe, "Miki, stop being sixteen!!"</p>

<p>This is the day I took pictures of Not Enough, Enough, and Too
Much tea.</p>

<p>This is the day I wrote my Intermediate and Advanced lesson: "what
would you do if you won a hyperjillion dollars?"  I predict they will
want to buy new cars and stuff like that.  If they do, I will say
"stoppit; be more creative," or something.</p>

<p>I turned in my requested dates to play Silent Football today.</p>
