<p>I slept from 6:15am to 12 something, totally forgoing breakfast but
waking up just in time for lunch.  Here on the top deck there are a
couple of guys refurbishing things: paint is being chipped off corners
and complex surfaces (I guess those are where it collects most during
painting and effectively reshapes those surfaces).  Another couple
guys are redoing the port side steps up to Sunshine Bar, where I am
sitting now.</p>

<p>On the port side of the boat is another boat labeled <a
href="http://bunkersatsea.com">bunkersatsea.com</a>.  From my vantage
point I have been unable to tell what they do.</p>
