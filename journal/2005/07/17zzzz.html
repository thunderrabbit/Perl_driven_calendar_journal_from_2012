<p>Big fun tonight after Silent Football, which was the opposite of
fun.  I felt really sad that very few people came, specifically those
people who had said, "I'll be there in five minutes."  I dug my brain
down into the reason and realized I just miss the shit out of YRUU
Silent Football.  It's not that I <em>totally</em> care if these guys
stop what they're doing to come play; I just miss the zaniness (and
zoominess) of YRUU.  On the ship, none of the players are willing to
strictly uphold the rules, and there's no way I can tell them that
it's more fun if we are really strict.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, I got some quality time with Erik Leaver, our American
Iraqi speaker.  Talked to him in the hall and confirmed I can crash at
his crib in DC around 25 September for marches on the capital.  Miki
showed up and mentioned she wanted pics of my hair, and I was like,
"you better do it now; cause I'm cutting it off tonight or in the
morning," so we got some great pictures (binary directions) and that
started a chain of picture taking in Free Space and then a trip down
to Erik's room (big and nice) and far far down to our rooms (small and
cramped).</p>

<p>This is not Erik's room, but an example of the larger rooms the guests stayed in:</p>

<p>Back up to the party where I basically stuck my head into Sports
Bar, deemed it too smokey, and came back to my room to sleeeeep.</p>

<p>I think I'm off one timezone, though the time is correct.  When I
talked about the hour jumping by two units, I think that fucked it up.
Maybe I shoulda reset the clock but kept the timezone.</p>
