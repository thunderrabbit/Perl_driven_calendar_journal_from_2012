<p>Aw man.</p>

<p>6 fuckin' shy ass girls.</p>

<p>I transcribed the Niveen speech while watching it in class
yesterday.  Before and during the transcription I was like, "if you
have any questions; if there is any word you don't understand, let me
know."</p>

<p>For the entire 1.5 hours, they were silent.</p>

<p>The six happy wonderful girls didn't say anything.  They didn't
say thank you.  At one point I stopped, and was like, "is this helpful
for you?"</p>

<p>They assured me it was.</p>

<p>At the end my hands were sore as shit, and I didn't feel appreciated.</p>
