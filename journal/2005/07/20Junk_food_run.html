<p>Headed out to RiteAid to get some foodage.  They have a pretty
decent selection of the junkfood I'll be craving on the way to Jamaica.</p>

<p class=date>6:37pm</p>

<p>This is the fourth time I've walked up 50th street in 3 days.  I
note that, though this doesn't feel like home, I am no longer walking
with a badass "I'll kill you" look.  I'm just walking.  Not suspicious
of everyone.  Except <em>that</em> guy; wtf is *he* doing here??</p>

<p>Haha the streets are gridlocked.  Man I'm glad to be walking and not
in a car.</p>

<p class=date>7:11pm</p>

<p>I bought 2 quarts of orange juice, and 100 chewable vitamin C
tablets cause I can feel a bit of a tickle in my throat like I'm
getting sick.  I'm going to bunk up in bed soon as I take a shower and
forgo the rest of the evening.  Though that means I won't see Niveen
waving from the port.  Dammit.  Maybe I can successfully take a nap,
go wave bye, then get back to bed bed bed.</p>

<p>Also bought white nail polish because I wanted to use Katt's
white nail polish for my toes, but she doesn't have any.  I also
bought some instant hand cleaner for Angie cause I used a significant
(and by significant I mean statistically significant) percentage of
hers while we were in Egypt.</p>

<p>Also bought some chocolate covered raisins.</p>

<p>And a fine point sharpie to mark CDs (though I've heard Sharpies
destroy CDs).</p>

<p>And some jelly beans for Christina from Bulgaria who works in Topaz
Dining.</p>

<p>And toothpaste.  But I forgot to buy a deodorant stone from Whole
Foods yesterday.  That would have been a good idea.  But I did buy 1.5
quarts (?) of Odwalla Superfood, that delicious dark green drink that
looks like motor oil but tastes like heaven.</p>

<p>Cool.  I just saw a FedEx truck with a slot on the back side that
says "FEDEx Dropslot" so I could just toss stuff there.  Pretty
kickass.  Makes sense, too.</p>
