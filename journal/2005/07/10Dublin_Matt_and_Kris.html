<p>In Dublin now on my handspring visor with no backspace.  Walking
around with Kris (from Canada) and Matt (the artist) ..  they stopped
in a little shop.  Matt says:</p>

<p class=note>i bouoght a lighter, (matt) kris used the cash mnachine
it appears as though she got out 20 euros, i wonder if this will cover
her expenses for the afternoon, although i suppose dublin is no
shoppers paradise, i have 50 euros, and this will be the last place we
will use them, should i find a token from ireland?  or perhaps ill
find those roller skates Ive been pining for, either way, the weather
is fine, and irish girls are too.  Ive always had a weakeness for
redheads, although at the moment the one standing over there has no
hair, just a red head.  dublin appears to be a cross between
manchester and france, lots of brick, talll buildings, wide streets,
ok, thats all.</p>
