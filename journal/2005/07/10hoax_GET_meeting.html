<p>GET Meeting was a fantastic hoax by Audrey!  She brought us up to
Sunshine Bar and bought us all beers!  So cool!!  I am surprised I
didn't recognized she was up to something: Sandy (one of the
bartenders) was standing behind her with a case of beers on the
bar.  I didn't have a beer, but enjoyed the stories everyone shared
about Dublin.  ps: I didn't drink a beer; the one allocated to me was
passed around to various people who needed extra.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Dave went to Belfast to find his family, but didn't have their
contact information - just a vague memory of the neighborhood.  He saw
an old-ish guy helping a blind man on the bus.  Then Dave recognized
the old-ish guy was his uncle!  After uncle Huey (*) helped the blind
guy on the bus, Dave ran up to his uncle Huey to help *him* on the
bus.  "Here you go sir; I'll help you.." and Huey (of course) was all,
"*I* don't need any help!!  hey, it's Dave!!!!!" and whisked him off
to a pub for a round of beer and the start of a huge family
reunion.</p></li>

<li><p>various people hooked up with various other people, and one
person said, "I organized my own homestay."  We all cheered, and the
general question was posed: who has hooked up with a passenger?  Three
of the guys have (including me).  None of the girls have, but a couple
of close calls were reported.</p></li>

<li><p>Carissa and Petra were at the beach, skipping rocks into the
water because they didn't have swim wear, and the beaches were too
crowded (with non-nude bathers) for them to just strip and dive in.
So they decided to skip rocks into the water.  Carissa was pretty
crap at it, so they just had a rock throwing contest to see who could
throw rocks the furthest.  Petra won again at that game, so they
tried to compete at the biggest splash contest.  That fizzled into a
game of just throwing pebbles into the ocean.</p>

<p>Carissa grabbed a pile of pebbles, took a good heave and her watch
caught on her shirt then went flying with the pebbles.  She took it in
perfect stride, "and there goes my watch" and experienced bullet time
as it gracefully tumbled and arced into the water with a fatal
splash.</p>

<p>Three Hong Kong dollars well spent and well thrown.</p></li>

<li><p>I most enjoyed Eddie Rocket's, the 50's style American cafe:
big glass of water that Kin could hardly lift and I was like, "this is
normal size!"  Big huge vanilla shake with the tumbler so I could
refill my glass three times - totally fantastic!</p>

<p>Greg got the punchline before I could: "so your favorite thing
about Ireland was the American food."</p></li>

<li><p>Petra claimed she had been chased by every 50 year old man with
no teeth within 200 miles of Dublin.</p>

<p>She chose the guy with a stroke over the toothless guy.</p></li>

<li><p>Katt was offered all sorts of information about stuff she
didn't care about, including the history of symbolism of the
shamrock.</p></li></ol>

<p>(*) props to Shawn for remembering his name, and thanks to
Katt for verifying the accuracy.</p>
