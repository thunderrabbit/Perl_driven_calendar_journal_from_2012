<p>Shawn and I are at Eddie Rockets cause he wanted greasy bad-for-us
food and I can say HI to Miska who was our lovely waitress yesterday
(and today).  I sat in the same seat and everything.  She remembered
me and that I like water with no ice.  I've got my cash laid out on
the table cause it's the end of my Euros.  6 for the taxi back to the
boat and 11.58 for the meal and tip.</p>

<p>My v key isn't working really well on my handspring visor keyboard.
Shawn says I should just use y cause the look almost the same.</p>
