<p>Went to bed around 10:30pm last night; I was just zonkered after
Costa Rica; I didn't even go upstairs to say bye to people nor
experience the departure.  I woke up around 6am, suprised that I had
slept so long; I had expected to be woken up last night.  I found my
backpack no longer on my bed; I imagine Katt moved it down so I
wouldn't kick it off the bed.</p>

<p>My dream seems important...  Yesterday I had some brainwaves
regarding mindfulness: basically wondering why some things are
remembered long term and why some are forgotten in a trice.  I tend to
believe remembering things more effectively can allow one to lead a
richer life.  And leading a richer life tends to make things more
memorable.  Further, being more alive should allow us to bring life to
the world by communication with others, by living with purpose.</p>

<p>For example, if I remembered all the Japanese that has been in my
brain at one point or another, I'd be pretty damn fluent.  Almost the
same for Spanish and American Sign Language.  Also, having more
memories helps to create my own personal culture, helps me have better
stories to tell like tribes who pass down their entire history through
stories handed down for generations.</p>

<p>So how does one go about becoming more mindful?  I'm pretty sure
there is a book called Mindfulness, by Tich Nach Han (sp) or some
such.  I've had trouble reading some of his work; maybe an American
English version should be written.</p>

<p>Part of the demise of mindfulness has come with "news" soundbites
and the MTV generation of images being flashed for hundredths of
seconds.  The mind tries to put it all together but becomes
overwhelmed because in the end, it's all just a bunch of static.</p>
