<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>I'm on Pb's 49th Global Voyage, between Bergen, Norway
and Dublin, Ireland.  We'll arrive in Ireland at 5am
tomorrow.</p></li>

<li><p>For most of the ports, I have chosen to simply wander around
with little or no pre-planning.  Plenty of fun has been had in this
manner.  Hanging out in the internet cafe next to the boat in Norway
resulted in meeting a cool guy named Thomas who told me a lot about
his country.  In Le Havre I joined Kris and Dave plus a couple
Japanese passengers walking around and chowing at a couple different
cafes and a picnic next to an old church.  In Italy, wild and exotic
fish and fruits were viewed and chowed at the local markets.  Plus we
zoomed over to Taormina for a fun time climbing.  Memories of
Barcelona excursion from La Rambla to Park Gruell (sp) via Sagrada
Familia with Niveen will always be cherished.</p></li>

<li><p>I lept into the frigid pool yesterday just for fun.  I tried to
escape the water faster than humanly possible, but I was limited by my
own beliefs in physics.</p>

<p>I declared it to have been the worst possible idea ever, so when I
did it again, Brandt was like, "you're worst idea ever has been
replaced by a new worst idea ever: jumping in a second time."</p>

<p>If I do it enough times, the first time could be considered sheer
genius.</p></li>

<li><p>I am super tired.  It's the middle of the afternoon but I'm
falling asleep on this couch.</p></li>

<li><p>I have kissed three women on the boat.  Two others I have tried
to kiss, but they were too smart for me.</p></li>

<li><p>Super busy; super tired on the boat; I think that is
contributing to my angsty mood.</p></li>

<li><p>The salsa performance is complete, and the initial Get to Know
a GET Teacher things are complete.  So I am not in the midst of
'preparing' for anything</p></li>

<li><p>We are 5 or 6 days (of 15) into the second semester of classes
already.</p></li>

<li><p>I had Niveen come to both my classes and the students
interviewed her after Dublin.</p></li>

<li><p>We just had Irish Night last night, and I was in a grouchy
mood.</p></li>

<li><p>Minorou is our roommate these days.  I am glad our room is so close
to Topaz Dining and to the classes.</p></li>

<li><p>I have yet to do a video tour of the boat, but I would like to
at some point.</p></li>

<li><p>I have about 60 euros remaining.  Maybe 45 left over from
Europe.  But we are out of Euro-accepting countries.  Oh, save
Ireland.</p></li>

<li><p>I got the new version of Where In The World, and have been
testing it for bugs a bit.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't totally missed the internet as much as I thought I
might.  It's been so busy on the boat and there is so much to do.  I
am trusting the advice to just go go go.</p></li>

<li><p>I will meet my Staff GET student soon, for the first time.
Her name is Yasuko, I think.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't met my Japanese teachers in a while.</p></li>

<li><p>I am recording this into tape 14, and have transcribed through
tape 3.</p></li>

<li><p>I am falling asleep as I write this.</p></li>
