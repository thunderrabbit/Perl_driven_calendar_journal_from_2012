Ode to Francois:

My dearest adorable rabbit
I fearest starting a habit
I love everything about you,
and I cannot live without you.

Your eyes so cute
and mouth so mute
Ears flopped at either side
You are my joy and my pride

May the fates not scorn me
and my mates all support thee
with great speed home swiftly
not too late for a spot of tea
as we gaze over the sea
or graze in Topaz Dining.

I won't again let thee
out of my direct sight, see
by giving you to Shunji
I lost my dear buddy

With tears in my eyes
I finish the lines
and hope you'll come back to me.
May it be no surprise
I'll massage the spines
of your captors when they release thee.
