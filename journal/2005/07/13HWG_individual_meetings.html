<p>Oh man.  Yuko was like, "what do you think me?" after about a five
minute pause to think of a question.  I responded like, "I think you
are too shy and you will not learn unless you try."  I tried to be
firm but gentle.  She cried for a full 35 minutes, fortunately the
next 15 minute timeslot was unallocated (only 5 girls showed up today,
though there are seven in the class, so I allocated six timeslots).  I
told her, "it looks like you're sad.  So I think you *want* to speak
English.  I know you can do it."  She was still crying when the next
HWG showed up (Mariko).  Mariko talked to Yuko, but later told me that
she, too, didn't know why Yuko was crying.</p>

Japanese lesson, it seems.</p>
