<p>The people leaving the ship were stuck behind glass and not
allowed to go onto the top parking lot area.  That was frustrating;
we could have talked to them and given our last verbal hugs and
byebyes.  I got some cool photos of parts of the boat and Empire
State Building and the moon, that I'll give to Paige who will
absolutely recognize all three.</p>
