<p>Notes from the all English session with Erik:</p>

<p>He was scheduled to go to Iraq soon after the US declared the war
over, but there were too many kidnappings, so they cancelled the whole
trip.</p>

<p>There are no NGOs *in Iraq*; all those that say they are on the
ground in Iraq (except the Quakers) are actually in Jordan.  Therefore
it's really hard to get started there.</p>

<p>The US has forced Iraqis to inquire about religious differences
within Iraq that were not considered before.</p>

<p>The UN has identified about 40 different groups that are variously
called "insurgents" "freedom fighters" etc.  The numbers of the
insurgency have gone steadily up since the US has continued its
occupation.</p>

<p>Basically all of the destruction in Iraq is being done by
non-Iraqis who can come into the country and want to fuck with the US.
The border is too difficult to control, so this flow hasn't been
stopped.</p>

<p>The US has a deadly version of Midas' golden touch.</p>

<p>The US is making the situtation worse, but can't figure out how to
make it better, and won't admit that it's just getting worse.</p>

<p>The people at Department of State had a pretty decent plan at post
war reconstruction.  They had done it in consultation with
Iraqi-Americans and spent nine months of effort to do it right.  The
Department of War (DoD) threw away all the State Department's work and
just bullied their way through because they had been told (by people
who would be fired for bad news) that the Iraqi's would all welcome
them with open arms.</p>

<p>The DoD is good at war, not reconstruction.</p>

<p>One reason the UN resolutions / sanctions didn't work is that the
international community wasn't united on which ones were important.
Saddam was really able to play off these differences to his
advantage.</p>

<p>There was no link between Saddam and the World Trade Center
destruction until Bush and friends created a link in the public
mind.</p>

<p>In the UN, when Yemen voted NO to going to war, the aid to the US
ambassador said "that will be the most expensive NO vote you've ever
cast in your life," And two days later aid to Yemen was cancelled.</p>

<p>The electrical infrastructure in Iraq is basically French and
Russian, but those countries were disallowed from helping with
reconstruction and the citizens are suffering while they are not
allowed to fix their own system and the US contractors are trying to
figure out how to make US equipment work with the French and Russian
infrastructure.</p>

<p>The US is buildng the largest embassy in the world in Iraq.</p>

<p>Iraq has a pretty decent constitution, but there is not much
chance of it being used.</p>

<p>It's possible for people to get pilot's licenses without being able
to read the instruments, they have visual navigation only, so
sometimes pilots get lost over DC and F-16s are scrambled from the
nearby airforce base.</p>

<p>(whoah)</p>

<p>If we poll the average American and ask how the US Government
should allocate its money, they would draw a pretty progressive chart.
But what people *think* we are spending / should be spending on
international aid, is nowhere near what we are actually spending on
it.</p>

<p>The US congress gets to allocate about 1.2 trillion dollars every
year.  About half of that goes to Defense / War.  That's been standard
fare for a while, just on "even keel" with no wars going on.</p>

<p>"Foreign Aid" is not just humanitarian aid.  It goes for military
training, loans to buy used US military equipment, etc.</p>

<p>The reconstruction projects for Iraq all go to US companies
employing US employees.  It's creating more of a dependency than any
sort of aid.</p>
