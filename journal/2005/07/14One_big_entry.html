<p>This is interesting..  Last night we changed timezones, and tonight
we will again; we're getting two 25 hour days in a row!  Whooooo
hooooo!!  This timezone motion has been one of the coolest aspects of
the trip for me.</p>

<p>But that's not what's interesting.</p>

<p>What's interesting is that I switched my computer from AZOST to the
next timezone (GST), but the clock jumped 2 hours.  I couldn't find a
timezone in between!  Isn't there one?</p>

<p>Katt suggested that I was old enough to take care of myself,
specifically around stopping at red lights to check for cross
traffic.</p>
