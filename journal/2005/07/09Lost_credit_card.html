I just bought two NIN albums for myself.  halo 8 de and halo_19.  I
have Halo 8, but this is an extended version apparently recorded in
SACD format, which may stand for Super Audio CD or some assnine crap
like dat.</p>

<p>Sarah, who has nice long reddish hair pulled back, at HMV told me
the halo 8 is better than halo 19, but I still had to have 19 for
completeness' sake.</p>

<p>One slightly bad thing: when I went to pay with my credit card, it
wasn't there.  I'm about to check my safe now to see if I put it in
there and don't remember.  I know I've had it on the boat, but I
don't remember seeing it recently.</p>
