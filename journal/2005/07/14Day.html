<p>This is interesting..  Last night we changed timezones, and tonight
we will again; we're getting two 25 hour days in a row!  Whooooo
hooooo!!  This timezone motion has been one of the coolest aspects of
the trip for me.</p>

<p>But that's not what's interesting.</p>

<p>What's interesting is that I switched my computer from AZOST to the
next timezone (GST), but the clock jumped 2 hours.  I couldn't find a
timezone in between!  Isn't there one?</p>

<p>Katt and I are watching Coming To America, instead of
participating in Sports Day up on the top deck.  I went up there for
the first parts, but I was unimpressed with any of the events.  A lot
of people escaped at the same time I did.  They did stretching all in
a huge mass of people nearly hitting each other, etc; plus stretching
without being warmed up first.  No way.</p>

<p>I went back up to eat the box lunches they gave us and there was
the finest of sprinkly precipitation, but not really rain.</p>

<p>Katt suggested that I was old enough to take care of myself,
specifically around stopping at red lights to check for cross
traffic.</p>
