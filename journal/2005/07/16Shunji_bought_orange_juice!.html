<p>We are working on posters in AN and Shunji bought us all orange
juices!  I had gone into Hemmingway at 3pm cause my schedule book said
"3pm Hemmingway" but I had no idea who to meet / what it was / why
that was written in my book.  I saw Shunji in there, and he invited me
to sit down for a drink.  His wife was there, smoking, so I was like,
"ah, I can't; I'm sorry," and went back to AN to work on the posters.
He came up a bit later with SEVEN cans of orange juice; one for each
of us!!  We had a ¤«¤ó¤Ñ¤¤ (cheers) for Shunji and it was great!</p>
