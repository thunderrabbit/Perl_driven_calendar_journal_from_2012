<p>Just watching a guy on the top deck bowling without using a
bowling ball.  Waiting for the ball, hefting it out with both hands,
feeling the weight of the ball, look down the lane, bowl with
complete follow through, wait for the pins to all drop, and then walk
backwards, wait for the next ball...</p>

<p>I have a solid idea for my class review: something about doing a
debate - we agree because he said blah blah blah, etc.</p>
