<p>Going to breakfast.</p>

<p>I'm in an okay mood, but still a bit rough after last night.</p>

<p>I just learned that Kuni went to Free Space to wait for me last
night.  I probably could have kissed her.</p>

<p>Class starts in four minutes.  I just woke up Shawn who apparently
didn't hear his alarm this morning at 7.</p>
