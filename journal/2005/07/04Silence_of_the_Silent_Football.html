<p>I had written "Silent Football on Fjiord Day" on the GET Meeting
agenda, but it didn't get transcribed to the whiteboard.  I wondered
why, but they were like, "oh; you can't schedule anything on that
day," and I was like, "oh; I meant just for us to play, to have an
English only game."  No one backed me up, though in the past a couple
people were all, "wow!  That was fun!" when we played a bit at
lunch.</p>

<p>I feel sad about it, and recognize I miss YRUU.  In a lot of ways,
this ship is like YRUU.  Except for the Silent Football part.</p>
