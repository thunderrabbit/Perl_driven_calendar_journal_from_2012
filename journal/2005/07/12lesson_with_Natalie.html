<p>Natalie and I have been working on a lesson for a couple hours,
and for some reason the computer just crapped out and died, but
fortunately I had just saved.</p>

<p>Have just finished creating a lesson titled Culture of Violence
with Natalie.</p>

<p>It's based on clips from Bowling for Columbine: specifically the
interview with Marilyn Manson.</p>

<p>I think it will be a bit too difficult for my classes, but I am
going to try it even so.</p>
