out with Kris and David primarily, with broad overview plans to meet
two of Kris' friends (Fas and Anika from Pakistan by blood but England
by nature), who took a ferry over here.  We were joined by Kuni before
we met Kris' friends, and then while walking around the city, Ai and
Emi joined our ranks.</p>

<p>During the day we had a basic plan of eating food and wandering
around the city.  Dave added to his own agenda buy purchasing a long
stem rose with the intention of giving it to a semi-random passerby.
We ate at a dessert cafe outside this shopping mall where passerbys
were gently scrutinized for their worthiness of receiving the rose.
Allison and a new Pb staff member name Maiko found us
(actually Allison saw me on my way to the loo) and we chatted for
about a minute at our table.  They left and we purchased cheese and
bread and beverages at a super market in the mall.</p>

Texas, but it was inside a shopping mall.  We spent quite a few
minutes in the cheese section, where a patient woman served us samples
of various soft cheeses (Kris and I found them less than delightful: I
didn't like the texture, and she suggested (and I agreed) they tasted
like broccoli.)  I focused on a hard orange cheese, the wheel for
which looked basically like a smooth pumpkin.  The woman behind the
counter cut it with some difficulty, though I imagine her double
handled knife is quite sharp.</p>

<p>We sifted through the checkout lines back into the mall and
reconvened at the dessert cafe where we had chat-n-chewed before.</p>

Funicular to what would be a lovely view of the city save for all the
fences around peoples' houses, so we couldn't see so well.  Scoped out
some areas to sit and chow, and ended up walking down the steps and
eating under the towering oak trees in front of a church that Dave
guessed was 400 years old.  (I wish I had gotten the name of the
church, but for those who know (or have a detailed map of) Le Havre,
it's right near the bottom of the Grand Escalier (sp) the tall steps
that lead down the hill the Funicular climbs.)</p>

<p>We went to Le Fun Time, a bar we selected soley by its name and
played billiards and chatted upstairs.  Kuni tried to get me to drink
alcohol, but I basically refused.  A man named Edward approached us to
see if we were up for a game of billiard.  He was maybe a meter tall,
but still able to play billiards as well as I.  Sometimes his friends
would mock-treat him like a little kid, mussing up his hair, etc.</p>

<p>There was a tall man named Philip (fee LEEP) who taught Emi how to
hit the cue ball with some semblance of forward motion.  (She was
horrible at first, but by the end could occassionally make oblique
angle shots 3/4ths the length of the table.)</p>

<p>Today I got more confirmation that I seem willing to give up on
something I want rather than ask people for it.  For example getting a
ride back to the ship.  Kris was willing to flag down a car and ask.
I was like, "let's just walk."  David tried for quite a few minutes to
get us into a club we wanted to check out.  I was like, "fuckit; let's
just go."  We ended up not being able to get in, but he made a valiant
effort, and learned where a different club could be found.</p>
