<p>See ya later, New York City.</p>

<p>I'm back on the ship; our boarding limit is 8:30pm, so I'm not
likely to go back out.</p>

<p>I never saw Frank, but I did see Paige yesterday and the day
before.</p>

<p>I got my blood sample Federal Expressed to be HIV tested.  Though
it won't give me an all clear if it's negative, I will know
everything through January is all good.</p>

<p>I decided today that I would no longer practice unsafe sex (sex
with untested partners).  One reason I don't smoke is that smoking
kills people.  From now on, I'm choosing to apply the same rule to
unsafe sex.</p>

<p>Though I mentioned Paige and then sex in the next paragraph, let it
be known that she and I did not sleep together, nor even kiss.</p>

<p>I rode the subway yesterday.  The system is pretty straightforward.
$2 to enter and go anywhere.  Don't have to scan the ticket on the way
out.  The system is not that big, either.  Compared to Tokyo, at
least.</p>

<p>I like how it's an old system with the metal structural frames of
walkways and walls and supports visible.  It gives an
under-construction look that I enjoy.  The trains are old and loud,
but still effective.</p>

<p>Actually, though, I was only on two different lines.</p>
