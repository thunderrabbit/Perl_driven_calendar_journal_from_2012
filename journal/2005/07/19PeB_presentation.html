<p>Tonight we are supposed to have between 750 and 1000 people on the
ship, which grew from having a couple tours of 50 people.  I am
stationed in Windjammer where we will talk about GET, but more just
talking about ourselves.</p>

<p class=date>8:45pm ADT Tuesday 19 July 2005</p>

<p>The first presentation was great: I did some beatbox and Audrey
sang a crazy fucked up song about stuff and things and we did funny
stuff because.....  no one showed up for the presentation.</p>
