<p><a href="http://www.havre-port.net/pahweb.html">Port Autonome du
Havre</a> official site.</p>

<p>(This could be interesting: click on Harbour operation, then
Movements of the day.  I don't know under what name the boat will be
sailing, but "PB" seems like a good guess.)</p>

<p>According to the site: In 1517, French King Francois 1 wanted to
build Le Havre as an international trade and defense port.  It
prospered until the French Revolution, but then came back again bigger
and better.  After the first world war and several decades of
lobbying, on 1 January 1925 Le Havre was granted the status of a <a
href="http://extrapah.havre-port.net/portal/page?_pageid=34,64330,34_64343&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL">port
authority</a>, which seems to basically mean incorporating it so they
can make money on docking fees and make improvements on the port. </p>

<p>I don't see a lot of interesting things to do right around the
port area.</p>
