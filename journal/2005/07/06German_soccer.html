<p>The Germans "hosted" a soccer game in the sports deck.  I played
one game, but it's far too cold for me to want to be out there.  Every
game had a different Good Sportsmanship Rule; ours was that we had to
play with our hands in our pockets.  Others have been playing in
pairs, or playing using only opposite foot to kick, etc.</p>

<p>I'm sitting next to Kuni in the weight gym now; we are just
watching them play out in the cold.</p>
