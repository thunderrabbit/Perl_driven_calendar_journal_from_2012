Paige!

I really enjoyed hanging with you in NYC; thank you for showing me all
your favorites in your favorite city in the world!  Your input helped
me see the city as a place I could enjoy summer residence.  Too cold
in the winter, though!

I never got connected with my friend Frank again; I called him several
times on the second night but to no avail.

I distinctly noticed that by not attending the festival on the third
day I wouldn't be able to say bye-for-now, but I felt completely wiped
out and didn't think I'd enjoy/survive an adventure out in the sun.  I
trust you got to see many of your PB friends and had a blast and a half!

We are in Cristobol, Panama now; I wandered around the terminal a bit
but didn't see anything to pique my curiosity for long.  We
(volunteers and staff) have been disallowed to leave the terminal due
to the high likelihood of muggings.  I hope all the passengers who
venture out will have no problems.

     Love Love
      - Rob!

I haven't had internet access for over a week, so this email is not
intended to acknowledge any you may have sent recently.  Been crazy
busy on the ship until recently when we finished the second term of
classes.  This vacation doesn't include much free time on the ship
because we were in Jamaica two days ago, Panama today, and Costa Rica
in two days.  Wah wah wah complain complain about going to all these
countries around the world.

I'm listening to nin [WITH_TEETH] album; I like it alright, but I
daresay he has done better work.  There are no wack chords, time
signatures, stretched sounds, nor long builds that I enjoy in his
other albums, specifically (2.5 years of cobwebs being removed from my
brain) Further Down The Spiral, I believe.

I grant, however, I have only listened to the album two times through.

Empress of Britain: of 25,516 grt, was built by the Fairfield SB &
E. Co., Glasgow, in 1956 for the Canadian Pacific SS Co service between
Liverpool and Montreal.  In 1964 she was sold to the Greek Line and
renamed Queen Anna Maria and used on the Piraeus-New York service and
then for cruising.  In 1975 the ship was bought by Carnival Cruise of
Miami and renamed Carvivale.  Renamed Fiestamarina in 1993, she was
renamed Olympic in 1995 and then The Topaz in 1998, having been
purchased by Topaz International.

The Topaz is a rare survivor of the great postwar British
shipbuilding.  She sails today under a unique long term charter
agreement with the Japanese based Pb organization. Throughout
the nearly five decades since she entered service she evolved from a
cold weather transatlantic liner to a full-time cruise ship.
