<p>Worked, fell asleep, worked, watched Family Guy, went 1 minute late
to Port Orientation, went to get my schedule, thought I could poo in
time, was 1 minute late to GET meeting, got a letter from Hitomi that
she said would be her last communication to me, and ate dinner sitting
with Angie, not really talking about what was on the top of my
brain.</p>

<p>On top of my brain is the awareness that before Pb, I had a
goal of not sexing anyone on the ship. - no girlfriends, just Rob
taking care of Rob's self.  That hasn't 100% worked out as planned,
and I am simply being aware of that.</p>

<p>I recognize part of the reason I sex is to feel good about myself.
I want that positive input.  I imagine if I can find a way to get that
positive input from an internal (spiritual) place, that would
ultimately be "better" for me.  Less complicated / dangerous / angsty
/ needy.</p>

<p>I can imagine Kim Sawyer suggesting that I look at different
aspects of my life and find small ways I can make positive adjustments
in different parts, which will ultimately bring about a massive
positive tsunami of change.</p>

<p>I also recall the results of a personality test saying I need 50%
people time and 50% Rob time.  Pb makes it easy to get people
time.  I gotta work for my Rob time, but that has been true since I
started living in big cities (~ 1990).</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>What does Rob Time look like?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>writing in my journal</p></li>

<li><p>climbing trees</p></li>

<li><p>riding my bicycle</p></li>

<li><p>meditating</p></li>

<li><p>making lists of things to do</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there one behind this list that I don't see yet?</p>

<p>Where does one write Written Goals?  Do we need to see them every
day?  Just write them down on a piece of toilet paper and flush it?
Write it on the bathroom mirror so we see in the morning?  Dude in
Momento tattooed it across his chest.  He was one focused mofo.  I
imagine there's a balance somewhere between flushing and
tattooing.</p>
