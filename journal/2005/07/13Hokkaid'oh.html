<p>I am about to attend my first non-teaching event today.  (not
including taking a whiz)</p>

<p>I am in the Broadway Lounge now, where I planned to see Ann
Sinclair's lecture on the history of jazz / blues / music.  But, had I
checked the schedule, I may have learned before too late that this
lecture is about the culture of Ainu: an indigenous people in
Hokkaido, the north island of Japan.</p>

<p>Fuck.  This is not quite as understandable nor interesting as I had
hoped.</p>

<p>He told us parents of newborns would not name the babies until
about age 3, but instead refer to them as a sack of shit or pile of
poo, etc, so that the gods would not be interested in taking the
child.</p>

<p>But once a (male) baby had a name, it was remembered for five
generations so the gods would recognize them.  Recognize us by
dropping names or recognize them by having heard their names?</p>

<p>I am on the front row so I'm not going to jet out of here, but damn
this is not money for me.</p>
