Wonderful Girls.</p>

<p>In the English version of today's paper, there were messages
sprinkled in various places.  Stuff like</p>

<pre>
Rob you better
meet our demands
or the rabbit gets it
Here are our demands
1) shave the left side of your head
2) wear your shirts backwards till Vancouver
3) remove your ugly nail polish
4) read Ode to Francois in the next GET meeting
</pre>

<p>For a while I debated doing as they requested, and basically
decided not to, though I followed the 'letter of the law' by</p>

<pre>
1) shaving the left side of my head (and the right side)
2) writing "your shirts backwards till Vancouver" on a shirt and wearing it
3) replacing the partially chipped nail polish with a new coat (*)
4) reading Ode to Francois in today's GET meeting (**)
</pre>

<p>(*) Actually, Katt had already done this nail painting the
previous night, so it worked nicely.</p>

<p>(**) This is the only thing I performed as requested, and Kim got
a video of it!</p>

<p>Fei is the CC translating the paper these days so he was the
obvious culprit, but he had a good alibi: a sheet of paper from the
supposed actual captors telling him to put that stuff in the
paper.</p>

<p>The pictures of Francois were taken with a "Canon EOS Kiss Digital
N" according to the information recorded within the photos.  I wonder
if N stands for something that got truncated.</p>

<p>I queried Matt the artist to see if he had done it, and he said he
had not, but he told me he had seen the pictures on a girl's computer.
So I'm thinking Nicole; she has a nice camera, though I don't know
what make or model.</p>

<p>Kim thinks it was Joel the CCC; he would definitely do this type
of thing, and he has access to the CCs and basically has access to
GET street.</p>

<p>Tonight was a formal dinner, and I luckily got a four-seat table
alone with Natalie; we shared fun stories and I told her about my
skating accident and subsequent palm reading.   She got 90% of the
story, but I cropped parts of it for time.</p>

<p>After dinner I chatted with Naho (one of my students from Cheerful
Dancing Fellows) for over an hour to continue our conversation we had
had during the end of Chat With today.</p>

<p>After that I went to the top deck where No Music No Peace festival
is going on.  Basically the music is not good enough to make me
withstand the freezing cold wind so I came downstairs.  I may go back
up at 1:30am to watch the merengue performance (starring Natalie,
Shawn and Miki) and then the Irish dancing performance starring Dave,
Carissa and Kuni.</p>

<p class=date>2:10am</p>

<p>I did go back at 1:30 and saw those performances.  Beyond that was
more guitar stuff so I left.</p>
