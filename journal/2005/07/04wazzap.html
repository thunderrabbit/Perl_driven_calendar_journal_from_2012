Sports Bar where the music was BLASTING and I danced my ass off; so
thankful for the party and English speakers and the space to yell.</p>

<p>Back in my (our) room, getting ready to sleep, I told Shawn about
the Hitomi situation.</p>

<p>He goes, "well, the good side is, you were dancing like a champ."</p>

<p>Shawn is awesome.</p>
