<p>It seems that Montego Bay is a mishmash of cultures, mostly
financed via tourism, with probably a decent amount via drug trade.
(I glean this last bit from a site whose Hot Tip about the area was
to remember that drug posession and use is illegal)</p>

<p>I am warned to beware of pickpockets while I'm encouraged to bask
in the glorious sun on any of the fine beaches.  On one map a railway
across the country is marked with Out Of Service written along it.</p>
