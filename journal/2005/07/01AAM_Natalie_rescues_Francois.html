life onboard) Natalie has been carrying Francois around; I left him in
Windjammer after some lecture.  She scooped him up for me and has been
denying that she has him, though we both know I know she does have
him.  (Dave told me at some point.)</p>

<p>This morning, just before the port, I was like, "Hey Natalie, I
will give you *anything* you want if you can help me find
Francois."</p>

<p>She was like, "anything?" with a flirty look.</p>

<p>"Anything that takes less than 1 hour."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can think of a <em>lot</em> of things to do in an hour!" she
said with a laugh.  "Now let me look for Francois, I think I saw him
somewhere around here...." as she rummaged through her bag.  "ah!
Here he is!  I wonder how he got *in* there???"</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for rescuing him."</p>

<p>"You're welcome, darl, but you need to be more careful with him;
I've heard rumors..."</p>

<p>"Really??"  I nearly beam with delight.  Francois is becoming
famous.</p>
