<p>Was just talking to Kuni a bit.  I find it strange that I seem to
be seeking women with whom I cannot speak.  I wonder if that's
because I just want to focus on the language of love...  I think that
is not in my ultimate best interest.</p>

<p>Just talked to Sean from Ireland.  He showed me Belfast on the
starboard side of the boat.  I'm meeting Natalie for dinner in Yacht
Club now.</p>

<p>Ooooh I just saw my first aquatic life: jellyfish!</p>
