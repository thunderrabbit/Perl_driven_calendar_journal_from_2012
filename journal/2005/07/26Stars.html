<p>Gazing at the stars, very happily between Natalie and Katt,
when Hitomi came up, blocking my view, asking me if I can answer some
computer question and I hear everyone going "ooooh" that shooting star
went by and I started to get mad and I'm like, <em>get the fuck outta
here!!</em></p>

<p>After the stargazing I went down and answered her question which
took all of a second and bitched at her for interrupting the
stargazing "you wouldn't stand in front of me if I was watching a
movie, would you?" "I know I'm sorry; I thought about that later."
<em>Well think about it first before being so annoying!</em></p>

<p>She cried and ultimately told me she spends every day trying to
think of ways to talk to me.  I'm thinking <em>come on; get over
me.</em></p>
