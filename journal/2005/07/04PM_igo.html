<p>It's getting completely freeezing on this boat!  Hello, July, you
should be warm!!  We are approaching Norway.  I was just upstairs, and
watched Petra playing go with Koji (my second to oldest student), and
she seemed to be doing kinda okay, or at least know what was going
on.</p>

<p>Shunji, my oldest student, was like, "hey Rob; let's play," so I
did.  He destroyed me, but gave me the most semblance of "teaching,"
though I still have no idea what's going on.</p>

<p>He would say stuff like, "don't go there; go here.  If you went
there, then *this* would happen:" and arrange the stones in some
configuration.  I'd be like, "oh man, I wouldn't want *that* to
happen!  Apparently."  I had *no* idea why these configurations were
undesirable except that they must mean I would lose territory.  I've
definitely got to have some of the basics taught to me before these
guys can teach me anything.</p>

<p>The strategy that he taught me conflicts with the first strategy I
learned.  Argh.</p>
