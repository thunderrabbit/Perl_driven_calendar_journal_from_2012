<p>Today we met the captain of the boat.  Captain Costas (sp) from
Greece.  He has been Captain of this ship twice.  This time since May
 2005 (basically just for this voyage).  He was first captain in 1966 -
for a cargo ship for a year and then several years for tankers.
Cargo ships, then tankers, then cruise ships.</p>

<p>Koji asked him what was his most important job, and he answered
that there were many jobs on the ship and they are all interesting:
chefs, house keeping, etc etc.  Without one, none could work.</p>

<p>I invited Aki to ask him again, and he began to give the same
answer.  I interrupted: "as Captain, what is *your* most important
job?"</p>

<p>"Oh!  This is a different question.  My most important job is
parking the ship at each port.  The second most important is moving
the ship out of each port.  On the open sea, it is no problem if we
are one meter to the left or to the right.  But when parking, this is
a big problem.  With wind, sea currents, waves.. all of these things
make the job very tense.  After we arrive, there is a very good
feeling.  So you can understand what I'm talking about, I will invite
you to the bridge tomorrow when we enter New York port."</p>

<p>"You will be my guests on the bridge."</p>

<p>Ho</p>

<p>Shit!</p>

<p>I wanted to bring the entire class, so I was like, "who exactly?"</p>

<p>"You three."  (me, Aki, and Koji.)</p>

<p>So the rest of the class won't be able to come.  I absolutely
didn't want to take advantage of his invitation, nor want to flaunt it
in front of the others, so we didn't say anything to the rest of the
class.  Koji likes to talk, though, so I imagine he will say
something.</p>

<p>"You should bring your camera; you will be able to take some nice
pictures."</p><p class=date>1:44pm ADT Sunday 17 July 2005</p>
