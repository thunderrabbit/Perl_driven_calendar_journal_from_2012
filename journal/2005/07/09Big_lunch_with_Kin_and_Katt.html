<p>Kin was like "holy shit!" when she saw the cups here at Eddie
Rockets, although she neither said "holy" nor "shit."  I totally
chowed: chicken sandwich, onion rings, vanilla shake and two glasses
of water.</p>

<p>Minoru told me there was a new NIN CD, and I was like, "what?  a
new nine inch nails?"  zooooom</p>
