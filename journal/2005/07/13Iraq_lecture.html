<p>Just attended Erik's second Iraq lecture.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Afterward, He told us about a march in Washington in late
September, and I was like, "I'm there, dude."</p>

<p>Pb - Lecture 2
<br>The U.S. Peace Movement</p>

<p>Thank you all for coming tonight. We had a lecture yesterday about
the Iraq War and it focused on the situation in Iraq and some possible
solutions. But it is clear that with the Bush administration that the
war and occupation will not end any time soon. So, it is our job to
mobilize the peace movement to help create public pressure both in the
U.S. (which is my job) and abroad (which is your job) to stop the
war.</p>

<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>Before going into the background and current status of the peace
movement in the United States, I want to give a bit of an introduction
of the NGO I work for because our history is so closely linked with
the U.S. peace movement.</p>

<p><i>IPS' background:</i></p>

<p>The Institute for Policy Studies was founded in the late 1960s by
two members of the Kennedy Administration who objected to war in
Vietnam. While organizing against the Vietnam was the first activity
of the Institute, throughout the last four decades my organization has
been involved in every major movement including the civil rights
movement, women's rights, anti-apartheid movement in South Africa,
opposing the wars in Central America, and more recently we were at the
forefront of the anti-globalization movement, and today, Iraq. Our
office's mission is to linking scholarly research with activism. This
allows us to help educate the peace movement and for us to help guide
the peace movement to influence policy.</p>

<p><i>Short History of the US Anti-war Movement:</i></p>

<p>Pictures from the anti-war movement during Vietnam were shown in
the film the other night about the disintegration of Yugoslavia. It
was a very vibrant movement. Culture was influenced by anti-war songs
and movies and they were prevalent in U.S. society. They helped create
a strong and powerful movement. But even during this time the movement
was made up of many different movements, each with their own tactics
and strategies. After the Vietnam war the movement fragmented - in to
small single issue sectors, each following their own agenda. We became
a bunch of smaller movements--none with enough political power to
substantially change US policies. And shortly before the Iraq War
there was not a strong anti-war movement that existed. It had to be
newly created.</p>

<p>This is why using the term "peace movement" in the U.S. is
difficult as we have a lot of smaller movements that are all concerned
about their single issue. </p>

<p>So this talk will focus more on the anti-war movement and I'll say
a few words later about the work that is being done to broaden the
anti-war movement to become a peace movement. </p>

<p><b>Run Up to War</b></p>

<p>Unlike the war in Afghanistan where few people were in opposition,
many citizens opposed the war in Iraq. Why not opposition to war in
Afghanistan? Americans suffered from shock of the loss of the trade
towers. It directly impacted so many people. I lost a childhood friend
in the attacks, and was lucky enough to have a family friend in the
2nd tower escape unharmed. My office is located one block away from
the White House where we would have been harmed had the 4th airplane
made it to the White House, and from our office we could see the
Pentagon on fire. But while some of us were able to use logic and
reason after these attacks, most Americans were paralyzed by fear.</p>

<p>But in the aftermath of 9-11 and even while we were opposing the
war in Afghanistan, we paid close attention to what the Bush
administration was saying about Iraq and by early 2002 we knew we
needed to start organizing to try to stop the Iraq war. A new
formation of the anti-war movement began. And my organization helped
start the largest anti-war group, United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ),
based in NYC, which has more than 1,000 member organizations. At the
same time two other anti-war coalitions began. Each represents
different segments of the anti-war movement ranging from the left to
the far left but all operate with the same goal - stopping the Iraq
war. And there is loose coordination between all of the groups.</p>

<p>Before war started the groups largely focused on pressuring the
President and conducting education campaigns aimed at the broad
American public. And there were several large protests which brought
all three anti-war coalitions together in the run up to war. </p>

<p>The anti-war movement also contained a strategy to engage
Congress. The work was very successful. Public calls to members of
Congress were 10-1 against the war. But Congress did not listen - nor
did they have to - no one who voted for the war was voted out of
office because they did so. And so the President obtained
authorization to go to war.</p>

<p>Finally the anti-war movement focused on the UN as the last
hope. And while the UN did not give the U.S. legal authority to go to
war, it did not challenge the invasion.</p>

<p>Finally, we joined the rest of the world in opposition to the war
marching in the streets of New York City in February 2003. The New
York Times newspaper - one of the most influential papers in the
United States - dubbed the protests around the world as, "The Other
Superpower." A superpower of global public opinion. But even being a
superpower we were not strong enough to stop President Bush.</p>

<p><b>Start of War</b></p>

<p>The start of the war had a chilling effect on the U.S. anti-war
movement. People were torn between wanting to "support the troops" and
wanting to bring them home. Initially the war seemed to be over
quickly and with the President declaring "mission accomplished" on the
deck of an aircraft carrier a month after battle begun, the anti-war
movement had little momentum. </p>

<p>My organization working in partnership with other organizations
both in the U.S. and across the world helped found an NGO in Iraq
called Iraq Occupation Watch. This was an effort to use a valuable
strategy from the wars in Central America in the 1980s and
1990s. Where people in the States visited Central American fighters
and people from Central America came to the U.S. to explain the
situation there. It was a powerful and effective tool for educating
the U.S. public and policymakers.  But it was a difficult model to
follow in Iraq as NGOs in Iraq didn't exist and it was difficult to
establish lines of trust. Also, those opposed to our work were able to
use fear to their advantage by accusing the Iraqis we were working
with of being Baathists. This had a chilling effect in both the U.S. -
with foundations funding our work unwilling to provide additional
money - and in Iraq, where these people became targets of violence and
locals would not cooperate with them. Eventually the center
closed.</p>

<p>Just as the start of war hampered the anti-war movement, so too did
it keep members of Congress from speaking out against it.  Congress
passed two immense packages of money shortly after the war - totaling
125 billion dollars with very little dissent.  </p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, President Bush claimed that power was being
transferred in Iraq and large segments of the public believed it. The
anti-war movement was perhaps at its weakest point since the war
began.</p>

<p><b>Where We Are Now?</b></p>

<p>But as many of us predicted before war even began, the situation in
Iraq got worse for both Iraqis and U.S. soldiers. More Americans
started dying. And this sadly, gave new life to the anti-war
movement. But progress hasn't been steady - instead it has flowed and
ebbed much like a wave at the beach. And progress has varied as events
in Iraq have changed.</p>

<pre>
       -Battle in Fallujah: lots of US casualties, more dissent 
       -Iraq Elections: seen as a success, more supported Bush
       -Recent offensive: car bombings - now public opinion is the strongest against Bush
</pre>

<p>60% of public now thinks the war is going badly but yet only 25
percent favor immediate withdrawal. So our job in the anti-war
movement is to convince the remainder of those who think the war is
going badly that we have a sensible plan to reduce danger to Iraqis
while brining the troops home. And this message was part of my speech
yesterday.</p>

<p>Just as public opinion is beginning to change, so are members of
Congress. They are becoming more willing to challenge the President,
and right before I left to get on the Pb I was involved in
drafting new legislation that includes both Republicans and Democrats
calling for the President to begin withdrawing troops next year. This
leadership by a few courageous members of Congress is giving new life
to the anti-war movement.</p>

<p>And at the forefront of the movement are the soldiers who are
returning from Iraq and the family members who have loved ones in
Iraq. And sadly there is a growing organization of families who have
sons, daughters, husbands and mothers, brothers and sisters die in the
war.</p>

<p><b>So as the movement gathers strength what Will be Next?</b></p>

<p>The movement has three principle tasks ahead:</p>

<p><i>Activities aimed at showing the strength of the anti-war
movement</i></p> 

<p><br>* September march/demo in NYC around the opening of the UN.
<br>* September demonstration in DC aimed at the end of the congressional
<br>* session. Lobbying component, direct action component.</p>

<p><i>Activities aimed at broadening the anti-war movement</i></p>

<p><br>breaking down the racial gap
<br>the importance of liberal churches who have become strong advocates in the U.S. in the campaign to eliminate global debt
<br>finding new messages that reach the broad public - thinking in terms like businesses
<br>Resurgence of teach-ins - a form of public education where all day
lectures are given. We celebrated the 40th anniversary of the very
first teach-in in the U.S. which focused on the Vietnam War this past
March. And I'm proud to say that my organization had people speak at
the first teach-in and we continue this type of public education 40
years later.
<br>And we continue to engage the media - both mainstream and
progressive media to try to reach people who haven't heard our
messages.</p>

<p><i>Activities aimed at building the peace movement</i></p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is a huge task ahead of bringing
together the fractured movements. This started to happen around the
last Presidential elections. Groups representing labor, the
environment, anti-globalization, and anti-war movements shared
membership lists, jointly coordinated voter registration, some worked
together on paid advertisements and TV ads. </p>

<p>This work will continue and I'm sure we'll see the peace movement
focusing on electing peace candidates in local city, state, and
congress elections.</p>

<p>Foundations are supporting these efforts but we still see
collaboration difficult. NGOs want to guard their work, worried about
future funding, as well as different work styles between organizations
make this difficult for us in the US. </p>

<p>It will be a difficult struggle but an important one. We've seen
what has happened in the U.S. with a divided movement - our only hope
is to unite as one to confront the dangerous direction the U.S. is
leading the world.</p>


<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>I'm going to return now to the Vietnam War movement. The peace
movement really started becoming strong in 1967. But the War did not
end in 1967. It took a decade for the U.S. to bring the troops
home. We are now 2 and a half years into the Iraq War and we have the
history and still many of the leaders of the anti-Vietnam war as
leaders and members of the anti-Iraq war movement. I don't think it
will take us 10 years but I know it is going to take all of us,
working as hard as we possibly can to stop the war sooner rather than
later. Being here with all of you I gain great encouragement with your
commitment to peace and I know we will succeed. Thank you.</p>
