<p>We finished our GET meeting early and Maryann read a poem about
the sun after we ran up onto the top deck to watch the sunset.</p>

<p>I came to the port side of the ship and am dancing on a box that
seems to be dumping hot air on one side and cold air on the other.
Pretty weird.</p>

<p>I'm hoping some girl(s) will come over and talk to me.</p>

<p>I've basically given up on writing something even more perfect for
the evaluation tomorrow.</p>

<p>One of my tastebuds has gone awry; any time I scrape it, I get
shooting pain from that point of my tongue.</p>

<p>I'm feelin' kinda sick today/tonight.  Not 100% bad; I am still
able to entertain myself.</p>
