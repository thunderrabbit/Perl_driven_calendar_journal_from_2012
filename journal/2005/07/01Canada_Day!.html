<p>It's Canada Day!  I'm walking with Kris and Kim, who know the US
national anthem, and plan to teach me the Canadian anthem.  There is
a painted path from the port to the exit so we can get to the town
center.  There are no big buildings here; some old ones with coats of
paint covering layers of rust.</p>
