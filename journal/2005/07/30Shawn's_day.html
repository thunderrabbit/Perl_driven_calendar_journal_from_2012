<p>Holy crap, Shawn and peeps (two taxis worth) ended up helping some
guys who had an accident on their inaugural trip to Costa Rica.. all
this crisis about having all their stuff in the world in this car and
GET Teachers helped him get his stuff to the hotel and everything.
Man.  What a messed up situation.  The wreck was a nightmare but no
one died.</p>

<p>He got 3 seconds' view of the lake in the bottom of a crater.  I
don't know which volcano.</p>

<p>Katt goes, "oh, Shawn, I have a picture for you, and for some
reason you look just like Keanu Reeves; I don't know why, but you
do."</p>

<p>Shawn: "cause I've got my mouth wide open, and I don't appear to
be thinking about anything?"</p>

<p>Here's Shawn and I enjoying some rather large corn chips.</p>
