<p>We have scooped up Kuni in our travels and are walking to the ferry
station to meet Anika and Fas, two of Kris' friends from her days
teaching English down on some islands in south south Japan.</p>

chew on Kris, and I am totally horny and she is saying "peer pressure
is the way to go," (you should have a drink).  I let Kuni pour wine
into my mouth with her mouth, and she was like "kiss me" and I was
like, "no" and then she was like "kiss me, please," and I was like
"okay."</p>

<p>In this moment, though, I am having fun.</p>
