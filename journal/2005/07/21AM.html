<p>Just woke up.  My body is a bit sore.  I'm wearing warm clothing
to sleep cause the air is on colder than I would have it.  I drank a
ton of orange juice.  Don't really remember my dreams, but I know I
had dreams.  My sinuses feel a little bit sore.  I need a full body
massage; that would be nice.</p>

<p>My snot is copius, but only slightly yellow in tint.</p>
