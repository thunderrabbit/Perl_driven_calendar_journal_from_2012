<p>Have just finished talking to Allison and Miki the awesomely cute
woman who is only 16 but quite perfectly bilingual and beyond
beautiful.  She's a bit worried about her schooling next year, that it
will be too hard, but I promise her that she will be able to get a
full scholarship into any university around the world given her
language skills and all hnors classes.  awesome.</p>

<p>I massaged Allison's back and neck while we sat on the couches on
7th floor.</p>

<p>Allison seemed really pleased an amazed with/at my ability to
massage her lumps away. I help release her back lump, but the one on
her shoulder proved too durable.</p>

<p>Gotta be in my classroom in 4 hours and 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm just checking my room and find it's a bit of a mess, but I
trust Natalie will clean her stuff up.  Heading back to my bedroom
now; I had hoped to take a shower tonight; damn.</p>

<p>I'm in bed; showered and flossed and brushed and am wearing my
mouthguard.  My hair is in the crazy triple mohawk and samurai cuts
on the side.  I'm thankful to janette for the quilt; I use it every
night on Pb.</p>

<p>Gotta be in class in 3 hours and 15 minutes or so.  I'm really
considering going to Palestine after Pb, at least for a
little while.  I also want to go on Pb again starting in
December.  South side.</p>

<p>For the record, I have suddenly lost my Sri Lanka bracelet that I
got from Helena from Germany.  I hope I get it back, but I release it
to wherever it needs to go.</p>
