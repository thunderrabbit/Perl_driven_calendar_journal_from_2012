<p class=dream>Steve Feinstein was telling me he was dictator of SF
games in YRUU after I had left, so that was cool.  He dropped me off
and my glasses were bent, and one of the temple's covering was made
out of a worm.  And I was totally disgusted by it and ripped the worm
off and no longer had any covering at all on the temple.</p>

<p>I went to breakfast with Katt this morning.</p>
