<p>CDF went over the vocabulary and difficult lesson that Natalie and
I created: "Culture of Violence."</p>

<p>HWG practiced "New York New York" today, with Frank Sinatra
accompanyment.  After several practices, I had them do Rock Scissors
Paper to figure out who should do a solo version acapella.  Rie was
the dubious winner and she did great!</p>
