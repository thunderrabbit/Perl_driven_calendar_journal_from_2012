<p>Funny quote from Shawn as he got out of the shower:</p>

<p>"And now, the old tedious job of puttin' on pants."</p>

<p>Shawn is hilarious!</p>

<p>I've decided to shave my head.  Then I decided to shave two stripes
from the front to the back, basically like a V on my head.  It turned
into something more like a mohawk in the middle with patches on either
side of it.  I did the two initial stripes and Shawn cleaned it up a
lot.</p>
