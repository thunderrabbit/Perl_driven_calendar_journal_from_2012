<p>We are in a coffee shop with too-expensive internet available.  I
drank a steamed milk with vanilla shot, just to see what it would be
like.  It was great - very vanilla-y and milky.  And steamy.</p>

<p>This city reminds me of New Orleans - not that there are jazz
musicians everywhere, but a lot of vendors in the street there are
trees protruding out of the sidewalks, and stores are various
complexities and types buildings are various degrees of open versus
closed, and a lot of activity; people walking both directions on both
sides and sometimes the middle of the street.  Very lively city.  At
least this area is.  But how can it be so lively without street names
on the streets??</p>

<p>Ooops; warm milk has decided to charge through my system at full
speed.</p>
