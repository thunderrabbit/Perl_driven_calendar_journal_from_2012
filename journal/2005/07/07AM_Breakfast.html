<p>Just finished classes.  My shy girls class and I have reached a
better situation.  I told them to talk and I picked out a grammar
point..  Thanks to Katt for that suggestion!  It's weird that I
haven't tried before cause that is my favorite way to teach 1 on 1
lessons.</p>

<p>I'm on the back of the boat; I dragged myself out of bed for
classes, slept, went back to bed, and now am upstairs to get some
food.  Some girls are saying "bye" to Francois, even though he is a
stuffed rabbit.  I do want him to be famous, though.</p>
