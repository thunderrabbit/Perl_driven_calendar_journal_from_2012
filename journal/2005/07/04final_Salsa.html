<p>In one minute Shawn and I will be late for the final practice
before the final Salsa performance.  I was gonna shave, but I don't
have time; I will put my contacts in, though.</p>

<p>We are dancing backstage just before we go onstage.  Allison will
perform and then we are on.  Everyone is in super high genki mood,
and it's great!</p>
