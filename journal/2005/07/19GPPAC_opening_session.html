<p>Everyone is well dressed, prepared to head to the United Nations
for the opening of the GPPAC (Global Partnership for the Prevention
of Armed Conflict).</p>

<p>It's apparently 105 degrees F outside.</p>

<p>Oops; the bus leaves at 8; not 8:15.</p>

<p>We went through the security tent of the United Nations building.</p>

<p>And are now milling about looking at the history of tattoos and
scarification and body stretching featured on the walls.</p>

<p>The stamps here in the UN are cool holographic stamps.</p>

<p>The Pb drum performance RULED.  I was really truly
impressed.</p>

<p>Other than the Pb drums, and the speech given by basically the
original PB guy, the whole ceremony was basically boring as turds.</p>

<p>I'm thinking like, "if this had been a right wing something
something, there would have been more calls to action - more
uplifting cheering let's do this thing!"  Why??</p>
