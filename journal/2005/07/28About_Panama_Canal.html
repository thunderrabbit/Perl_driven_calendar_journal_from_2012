<h2 align="center">Cristobal</h2>

<p>Cristobal itself is not much to look at and there is limited
shopping in the city.</p>

<p>The only place to go was the large dockside flea market, which
consequently was jammed with people and did rather well. We bought a
nice woven basket made by almost clothed Indians from the Wounaam and
Embera tribes which inhabit the rainforest in the jungle between
Panama and Columbia, and a local Panamanian T-shirt. The Indians
favored us with a dance when they were not selling woven ware.</p>

<p>There seem to be no restaurants in the city.</p>


<h2 align="center">Panama Canal</h2>

<p><img src="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/Panama_Canal/panama_canal.gif" align="left" /> The Panama Canal
extends across the Isthmus of Panama from Colon on the Atlantic Ocean
(Caribbean Sea) side to Balboa and the Pacific Ocean.

<h3>canal operation</h3>

<p>The operation of the locks consumes a prodigious amount of fresh
water. Each time a ship passes through the waterway, some 52 million
gallons must flow into the locks and out to sea. Most of its comes
from Gatun Lake but with the increase of traffic, nearby Madden Lake
(or Alajuela Lake) was built, also by damming, in 1936. There are
three levels of continuous locks at Gatun on the Atlantic side but on
the Pacific side it was necessary to separate the levels. There is
only one level change at Pedro Miguel from the 85-foot high Gaillard
Cut to 54-foot high Miraflores Lake. Like all Panama Canal locks,
chambers are filled and emptied by gravity, water flowing through a
series of 18-foot diameter tunnels allowing the filling and emptying
of a chamber in 10 minutes!</p>

<p>The lock gates, another marvel of engineering, consist of a pair of
towering leaves ranging from 47 to 82 feet high. The leaves are each
65 feet wide and seven feet thick with a weight from 400 to over 700
tons. The lower sections of the gates are watertight flotation
chambers. Each set of gates can be opened or closed in about two
minutes by 40-horsepower electric motors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/travel/Pb/49th_May-Aug_2005/Panama_Canal/PanamaGatunLocks2.jpg" align="right" />There will be three
main culverts extending the full length of the locks, one in each of
the side walls and one in the middle wall.  The side-wall culverts are
22 feet in diameter from the intake at the south end of the upper
locks to a point 320 feet north, where they are reduced to 18 feet, at
which diameter they will continue to the end. a distance of about
3,500 feet.  the culvert in the middle wall is 22 feet in diameter
from its south end to a point 120 feet north, where it also will be
reduced to 18 feet, at which diameter it will continue to the end, a
distance of about 3,500 feet.  Lateral culverts in the form of an
ellipse will run in the floor from and at right angles to the main
culverts at intervals of 32 and 36 feet, leading alternately from the
side and middle culverts.  Water will be delivered or collected by
each lateral culvert through five openings or wells in the floor.
Valves, which may be opened or closed either individually or all at
one time, will be located at the intakes and outlets of the main
culverts, and at the connections between the center culverts and the
lateral culverts.  In the center space of the middle wall there will
be a tunnel, divided into three stories or galleries.  The lowest
gallery is for drainage; the middle, for the wires that will carry the
electric current to operate the gate and valve machinery, which will
be installed in the center wall, and the top, a passageway for the
operators.</p>

<p>The locks are given maintenance frequently. If by chance you happen
to visit Miraflores locks at that time it is an impressive sight to
see the vast empty chamber and its huge gates being cleaned.</p>

<p>An original feature of the locks is the system of electric
locomotives better known as "mules". The mules operate along the lock
wall and are used to position vessels properly within the lock chamber
and ensure they don't bump into the side of the chamber. Each mule
weighs 55 tons and is equipped with two windlasses (winches used to
hoist or haul), each of which can exert 35,000 pounds of pulling
strength, plus a special gear which engages a slotted track between
the rails with additional traction if necessary. Small vessels may
need up to six or eight mules.</p>

<p>Every ship's captain has to relinquish the responsibility of
navigating the vessel through the Canal of Panama Canal pilot. Over
250 pilots move some 14,000 vessels through the Canal each year. Total
time spent in Panamanian waters averages about 24 hours.</p>

<h3>transit costs</h3>

<p>Cargo and passenger ships (including yachts, army and navy
transports and hospital ships) pay according to the amount of cargo
space they hold.</p>

<p>100 cubic feet of space = 1 Panama Canal net Ton</p>

<p>When carrying passengers or cargo: $2.57 per net ton</p>

<p>Without passengers or cargo: $2.04 per net ton</p>

<p>The average toll for oceangoing commercial vessels is approximately
$45,000 but whatever a vessel pays, it can save up to ten times the
toll by eliminating the journey round Cape Horn.</p>

<p>Large ships (~105 feet / ~31 meters wide) pay between $80,000 and
$150,000 in tolls.</p>

The cruise ship Rhapsody of the Seas paid the highest ever: $165,000
to navigate the canal.  The lowest toll paid is 36 cents, levied upon
Richard Halliburton for swimming the Canal in 1928.</p>

<h3>history</h3>

<p> The canal was constructed in two stages. The first between 1881
and 1888 by a French company (led by Lesseps, who is credited with
building the Suez Canal), then followed by the Americans, with their
construction completed in 1914.</p>

<p>In 1883 it was realized that the tide level at the Pacific side was
almost 19 feet higher than the Atlantic side. Engineers concluded the
difference in levels would be a danger to navigation. It was then
proposed that a tidal lock should be constructed near Panama City to
preserve the level from there to Colon.</p>

<p>Eventually, due to some new thinking, and in an effort to do it
right the first time, it was decided that the original plan should be
modified and a widely accepted lock system should be used.</p>

<p>As an example, when a ship traveling from the Atlantic side reaches
the Gatun Locks, a series of three locks raise that ship about 85
ft. to Gatun Lake. Then it's a 40 mile trip to the locks at Pedro
Miguel, locks that lower the ship 30 feet. At the Miraflores locks the
ship is lowered an additional 52 feet to Pacific Ocean sea level.</p>

<p>The Gaillard Cut, once called Culebra Cut and renamed for
Col. David Gaillard the engineer in charge of this section of the
Canal work, is the most interesting part of the trip. This portion of
the channel is about nine miles long. It was excavated through rock
and shale and the endeavor cost heavily in lives and was one of the
many reasons for the Lesseps' failure. Its width was originally 300
feet but it was widened later to 500 feet. A new widening construction
is actually under way.</p>

<p>Since its
opening in 1914, the canal has been closed only one day, December
20th, 1989, during the invasion of Panama by the United States, in
their successful effort to remove the de facto ruler General Manuel
Noriega from office. Managed for decades by the U.S, the canal was
returned to Panama on December 31, 1999.</p>

<p>The Culebra Cut, where the canal slices through the continental
divide; and the beginnings of a huge new suspension bridge, which will

<h2 align="center">Balboa</h2>

<p>The small town of Balboa is at the Pacific end of the canal and is
adjacent to Panama City. Once part of the U.S.-controlled Canal Zone,
its former military buildings, barracks and officers' quarters have
been converted to shops, offices, schools and luxury homes.</p>

<p>The big buildings and wide lawns of Balboa provide a stark contrast
to the narrow streets of the old parts of nearby Panama
City. Definitely worth a visit is Balboa's Canal Administration
Building. The building's rotunda, which resembles the one in the
U.S. Capitol, is surrounded by fantastic murals that tell the dramatic
story of how the canal was built. Near the road leading to Ancon Hill
is Los Pueblitos, which has replicas of villages of four different
Panamanian ethnic groups.</p>

<p>If you want to shop, the folk market at Stevens Circle in Balboa is
a good place to buy local handicrafts. It's a small, outdoor market,
where no one hassles you to buy. Indians from the San Blas Islands are
there with plenty of molas (embroidery pieces) to sell. (If you will
be visiting the San Blas Islands during your trip, you may prefer to
buy molas there. The selection is better.)</p>

<p>Fort Amador, once a U.S. military installation, is going through a
major transformation. It has become a cruise-ship port, and many tours
of the city and canal are offered from there. Flamenco Island, where
the fort is located, is becoming a resort complex complete with
marina, restaurants, bars and shops. (A hotel and casino are in the
works.)</p>

<p>The Causeway stretches out from the end of Fort Amador to three
small islands, affording great views of the canal, the Bridge of the
Americas, which crosses the canal, and Panama City. Several rustic
waterfront restaurants are found along the Causeway. Also just past
Balboa are the impressive Miraflores Locks, the most convenient
viewing point for the canal (with a nice visitors center). 2 mi/3 km
west of Panama City.</p>
