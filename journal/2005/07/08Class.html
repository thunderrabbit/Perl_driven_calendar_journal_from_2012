<p>Today after my HWG class I had to vent a bit with Kris and Petra -
I just want to throw HWG off the boat for not talking!  As individuals
they all try to talk, but when in a group they just clam up like the
air has been poisoned.</p>

<p>Massaged Petra's shoulders and back until lunch time.</p>

<p>HWG stands for Happy Wonderful Girls.</p>
