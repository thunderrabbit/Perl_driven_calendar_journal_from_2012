<p>We're docked in Cristobol, Panama now, which has been described as
so dangerous that we must not leave the terminal.  This rule has been
set down as law for volunteers and paid staff, but the paying
passengers are allowed to exit the terminal.  Apparently there were
several muggings last time, though.</p>

<p>Several booths are set up inside the terminal, hawking trinkets and
T-shirts and crap that are (from my point of view) barely
distinguishable from most of the other ports we've visited.  There is
an internet cafe with three computers, five flat screen monitors, and
several empty desks.  $2 per half hour.</p>

<p>I wrote a four page letter to Kellie on the Rody stationery that
she sent to Jamaica for me!  Okay; I'm going to write some emails to
people and maybe send them from this port.</p>

<p>Kim put a woven bowl on her ponytail.</p>
