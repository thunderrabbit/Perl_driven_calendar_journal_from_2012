<p>Big issues getting my credit card cancelled - had to get the phone
numbers using the internet (500 yen), then after huge inability to
dial out from my cabin (no real instructions), I kept getting cut off
after I reached the voice response system of my credit card company.
I was really frustrated and went back up to the top desk where
beautiful tall Sabrina tried hard to push the guy to let me use the
ship phone (so I won't have to pay).  Turns out, 800 numbers cannot be
dialed with the ship's satellite phone system.  I guess the average
1-800-number owner doesn't want to pay for it.</p>

<p>Went outside to find a payphone, but there are none near the
ship, according to two cops on bicycles, who did not let me use their
bicycles.</p>

<p>Time for bed.</p>
