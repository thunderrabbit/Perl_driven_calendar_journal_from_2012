<p>I was stressed with too much stuff to do, but I'm feeling a bit
better.  I had to record audio of the bell chime for my little skit.
I got it done alright, but it was like the last straw of things to do
that I was like, 'augh! too much!'</p>

<p>I've finished lesson prep for both classes tomorrow.  I think it
will be enough.</p>
