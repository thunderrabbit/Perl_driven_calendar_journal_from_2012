<p>I just met a man named Frank who is 75 years old and just had a
cancer operation.  He was like, "I'm too old for *dancing* and
stuff.." and we talked about the history of the ship and stuff.</p>

<p>Right now I'm about to go meet *my* Frank out and about in New
York City.  I'll take Francois and my toothbrush just in case.</p>

<p>Never met Frank; I called him and left messages about every 30
minutes, but never got a response.</p>

R,
 
Lost my fucking cell phone. I got your voicemails. Total nightmare for me.  
Sorry for the fuck up.

<p>Oh man; that sucks.  Frank *never* does fucked up stuff like
that.  I knew something big musta happened.</p>
