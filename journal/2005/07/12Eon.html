<p>In an effort to just relax my brain after being all mad at Happy
Wonderful Girls, I started to read the history of earth as described
in Encarta, an incredible resource that has become our backbone of
research given we have no internet access.</p>

<p>I learned we are now in the Holocene period.  There is like era,
???, period, and epoch.  We are in the Holocene period.  Kinda weird
to be inside spans of time so large that I don't even know they have
names much less what names.</p>

<p class=note>(more <a

<p>I wonder if we are thinking about getting out of the Holocine
period due to global warming and subsequent freezing and etc etc... It
would be cool to experience a new 10,000 year unit!</p>
