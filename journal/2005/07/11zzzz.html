<p>Today and tonight I spent a lot of time on my computer, downloading
the videos of Niveen being interviewed by my classes for viewing
tomorrow.  Flirted with Natalie a bit.  No one showed up for Silent
Football except for Hitomi, who showed me pictures from Dublin and
took Francois when she left.  Maybe for a good washing.  I didn't
really flirt with Kuni today.  I talked to Allison about our
respective relationship situations.  Tough stuff.</p>

<p>Natalie had NIN halo 8, which I tried to import on my machine, but
it kept spinning the CD up and timing out after a minute of high speed
spinning.  This was completely unstoppable and completely frustrating,
but finally I just powercycled the machine and got it imported.</p>
