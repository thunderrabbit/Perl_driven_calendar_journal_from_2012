the sunshine bar now, about to head back to the internet cafe with my
computer so I can use their WiFi and upload all my ramblings.</p>

<p>Still haven't uploaded any pictures yet.</p>

<p>Hmmmm... I have time; I'll make an album now.</p>

<p class=date>4:11pm CEST Saturday 02 July 2005</p>

<p>Okay, I've just put together 97 pictures, which represent all the
ports we've been to so far, I think.</p>

<p>To do:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>upload pictures</p></li>

<li><p>upload journal entries</p></li>

<li><p>send Rob Update</p></li>

<li><p>send two .doc files to Matt</p></li>

<li><p>(optional) get copy of thumbnail URLs so I can add them to my
journal entries.  (I can do this later)</p></li>
</ol>
