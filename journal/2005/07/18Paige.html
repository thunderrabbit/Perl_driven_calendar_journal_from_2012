awesome energy.  Huge beautiful smile and so lovely and tall.  When I
called her, she was like, "meet me at 6th street and 34th in front of
Macy's" so I went there and was like, <em>shit; I don't know if I
remember what she looks like - okay, she's tall, beautiful, big smile,
ummmm so she'll be smiling I'm sure, man...</em> so I waited a bit
with this worry hanging over my brain and then I saw her and it was
like, Bang.  No question.</p>

<p>We met and talked about our respective Pb voyages (she's
been on 3 voyages) and she was in New York at the time of Airplane
Day, and she was in London recently on Train Day.  Holy fuck!</p>

<p>We are at her favorite bookstore, The Strand, featuring 18 miles of
books.  We have specified that we'll meet back at the front at exactly
3:40pm.  She and I both love books slash bookstores, so we could be
here for a while, but that could get expensive (and heavy).</p>

<p>It's so weird to see all these books in English!  Man; there is so
much to read!</p>

<p class=date>7pm</p>

<p>Paige has been giving me a brief history of places she's lived in
New York.  I will remember some of it, e.g.</p>

<p>Broadway cuts diagnolly across all the streets.</p>

<p>Fifth avenue ends at Washington Square.</p>

<p>I should see the movie <em>Kids</em> and <em>American History
X</em></p>

<p class=date>8pm</p>

<p>We are going to Bowery Bar later, but I am zipping back to the
boat to put on some nicer clothes and she is doing the same at her
apartment.  We will meet at her apartment in a bit.</p>

<p>I called Frank on Paige's phone and invited him to Bowery Bar.  He
declined, saying he'll have to wake up early tomorrow, but we will
meet tomorrow.</p>

<p>I ran barefootedly back to the boat cause I am faster running but
couldn't run in my sandals.  I met a guy named Pat when I stopped to
put on my sandals to walk across some horseshit water coming from the
horse drawn carriage barn.</p>

<p>He was like, "now here's a guy I like; where you from? Jersey?"
and I was like "Houston," and he goes, "Houston is hot.  I have a
brother from Austin," and he told me a bit about what's what in his
life, and I gave him a brief overview of mine.</p>

<p class=date>12:05am</p>

<p>I am in a cab heading back to the boat.  Just hung out with Paige
and her peeps at Bowery Bar, where we played Mafia (I narrated the
games) twice.  The first game was short cause I hadn't done a good job
of describing the rules:</p>

<p>I handed out shuffled pieces of my business card to specify who
would be commissioner, mafia, townspeople.  Everyone saw their little
piece and I specified, "okay, don't show anyone your card.  whoever
has my first name, 'Rob' is the mafia.  Whoever has 'Nugen' is the
commissioner.  Everyone else is a townsperson."  Everyone understood,
and the first night came.  I was like, "okay, everyone put your heads
down.  Mafia person, wake up and touch one person on the head."  I had
my head down, too, because we didn't really have enough people to play
otherwise.  "Okay, everyone wake up, except the person who was
touched: you have died," and then for effect, "Oh No!!"  So one guy
woke up all dramatically dead and then I was like, "aight guys; who do
you think did it?"</p>

<p>And one guy goes, "I did it," like, <em>well *that* was an easy
question!</em></p>

<p>I was like <em>oops</em> and explained the rules more carefully
the next time.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh, *AND* I met a man named Earth who (looks a lot like my
cousin Peter, and is superfluent in Japanese, and has a birthday soon,
AND) knows Silent Football!!!!  I was describing the overview of the
game, and he goes, "oh, you mean Silent Football?" and my heart lept
like, <em>WOW!</em> "yeah!  you know it??"</p>

<p>He said he learned it in college and showed me some of the moves he
remembered.  They were different than what we use in Southwest
District, but similar moves to what I remember from some of the UU
groups up in the northeast US..</p>

<p>We didn't actually play SF, but had a great time chattering and
such.  My first night out in New York City was a great success.</p>

<p>At one point I saw Earth's shirt was wrong side out, so I said,
"hey Earth, why is your shirt inside out?"</p>

<p>He goes, "wha?" and looked and "hey, my shirt is inside out!"</p>

<p>So I turned my shirt inside out as well, just to be the first one
in on this new fashion statement.  Paige joked about turning her own
shirt inside out, but it would have been a bit more revealing than
our button shirts over T-shirts.</p>

<p class=date>12:10am ADT Tuesday 19 July 2005</p>

<p>Just dropped of Paige, Sarah and Alex at Sarah and Alex apartment
where Paige is staying.</p>

<p>I have had the absolutely best time ever today, and really enjoyed
the *feeling* of being in New York City, just like stories I have read
of people in New York City, cause now, after all these years, I can
say I have done this stuff in New York City, too.</p>

<p>Hmmm; I never asked Paige how she is funding her travels... It's
like I want to be told the answer, but I know it has to come from
myself.</p>

<p class=date>12:17am ADT Tuesday 19 July 2005</p>

<p>I walked through the metal detector, but it went off, but they
were like, "whateva" and let me through.  Also, there is a sign that
says something like, "BLAH BLAH BLAH IS A BREECH OF SECURITY."
Breech?  Come the fuck on guys; use a dictionary!</p>

<p>I told one of the security guards in the hopes that he would tell
someone who could fix the sign.</p>
