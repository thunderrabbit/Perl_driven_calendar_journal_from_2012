<p>I have 25 minutes until I need to meet Happy Wonderful Girls 15
minutes each individually.  Our lesson was much better today than
yesterday.  Now it's only been half the cruise, but hopefully I have a
better sense of what they want.  We went up onto top deck and
practiced "it looks like" and "it sounds like" and "it seems like"</p>

<p>After class I ran down and did the Super Beginner and Beginner
lesson.  I worked on Responding to Good News and Responding to Bad
News.</p>

<p>Hitomi just brought a recently washed Francois back to me.</p>
