<p>Today after the GPPAC thing I met Paige and we walked down to Union
Square to meet her friend Sarah there.  We went to Whole Foods and
chowed yummy Whole Food cookies courtesy of Sarah, and just enjoyed
talking about travel and whatever we talked about.  I got one of the
huge _Whole Foods Odwalla Superfood Micro Nutrient Fruit Juice Drink_
bottles cause I love that stuff, but all too soon I had to head back
for this thing we are doing tonight on the ship.  Sarah was like,
"I'll see you again," and I thought <em>???  really??</em> and she
goes, "you know how these things work out."</p>

<p>So I specifically took a moment to memorize her face.  She looks a
lot like (Marcel's) Kayse to me.</p>

<p>I then took the New York subway for the first time, and was pleased
by its raw energy and rough old minimal appearance.  Flat $2 to go
anywhere one wants in the system.  Took the train from Union Station
to 50th and 8th Avenue, then walked to 50th and 12th Avenue where the
ship is parked.</p>
