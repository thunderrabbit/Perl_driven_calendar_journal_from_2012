<p>Gorgeous beautiful weather outside.  The Atlantic has been
disappointingly smooth.  Hopefully the Pacific will be rockin'.</p>

<p class=note>Maryann says "HI Rob's diary!"</p>

<p>Today, Cheerful Dancing Fellows will have interviews with people,
including Captain Costas!</p>

<p>I bruised the ball of my right foot pretty effectively last night
by climbing over a rail in Sports Bar.  I hit a table, all of which
are well-secured so they won't tip in rocky weather, and I can still
feel it today.</p>

<p>Wow!  today is Captain Costa's birthday!  1946.</p>
