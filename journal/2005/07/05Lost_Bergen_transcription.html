<p>While transcribing tapes, I foolishly deleted Bergen entries and
never retyped them.  But I have pictures.  I basically walked into the
city alone, talking into my tape recorder about what I was seeing.
Everything was far too expensive for my tastes (I should live there
and get a job if I wanna make some phat cash) so I just hung out in
the makeshift internet cafe slash souvenir shop near the ship.

the norsemen who fought against the bad guys.</p>

<br />shops along my side of the fiord</p>

my hip.</p>

<br />Back to the ship, I got these pics.  The weather was *spectacular*.</p>
