<p>Met up with Matt and Kris to get a taxi into town.  I don't really
want to walk the same trek again.  I thought the taxi driver we found
was cool though I couldn't really understand his accent.  But then he
kept driving a bit longer than what I expected.  I was like, "here is
cool" but he wanted to drive a little further.  Grr.  Kris was totally
falling asleep in the back; she <em>forgot</em> to sleep last night.
