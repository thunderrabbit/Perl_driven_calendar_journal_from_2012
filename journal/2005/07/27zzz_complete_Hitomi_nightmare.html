<p>While I was watching Family Guy on Brandt's DVD with Katt in my
GET Room, Hitomi came and knocked on the door.  She was jealous of me
watching cartoons with Katt and I was not wanting to talk to
Hitomi.  Complete nightmare.</p>

<p>Katt left cause Hitomi wouldn't leave and Hitomi came into the
room and did her old trick of locking me in the room with her and not
letting me leave.  She was like, "what were you doing?" and I'm like
"relaxing" and she goes, "oh, go ahead.  Relax."  And I'm like, "fuck
you, Hitomi; you know that's not fair."</p>

<p>It's been a complete nightmare having her on the ship.  She
literally was hanging onto me as I was trying to leave, and I was
trying not to be violent with her, but it's like, "jesus Hitomi stop
it," and I literally walked with her hanging onto me.  I walked all
the way to reception, bless her little heart, with her literally
holding onto me and being dragged (not with me holding her) by holding
onto me as she walked.  Incredible.</p>

<p>I just wanted for a real person (at reception) to see this fucking
insanity and somehow magically Natalie happened to come by and
listened to my story for about 20+ minutes and then Natalie ended up
talking to Hitomi for about 2+ hours.</p>

<p>This is a complete fuckin' nightmare.</p>

<p>Am I continuing to bring this nightmare on myself?  Do I need to
change more to keep it from happening?  Do I want it to stop?</p>
