<p>I had a somewhat scary dream:</p>

<p class=dream>I was peeing into a big sink like I owned a house again
and the sink was really wide, but still just the same depth as normal
sinks.  I peed in the sink and then rinsed it down.  Marcel was there;
it was his house.  We went outside and a witch or someone was like by
Marcel's house, and at the end, we saw what happened: she was standing
between two people and a bad thing came up from the ground into her
foot and transformed her into a bad woman, and she shot two people who
she had previously only tried to scare.  She shot them and they did
not die, but still they got shot.</p>

<p>Someone, I assume Katt, brought me a blanket last night, for
which I am very thankful.</p>
