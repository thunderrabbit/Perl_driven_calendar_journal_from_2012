<p>500 meter visibility.  The ship is honking its horn every couple
of minutes.  Interesting to not be able to see shit.</p>

<p>I hope Captain Costas still lets us go up to the bridge.</p>

<p>He cancelled.  d'oh.</p>

<p>On the top deck now, and it's funny: we cleaned the shit out of
this ship, but the set of piers to which we are headed are ugly and
old and crappy lookin' as anything.</p>

<p>From Pier 90, Berth 3 I emerge into the streets of New York
City.  About four lanes of traffic each direction.  Just gotta get
change and then call Frank.</p>

<p>Brick buildings and dirty streets.  I'm walkin' like a bad-ass like
"Ima fuckin' kill you," but there is no one around to see.  This is
like the edge of the city.</p>

<p>Dirty ol' fucked up couches behind buildings.  I'm on 50th street,
one way with three lanes, two of which are used for parking.</p>

<p>I wonder what there is to love about the city.  I don't love it
yet.</p>

<p>I just mailed stuff to the family: a cat for dad, sand for Fred and
Ma, and some backup CDs entrusted to Fred via Ma.</p>
