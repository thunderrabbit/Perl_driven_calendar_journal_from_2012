<p>Yesterday after my camera shutter button escaped my camera, I
decided I *must* fix it before today.  I was going to bend a
paperclip, but then realize a thumbtack was already in a more perfect
shape.  Got a thumbtack and Shawn suggested clipping it to the right
length with nail clippers.  It worked perfectly!</p>

<p>I heard a rumor that Angie's camera shutter button also vanished.
She was really happy when I fixed a thumbtack for her camera!</p>
