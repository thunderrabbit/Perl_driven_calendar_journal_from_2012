<h1>State Of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type="A">

<li><p>I'm on Pb's 49th Global Voyage, and we just left
Jamaica yesterday.  We're headed for Panama now.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't written anything in my journal for a while, but I've
been pretty diligently recording audio tapes of what I intend to
transcribe slash adapt into online journal entries.  In Jamaica I
started recording tape number 23.  For transcribing, I have finished
tape 3.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been so busy slash out of touch with the real world that
I didn't even write a card to my dear Maggie who got married
on the other side of the Gulf of Mexico from us.</p></li>

<li><p>I've received postcards or letters from Kellie in nearly every
port!  She has easily been my most avid off-boat supporter, and I've
really appreciated her time and attention.</p></li>

<li><p>Just now (12:38pm) (I thought) I was in line to chat with
Mariko about working for slash helping Pb in the near future.
I hadn't gotten a timeslot for talking to her (because I haven't seen
really seen her since she got on the boat in Jamaica) but a couple
people had.  I heard a rumor that she would be in Hemmingway from 11am
to 2pm chatting with people.  Went down there, found her and waited a
fair distance away so I wouldn't be annoying, and when she became free
I walked up as she and Audrey were getting up to leave.  "Did you have
a meeting?"  "No."  "Okay; just really crazy, dude."</p>

<p>They're busy.  I get that.  Should I have been annoying and be
like, "me too me too!"  ?  Should I have not waited?  Should I just
fucking get over it?</p>

<p>I think my angst stems from my assumption that the people who got
meetings scheduled with her had them scheduled at the party last
night, which I didn't attend cause it didn't interest me.</p></li>

<li><p>I still haven't decided what I'll be doing after Pb
(September 1st).  A vague outline idea is:

  <ol type="1">
  <li><p>hang out in Japan slash US until the 24-26 September peace
      march on Washington.</p></li>
  <li><p>go live in Palestine and work for an NGO there for a month or
      two.</p></li>
  <li><p>go back to Japan for 52nd Pb voyage
      preparations</p></li>
  <li><p>go on 52nd Pb Voyage (6 January - early
      Aprilish)</p></li>
  </ol></p></li>

<li><p>I've now climbed Dunn's Falls in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, as
Armstrong suggested it would be the coolest thing ever.  It was
definitely cool, and definitely way more cool than it would have been
had I stuck with the group, but, it was not as cool as Wailua Falls on
Kawai'i (sp), Hawai'i.</p></li>

<li><p>My camera lost its shutter button, so I replaced it with a
thumbtack and a sticker to hold it in place.  It works well enough
that: (!) I won't need to replace the button with a "real" one; (@) it
works in my underwater camera case.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been taking *far* fewer pictures at each port recently.
I took jillions in Egypt.  I took maybe 30 in Jamaica.</p></li>

<li><p>The boat is rocking quite a lot today; it's putting me to
sleep.</p></li>

<li><p>In New York, I made a decision to no longer have sex with
people whose HIV / disease status is unknown to me.  The logic was
based on my disapproval of people who smoke while knowing smoking
kills.  I bought a <a href="http://homeaccess.com">home testing</a>
kit at a drugstore and got my results in Jamaica.  Negative.  However,
I'm not past the infection window thing, so I'll test again after
that.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't written postcards in a while, and I haven't ever
written a postcard to Jen.  It's weird how we could be so close when
we're together in Tokyo and so distant when we're 12,000 miles away.
I'm just feeling overwhelmed with stuff to do, even though right now
we are on vacation from teaching GET classes.</p></li>

<li><p>Francois, the (name I've given (Ai gave) to the) stuffed rabbit
Colleen gave me, is being featured at the end of a music video being
put together by a few members of the video project team.  The
students' basic idea was to have people begging for the love of an
unavailable woman and I suggested Francois as the model for the woman.
It's good that this will boost Francois' career, but it may give him
gender issues considering people already think he's a girl when I
introduce him to people.  Ah well.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven't studied Japanese worth crap on this voyage.  I'm
often finding myself sick of the way I imagine I'll have to think to
speak Japanese.  It seems a very loosey goosey language where we must
infer the meaning of everything that's spoken to find out what's being
said.</p></li>
