<p><B>The Context of War: Reasons behind the War</B></P>

<P>2 and a half years ago President Bush took us to war in iraq.  As
in the run up to war, today a national and global debate rages over
the rising costs and dubious benefits of war and occupation in
Iraq. For many people, especially in the United States, informed
debate has been difficult since so much of what we have been told by
the Bush administration has turned out to be false. The majority of
people now recognize that the administration&rsquo;s central premises
in launching this war were lies: Iraq did not possess weapons of mass
destruction, Baghdad had nothing to do with September 11, and Saddam
Hussein did not have operational ties to al Qaeda.</P>

<P>[Rough copy here&mdash;Erik&rsquo;s Notes]</P>

<P>Why go to war?  Huge amounts of speculation. Oil, finish work of
George Bush I, Ideology of neoconservatives who want to remake the
world in the US image, war profitering, new place for military
bases. Recent reports in the US that Bush discussed the war when he
was in the Governors office in TX as a way of diverting public opinion
away from the domestic agenda. In some sense, these are all right. The
administration is made up of many different people, and many have
their own agendas. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll never know the exact reason why
George Bush decided to make that fateful decision in March 2003 to
order the attacks. While it is important to hold the President
accountable for the lies and deception that led to the war we have a
much more urgent task at hand right now&mdash;stopping the war. Once
the suffering of the Iraqi people ends, we can spend our energies
exposing the lies of the President.</P>

<P><B>The Costs of War</B></P>

<P>After 2 and a half years of war and occupation in Iraq, and even as
public support for the war plummets, there is still little
understanding in the United States about the real costs of the war. We
have paid a very high price for the war and have become less secure at
home and in the world. The destabilization of Iraq since the
U.S. invasion has created a terrorist haven that did not previously
exist in Iraq, while anti-American sentiment world-wide has sharply
increased.</P>

<P>[Rough copy here for the 3 costs&mdash;Erik&rsquo;s Notes]</P>

<P><B>An Alternative Path: Bring the Troops Home</B></P>

<P><I>Staying the Course?</I>  Putting aside the costs and illegality
of the war, the very real question remains&mdash;what do to
next. While the majority of the U.S. public are generally unhappy with
President Bush's handling of Iraq and they are resigned to the
importance of seeing the commitment through. Only 25% of the public
thinks immediate withdrawal is the best option. Many, including
progressives, argue that we have obligations to the Iraqi people to
stay in order to provide security and reconstruction. Many
conservatives argue that the project of democratizing the middle east
is working so we need to stay. And we hear objections to setting a
timetable as that will allow the insurgents to hide until that date.
These are all deep and profound dilemmas we need to address in order
to find a peaceful solution in Iraq. And I&rsquo;m going to take a
quick shot at providing some possible solutions and I look forward to
having a good question and answer period to get more indepth.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>What will happen when
the U.S. troops are withdrawn?<BR></I></SPAN></STRONG>No one can say
with certainty what will happen when U.S. troops leave.  But if the
Administration continues to &ldquo;Stay the Course&rdquo; U.S. troops
will continue to die and they will continue to kill.  Iraq&rsquo;s
reconstruction will remain stalled and the country&rsquo;s overall
situation will remain dire. </P>

<P>It is likely that the withdrawal of U.S. troops would lead to the
collapse of at least some parts of the current government, but some of
its institutions, including the police, the military and other
security agencies, could well survive with different people, untainted
by association with the U.S.  occupation, emerging from within them to
assert new leadership. And without an outside enemy occupying the
country, it is also more likely that the kind of secular nationalism
long dominant in Iraq would again prevail as the most influential
(though certainly not sole) political force in the emerging Iraqi
polity, as opposed to the Islamist tendencies currently on the rise
among Iraqis facing the desperation of occupation, repression and
growing impoverishment.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Minimize Chances of
Civil War<BR></I></SPAN></STRONG>The most important step towards
preventing civil war requires withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, and
thus diminishing the overall level of violence by removing its primary
target. It is unlikely, however, that the violence will completely
disappear with the end of the occupation, or that the Iraqi military
can rebuild itself instantly as U.S. troops are withdrawn. As a
result, there will be a need for international
assistance&mdash;including some temporary kind of peacekeeping and/or
security assistance until Iraq&rsquo;s own security forces become
viable. That temporary on-the-ground security assistance cannot be
imposed by U.S. (or U.S.-led &ldquo;coalition&rdquo;) forces. Truly
multilateral regional and international organizations must provide
it. </P>

<P>A combination of United Nations blue helmet peacekeepers, along
with temporary forces accountable to the Arab League and/or the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) would provide
international legitimacy as well as regional accountability. The
effect would be to reduce regional tensions and encourage neighboring
countries to provide support throughout Iraq&rsquo;s reconstruction
process. </P>

<P>Washington rejected an offer from Saudi Arabia to help create a
regional force in Iraq. But clearly there is willingness from other
countries in the region to get involved. Since the U.S. went into Iraq
with no plan to secure the support of neighboring states, despite the
fact that one of the claimed goals of invasion was &ldquo;spreading
democracy&rdquo; in the Middle East, it is not surprising that the war
and occupation have significantly increased regional antagonism
towards the U.S.  Additionally, persistent U.S. hostility towards Iran
continues to hurt the prospects for post-occupation regional
cooperation. Once the Iraq occupation ends, though not before,
U.S. efforts to repair its damaged standing in the region might have a
chance of success. A serious U.S. effort to support regional (the Arab
League and the OIC, which includes both Iran and Turkey) and
international efforts, without controlling them, would be an important
start. </P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>A Plan for Withdrawal:
Policy Directions for the U.S.<BR></I></SPAN></STRONG>In the period
between the announcement of a date certain for troop withdrawal and
the completion of the actual withdrawal: </P>

<P><B>1) Decrease U.S. troops and end offensive operations:</B> As a
first step to withdrawal, the U.S.  should declare an immediate
cease-fire and reduce the number of troops deployed in Iraq. Increased
offensive operations will only escalate the violence and make Iraq
less secure and less safe. The U.S. should pull troops out of major
cities so that greater manpower can be directed to guarding the
borders to stem the flow of foreign fighters and money being used to
fund the resistance. If Iraqi security forces need assistance
maintaining order, they have the option of inviting in outside forces,
preferably under the UN.</P>

<P><B>2) Declare that the U.S. has no intention to maintain a
permanent or long-term military presence or bases in Iraq:</B>
Congress needs to make clear that it is committed to the principle of
responsible withdrawal of all U.S.  troops from Iraq. By making this
statement through a congressional resolution, the U.S. would openly
acknowledge that it has no interest in controlling Middle Eastern oil
or in suppressing Muslims, hence depriving insurgents of their central
organizing message. Without such a resolution, Iraqis have little
reason to believe that our present actions are nothing greater than a
plan to establish a long-term military presence in Iraq and make the
occupation a permanent feature of Iraqi life.</P>

<P><B>3) Hand the restoration of services to Iraqis:</B> The
U.S. government and its contractors have failed to restore public
services and public safety, strengthen institutions, or provide
jobs. By giving Iraqis control over reconstruction funds more Iraqis
will get jobs and projects will be better targeted to the needs of
Iraqis. And lowering the unemployment rate will weaken the potential
for recruitment into the insurgency.  Lawmakers should put the brakes
on the rampant war profiteering that has caused widespread waste,
fraud, and abuse. To do this, the U.S.  must stop awarding no-bid
contracts and open-ended, &ldquo;cost-plus,&rdquo; multi-billion
dollar contracts such as those awarded to Halliburton and Bechtel and
increase oversight over the military and its contractors.</P>

<P>The U.S. owes a massive financial debt to Iraq. Over time, that
obligation must be to repay Iraq for the cost of the collapse of their
economy as a result of the U.S.-orchestrated 1990-2003 economic
sanctions; for the damage of the 2003-2005 invasion and occupation;
and promised U.S. reconstruction funds far beyond the pittance so far
released. </P>


<P><B>4) Negotiations: </B>As with any guerrilla war, the Iraqi
resistance is unlikely to be defeated by military means. Political and
diplomatic solutions must be the key components to change the terrible
situation Iraqis are in today. The Association of Muslim Scholars,
which represents thousands of mosques throughout the Sunni triangle,
said they would have participated in the elections if the U.S. would
have put forth a timetable for withdrawal. On a positive note, recent
news reports indicate that some discussions between insurgent groups
and the U.S. military have occurred. But even more important than
negotiations with the U.S. is for a dialogue between the insurgents
and Iraqi leaders who were recently elected. </P>

<P><STRONG>Looking Forward</STRONG></P>

<P>All possible scenarios in today&rsquo;s war-ravaged Iraq pose
potential risks. Having waged an illegal invasion and occupation of
Iraq, the U.S. has no good options. Maintaining the U.S. occupation,
with U.S.  troops killing and dying in Iraq, violates U.S. and
international law, as well as the UN Charter and the Geneva
Conventions. Clearly this is not the way forward. </P>

<P>A January 2005 Zogby poll found that 82% of Sunnis and 69% of
Shiites favor U.S. withdrawal either immediately or after an elected
government is in place. How withdrawal is done will be our
legacy. What we propose is that that legacy be based upon giving the
Iraqis true control over their political, economic and military
conditions. That means that withdrawal isn&rsquo;t the last
step&mdash;it is the first step in a long commitment the U.S. will
have to this country.</P>
