<p>We are in The Pub, and I'm glad I came.  They were talking about
going dancing and I was like, "no way; I cannot go dancing."  Kris
held my hand / dragged me out here, which certainly helped me want to
come.  Her hand was really warm cause she had on a jacket.  I sang "I
wanna hold your haaand; I wanna hold your hand."</p>
