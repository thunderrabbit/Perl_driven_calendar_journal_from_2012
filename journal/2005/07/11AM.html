<p>We're on the way to New York City, after leaving Dublin yesterday.
The Atlantic (in this area) has waves of low amplitude but long
wavelength.  I'd say they are 30 or 40 meter wavelength and 1 meter
amplitude.  At least it looks that way to me.  Very slight rocking
back and forth on the ship.</p>

<p>I look forward to bigtime rocking later on as we cross the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>Hung out in Dave's room talking to Dave, Niveen, Natalie,
Katt, Joel... and we were teaching Niveen all sorts of new
vocabulary like "kinky" and "pervert" and "raspberry" and kept up a
debate between "don't corrupt her" and "we're not corrupting; we are
just explaining."  I was a willing recipient of raspberries.</p>

<p>We are going to be writing postcards to various embassies that
might help get the wall stopped in Palestine.</p>
