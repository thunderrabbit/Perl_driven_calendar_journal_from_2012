party: all the GET teacher got wine and cheese and hung out in
Carissa's room for a wine and cheese chow fest.  Greg was hilarious
with his fake French accent and Brandt wasn't close behind.  Natalie
sat in my lap for a good while, and I tried to chew on her ears, but
to no avail.</p>

<p>The party moved upstairs after departure, during which I had stood
with Petra, giving her premium high quality hugs as needed.</p>

<p>Then to Sports Bar, where we all danced and met (some of) the
German international exchange students, who are going to be on the
boat until Dublin.  I met Emily and Kristen.  Kristen is from Phoenix,
Arizona, but going to school in Germany.</p>
