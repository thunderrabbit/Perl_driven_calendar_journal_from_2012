<p>We took a taxi with a Japanese staff guy.  The taxi drivier charged
us extra (15 euro vs 11) by not using the meter, excuses falling forth
as I bitched at each one: claiming it was Sunday and the extra person
and the fee to come pick us up.  What a jerk.</p>

<p>Standing on the main street with the spire..  The middle few lanes
are under construction, but it's a Sunday so all the equipment is
sleeping.  Shawn is in the phone booth next to me as I'm enjoying the
sun, standing on the crowded sidewalk.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for the inexpensive internet access.  I downloaded a
bunch of news stories about the London bombings that I may or may not
find time to read on the boat.  I have confirmed the liveliness of
Bryn (and Noah) in China, though I have not heard back from Genki man
Dan nor Bronwyn nor Paige, who doesn't live in London but happened to
be there during the nightmare.  She had just sent a happy email the
day before sayig she got accepted in a business program at uni
there.</p>

<p>for the record, I don't 100% know Paige, but she was on the 45th,
 47th, and 48th Pb voyages, and I got her contact info at the
 48th 49th handover meeting.  She (at one point) planned to meet us in
NYC, but I don't know if that has changed.</p>

<p>This morning we saw the Germans off the ship; they are headed back
to their real lives in Germany.</p><p class=date>11:20am IST Sunday 10 July 2005</p>
