<p class=dream>Jimmy was on the boat for a second and when he left,
he left a note on my bed (between my bed and Minoru's).  He wrote it
on the board between our beds.  He put Francois on Minoru's bed
because he didn't know whose bed was whose.</p>

<p class=dream>I went downstairs to do something with my phone and I
saw one of the housekeepers who spoke really good Japanese.</p>
