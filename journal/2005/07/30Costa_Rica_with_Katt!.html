after walking for a while on the beach, where I 'helped' the guys who
were cleaning the beach for what seems like preparation for a big
event tonight, we walked around this little peninsula.  We walked past
what might be considered the shady area of town, because there was
shade, and people with rather sharp knives were gutting fish among
junk cars and corrugated metal sheds.  On the water, boats floated
next to non-flotatious boats (or at least not very modern boats) and
flamingoes chilled in various cliques.</p>

align="left" /></a> Near the end of the peninsula, we found a park
that was just about completely overrun with plants.  It featured a
swimming pool, but the water was only about 18 inches deep, and quite
dark.  I enjoyed seeing trees growing completely beyong the tires that
had protected them when they were little.</p>

<p>I would have found a way into the pool, but Katt was
anti-interested in that.  She left the park after not too long.</p>

align="left" /></a> We continued walking, and at the end of the
peninsula, we spent several minutes trying to get a photo of Francois
flying toward the camera as I stood in the water.  I wanted my arms to
be at my sides so it wouldn't be apparent he had been thrown.  This
one is the best we got.</p>

<p>It was after this game that we met a motorcycle rider.  He had
stopped, possibly wondering wtf we were doing with this stuffed
rabbit.  I felt assured he wouldn't think I was a pansy with a bunny
so much as a weird guy with a stuffed rabbit, cause I certainly wasn't
taking pains to treat Francois as if he were delicate.  He landed all
over the rocks and asphalt and we laughed each time as I ran up the
rocks (barefootedly, of course) to recover him if he wasn't within
Katt's easy reach.</p>

<p>Afterward, I went up to talk to him.  He's been riding around for
some months and will sell it soon and go to Chile and live for a
while.  I wondered how he financed his adventure and he goes, "Ah.. I
have income."</p>

<p>So Katt and I were wondering how he has money.  She thinks
network marketing, and I think something he built with his own blood
sweat and tears, which could include network marketing.</p>

video of them.  I wanted to have a thin long rope so I could lower
Francois down to their level and see how big they were compared to
him.  They were basking by a river over which our highway passed.
Lots of people were stopped in the area to scope out the crocs.  Lots
of traffic rumbled by, making for a relatively dangerous situation:
there was no real guard between people on the narrow "sidewalk" (which
basically amounted to a wide curb) and the highway traffic, that often
included large 18-wheelers.</p>

<p>A dog that could be named Rex, Katt next to a pretty big tree,
me on the suspension brige.</p>

/></a> Katt and I walked through this cloud forest area (called
Rainforest Aerial Trams) and loved watching the leaf cutter ants.  She
created obstacles for them by putting a big leaf in their path. She
wanted to know how long it would take for them to find their way
across it.  Basically they didn't before she got bored of waiting and
removed the leaf.</p>


<p>I was amazed at the sheer length of their trails.  They would
travel for several meters each direction before disappearing into the
jungle.  We kept seeing them cross our trail and I wondered how many
different colonies they represented.  Was it the same ant-highway
crossing our trail multiple times?  And why can't these guys find
leaves closer to their home?  Surely they don't have to walk 20
meters in the jungle to find a leaf!</p>

<p>Hilariously, Katt complained that this is a "rainforest" but
wan't raining, and it better rain cause she brought her umbrella.</p>

<p>Soon thereafter, it began to rain, and she was all happy with her
umbrella, plus, the trees did an excellent job of dispersing the
rain.  Then it came time to go back across the small suspension
bridge to go back across the river.</p>

<p>Her umbrella wouldn't fit between the lines!  She had to fold it
up to walk across, and she got soaked.  Aww poooor Katt!</p>

<p>My watch also go soaked, and it now shows blank-o'clock.</p>

<p>We ate at a cafe, and Katt got alligator burger.</p>

<p class=date>3:50pm CST Saturday 30 July 2005</p>

<p>Wow - time flies when we are sleeping in the back of the taxi.</p>

<p>Holy crap as we were paying, two guys began fighting on the street;
I heard a bottle smash and heard yelling and the cart owner threw
something and the other guy was handcuffed.  I didn't get a
picture.</p>
