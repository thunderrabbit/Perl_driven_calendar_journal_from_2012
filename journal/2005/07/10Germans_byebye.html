<p>Came back to the boat just to say bye to the German students who
partied with us for 10 days.  Kristen (from Arizona) told me they saw
an amazing speaker in Belfast who had a basic point that no one can
accurately claim to be a neutral mediator in a dispute.  Everyone just
needs to say "I am biased; I want to kill you all; now let's discuss
the issue at hand." As she spoke, words tumbled from her mouth at
light speed cause she was so excited.  She said he was ten times
faster than she, and that the non-native speakers had totally
contorted faces trying to comprehend everything.  She said it will
take her 10 days to digest it all.</p>

<p>Shawn and I are about to head back out.</p>
