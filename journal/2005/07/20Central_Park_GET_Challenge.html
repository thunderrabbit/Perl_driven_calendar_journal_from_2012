<p>I'm supposed to go meet for the GET Challenge running around
Central Park in a few minutes; I got the blood sample done okay, but
I'm not sure how I will get it to a Federal Express pickup point today
given that I will be busy with GET Challenge Program.</p>

<p>Central Park is nice.  There are curvy paths and trees and
sunbathers and lakes and water fountains and squirrels and dogs and
bikes and many other things.</p>

<p>We got lost in The Ramble, and some Puerto Rican guy led us out,
telling all sorts of stories about how dangerous it is.  I gave him $5
for getting us out and back to the meeting point basically on
time.</p>
