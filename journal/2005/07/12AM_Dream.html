<p class=dream>I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger on the street.  I was just
leaving this party and he came up.  I ignored him at first, but then
thought I might as well say HI.  I was like, "SCHWARZENEGGER!" and he
stopped and I was like, "hey man, I just want to say that I look up to
you as a man who has his shit sorted out, and I appreciate that."  I
said, "maybe there's a secret behind-the-scenes life that I don't know
about, but if there is, you hide it well, so good job."</p>

<p class=dream>He was like, "thanks!"  He asked me what I wanted to do
with my life and I said I'd like to teach or something; I'd like to do
something good and important for the world.  He didn't really comment
after that.</p>

<p class=dream>There was a bit of awkward silence, and I gave him my
yellow card.  Without hesitation he pulled out his card.  He wrote
down his email address - something weird like theiza@rica.net.  I was
like, "cool."</p>

<p>(His arms were not as big as in the movies; it was like he had lost
a little bit of bulk being governor, although he wasn't governor in my
dream.)</p>

<p class=dream>I was walking up to the street and I saw Kris on a
bicycle, but she was going really slowly.  She had left before me, but
she was having trouble with the chain.  I noted that it wasn't aligned
and I told her what was happening with it.  "Everytime you make a turn
the chain goes crooked."</p>

<p class=dream>The sprocket was only a single front sprocket, not
separate ones.  It was sheet metal, not separate ones.</p>

<p class=dream>I was going to call Marcel cause I was in an area of
town where my cellphone would work.  I looked in my pocket and pulled
out the wrong phone, and then I went to my other pocket and no phone
at all.  Then I realized, "wait a minute!  This is a dream!  I won't
have Arnold Schwarzenneger's card at all!"</p>
