<p>Let it be known that: (!) Sara (from HMV) was basically right:
[WITH_TEETH] is not as good as <b>the downward spiral: further down
the spiral</b> (though I have only listened to it one time so far
(need to listen to it seven times to give it a fair shake, according
to a guy from Telecheck who told me that about Marilyn Manson's
Antichrist Superstar)), and (@) I already have this double album which
I bought for 22 euros.  Oh well.  I hope Trent enjoys the phat
cash.</p>

<p>Going to Sports Bar now to watch Katt drink Bailey's Irish
Cream, which she said is non-alcoholic, trying to get me to try
it.  Silly girl.</p>
