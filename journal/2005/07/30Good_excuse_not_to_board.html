<p class=date>7 minutes before boarding limit CST Saturday 30 July 2005</p>

<p>We are next to the boat, but the gangplank is being *moved* so
that we cannot get onto the boat!  And the fish are going *mental*
down next to the boat.  There are hundreds of fish swimming around
this floating sticks and crap next to the boat and the fish are just
going *crazy*.</p>

<p>"Why did you miss the boarding limit?"</p>

<p>"There were no stairs!"</p>

<p>"Wah Wah Wah no stairs..."</p>

<p>Oh crap the door is closed now.  I imagine we can get on at the
other end.  Damn this is pretty spooky!   I see Shawn and Carissa
now, so I'm even more sure we are not late.  And wow the passengers
don't have to be on for 30 more minutes!</p>
