<p>I'm conflicted about what I wanna do today, except for tonight, I'm
going to throw away my contacts because I'm putting in one day
disposable lenses.  I hope to upload journal entries today.  Runes
suggested that I do my own thing today after doing a bit of
research.  I packed my crap to do an overnight somewhere.  I packed
my Handspring Visor and collapseable keyboard.</p>

<p>When Shawn saw it, he goes, "fuckin' sugoi," which is pretty cool
considering Shawn does not speak Japanese.  He goes, "that's the
coolest thing I've ever seen in my entire life," and then went back
to reading.</p>

<p>The only detail is delete key doesn't work.  Shawn goes, "that's a
good thing though, think about it: you don't look back.  Always
forward."</p>
