<p>Played ごならべ with りえ。 It's similar to Pente: we have to get
five same color stones lined up to win, but we are not allowed to
capture stones nor place stones so that we have two "open threes,"
which are the primary two ways to win in Pente.  I won four times and
she won five times, which is *much* better than the first (most
recent) time we played.  I think simply because I was less tired this
time.</p>

<p>Then we played Pente, and we won maybe an equal number of times (I
think she won one more, but I didn't keep careful track).</p>

<p>GET Meeting now.</p>
