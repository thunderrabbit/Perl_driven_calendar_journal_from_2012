<p>This morning has arrived earlier than I wanted, but I still got up
in time for breakfast.  Nicole got me with the eye-tag game in the
cafeteria.  I pretended to drop my water with a long step toward the
ground as my punishment.</p>

<p>Sometimes I eye-block her but she seems to react as if I eye-tagged
her.</p>

<p>Heh.  I almost stepped out of my room with toothpaste tube stickin
out of my pocket.</p>
