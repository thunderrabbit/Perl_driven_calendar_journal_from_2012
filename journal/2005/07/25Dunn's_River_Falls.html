<p>Fuck.  2.5 hour bumpy ass bus ride here.  That means 2.5 bumpy ass
hours back.  This place better be fuckin' *money*.</p>

<p>Next time: don't rent shoes.</p>

<p>I saw that Owen, our guide, wasn't wearing any, so I knew *I*
wouldn't need any.</p>

<p>I climbed alone; people were originally climbing as a human chain.
I was like, "ainno way I'm doing this human chain; I *need* my hands
to balance."  I am quite thankful that no one forced me into line; I
woulda been <em>pissed</em>.  Some parts were slippery as shit, so I
was careful around those parts and didn't climb if it didn't seem
safe.</p>

<p>I *loved* having my waterproof camera there.  I would climb up all
fast, then wait and maybe go back down and go up a different
way.. like a dog running fast around its owner like a comet doing
crazy loops around its sun.</p>

<p>The rocks were all really smooth; I don't know if they were
naturally formed or what.  Mold/moss grew all over them, but I could
see where they had been scraped clean, and therefore knew with 90%
certainty those rocks wouldn't be slipperly.</p>

I just wanted to drop you note, I have checked your site from time to
time, and it always amazes me that you and I always seem to be in the
same country at the same time.

I was in Jamacia climbing the falls on the same day you did. I got
married the day before.
