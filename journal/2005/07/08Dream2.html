<p class=dream>We could just take pills and escape the pull of
gravity.  Kris was there and Angie was there.  Some guy invited us to
join him flying around.  We were floating and not using space suits,
so we had to hold our breath.  We went so far away from earth that it
just disappeared.  When it was time to go back, I didn't know how we
would find the earth again, but we pointed back where I thought earth
might be, and I didn't take into consideration the sun, which would
be a much heavier mass and easier to see than the earth, but we were
so far away we couldn't see it.  We were flying back and were
supposed to be outside earth's gravity, but I was dragging on the
carpet, so it didn't quite work.  Kris said she was scared, but I
wasn't scared so much as just dragging along the carpet a bit.</p>
