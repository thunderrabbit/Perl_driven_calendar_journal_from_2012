<p>At the top of the falls, all the Jamaican knicknack shops are
definitely overpriced.</p>

<p>One cat was like, "hey mon; what's your name?"</p>

<p>I'm like, "Rob.  What's your name?"</p>

<p>He goes "John," and carved my name into some little wooden carved
face, and said it was mine, but I needed to pay for the girl version
for my girl.  He goes, "what's your girl's name?"</p>

<p>I was like, "I ain't got a girl,"</p>

<p>He totally ignored me and goes, "no, what's your girl's name?"</p>

<p>I'm like, "uh, Katt,"</p>

<p>John carved her name in the other.</p>

<p>He put the heads side by side, "this way means friendship,"
<br>facing each other, "this was means sex,"
<br>on top of each other, "this way means respect."</p>

<p>He said they take about a month to make etc etc blah blah, and I
shelled out $20 for them cause "it's not about the price, it's about
the respect."</p>

<p>THEN, I met another cat who did the exact same spiel, including
saying his name was John.  Good thing for him: he didn't carve my name
into the face; I was definitely not going to buy another set.</p>

<p>The new John put the heads side by side, "this way means love,"
<br>facing each other, "this was means respect,"
<br>on top of each other, "this way means sex.  The woman always goes
on top."</p>

<p>So basically the positions don't mean shit and these guys just
make it up as they go.</p>

<p>Then I talked to a third cat.  This guy was way old and had dreads
down to his butt.  He assured me his work was the best because he
only used cured wood.  "Those wooden faces are not cured; they are
green, and if you put them in the sun, they will crack.  Feel how
light this is," and he handed me a piece that was bigger but lighter
than the heads I had.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>"How long does it take to make one of these?" I asked, showing him
the carved heads.</p>

<p>"Those are easy, just wack wack wack four hours."</p>

<p>Damn.</p>
