<p>Aw fuck I forgot three individual student meetings today.  I
wasn't even in a messed up situation - I just wrote it down in the
margin of my schedule instead of in the timeline section of the day.
fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p>I was watching Family Guy with Katt as I missed the meetings.
She was like, "I thought you were busy until 5!" and I was like, "I
did too, but I can't see what it was.  Meh; let's go watch Family
Guy!"</p>

<p>I wrote notes for all three of them, and rescheduled meetings with
them.  Actually I met Koji at the time I gave him the note: he was
working on his speech on the board game Go, so I read it and gave him
a bit of feedback, and retooled parts of it.</p>

<p>I bought a drink for Yama, and Shunji bought me a bowl of ramen.
Delicious!  I'm going to go downstairs and go watch more Family Guy
now.</p>
