<p>We are in Ireland!  Just now walking by a ship labeled "FRED OLSEN
CRUISE LINES" - I guess some cat named Fred was like, "I'm gonna get
me a cruise line!"</p>

<p>Oohh cool; there are loaders here that look like sports cars!</p>

<p>I walked with Kin and Katt into Dublin, and they sang some song
in Japanese.  They asked me to sing something so I did Eminem's
"Rabbit Run," but it seems I have forgotten a couple of the lines.
After some practice I was able to get it all back.  I guess a couple
years without practice makes a difference.</p>

<p>Some of the buildings are only outer facades, with all the
interiors shredded out.  Most of them are short - like three to four
stories.</p>

<p>There seem to be very few street signs.</p>
