<p>I'll grant that I was in an anxious mood to get my phonecall made
to the HIV test results center.  I was like, "I need to buy a phone
card," and a woman was like, "just use my cellphone and pay me a
dollar," and I was like, "aight," and gave her the phone number.</p>

<p>Dialed and it said, "this phone number is not a free call outside
the United States." And I was like, "this phone number is not a free
call outside the United States," and then five hundred motherfuckers
were all, "c'mon use *my* cellphone," and trying all sorts of
combinations like, "001" and "0100" and every fucking binary number
between 0 and 15 and I'm like, "It's not going to work; where can I
buy a phone card??" and walked away, leaving them with the phone
number, which by that point I had memorized.</p>

<p>Finally found a shop run by a middle eastern looking guy who was
not into the shady swindles.  He sold me a phone card, let me use his
phone (on which I got good news), and I gave him the card back with
its remaining minutes.</p>
