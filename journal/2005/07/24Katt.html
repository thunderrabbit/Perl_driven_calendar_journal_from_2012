<p>In bed again.  Katt offered to get me candy from the store.  I
definitely appreciate her concern and help.  I'm going back to sleep
now.</p>

<p>Katt b(r)ought me a drink, sandwich, and individually wrapped
candies.  I'm thankful for that and thankful for feeling better.  I
don't actually know if this is viral or just allergies.</p>
