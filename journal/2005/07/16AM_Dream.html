<p class=dream>I was telling Bill Cosby some stories, and was
retelling some stories.  Sometimes we get ready in the warehouse.  So
one day we went to the warehouse and banged on the door, "hey Fat
Albert!  We're comin' into the warehouse!" And we went in there and
got ready for school. After we got ready, we still had plenty of time
on our hands, and I thought I had a good idea.  So I got on a box and
said, "hey everybody, you all look great!  This is the first day of
school, and we got plenty of time before school, and don't have far to
go there.  So I've got an idea!  Let's fight Fat Albert."</p>

<p class=dream>Worst massacre ever.</p>

<p class=dream>When I woke up, school was over.  Not just that day;
the entire year was over.</p>

<p>I can't think of the punchline that was so funny in my dream.</p>

<p class=dream>I was walking and deciding I should record it for Fred,
and thinking about recording it for Fred in my Bill Cosby voice.</p>

<p class=dream>The moon was illuminated as a really thin crescent.
We walked out of the warehouse and I was speaking into my voice
recorder saying "this is for Fred," and then I woke up and then my
alarm went off for real.</p>

<p>Woah.  good timing.  For the second day in a row.</p>
