<p>I was totally in a great mood, having had a lovely several days and
just now Hitomi was like, "can I talk to you?" and I'm thinking <em>oh
god, I cannot deal with this right now.</em> but told her she could
talk to me.  We are supposed to meet later; if it's not her
apologizing to me, I don't know what I'll do.</p>

<p class=date>1+ am CEST Tuesday 05 July 2005</p>

<p>Had a argument with Hitomi for two hours.</p>

<p>I fucking hate having Hitomi on this ship.  She had
me <em>trapped</em> in my room and I was bawling crying just LeAvE mE
tHe FuCk AlOnE (voice wavering through tears) and just as I was
devastated, ready to break my Mt Fuji staff into even smaller pieces,
Shinji (my roommate) came in and Hitomi was like, [oh, he can
translate] and he heard her story and said "I cannot understand
completely.  I think you should calm down and talk later.  I think I
should not interpret this coversation; I think this is your personal
matter, so, mmmmm."</p>

<p>I recorded a lot of their conversation, but it can't reallly be
heard over the tape recorder's own motor.  But that was Shinji's
direct response to me.</p>

<p>I lay in my bed, with tears and smeared snot drying on my face,
waiting for them to finish so Hitomi will be gone and I will be able
to get off my bed without her talking to me.  I hate Hitomi.</p>
