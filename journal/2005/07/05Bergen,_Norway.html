<p><b>Bergen, Norway</b></p>

<pre>In the port orientation yesterday, Bergen, Norway was described as featuring 275
days of rain per year and a possible temperature of 10 to 20 degrees C during July.
I wasn't expecting much when I got off the boat, but I assure you, it's is
*beautiful* today!  Bright sun and warm breeze.  Totally brilliant.

I wandered around outside in this little city nestled in a fiord, the remains of a
glacier's path to the sea during the last ice age.

The weather is clear and beautiful, and the sunlight plans to last all day and all
night.  Even at 3am, it's light enough to see outside.

Last night on the boat was a variety show of performances, including flag
semaphore, belly dancing, salsa dancing, Korean drumming, various Japanese
performances (song and dance), ukulele, etc, etc.  I was in the Salsa performance.

And I've just uploaded pictures!

Thanks for the emails; I've enjoyed hearing from my homies back home.

     Love Love Love
