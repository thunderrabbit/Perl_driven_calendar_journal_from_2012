with the super tall super cute Miki again.  Yay!</p>

<p>I did better today than before.</p>

<p class=date>7:21pm CEST Monday 04 July 2005</p>

<p>We will practice the salsa performance, wait (I must be tired) -
we will *perform* tonight.  This is the big night and I will get to
dance with Miki for the show.  Well, the first 3/4ths of the dance
until we change partners.</p>

<p>I will be wearing white long sleeved shirt and blue tie and she
will wear a blue top.  (We're supposed to match our partners
outfits.)</p>
