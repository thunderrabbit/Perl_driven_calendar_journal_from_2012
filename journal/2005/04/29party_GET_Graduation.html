<p>Had a pretty much fun time with some P-B peeps and GET
students at a Greek restaurant with a little buffet and gyros and
salsa dancing.  The whole (small) restaurant was reserved for us, and
we had tables put together to make one big table outside.  We had a
get-ta-know-ya game of finding correct answers to questions (all given
strips of paper) and then played a drinking game afterward.</p>

<p>Kellie got to meet my mates from PB and found out that she won't be
able to join the 51st voyage cause it goes to Cuba and Americans can't
easily enough get visas into Cuba.  Apparently staying on the boat is
not even an option cause the boat will be in Cuban waters.  What a
fuckin' fiasco Bay of Pigs has caused.</p>

<p>Lots of dancing was danced (after we played a couple of drinking
games, including the Animal Game from YRUU but miming musical
instruments and a random order counting game that I propose we call
Sharks.) including lots of salsa and some Rob's crazy dance mixed in.
I certainly didn't do any salsa, but did dance around with some of the
obaasans.</p>

<p>After the party a few of us (Nat, her boy Rosh(sp) and a man who
won't be able to joing the 49th voyage and a woman who will (names
forgotten) and I) went to HUB near Takabakabaka station.  I didn't
stay too long; it was too smokey for me.  Eww.  But I did stay for a
bit.</p>
