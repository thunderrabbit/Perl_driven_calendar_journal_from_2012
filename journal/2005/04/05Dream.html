<p class=dream>Spent the night camping in a large department store.  I
had apparently arrived the previous night by bicycle, for when I woke
up, my bicycle was near on of the registers.  However, I noted that
it's tires had been removed!  I saw some employees near my bike; they
had a cart full of innertubes and tires.  I assumed they must at least
know what happened; maybe they stole them, and I went digging through
their cart as if looking for new tires, but also looking for my old
tires.  I just kept thinking that someone must know; for god's sakes I
was here last night when the store closed! Yargh!!  I was so upset I
was like, "すみません！" shouting for help in Japanese, but no one
came before I saw Michael from Gaba.  I was like, "Michael!" but he
also didn't respond.  I recognized something was a bit weird and
realized it must be a dream so I woke up.</p>
