<p>Went to Narita with Sally and Kelly and Satoko to say bye to them
at the airport.  Kelly talked to Satoko the whole way and was all
nervous about the time.  I was talking to Sally who was showing me
pictures and not worred about time at all.  Like, "we got plenty of
time!" ... that was pretty funny.</p>

<p>Satoko and I wandered around Ueno park, where I got a 500 yen palm
reading thing.  The computerized printout rang less true than what
Satoko translated for me that the guy said.  (Winner: worst
grammar <em>ever!</em>)</p>

<p>The guy was all, "wakkawakkawakka" in Japanese as he looked at my
hand.  Satoko translated for me and I was like, "yeah; I like that:"
("he said, you like to do things alone, and when you do something that
you like, it's good.")  Awesome.  Sounds like a really short version
of what Richard Unger told me at our first palm reading thing.</p>

<p>Kelly bought a USB cable that she doesn't need so she gave it to
me.  I'm going to take it back to the shop in Shibuya to get the
firewire cable that I need for my video camera.</p>
