<p>Last night I lay awake for a while reliving all the moments of my
trek then realized I could record myself with my video camera.  It was
too dark for visual recoring, but I (hopefully) recorded my voice
which I'll burn to CD and send to janette for her birthday.  Ooops.
Secret!</p>

<p>I'm near a Catholic Church, here for the night.  It took 9 hours or
so to get here from my house.  Two of those hours were spent climbing
the last hill from Yumoto station to Gora station.</p>

<p><a

align="left" /></a> There was a speed trap on Route 1 near Hakone
Turnpike; I went by a little thing that looked like a flash for a
camera.  Around the same time I saw three police cars parked down by
the river.  I thought, "how cool for them to have the police station
right near the river."  They obviously weren't just sneaking off by
the river to smoke weed; no one was in or near the cars.</p>

<p>I got there and there was no police station, but a couple cops and
a couple cars, and I thought there must have been an accident.  They
blocked traffic to send a car out and then popped a car in, because
basically every car was speeding.</p>

<p>Except for me and TJ Bike.  We were not speeding, but we were
going down that hill pretty fast.  But on the sidewalk side and not
in the actual street.  I'm glad about that.</p>

<p>I decided not to ask them for directions cause they were obviously
busy.  I went and looked at my map and was like, "I hope that's the
road to Gora" as indicated on the map.  I went back up the sidewalk a
bit to see if the sign indicated the name/number of the road.  It did
not; plus I couldn't turn TJ Bike around cause there were rails on
both sides of the sidewalk.  I got off and followed him backwards out
of the sidewalk back to the speed trap ticketing area and the cop
nearest my age came up and asked if I needed any help.</p>

<p>I was like, "yeah; I'm trying to get to Gora."  She asked a
different cop and then she gave me directions, but they were Crazy
Wrong.  Though she did give them to me in English, so maybe she got
"left" and "right" mixed up.  But I confirmed her statement in
Japanese and she was like, "yeah... maybe"</p>

<p>And I'm like, "maybe???" and she goes, "I'm sure."  But she should
have left it at "maybe" or switched it to "April Fool's!" cause the
only left turn was the entrance ramp for a TOLL ROAD that specifically
said No Pedestrians, No Bicycles, No scooters under 1500 CC in Japanese,
English, and graphics.</p>

<p>I was on the left side of the road which was dead ending into
construction and I was like, "ugh" and had no energy.  I just decided
to quit.  But I rolled back down the hill a bit to a Family Mart
convenience store on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>I parked beside two motorcycles and ate corn cream soup using the
hot water thing from the store.</p>

<p>So I kept going straight and made it to Yumoto station and I was
like, "awright."  I didn't get a picture, which would have documented
the time I had arrived, but I had gotten the picture with Hakone
Turnpike in the background.</p>

<p>I saw three rickshaw guys at the bottom of the hill near Yumoto
station and thought if anyone knows about using muscle power to Gora,
they'll know.  They were like, "where did you ride from?" and I told
them Kawasaki.  They were like "wow," and I asked them how to get to
Gora.  He indicated the road next to which we were standing.  But, he
assured me, it wouldn't be easy; I'd be pooped by the time I reached
the top.</p>

<p>I pointed to my TJ Bike sticker "全然大変じゃない" he read it and
laughed approvingly.  Awesome.</p>

<p>But, I stalled, which side of the road is preferable; which side
has a sidewalk?</p>

<p>In a non-answer, he said, [the road is very narrow.]  (i.e. There is no
sidewalk.)</p>

<p>I pondered a bit.  <em>Am I ready for this?</em>

<p>He goes, "GO!"</p>

<p>Okay, Go!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>So I started heading up the hill.  Soon after I started, I saw a
woman on a touring bicycle like TJ Bike.  I had seen dudes with racing
bikes and huge quads wrapped in spandex, but she was the first person
I had seen with <em>bags</em> on her bike.  She looked at me and did a
double take, and I looked at her and double tooked and it was almost
like, "hey man; you wanna talk?  You wanna hang out?"  but she was
turning left down a hill I wasn't going down or anything.  We both
headed our separate ways.  I looked back over my shoulder and she was
looking back over her shoulder, but that was the extent of our
affair.</p>

<p>Going up the hill was tough.  I nearly gave up a 10, 20, 5 thousand
times.  I sang "Just keep swimming just keep swimming" cause I had
seen Finding Nemo a couple days before.  A couple times I flat
stopped.  After a bit, I was like, "okay, at least, <em>walk</em>" so
I could make some positive progress.  So I generally did that.</p>

<p>On one side of the curvy mountain road is the mountain and leaves
and trees and fencing holding it all together.   On the other side is
a valley.  Occassionally on the mountain side of the road small
statues silently blessed my journey, as they had been doing for years
to all who passed by.</p>

<p>At times the hill was just really steep: not like "oh my god
steep" like Mt Fuji was, but TJ Bike was heavy.  Loaded down with
sleeping bag, tent, computer, digital video camera, but no clothes
(I forgot to bring socks and underwear) except for sweatpants and
sweatshirt. And I wondered what it would be like to not have all this
weight; would it be easier?</p>

<p>I had seen a guy trudging along the highway with just a backpack,
and as I flew past him on TJ Bike (ffsheww!) I wondered if later in
my traveling career I would choose to hike instead of ride.</p>

<p>For a short period, I was just able to sing that song and was able
to get into a meditative state where I wasn't thinking about anything.
Just in the number 1 lowest gear on TJ Bike.  It definitely helped to
just sing that song, because after a while I basically looked up and
saw a sign for a road that goes to Gora.  I had debated earlier which
road I should take, when looking at the map, and I was like, "this is
the one that I had hoped I was at a fucking long time ago!  But that's
good because that means it's not all that much farther."</p>

<p>I was using the map I had picked up at the Family Mart, so I saw
"aight; *this* road is definitely more direct, and it went down for a
ways as opposed to the torturous uphill climb I had been doing for so
long." So I went down the hill flying in top gear at the same speed
traffic would have been, had there been any traffic, so I was in the
lane as opposed to in the dirt and sticks and grass.</p>

<p>I ended up in this little valley and was like, "fuck, gotta go up
again," cause there was nothing to eat, nowhere to stop, nothing to do
but give up or keep going.  I was like, "crap. Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming."</p>

<p>I just started to go up the hill in low gear again.  Just go go go
as steadily as possible.  And the hill wasn't as long as the last
one, but it was still hard and I ended up walking TJ Bike up the hill
and then I saw a sign.</p>

<p>Gora 300 meters.</p>

<p>Hell. Yeah.  I know how far 300 meters is.  I can walk 300 meters.
I cracked out my GPS and it confirmed Gora was 348 meters away.  But
that was straight line 348 meters.  This hill was a side street and
even steeper, but I was just like "rar" going up this hill.  The hill
sidewinded back and forth.  I could feel my energy like near passout
mode.  Not 100% pass out, but I was like, "I could rest now.  I
could sleep."</p>

<p>Then I got to another sign.</p>

<p>Gora 300 meters.</p>

<p>The GPS said 200 something meters.  But I just started to count
left footsteps, guessing they were about 1 meter apart. </p>
