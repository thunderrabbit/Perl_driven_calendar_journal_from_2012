<p>Went to the zoo in Hinodecho with Hitomi this morning.  It was
nicer than I expected (but I had really low expectations).  Some of
the animals had grass.  I most enjoyed watching the ostrich.  After
watching it walk gracefully back and forth, with its mean sneery face
peering over its fence, Hitomi goes, "首ながい、ね。"</p>

<p>I go, "ほんとだ。"</p>

<p>So hilarious!!</p>

the zoo.</p>
