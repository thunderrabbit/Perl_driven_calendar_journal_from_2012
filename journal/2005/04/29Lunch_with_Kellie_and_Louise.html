<p>Lunch with Kellie and Louise was lovely; we met in Omote Sando and
chowed at a smoke filled restaurant called Zest.  It was really crappy
service; though they weren't really busy, it took about 20 minutes to
get the first glasses of water.  They didn't have the first two
choices Kellie chose from the menu.  They were on the menu, but not
available, including a salad.  The food took a pretty long time and
the best thing was definitely the company I was with.</p>

<p>Louise is getting ready for her performance in Steel Magnolias, and
Kellie is getting ready for the 51st Voyage of P-B, for which
she'll be applying soon.  Louise told the story of someone <! Seth >
who shall remain nearly nameless who invited himself over to her house
after a late night of revelry and then vomited on her couch but didn't
clean it up.  Ick.</p>

<p>On the way out, I jokingly beggingly asked Louise if I could hang
out with her and sit next to her and sit behind her and talk to her
and please please please please...  and she said that I couldn't talk
to her, but I could help her with her lines. (*)</p>

<p>(*) Dialogue from her play, not cocaine</p>

<p>I was like, ooooooooooooooooooooh cause I would *love* to hang out
with her more, but it could be based on the wrong reasons, plus I had
plans to see Kellie's balcony where TJ Bike can live while I'm on the
boat.</p>

<p>I told Kellie how I had thought Louise might meet/match all the
checklist of my optimal mate, and how Louise shut me down pretty
quickly.  Ah well.</p>
