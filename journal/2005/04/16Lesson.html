<p>During my Japanese lesson today I gave my best Japanese version of
the adventure riding from Yumoto station to Gora station.  Ayana
wrote it down for me and I intend to transcribe it here.</p>

<p>This morning Hitomi wrote the furigana (pronunciation) for the
kanji in the story so I'll be able to type them.</p>
