<p>Last night was a Jen's birthday party after party at karaoke.  I
stayed nearly two hours and sang a couple of Eminem songs, though they
didn't have my favorites "Business" and "Rabbit Run." "Business" was
listed in one of the indexes, but those digits came up as a different
song.  nightmare.</p>

<p>However, I ran back and forth like a maniac on the benches during a
couple of songs, especially "I think we're alone now."  I start
running when she goes (something like)</p>

<pre>running just as fast as we can
holding onto one another's hand
trying to get away into the night
and then we take a look around us
and then we tumble to the ground
</pre>

<p>And at that point I do a front roll onto the seats and wiggle
dance for the remainder of the stanza and next verse.</p>

<p>Genkiman Daniel proved how shy he was in front of the mic by
singing loudly enough to not need a mic (and still sounded melodic).
Quite impressive!  He sang basically every song, or at least he sang
during every song.  It was a bit of a trick for me to keep from
laughing when he as singing "You ain't nothing but a hound dog" while
I was doing "Without me" and trying to toss in my own references to
hound dogs during the chorus.</p>

<pre>
This looks like a time for houndogs
so everybody just cry all the time
cause we need a little hounddog
cause it feels so empty without hounddogs</pre>

<p>Which very completely threw off the cadence, but was fun even
so.</p>

<p>I drank all the liquid sweetener they had outside by the drink
machine (probably 4 or 6 ounces) by mixing it liberally with various
drinks.  ("I like my sugar with coffee and cream" is a Beastie Boys
line that reminds me of this meaning of "liberal") On one of my drink
mixing adventures, I found some of my favorite chocolate discarded in
its package in the trash so I rescued it.  It wasn't wet or gross and
didn't seem to be otherwise tampered, but who in their right mind
would throw away <em>chocolate</em>???? I rescued the three pieces and
promptly gave them a good home, in my sugar filled stomach.

<p>I fell asleep after Matteo extended us to a second hour past our
originally planned 1 hour.  Funny, that.  Super loud, super sugar,
but just bang sleep.</p>

<p>Jackie and Matteo smoked so my clothes smelled disgusting when I
got back home, but I chose not to take a shower.</p>
