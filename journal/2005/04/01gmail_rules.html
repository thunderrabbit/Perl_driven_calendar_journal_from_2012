<p>I'm using gmail as my main email storage.  rob@robnugen.com is my
address and thunderrabbit@gmail.com is my storage.  And, as I'm
typing, my gmail storage quota is going up.  It was 1000 MB yesterday.
It was 1125 MB a moment ago.  Now it's 1145 MB. Gmail guys have a
counter on the front of their site.</p>

<p>Oh my god, the counter matches my quota.</p>

<p>Gmail rules.</p>

<p>On the front page of <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail.com</a> there
is a counter spinning up about 10k per second.  That's how much
storage we have on our accounts.  When I click refresh on my gmail
screen, the percent used thing matches how much it says we are
allowed.  Right now it's at 1149 megabytes.</p>

<p>I am guessing that it will top out at 2000 MB at the end of April
1st California time and then slowly inch its way up from there.  I
don't care to do the calculation to see if that makes sense, but,
that's my guess.</p>

<p>This is taken from their front page.</p>

<p>And where it says "Over 1000" above, it's zipping right along on
<a href="http://gmail.com">their site</a>.  1161 megs now.</p>

G is for growth
 Storage is an important part of email, but that doesn't mean you
 should have to worry about it. To celebrate our one-year birthday,
 we're giving everyone one more gigabyte. But why stop the party
 there? Our plan is to continue growing your storage beyond 2GBs by
 giving you more space as we are able. We know that email will only
 become more important in people's lives, and we want Gmail to keep up
 with our users and their needs. From Gmail, you can expect more.

<p>Good job, gmail.  I'm really really happy with this.</p>

<p>And, I'm really really even happier that recently gmail allows me
to write in Japanese!  Before last week, I could write in Japanese,
but it would only send gibberish to whoever read it.  Now it's
legible.  Whoo!</p>

<p>This is money.</p>

<p>In the amount of time it took me to read David Pogue's intial
review of gmail from last year, my quota has gone up to 1170 megs.
In the time it took me to write this sentence, 1171 megs.</p>
