<p>Today I've been cleaning my computer's hard drive.</p>

<p><a
href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/construction/building_in_kawasaki/">Most
of these</a> were taken from the KQ Kawasaki Nova teacher's lounge
window.  I don't know the name of the building, but it is finished
now.</p>

<p><a href="/images/travel/japan2003-2004/Genkiman_Dan/">These
pics</a>, featuring Genkiman Dan, were part of 200 megs of pics given
to me by Lubo back near the end of my days in Tsunashima.  I've
burned those pics to CD for Dan (along with a bunch of other stuff)
and uploaded my favorites.</p>

<p>Also today I've done some research on some of the ports we'll be
visiting on P-B.  Primarily Port Said (Sayed | Saied) in
Egypt:</p>

<p class=note>(written before P-B)</p>

<p>Port Said (<a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/suez/suez14.htm">Egypt
govt</a>) is situated on the north end of the Suez Canal (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal">wikipedia</a>, <a
href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/suez/suez010.htm">Egypt govt</a>), which
runs north-south from the Red Sea (between Africa and the Middle East)
to the Mediterranean Sea (between Africa and Eastern Europe).</p>

<p>The Suez Canal was dug between 1860 and 1870 after Mohammed Said
said, "yo man, hook it up" to a French cat named Lesseps.  It's after
Said that Port Said is named.</p>

<p><a

is the title of the Turkish rulers over Egypt between 1867 and 1914,
so it's interesting to see some sites (<a

href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/suez/suez14.htm">Egypt govt)</a> say
<em>Khedive</em> Said authorized the canal in 1859.</p>
