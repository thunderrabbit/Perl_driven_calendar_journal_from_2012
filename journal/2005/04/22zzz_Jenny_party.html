<p>Lots of peeps came for Jen's party tonight!  I am really happy for
her.  I'm really happy for me because I got to sit next to Dan, who
was quite entertaining all night, and not in a silly crazy over the
top alcohol way.  I had given him 30 train cards, and we played all
sorts of card games with them.  Magic tricks where the magician
publicly identifies the card secretly selected by the audience, plus
guessing games where Dan totally won; whoever chooses a card that
comes up before the card chosen by the other player gets the card.
Shuffle the deck each time and see who can choose a faster card.</p>

<p>I'm totally falling asleep, but I want to get one point in.  Dan
said simply, "we sure have had a lot of fun with just these 30 cards."
And I realized that while it's clearly true, I hadn't really noticed
it.  Thank you, Genkiman Dan.</p>
