<p>Home from my byebye party: Jesse, Satoko, Seth, Lenny and me.  We
chowed okonomiyaki and I chowed visions of the beautiful Russian
waitress.  Her face reminded me of Minnie Driver.  Long wavy/curly
locks pulled back gently into a banana clip horse mane of hair.  Very
nice.</p>

<p>Jesse ate using his chopstick that hit the table, and we all
enjoyed various flavors of okonomiyaki before heading out.  Never went
back by to see Roscoe and Zach during their drinking adventure, but
I'm sure they'll be okay.</p>
