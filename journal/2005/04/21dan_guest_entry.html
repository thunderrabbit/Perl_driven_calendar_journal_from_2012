<p class=message>Well I've had a long day and I'm now sitting in the
Millenium House garden with Jen, Rob and Jackie. Its Jennifer's
birthday so we are drinking champagne and eating cheese. Rob and I
have played hackey sack and I've actually taught him CRICKET!! Wow,
its been a nice day but my god I'm tired!! Rob wasn't sure about
cricket but by god he has an eye for batting! He didn't quite get the
hang of bowling but saying that, my wasn't brilliant, its wasn't that
bad either, just not quite up to scratch!</p>

<p class=message>Cool,
