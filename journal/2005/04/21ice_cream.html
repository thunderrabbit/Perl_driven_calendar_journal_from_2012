<p>We have over an hour to wait for the movie and a little ice cream
shop was just outside the theater.  Awesome.  Crepes, fruit, a few
different ice cream flavors.  Money.</p>

<p>May I have cookies and cream and mango mixed up?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>(no reason)</p>

<p>Try hard.</p>

<p>We can't.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>(no reason)</p>

<p>Just put them both in a bowl and I'll mix them up.</p>

<p>Can't.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>(no reason)</p>

<p>This is why I hate Japan.  No one can think beyond a rule.  Do you
want a customer?  Do you want some money?  Or do you want to coddle
your inventory so carefully that you can't even put a few fucking
pieces of sliced mango (that are <em>already</em> sliced and waiting)
with some cookies and cream?  How much does cookies and cream cost?
how much do mango pieces cost?  Fucking hell man just put them in a
fucking bowl! </p>

<p>If my Japanese were better I would be dangerously mean in
situations like this. Stupid Japan.</p>
