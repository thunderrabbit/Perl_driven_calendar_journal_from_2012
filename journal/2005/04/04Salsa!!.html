<p>Big fun at Salsa Caribe tonight!  Simone's husband Renato works
there so we got in free!  We = Sally, Satoko, Hitomi and I.  Big fun
dancing (after chowing pizza and pasta with Hitomi and Satoko).  We
were the last ones in the club.  They played some heavy slow beats
that helped me do a gorilla dance.  Really nice to see Hitomi having
so much fun!  I really enjoyed dancing with her.  I would massage /
grip her shoulders to remind her to relax so she could just wiggle to
the music.  Fun times.</p>

<p>I brought my video camera and got some footage, but it was really
dark in the club so I doubt it will turn out very well.  Probably
won't end up online.</p>
