<p>It rained all day yesterday and today so I didn't go to Hakone, and
it's really cold.</p>

<p>But, today I've gotten some good progress done cleaning my desk.
Thrown away a lot of junk and nearly filled a box to send to Fred.
Mostly books and CDs and DVDs.  Interesting that Aaron suggested that
this society is based on moving information around, which is basically
what I'm sending to Fred.</p>

<p>Went shopping and made some Roboyaki, but this time included
muesli.  It was a bit strange, but still good.</p>

<p>Watching Southpark episodes now, in honor of janette's birthday!</p>
