<p>I think I went to sleep around 10pm.  During the night, between
probably 12 and 2 am, I heard a strange sing-song noise that I
recognized as a girl animatedly talking.  I guessed she was a loud
American yammering with her quieter friend.  Then I recognized some
Japanese words, and I recognized she was animatedly upsetly crying
talking on her cell phone.  Good vibes sent her way.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up around 5:45 am, feeling basically refreshed
and happy, though I hadn't particularly slept for two continuous ~4
hour stretches like normal.  I did a lot of flipping around since I
was sleeping on a slight incline, and the ground wasn't as soft as my
futon.</p>

<p>I packed up my gear, gave a blessing to the church for offering the
space, and to the trees for protecting me, and to the weather for
staying clear and dew free.  Made sure I had all my stuff and my trash
and headed out.</p>

ZZZZooooOOOOooooOOOOoooooOOOomomoommmmmmmmmm flying around corners all
zoooooomoooOOOoooOOooomm sailing down the straight parts all
ZZZozzozozoooooaooaoaooozoozozozooooommmmm tears pouring out of my
eyes from the crispy wind, then slow slow just keep swimming just keep
swimming as I went up that shortish stretch of hill, at the top of
which I got some pictures.  Then down the rest
ZzzzzzozozozozoooooooooOOOOooOOOOOoommmmm reliving in reverse all the
places I had toiled so hard to climb.  Down past all the places I had
planned to stop ZzzzzzozozoOOOOOOOOOoooOoOom past the mysterious steps
that climbed down to the highway zZZZZzzzzzoooooOOOoooooOOOOoomm past
the ZZzzzozzzzoooooooooOOOOOooOOooOoooooooMMMMM past the statues that
had blessed my ascent yesterday ZzzzoooooOOOooommmm past the well
manicured flowerbed with ハコネ written in blossoming flowers Zzoooo
eerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtt!!  (stopping noise).  A truck was
fully <em>stopped</em> in the middle of the lane.  His wheels seemed
to be smoking; I'm sure it was his brakes.  Little bit too much zooom.
I waited for a clear moment in traffic then zipped around him,
blessing his journey and my journey and TJ Bike's brakes.  Then
zzzzozoozoooooooooOOOoooooooooooOOoooooommmm all the way to the bottom
of the hill where I arrived back at that station at the end of Odakyu
line and looked for my three rickshaw buds.</p>

<p>Of course they were not there; it was probably only 7am, and there
weren't many tourists out.</p>

<p>Oh, that reminds me: during my AM descent, most traffic was going
UP the hill; in to Gora for the day.  I had a pretty clear shot all
the way down save for that truck.  Oh, and a wide crane thing going
uphill, taking up more than half the road.</p>

<p>Other than that, it's been pretty straightforward.  Just heading
back along Route 1 国道１ (what's the pronunciation for these
kanji?)</p>

<p>I'm stopped in 小磯 （おいそ）at Denny's using their electricty to
write this entry.</p>
