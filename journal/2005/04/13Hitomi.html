<p>Hitomi called and seemed really tired and not particularly enjoying
herself in New York.  I'm sure she's been through the wringer trying
to watch shows and see sights and just kick it in the big city.</p>

<p>I couldn't really understand everything she was saying; the line
quality was not super great (and I have trouble understanding her even
when she is in Tokyo) so I tried as best I could to give appropriate
feedback to her stories and such.</p>

<p>She was crying at the end, and I just wanted to hug her, but
couldn't do more than send her good energy.  ´èÄ¥¤Ã¤Æ¿ÎÈþ¤Á¤ã¤ó</p>
