<p>I've been cleaning my desk.  It looks better.  I consolidated two
little cases of 0.5mm pencil lead, took some stuff downstairs and
Simone scooped up the 6 CDs I had from my Genki I Japanese book.  Put
some stuff in a box for Fred (and janette) and I'm about to head out
for Jiyugaoka to meet Kellie.  I'm not going to bring my computer.</p>
