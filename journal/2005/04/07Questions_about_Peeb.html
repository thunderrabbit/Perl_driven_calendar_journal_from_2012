<p>These are questions I have about P-B (49th voyage)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it possible for me to sail on the next (51st) voyage as
well?</p>

<p>If so, what do I need to do?</p></li>

<li><p>Will there be internet access available on the ship?</p></li>

<li><p>Any advice around bringing the following on board:</p>
<ol type=a>
<li>TJ Bike</li>
<li>video camera</li>
<li>laptop computer</li>
<li>a hardback book for everyone to sign / draw / write</li>
</ol>

<li><p>I plan to learn everyone's name on the ship.  To support this,
I'd like to take everyone's photo with a Polaroid camera.  In fact, I
think everyone would benefit from having a wall of pictures and names.
Is there a plan for this?  Can I help create this project?</p></li>

<li><p>I'd also like for everyone to have a mailbox in one of the
common rooms so we can send notes and pictures and have secret
pals.  Is this in the works?  Can I help support it?</p></li>

<li><p>I have lots of ideas for lessons.  For most of them I need
paper / copy machine / pens / pencils.  Are these available?</p></li>

<li><p>Are there any plans to make a scrapbook of the trip and
distribute it to everyone (maybe for a cost-offsetting fee)?  Can I
help support this?</p></li>

<li><p>Will we get to see the pyramids in Giza from Port Said?</p></li>
</ol>
