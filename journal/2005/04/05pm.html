<p>Hung out a bit in Shibuya to chow and then exchanged the cable at
Sakuraya.  The guy asked if I had the credit card, but I was like
nope. but since the cable I wanted was more expensive, he let me do
the exchange without presenting the credit card.  Or maybe he just
let me do it for no particular reason.</p>

<p>I went to the video camera section to get a bag for my camera, but
the CANON brand bag had a wussy zipper and was 3000 yen more than it
should have been.  I was like, "man this zipper is weak" and the guy
was like, "yah" and I was like, "man if this zipper were stronger I
would buy it." and the guy was like "yah" and Finally Satoko was like,
"can you show us some other bags?"  Obviously the dude does not get
paid on commission.</p>

<p>He brught out three other bags and I slected one of them which was
only like 1600 yen (instead of 4600 yen) and was like, "hey man, can I
open it?" and he was like, "no" and I was like "hey man, if I buy it
and I don't like it, can I bring it back?" and he was like, "no" and
then I was like, "will the camera fit?" he was like "yeah" and to
prove it he got a tape measure to measure it.  And sure enough it
seemed that it would fit (barely) according to the dimensions printed
on the case cover thing.  I was satisfied that it would work, so I
bought it and immediately opened the wrapper and took out the case.  I
was able to open the wrapper with zero rippage; it was taped closed
with reusable tape and it was just fine so I don't know what the big
deal was.  But I put the camera in its new case and put the wrapper
neatly on the counter and everything was allll gooood.</p>

<p>Headed home now.</p>
