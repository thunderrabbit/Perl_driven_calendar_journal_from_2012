<p>Hitomi and I met Brandt last night at Friday's in Roppongi.  He has
an artsy rebel look about him with a thumb ring, streaky dyed hair,
and shoulder bag slung over one shoulder.  He was raised in and around
Dallas Texas and has degrees in programming and finance.  In his life
are projects like how to write Japanese or English education software
and starting businesses back in the US.</p>
