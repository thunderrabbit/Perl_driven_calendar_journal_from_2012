<p>I'm in Shibuya now to get contacts.  Have just filled out the
first timer customer form to the best of my ability.  It does not seem
that any of the staff speak English.  This should be interesting.</p>

<p>On the way here, I got into Kosugi station and it starting blowing
rain, so I tried to call Jen, Shoko and Rene, but none of them
answered their respective phones.  I hoped I could get somone to close
my window, but I ended up going back to do it.  Got pretty wet on the
way there and back.</p>

<p>This doctor shop is like a clinic; with lots of people being lined
up and moved through the process.  Nothing like Dr Pickering where we
make appointments and such.  These guys (and by guys I mean girls) are
calling names over the loudspeaker and such.  16 people in the waiting
room and a name called about once every 2 minutes.  I trust I can
still get good care for my eyes; this place was recommended by
Hitomi's friend Kaori.</p>

<p>That was pretty darn painless.  A woman who could speak some
English checked my eyes (except for the retinal exam part) and the
rest was just buying stuff.  I got free daily wear contacts and 5000
yen off for being a first time customer for a grand total of under
8000 yen for exam and 12 pairs of use-for-two-weeks contacts and 10
single use contacts.  Nice.</p>
