<p>Early on I had many flying dreams, with good flying control.</p>

<p class=dream>Suzanne taught me a new way of flying.  She said, "make
me fly, lift me up," and I did no problem.  "Okay, make yourself fly,"
and I tried pushing away and I was less effective.  She said, "okay,
now lift yourself like you lifted me." and I did that and it worked
really well!  A fundamental flying shift from throwing my own energy
back to propel myself forward, or using the universal energy to lift
and move myself wherever I wanted to go.  Thanks, Suzanne!</p>

<p class=dream>While flying, I remembered to try and find someone.  I
thought about Hitomi, but guessed that since she was herself flying in
a jet, it wouldn't be safe for me to visit.  I visualized Satoko's
face and that seemed to propel me.  I didn't actually find her; she
had gone outside a shopping center and didn't want me to find her.</p>

<p class=dream>On the fourth floor balcony of Maggie's house, which
had no entrance to her house directly from that level, we saw the bad
guys (late 1950s era hooligans like Biff from Back to the Future)
driving around her house.  They had been attracted to the house by the
bizarre death of a cat who had been the victim of a indoor baseball
game accident; a kid slid toward the base and squished the cat, which
made a visible, recognizable impression of the cat on the carpet.  The
curse had begun.</p>

<p class=dream>The bad guys knew we were up there and were coming
around to the front of the house.  I asked Maggie if we could escape
by climbing onto the roof and she said we could, in theory, but we
didn't have a way to climb up there.  I discovered a set of vertical
slats that were loose in the wall of the attic just below the roof and
hoisted myself up there using some support beams and then helped
Maggie do the same.  She walked through the attic to the secret master
bedroom where she found Laura and Jeanine waiting for her.  I tried to
replace the slats that we had broken to make it less obvious how we
had entered the house, but the pieces were all way too small to do it
properly.  I swapped them with some different slats and used part of a
box to cover the rest.  I followed where Maggie had gone and found all
three girls giggling in bed, eating snacks and watching TV.
Everything was all good concerning the bad guys and I woke up.</p>
