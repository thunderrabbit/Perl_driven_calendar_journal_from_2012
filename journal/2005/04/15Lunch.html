<p>Stopped for lunch at Jolly Pasta which boasted bicycle parking.
Locked TJ Bike, grabbed my computer and camera and trash and headed
in.</p>

<p>[We don't open until 11.]</p>

<p>[What time is it?]</p>

<p>[10:30.]</p>

<p>blink.  wow.  Earlier than I thought; seems like I've been riding
for ages.  I walked out, a bit miffed, but then I decided I would
wait around if they had an electric socket for my computer.</p>

<p>[Do you have an outlet for my computer?]</p>

<p>[What?]</p>

<p>[Computer.  Electric.  Is there a socket?]</p>

<p>これはちょっと。。。</p>

<p>That's one thing I hate about Japanese.  It translates to "that's a
little bit..." and I'm supposed to fill in the adjective.  Just say no.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Went back out, reloaded TJ Bike and headed a bit further down the
road and came to a McDonald's.  Yes yes McDonald's bad, but I guessed
they would be open and might have an elecric socket like in
Yoyogi.</p>

<p>There happened to be a dude outside who directed me to a fence to
which I could lock TJ Bike (their bike parking area was full).
Grabbed my shiznit and went inside.  Cute girl opened a register for
me and I ordered two 100 yen fish sandwiches and water with no ice.
Didn't find an outlet in the seating area, but oh well.</p>

<p>Found ice in my water, went back to the same girl and was like, "is
it okay if I get water without ice?" a polite way of saying hey man
you forget my original request.  With no sense of guilt, apology nor
even recognition, she happily replaced my ice water with water.</p>

<p>For the record, I had to agree with Jen; it took them a long time
to fill my order. Not even counting the ice fiasco.</p>

<p>I am really tired and my arms are slightly sunburned.  Forgot to
bring sunscreen.  24.6 km to my house.</p>
