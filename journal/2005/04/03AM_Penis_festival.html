<p>With Kelly, Jasmine, Hitomi and Satoko, I met Kellie, Yumi, Katsu,
and someone to scope the Penis Festival, which started as a ceremony
to keep prostitues safe from syphilis and prosperous in business.</p>

<p>I can respect and understand that, but it was a bit difficult for
me to respect why so many old men were taking photos of women sitting
on the giant wooden phalluses.</p>

<p>There were booths selling penis and vulva shaped candies and ash
trays; other vendors sold food and sake.  If you want to go next
year, get there around 9:30am; it's uncrowded and easy to see
everything before the crowds arrive.</p>

<p>Jasmine carved a daikon radish to look like what the other people
were carving.  She didn't know which end was up on the erect penis
shape.  I'm glad for her for that.</p>

<p>The radishes had green leafy stalks on the top end and a long
skinny tail on the bottom end.  People were making the head by
cutting off the leaves and carving the head then cutting off the tail
and saying, "look; a penis!"</p>

<p>I would use the leafy part as pubic hair and if my carving skillz
were sufficient the long skinny part as an ejaculation.</p>

<p>However, by going and leaving early, we didn't see the drumming
nor the parade, etc.</p>
