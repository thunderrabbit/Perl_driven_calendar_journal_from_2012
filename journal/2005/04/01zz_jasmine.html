<p>Jasmine has arrived back safely from her adventures in Kyoto.  She
said they rode bicycles and had a lovely time, which I think janette
and I would have enjoyed doing the time we went to Kyoto.  Walking
just took forever and bussing is rather expensive.  But we had big
fun.</p>

<p>Anyway, Jasmine had big fun too, but felt a little bit stomach
achey slash tired and came back today.  She figured out that she
didn't have to go all the way to Tokyo station, but could get off at
Shinagawa and get home more quickly.  Good work!</p>

<p>Hitomi and I wanted chocolate so I asked Jasmine if she wanted
anything from the conveni and she was like, "I wanna go" and she
wanted to run, and I was like "booo" cause my knees don't like
running, so she ran while Hitomi and I took Mimibike.</p>

<p>Watched a bit of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on TV
after a bit of 90210, which I had to have Jen identify for me
("you're kidding, right?"  (not kidding)) and we basically fell
asleep watching the movie.  Bedtime.</p>
