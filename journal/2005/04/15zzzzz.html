<p>Have a bit of a headache, but want to write even so.</p>

<p>After my adventure, I went to the local public bath (for the first
time at an actual public bath) and didn't know I had to bring my own
soap and towel!  No wonder it's so inexpensive!  I felt embarassed to
be the only foreigner there, wandering around trying to figure out
where everyone was getting their soap and stuff from.  Everyone was
keeping to themselves so I didn't feel comfortable asking a busily
washing/shaving/soaking naked Japanese man where to get bathing
equipment.</p>

<p>At all hotels I've been to, including Gora last night, all the
soap and towels are provided.</p>

<p>Hitomi called me today several hours before her flight (not daring
to sleep) and I was really happy to hear from her.  I invited her to
come with me to meet a couple of PB cats (Brandt and maybe
others).</p>

<p>I chose not to go out with Jeff and Colin and Naz for their welcome
back party.  I thought tonight was Jen's party (it's next week) so I
asked her via textmessage "What will I do with all this pudding?"
referring to nonexistant pudding I bought for her party.</p>

<p>Foolishly am up too late trying to catch up on email after eating 3
eggs worth of Roboyaki and three cups of pudding, 100 grams of
chocolate, and over a liter of Pocari Sweat.</p>

<p>I have downloaded pictures but not uploaded them to my site.  I've
burned a CD of my story recorded last night, but not transcribed any
of it yet.  Might do it tomorrow at OM after my Japanese lesson
(first one on Saturday with Ayana).</p>

<p>Crap.  My journal appears to be down and I don't know why.  I
haven't messed with anything that I know of.</p>

<p>journal.pl is working as I expect, but firefox is not honoring the
refresh meta tag.  Safari does, so fuckit I'm going to bed.</p>
