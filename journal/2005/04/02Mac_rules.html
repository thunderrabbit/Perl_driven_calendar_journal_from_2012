<p>Logged into my computer from Hitomi's via AirPort, the 801.c
whatchamadoodle that allows wireless access.  No problem, but slow.</p>

<p>Borrowed a non-crossover cable from Dave to connect them.  Fast.
Crazy fast.  And though it's not a crossover cable, it works fine to
connect the computers.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Only thing is I couldn't get AppleSharing to work over the
crossover cable.  May try again, but I think I'll just use FTP.  I
have a huge directory structure of all my images to copy, so I don't
want to use the command line; it doesn't seem willing to create
directories during an mget operation.</p>

<p>Today I'll try to download a better graphical ftp program that
will do it.</p>
