<p>Yesterday Hitomi and I rode our bicycles to Sakuragicho area.</p>

<p>On the way there was rather colder than we wanted, but not
unbearable.  Going through Miyorenji, the station one past Kikuna
where we went swimming a couple times last year, we stopped at the
grocery store for beverages.  Hitomi was impressed with the prices in
general and wanted to stop on the way back to grocery shop.</p>

<p>I now think I know a better way to go through Yokohama (I got lost
there en route to Hakone).</p>

<p>I watched the bikes while Hitomi bought McDonald's: two 100 yen
fish sandwiches for me and a double cheese burger for her.  We ate on
the curvy grass dome over the Yokohama Marine Museum (or something
like that) and she chased away the pigeons until they gave up.  I was
surprised they gave up; it seems they knew their quest was useless; we
weren't going to give them any food.</p>

<p>I presumed they had simply learned that people who yell instead of
throw food will continue to do so.  I wondered what would happen if I
didn't match previous patterns: maybe I could give food and chase them
away from it.  I didn't try, knowing I wouldn't have a way to measure
any change, especially not over a significant period of time.</p>

<p>We finished eating and then I was like <em>this sucks; let's go
home.</em>  I asked Hitomi 帰りませんか？ (shall we go home?) and she
was like "yeah" but didn't mean it and I could tell she was upset.</p>

<p>We stood in silence for a bit wondering if we should be mad or give
in or what, and were brought back to happiness when a nearby boat gave
a big horn blast and we both though of the same fart joke.</p>

<p>She offered to show me the port where P-B will presumably
dock and I was like "yeah" though I had been like "nah" before.</p>

an elongated skate park.  <a

image, but maybe not permanent online</a></p>

<p>Near the information desk was a book written by (part of) the
architectural team that designed the building.  They basically didn't
want (m)any visible vertical surfaces.</p>

<p>It was interesting for my consciousness to go from <em>wow; what a
cool building</em> to realizing it's cool
because <em>they <b>tried</b> to make it a cool building</em> to
<em>damn; what a lot of work went into the design of this
building!</em></p>

<p>Stopped by OM to get my computer's power supply and the 911 book
(which is actually why I started writing journal entries today) and
headed back home.</p>

<p>Going back seemed easier than going to; I'm not sure why.. well, I
know we did a more direct route, but even before the indirect part
started, Hitomi had felt tired.  Now I know how to navigate past
Kikuna; we have to follow the street along the Yokohama line instead
of the  Toyoko line; that street switches away from the Yokohoma line
back to the Toyoko line.</p>
