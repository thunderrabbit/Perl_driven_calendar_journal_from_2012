<p>Hung out in P-B office today; sitting by super genki super
fun super chatty super woman Audrey, I graded a bunch of tests, so
we'll be able to place students in classes basically according to
their English abilities.  I enjoyed getting into the energy of the
group here, and getting a sorta better idea of how things are
organized though I still don't know how everything <em>works</em>.  I
met a woman named Aya who is the international coordinator: she goes
to all the ports to get stuff arranged before the boat arrives.  Wow.
And then I met Michiko, the woman who did that job for three years
before Aya.  Powerful women, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Looked at Matt's GET Guidebook for the students; he's putting
together a pretty comprehensive supplement that will help students
apply their English knowledge on Pb related activities.  How
to haggle.  Giving directions in a city we'll be visiting.  How to
talk about what time to be back on the boat.</p>

<p>BUT, I found out something that's cooler than ALL of that: we're
going to the Valley of the Crescent, featured in Indiana Jones Last
Crusade!!</p>

<p>Holy shit!!  I'm super pumped about that; I've always thought that
place is "so far away" and "so mysterious" and "so cool" and "would be
so cool to SEE."  .....  well, I get to see it soooooon!</p>

<p>And, Audrey said she introduced me to people as "the guy who said
'fuck' in the interview."  Awright.</p>

<p>Hahaha... Audrey can talk really quickly.</p>
