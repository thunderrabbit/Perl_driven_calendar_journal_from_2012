Vanishing Coaster at Cosmoworld.  Now chowing overpirced foodage in the lovely spring sun!</p>

<p>Satoko was in the area so she joined us near the end of our meal.
Satoko wanted to ride Vanishing Coaster, so I joined her for that and
Jen took a picture of us as we vanished behind the water.  But we
vanished before the picture could be taken.  Ziip!</p>

<p>Walked around a bit and I showed Jen a new game I invented.  I call
it "Escalator Slide" and basically slid down the escalator hand rails
by extending my upper arms and tucking my legs, using my sleeves for
friction reduction.</p>

<p>I found it a bit tricky to go down straightly, and I hit my elbow
pretty effectively.  Yeouch!</p>

<p>I'd enjoy bringing Hitomi to this game center cause there are fewer
people who smoke, and funnier kiddie games.</p>

<p>Jen left after we scoped the portrait artists who were not willing
to paint a picture of Jen with Michael Jackson (even though there was
a picture of Michael Jackson on the wall behind them) and Satoko and I
stayed a bit longer and rode the Spinning Coaster, the ferris wheel,
and the haunted house and Ice World (-29.5 C with stuffed/fake polar
animals on ice).</p>
