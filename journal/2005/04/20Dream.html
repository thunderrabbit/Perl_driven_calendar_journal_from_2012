<p class=dream>Hitomi and I were riding a freight train back home; we
were up on the top of a car, between two large I-beams that prevented
anyone from seeing us.  The weather was really warm as we rode, but
then it started sprinkling a nice summer sprinkly rain while the air
was still warm.  We didn't have to worry about getting our clothes wet
since we weren't wearing any.  I just basked in the sun and rain on
the train as we headed back home.  Hitomi was worried that we would be
caught by someone as we headed into the city, but I told her not to
worry; that we could get off anytime she felt nervous.</p>

<p class=dream>One of the I-beams was no longer there, so it would be
easier for us to be seen, and I was a bit worried that the remaining
I-beam would smush us if it was no longer counter-balanced by its
partner.  But the straps seemed to hold it in place.</p>

<p class=dream>We began to arrive in Futaktamagawa and Hitomi was
really nervous, but I told her not to worry.  Then I noticed the train
seemed to have left the tracks and was driving along the street.  It
seemed strange, but I was sure it couldn't be true; the train was too
heavy for such a thing.  Hitomi was scared and told me she wanted to
get off, and reminded me about my promise to get off if she wanted, so
we did and I had clothes on, but she didn't, and I just kinda hugged
her to me as we walked away from the crowds.  No one saw us get off
the train.</p>
