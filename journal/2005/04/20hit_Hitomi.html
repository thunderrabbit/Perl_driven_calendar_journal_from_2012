<p>Fuck.  I hit Hitomi and I feel really bad about it.</p>

<p>During bedtime preparations, I asked her which P-B DVD she
wanted to watch; she had requested that we watch one of them
today. (she's been requesting this for a while) and we were somewhat
busy today cleaning my room and researching stuff for P-B and
eating and watching movies and we never watched either DVD.</p>

<p>I couldn't understand what she was saying, but when we finally
talked I got that she felt she had been waiting all day to watch, but
we never got a chance because I was on the computer all day.</p>

<p>I told her what I heard her say, men's group style, and then asked
her what she wanted right now.  She said she didn't know.  I was
about to fall asleep, so I was like, "well, I want to go to sleep."
She goes, "おやすみ" (good night) and rolled over to sleep.</p>

<p>I fell to that point of asleep where it's not 100% but definitely
not awake and she kicked her leg back at me in a last-stab type
gesture.  I was already hot and already asleep and I kicked her back
and struck my arm down on her hip. pow.</p>

<p>Oh damn.  I'm sorry; I told you I would never hit you, but I did.
I didn't control my anger during my sleep.</p>
