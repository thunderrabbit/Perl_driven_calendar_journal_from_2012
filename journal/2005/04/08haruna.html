<p>Lesson with Haruna tonight. Our first one outside Gaba.  We're
supposed to meet at 7:30.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.  I want to make sure I remember to
bring my little Rody horses on P-B.  I think I'll bring them
by default; they're in my backpack, but it will be nice to check them
off my list.</p>

<p>Lesson with Haruna was good fun.  We talked about her goal of going
overseas to learn English and I helped her make some specific goals
and begin to plan it.  Calgary, Canada 9-17 September.  or 17-25?  I
forget, but she has it written down.  I told her that I wouldn't have
another lesson with her until she has done some research on different
language schools in Calgary.  "Send me the URL and we'll schedule our
next lesson."  She was like, "I'll try" and we spent an hour talking
about "I'll try" or more accurately <b>I</b> spent an hour telling her
that "I'll try" means "I won't."</p>

<p>"What? is your computer difficult to reach?  Is there no internet
in Japan?  No internet cafes in Yokohama?  No internet access at work
and no lunch hour during which you can research?"  She asked me not to
get mad if she doesn't email me, and I said I wouldn't, but I would
think "poor Haruna, doesn't really want to go to Canada."</p>

<p>I hope that hour was helpful for her.</p>
