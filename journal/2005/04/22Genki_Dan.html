<p>Dan and I headed down to Tsunashima on a Quest to pick up the
painting that I painted (but never determined to be "finished" and
subsequently left it) after I received an email from one of the
current tenants:</p>

Hey dude, I live at #101 Bell Wistaria and without exaggerating i get
no less than 227 letters addressed to you from Yahoo BB a day.  In
additon to this I have 12 Yahoo BB modems here.  Please come and pick
them up.  They are under my table and are pissing me off.

P.S. The artwork in the lounge room is still here if you want it back.
I had it valued the other day and it has increased in value 10 fold to
a staggering 17 yen.

<p>Last night when we made plans to go, Dan was like, "I'm going to
have a shower when we go.  I'm going to do some washing.."  And I was
really looking forward to that; I know Dan has a pretty good sense of
right and wrong and an excellent sense of what sun and funny, so I
know I would have gone right along with him.  I even brought socks and
underwear to wear after my shower.</p>

<p>We stopped at Subway along the way to grab sandwiches and I was
able to use the free sandwich cards that were in one of the map books
I bought from Andrew the bike guy I met at Alistair's thing.</p>

<p>Chilled out at Subway for a while and let our sandwiches settle as
we watched people go on with their lives.  I'm sure we discussed
something funny or interesting.</p>

<p>Stopped by the river after that and discussed plans for our new
movie based on my desired super power.  The movie could be called
_Show Me_, starring Drew Barrymore and Samuel L. Jackson.</p>

<p>We complained about tobacco usage in Japan and contrasted it to
England which bans all such advertising.  I told him about the new
smoker I saw in Shibuya.  (What are you trying to prove, girl?)</p>

<p>Headed toward the house and saw some gaijin walking the opposite
direction; they were presumably headed to their respective NOVA
branches for 1:20 starts.  (Shudder)</p>

<p>Made it to the house and walked introspectively into the bike area,
checking for interesting mail (especially 200+ bills in my name) and
found nothing.  To the door and rang the doorbell.  Nothing.  Knocked.
Nothing.  Tried the door and found it unlocked.</p>

<p>"Helllloooo???"  "Hellloooo??"  No answer.  "Moshi Moshi??"  no
answer.</p>

<p> I kicked off my shoes in the entrance and peered into my original
room.  No one.  Dan's second room.  No one.  My second room was
closed, with the couch angled so as to make the occupant use the
right hand door instead of the left.</p>

<p>The painting was there as indicated.  I grabbed it, glanced at the
table for modems, and saw none.  I think the email was a bit
exaggerated.</p>

<p>Headed back out.  Dan locked the door so no one would take
anything.</p>

<p>I had second thoughts about locking the door; maybe it's open for
someone specific.  Maybe they all lost their keys.  Maybe Dan will
have to go back and unlock it.  Maybe I should just chill out.</p>

<p>Headed toward Okurayama cause I hadn't been that way in a while and
mostly cause I didn't want to walk through Tsunashima with my painting
(though yes, it is mine; I bought it, painted it, etc)</p>

<p>Dan started a new game of let's see who can find the coolest thing,
and he promptly found a nearly new Japanese porn magazine behind a
pole.</p>

<p>"Besides this magazine or (not counting this magazine) let's see
who can find the coolest thing.  And we can have discussions about
which thing is more interesting and why."</p>

<p>The game didn't last very long; I kept forgetting about it and was
talking about other stuff.</p>

<p>We saw some flowers and I took a picture of Dan right in front of
them and we both had the idea to snap the phtto as a woman walked in
front of the frame.  This led to a game of taking the worst photos
possible.</p>

<p>We also got some pictures of us in the mirror of the photobooth,
using the painting as a backdrop.</p>

/></a></p>

<p>In addition to those, we got a guy to take two photos of us on the
train, and then in Hiyoshi he got off and another guy got on and sat
in the exact same spot so I had him take another picture of us.</p>
