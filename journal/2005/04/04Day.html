<p>This morning I walked with Jasmine and Sally as we dropped off
Jasmine at Motosumiyoshi station.  We picked up Andrew along the way.
I wished I had brought my camera to record the girls singing songs as
they walked.  Very cute.  Big hugs to Jasmine as her train arrived.  I
had carried her luggage up the stairs to the platform for her and did
a few Beaver Dance motions as the doors closed.</p>

<p>Watched four episodes of Southpark instead of doing much productive
stuff.  Though I did make breakfast and lunch and talked to Simone a
little bit.  She asked me if I would help her learn English, and with
Jen's "I couldn't take money from a friend" bouncing around in my
head, I told her I could teach her for 4000 yen per hour.</p>
