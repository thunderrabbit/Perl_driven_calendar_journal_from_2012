<p>During the process of cleaning out my room, I decided I would not
keep the jacket Jon gave me before I came to Japan.  I emailed him to
see if he wanted it back, and he said I should mail my mom; she had
given it to me.</p>

<p>She said that she *brought* it from Texas to Japan when they came
in November 2003, and I never thanked her for it.  Fuckin' hell.  I
have a completely different memory, and am sad to imagine that I
never thanked her and that for all this time she has felt
unappreciated around carrying the jacket over.  Damn.</p>

<p>So I decided the best thing I could do is take some pictures of me
appreciating the jacket and sending those to her.  And offer the
option of sending the jacket back to her or giving it away here.</p>
