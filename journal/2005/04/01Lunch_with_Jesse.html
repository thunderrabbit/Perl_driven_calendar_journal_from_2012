<p>Met Jesse for lunch in Jiyugaoka.  Talked about nothin' and then
about him and Takako vs his dad; pretty fucked up sounding
situation.  His dad doesn't like Takako, which is causing tension
between Jesse and Takako.  Really unfair sounding stuff.</p>

<p>We played HSJ in a bank lobby area (bank was closed) vs some other
girls in a loudness competition.  The girls were talking all loud so
Jesse wanted to out-loud them.  Soon thereafter he cracked out the
hackey sack and we got several good kicks in.</p>

<p>His student arrived and  I didn't remember ever having met her
before, though she says I did, and they went off for their lesson and
I came home.  Or I am on the way home now.</p>
