<p>Watched a couple (four) Southpark episodes (thanks, Jackie!) with
Hitomi.  Satoko and Jasmine watched a couple as well.  Then we
ordered pizza and watched most of _Needful Things_ and then the end
of _Love Actually_ downstairs while sharing a bit of Sam's 熱燗　（あ
つかん）（熱いお酒）</p>

<p>_Needful Things_ was actually pretty good; I thought it was a good
story concept.  _Love Actually_ got me teared up when the girl
answered ("Yes is be my answer") in the restaurant.</p>

<p>Kellie from Gaba has invited us to the ちんちん festival
tomorrow.  Pictures fo sheezy.</p>
