<p>After work yesterday I wondered if Hitomi left her computer so I
could write some files to DVD.  My computer can't write DVD, but can
read them.  She did, so I copied all my files to her computer.. well,
all my images and music and non porn movies and the contents of my
desktop to her computer.  I must give props to Mac for making this
super easy.  I used a straight cable (not crossover) to connect the
machines directly and it worked easily, just by turning on Sharing on
Hitomi's computer.  I turned off her airport card so no one could
access her machine wirelessly while sharing was enabled.</p>

<p>She bought Roxio Toast, which makes burning CDs and DVDs a snap.
Somethng that Panther (OS X 10.3) can't do with Finder, but apparently
Tiger (OS X 10.4) will be able to do.  I might get Tiger, but I may
wait until I get a new machine.  Hopefully that won't be for a while.
I'm interested to know what jungle cat will be next.  I can't think of
any more such names that end with R, discounting jaguar, which was the
first version? 10.2?  I don't know if 10.1 had a cat name.</p>

<p>ANYWAY, the pics directory was 5 gigs, and the music directory was
5 gigs and I couldn't think of a logical way to split them.  So I just
tarred all four directories into a tarball using -L to limit the size
f the archive.  I used google to determine how many kilobytes in 4.7
gigabytes, but tarballs that big were too big.  4.4 gigs of writable
space on the DVDs.  I tried again, but was over by like 4 k.  Tried
again and got it just the right size for the DVDs.  burned 3 DVDs
overnight.</p>

<pre>
tar --create -L 4596699 --file rob_arc_2005apr30.tar rob
</pre>

<p>rob is the directory where all my files were.</p>

<p>Actually I burned the first two volumes then realized her HD ran
out of space during the burn of the third, but tar didn't report an
error; it just finished the file with 52<em>K</em> remaining on her HD
and waited for me to clear space for the next one.</p>

<p>I had burned the first two .tar files, but wasn't going to waste
space burning the third; it was only 2 something gigs.</p>

<p>So I wiped all the .tar files from the HD and recreated them, and
had at most two at a time on the drive.  Toast writing one to DVD and
tar creating the next.</p>

<p>I burned all three DVDs that way, and wondered if the two copies of
the first volume of the archive was the same on each copy of DVD 1 and
DVD 2.  Wiped all the files from the HD then copied 1 from the DVD and
used diff to compare it to the next DVD.  Both copies were exactly the
same.  Awesome.  Thank you, tar.  Thank you, Toast.</p>

<p><em>That</em> basically took all night and this morning as I was
leaving for OM, I was neeeearly finished copying the third DVD to
make a duplicate of it as well.  I left Hitomi's computer running
while I'm at work (and probably while I meet Satoko tonight).</p>

<p>The next step is to use tar to test extraction of the files.  I
was hoping to do that today while at work, but it will have to wait
until tonight.</p>
