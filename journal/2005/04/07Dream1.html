<p class=dream>In the middle of a wide valley so wide that one could
forget mountains surrounded it, a man had built a two story building.
The second floor was shaped like \/\/\/\/ it had troughs to guide
water or something.  Walking underneath the second floor revealed that
the \/\/\/ was because each / and \ was a separate block of concrete.
I asked him about this technique and he said he didn't have enough
resources to pour the entire floor at once, so he poured these
individual square blocks of concrete and bolted them all together to
make the floor.  I was really impressed with what a big cool thing he
had done using persistence instead of ample money.</p>
