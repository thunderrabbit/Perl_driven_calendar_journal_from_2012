<p>Kellie told me she couldn't get gmail to work for some reason, but
she got 1 gig of free email via <a
href="http://torrentreactor.net">torrentreactor.net</a> (I think), so
I scoped their site and started to download a southpark episode, and
Jackie was like, "don't bother; I have all of the episodes on CD," and
she brought them to my room.  Like a stack of 40 discs with 4 episodes
on each one.  Nice.  I watched one and Hitomi and I watched 2 and then
Jasmine came home!</p>
