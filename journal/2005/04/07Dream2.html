<p class=dream>Driving YRUUers in Scott, we parked near a building for
no particular reason.  Then I realized the building was the drug rehab
house used by the popular kids from at least two previous YRUU
generations.  With me were Josephine, Face, Laura, Mikey, and some
un-specific others.  I had brought them here and told them what it
was, but didn't tell them they had to go in. Josephine took the plunge
and walked in.  Laura followed, but asked me to hug her slash hold her
hand when she went in.  She was all crying and I hugged her for
several minutes.</p>

<p class=dream>Or it would have been for several minutes if another
resident hadn't spoken up like, "HI; why are you crying? we all were
scared when we first came.  are you scared?  What's your name?" etc,
effectively breaking the space for a good cry.</p>
