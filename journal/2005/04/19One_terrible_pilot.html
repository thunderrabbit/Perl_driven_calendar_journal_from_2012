<p>A couple months ago I saw some pictures of the Pentagon and
decided there's no way a 757 could have crashed into it.  Some people
have theories on how it happened with wings folding back and oblique
angles of attack and rotation to fit a plane that big into a hole
that small, but... I don't buy it for a moment.</p>

<p>BUT, regardless of one's theories about that, the book <a
href="http://www.carnot.fr/ouvrage.asp?CatalogId=190"><em>9/11 The Big
Lie</em> by Thierry Meyssan</a> brought to my attention something
else.</p>

<p>I began to write my own version, but <a
href="http://www.davidicke.com/icke/articles3/bushlies.html">this
page</a> sums it up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My version for posteriority's sake:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Airplanes crashing into the World Trade centers caught the media
by surprise, right?  No one saw the first plane on live TV because
live TV was in the middle of morning shows and the like.</p>

<p>Later, it turned out that there happened to be some guys doing a
documentary on the New York Fire Department and they did film the
first crash, but it sure wasn't broadcast live on TV.</p></li>

<li><p>In this <a
href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011204-17.html">White
House press release</a> search for "the terrorist attack?"</p>

<p>George W. Bush answered, in part:</p>

<blockquote>
I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an
airplane hit the tower -- the TV was obviously on.  And I used to
fly, myself, and I said, well, there's one terrible pilot.  I said,
it must have been a horrible accident.

But I was whisked off there, I didn't have much time to think about
it.  And I was sitting in the classroom, and Andy Card, my Chief of
Staff, who is sitting over here, walked in and said, "A second plane
has hit the tower, America is under attack."</blockquote>

<p>My question: <b>how did George see the first plane crash before
the second one happened?</b></p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, it's arguable that he meant, "I saw a plane <em>had</em> hit
the tower," and simply attribute it to a grammar flub, something W is
good at.</p>
