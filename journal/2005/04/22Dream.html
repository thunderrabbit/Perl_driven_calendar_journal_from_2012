<p class=dream>Riding my bicycle down an escalator filled with people
so I had to be careful, controlling my speed by gripping the handrail
thing on my left, making sure not to squish anyone or any dogs.  As I
got past the crowds, the escalators cleared out and I could go
faster, and the escalators were steeper.  I gripped the handrail less
and less until I was freefalling down the vertical wall and then
grabbed the handrail at the last minute to slow my descent before
crashing into the ground.  Some women were watching and I know that
made me go a little bit faster and wait a little bit longer than I
would have otherwise.  I pedaled up the next hill, wanting to go
nonstop up it, but I got a bit tired and couldn't go directly up it,
so I acted as if I wanted to go do some other stunts, but actually
just appreciating the less steep terrain, though it was actually more
steep but for some reason it was easier to ascend.  Another guy on a
bike went the original way and I was able to pass him and then we got
to a big dropoff about five feet tall and jumped down it and had to
stop before we fell into a bottomless pit with ventilation fans ready
to slice us to bits.  We stopped and introduced ourselves to each
other and he said his name was Derrick.  I told him a name other than
Rob, but I don't remember what and I don't remember why.</p>
