<p>Hitomi and I met Dan, Kei and Jen at Tsurumi river in Tsunashima
for old times hang out sake.  Dan and I played HCJ (Hackey Can Jack)
which turned into a game of kick the can soccer and then back to
hackey can jack and then finished when I kicked the can over the
fence.</p>

<p>Great fun talking and hanging out with Dan, whose hat had a bit of
an unraveling issue.</p>
