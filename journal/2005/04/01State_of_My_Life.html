<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol type=a>
<li><p>I HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO SAIL ON P-B's 49th Global
Voyage!!!</p>

<p>I got the news on my birthday, the same day I went to pick up Sally
and Kelly at the airport.  Oh my god I was vibrating with elation.
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!</p></li>

<li><p>Dude sent me <a href="http://tadalist.com">tadalist.com</a>
which led me to <a
href="http://www.basecamphq.com/?ref=robnugen.com">basecamp</a> where
I have set up a free project management project to organize my
thoughts as I transition from Millenium House to P-B's 49th
Voyage</p></li>

<li><p>I'm well on schedule for sending in all the stuff they need;
I'm actually caught up until 14 May, though I'll need to read a bunch
of stuff they'll send me soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to ride TJ Bike to Hakone soon.  Probably right after
Sally and the gang leave Japan next week.  It's only 60+ kilometers
according to my GPS receiver, but the roads are steep and
curvy.</p></li>

<li><p>I have just emailed Mieko to confirm I may stay at her parent's
house for a night when I ride out that direction.  I don't know how
close their house is to the straight-up Hakone area, but, the process
has begun.</p></li>

<li><p>Had a bit of a falling out with Sally.  I didn't like that she
bought cigarettes and she didn't like something I did.  Or something.
But it's all good; We'll both lead awesome lives.</p></li>

<li><p>Sally, Kelly and Jasmine went to Kyoto yesterday and haven't
come back to my house yet.  I hope they are doing well and having big
fun!</p></li>

<li><p>Millenium House is full, or so the rumors say.  Sam from OZ
(maybe), a long haired girl from Brazil (who speaks very little
English, but helped me with Spanish, (and her husband who I haven't
met yet), and a guy from somewhere else who I've not met yet are all
new denizens of our lovely building.  I'm glad for Elvis, who was
running low on cash, having no one in the building.</p></li>

<li><p>Just today I snailed some Chinese learnin' books to Bryn, and
included a picture in the package.  It was wrapped tightly in
cardboard and basically resembled a hardback book.  A thick hardback
book.  I wrote on the package PHOTOS ENCLOSED DO NOT BEND.  hahah such
a riot!</p></li>

<li><p>I still live in Millenium House, in Tokyo Japan but my days
there are numbered.  Like in the 40s.  (49 days to be
exact-ish)</p></li>

<li><p>My computer has lots of pics on it; my chores for today consist
of looking at different ways to get the images and music archived
before I go go go.  I'm thinking I'll be able to transfer stuff from
my compuer to Hitomi's and use her DVD burner.  That would be
cool.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been in email touch with Kellie, the tall funny loud
woman who lived in Hawaii for her growning up years.  She's intent on
being on P-B's 51st voyage.  I'm sure she'll be able to do
it.</p></li>

<li><p>I've basically not kept in touch with anyone from Gaba except
for Jesse.  and it's only been a week or two.  Oh, except for Mieko,
who I emailed today.  But only cause I want to crash at her parents'
crib.</p></li>

<li><p>The weather is getting warmer; I sometimes venture out without
my hat, and the sun is actually warm at times.  yay warmer
weather!</p></li>

<li><p>I'm using gmail as my main email storage.  rob@robnugen.com is
my address and thunderrabbit@gmail.com is my storage.  And, as I'm
typing, my gmail storage quota is going up.  I think it will be 2000
MB by the end of today.</p></li>

<li><p>I have changed my visa status to Temporary Visitor.  That
means I'm not allowed to work.  Unfortunately, I'm unable to buy a JR
Rail Pass in Japan.  I have to get an exchange ticket outside Japan
and then exchange it for a pass inside Japan.  Very strict.  I wonder
if I'll buy a pass while I'm in New York for 3 days in July with
P-B.</p></li>

<li><p>My only job is at Jen's OM job on weekends.  I don't work
during the week now.  Not even really any private students.  My job
description and salary have been cut at OM.  Only a few quintarks and
no data entry.</p></li>

<li><p>OM has been absent for the past couple weekends at OM.  He's
kickin' it in the Phillipines.  Jen has been trying to keep the
business working; last weekend I helped her figure out what needed to
happen to get stuff working smoothly.</p></li>

<p>My computer is MAC OS X version 10.3.8, with 667 MHz PowerPC G4 1
MB L3 cache and 512 MB SDRAM.  HD: Mac OS Extended (Journaled) 27.94
GB capacity and 1.78 GB free.</p>

<li><p>I never went to help with the tsunami, but I'm pretty much
over that.  It was too expensive, and now I can help people in a
different way on P-B.</p></li>

<li><p>I wonder if I can do the next P-B voyage.  I wonder why
there is no 50th voyage.  Only a 49th and 51st.  I wonder if I'll
want to go on the 51st after I've experienced the 49th, or if I'll
want to just sleep or never travel or what.</p></li>

<li><p>Right now, I cannot adequately (and by adequately I mean "at
all") explain what P-B activities we will do in ports that
really help the world be peaceful.</p></li>

<li><p>I've written a little cron job that archives my journal entries
in the early am every day, then emails them to my trstorage account on
gmail.  On the 1st, 11th, 21st, and 31st, it emails them to different
email accounts on the web.  This is all just for backup in case
something bad happens with robnugen.com or the US in general.</p></li>

<li><p>I am not yet archiving my images in this way.</p></li>

<li><p>I seem to be settled with the idea of keeping a beard.  During
my P-B adventure, I plan to just use Dan's shaver to trim all
my head hair to the same short short length.  Short for hair, a bit
fuzzy for beard.</p></li>
