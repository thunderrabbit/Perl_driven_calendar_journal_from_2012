come through my door; I had forgotten at that minute that he would be
coming, but I knew in general he would come today.  Hitomi was totally
surprised.</p>

pudding.  Jackie came down and while she chatted with Jen, Dan and I
hooked up a game of HSJ, which turned into a game of cricket in the
street after a single pitch worth of broom hackeysack baseball.  We
found that a wicket could easily be made with the nearby scraps of
wood.  Soon our game moved to the street and we pulled up part of a
gutter lid to act as a backstop.</p>

<p>Jackie had come down to chat, so she and Jen gabbed while Dan and I
played cricket.  After the game, I was a bit hungry and whipped up a
batch of broken corn chips and mozarella cheese in the microwave.</p>

and cheese and crackers which we enjoyed readily.  Two types of lovely
cheese.  One was a half roll of verigated cheddar and soft white
cheese.  It had garlic in it as well; pretty interesting.</p>

<p>Katrina came down after beating her goal of sleeping until 5pm and
the girls talked about girl stuff while Dan journaled and I sat
quietly listening, but not really paying attention; I was focused on
cheese and crackers.</p>

<p>I'm headed to Yokohama to meet Hitomi for Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind, which I've seen twice, but enjoyed it enough to see it
again (and pay for it this time).  Kinda a reward to Jim and Kate.</p>

<p class=date>8:23pm</p>

<p>Turns out there is no late show of Eternal Sunshine, so we're going
to see a CGI-filled Constantine starring Keanu Reaves.</p>

<p>But that's not why I'm writing.</p>
