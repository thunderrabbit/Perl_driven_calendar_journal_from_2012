<p>Now their front page looks something like this:</p>

<table width=94% align=center cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1>

  <tr>
      <td width=75% valign=top>
	    <p><font size=-1>Gmail is an experiment in a new kind of webmail, built on the idea that you should never have to delete mail and you should always be able to find the message you want. The key features are: </font></p>
	    <ul>
          <li>
            <p><font size=-1><b>Search, don't sort.</b><br>
             Use Google search to <b>find the exact message</b> you want, no matter when it was sent or received.</font></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><font size=-1><b>Don't throw anything away.</b><br>
            <span id=quota>Over 2000</span> megabytes (and counting) of free storage so you'll never need to delete another message.</font></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><font size=-1><b>Keep it all in context.</b><br>
            Each message is grouped with all its replies and displayed as a conversation.</font></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
		 <ul>
          <li>
            <p><font size=-1><b>No pop-up ads. No untargeted banners.</b><br>
            You see only <a href=http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/about.html#ads>relevant text ads</a> and links to related web pages of interest.</font></p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Right now as I'm typing this, the scrolling number thing says 1832
someodd megabytes of space, but the static one says "Over 2000" which
leads me to believe that spinner will just keep on spinning.  I
further believe this will be their front page for a while.</p>

<p>Gmail rules.</p>
