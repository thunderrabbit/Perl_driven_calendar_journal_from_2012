<p>Got to hang out with Genki Carla today!  We had lunch and chatted
and scoped her pictures from her world tour.  I got to see the first
three countries and got a sense of how different India is.  Men hold
hands and sometimes caress each other while talking.  Men and women
are completely segregated; there's no heterosexual outlet available
until the parents say "okay, you're going to marry this person."</p>

<p>She showed me a picture of a blue dog (an actual dog, actually
(painted?) blue), goats standing on an impossibly high and narrow
ledge, cattle roaming around postcard racks, dead bodies washed in
the Ganges, burned then dumped in the Ganges, </p>
