<p>The long haired girl from Brazil was chillin' on the computer in
the living room.  I stumbled through a few sentences in Spanish with
her (she wouldn't let me speak Japanese with her :-) and then she
asked about how to get to a nearby payphone.  The old Rob would try to
walk with her, but there's really no need for that; and I've got junk
to do here.  (Like what, I wonder.)</p>

<p>I don't remember her name (she told me last night).</p>

<p>Sam just said her name is Simone.</p>
