<p>I'll go ride TJ Bike to get some DVDs to burn my mp3s and images.
Plus Hitomi wants to burn some stuff to CD.</p>

<p>Rode TJ Bike to PC Depot and bought some DVD-R and CD-R (10 each)
and tried to figure out how to burn files onto the DVDs, but iDVD is
nothing like iTunes nor Finder for burning.  I just want to archive
these files on the DVD.  Maybe it will work if I tell it to open
Finder when a new DVD is inserted.  That way I may have a better
chance of having a disc icon show up onto which I can dump the files.</p>

<p>Took a bit of a nap and then rode TJ Bike out to Shinagawa, where
I am now.  I recorded a bit of my trip (out to Tsunashima kaido) and
then a bit walking around Shinagawa station, but nothing of the ride
in between where I squeezed between cars on the road and zipped down
hills with traffic.  I definitely want to get a video camera mounted
on my helmet or something and then a microphone with foam so I can
talk.  And a remote so I can turn on and off the recordeing.   I
wonder what kind of power the external camera would need.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p>I was just thinking about the money I spent on tent and sleeping
bag, but having used them yet.  maybe this Friday night I'll go sleep
by a river somewhere.  I chose Friday because that way Hitomi could
come with me.  I wonder why I seem to be hesitant to do it alone.</p>

<p>Jen brings up a good point; how will I store all my videos?  Just
on the way here I recorded like 5 gigs worth of foolishness; I'll
quickly run out of storage space...  I could get a 160Gig external
drive (from PC Depot) for 20,000 en, which would definitely help.
I'd like to find a balance between just having tons of crizap and
editing tooo much along the way...  I think it will be easier overall
to just have tons of crizap and once I am setled again, sort through
all of it.  Or hire someone to do that.</p>
