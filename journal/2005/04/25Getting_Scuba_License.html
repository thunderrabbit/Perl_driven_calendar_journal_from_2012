<p>I'm meeting Christ Goodman from Gaba to begin the proces of being
Scuba Certified before P-B.  I emailed him about a week ago and
said, "I'm ready to get certified" as he suggested/offered/encouraged
me (and everyone else at Gaba) to get scuba certified.  He is a
certified trainer type.  </p>

<p>He said it will be nearly impossible to get my certified before 21
May, but then he emailed back saying I could study on my own, then
take the test and do a couple of dives to prove I can do 16 things
under water.  Or something.</p>

<p>55,0000 yen.  ($550), and helping out a friend.  rock on.</p>

<p>I'm here at the Starbucks where I'm meeting Chris and a woman
smiled at me; I don't know if she looks familiar because I've seen
her before or for a different reason or two.</p>

<p>I researched Piraeus, Greece a bit today.  We will be there for but
a day; I kinnnnda doubt that is ample time to get into Athens on the
electric railway and see the old school buildings.  I found a few
internet cafes listed; I don't know how close they are to Piraeus, but
one site I saw suggested a lunch type adventure in the small marina is
preferable to trying to find toouristy stuff near the big port.</p>

<p>The woman here in Starbucks talked to a guy who could be an
unshaven Tony LaQuesta, who was manager at Shibuya LS when I met
him.</p>

<p>I have 310,000 yen in my Gaba bank account; that's enough that I
can afford to get fitted for contacts before I get outta here onto the
boat.  These glasses with cool frames that I got in Dallas with
janette's help, after losing mine in Hawaii (and getting contacts with
janette's help) are the only pair of corrrective lenses I have right
about now, so I would be hard pressed to see if I lost them while on
PB.</p>
