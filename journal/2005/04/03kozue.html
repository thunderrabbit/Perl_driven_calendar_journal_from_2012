<p>After work I met Kozue in Akihabara where she helped me find a
digital video camera.  The one she suggested is one I had my eye on
and after a few minutes contemplation, I flipped a coin and learned I
should buy it.</p>

<p>She was surprised at how fast I made the decision.  :-)</p>

<p>Afterward, she drove us to Shibuya to meet the assembled posse of
Kelly, Satoko, Jasmine, Andrew, Katsu(?), Kellie, Yumi, and Hitomi at
a shabushabu restaurant.  When we arrived, there were about 20 people
waiting in line, but I was all like, "Kelly会います。" and zoom we
went straight in.  Kozue was like, "wow."  It was pretty neat.</p>

<p>It was all-we-could-eat for about 2600 yen each including drinks.
Pretty good.</p>

<p>They just kept bringing stacks of plates of thinly sliced beef and
plates of vegetables that we swoosh around in boiling water.  The
water was in bowls on electric eyes on the table; no gas flames
here.</p>

<p>I kept thinking about all the starving people in the world as we
chowed down.  How will my thinking change when I'm on P-B?</p>
