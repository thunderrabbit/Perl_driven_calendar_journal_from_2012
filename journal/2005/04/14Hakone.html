<p>I'm just about to leave for Hakone on TJ Bike.</p>

<p>I have my tent, sleeping bag, computer, GPS, banana (*), air pump,
and map.  I think that will be sufficient.</p>

<p>This is my first TJ Bike trip during which I'm planning to stay
overnight.  I don't know how long it will take to get to Hakone, but
there are pretty clear highways for the route.  I plan to go down
along Tsunashima Kaido to Highway 1, then turn right and go until I
get to Hakone.</p>

<p>I have marked Gora on my GPS, but it may not be particularly easy
to use that since the roads will be all curvy around the
mountains.</p>

<p>(*) an actual banana for eating purposes</p>
