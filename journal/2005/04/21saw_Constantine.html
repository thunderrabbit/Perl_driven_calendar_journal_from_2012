<p>We watched Constantine tonight.  Actually a pretty good movie.  I
liked how Gabriel was a bad girl and how Satan was duped and how the
bee,roach,crab,snake demon attacked John.  I liked something about the
bowling alley scene, but I don't remember what.  The fly crawling out
of his eye was nuts.  ewwwwwwwwwwWWWW!!</p>

<p>Oh, my favorite scene in the movie was when Satan walked into the
room where his son was trying to get out of the heroine.</p>

<p>Real Matrix kinda stuff.  It woulda been cool had they shown that
in realtime as well.</p>

<p>It's a good thing I didn't see the movie with Miki.</p>

<p>On the way into the theater I stopped by Thailand.</p>

<p>As we left the theater, both escalators were rolling down, so I was
able to ride the handrails down.</p>
