<p>Work yesterday was easy and 1.6 quintarks positive.  After work Jen
and I sat out on the grass (after getting food, a traumatic experience
of slogging through crowds and blaringly loud music, way beyond the
capacity of the speakers producing it) to eat and enjoy the sun.  I
kept telling her to look out over the water, not at the people around
us, who were driving her bananas.  It was really windy, so after she
left, I had to hold the pages of my pre-orientation packet quite
carefully.  I was successful in keeping them all with me, though some
other people were successful in releasing their trash which rolled
over me.  I should have grabbed it because my earth is more important
to me than placing blame on trash production.</p>

<p>Watched _28 Days Later_ (weak) and _Beyond Borders_
(excellent).</p>
