<p class=note>(I sent this to P-B as my intro for the staff book)</p>

<pre>Though I'm Rob Nugen from Houston, Texas, I'm not a "Texan" and I
don't approve of George W.  I enjoy riding my bicycle and inline
skating when I'm able to wrench myself away from my computer.  I write
plenty in my journal (robnugen.com/journal), and often am inspired to
do some perl programming.  I was a programmer in Houston for 8 years
before I decided to get out and see the world, which included an
11,000 mile solo driving trip around the US and now 2 years teaching
English in Tokyo.  I'm looking forward to doing more *traveling* in
my travels!</pre>
