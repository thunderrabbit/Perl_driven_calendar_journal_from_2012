<p>Just chillin' online.  Have done one quintark transaction.</p>

<p>Jen, however, was run nearly ragged today.  OM is just ...
unfathomably short sighted.  He asks her to do two things at the same
time and then is surprised when she stops doing one of them.  I am
unable to help her cause she's on the phone with him so I can't hear
what he's asking and the requests are trivial anyway.  Man; it's a
weird situation.</p>

<p>I bought her a tasty beverage when she asked and tried to keep
asking her if I could do anything.  Generally speaking I could
not.</p>
