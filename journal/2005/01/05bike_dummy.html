<p>Crap.  Mimibike was towed again today.  I parked her near the
station.  I remained in a relatively chipper mood, knowing I was about
to pay 2500 yen (for the third time) for a bike I bought for 3000 yen
in the first place.  Even learned the name of the guy at the place.
(What a crap job he must have.)  Shimizu.</p>

<p>My good mood was lost when, as a result of having paid 2500 yen for
the bike, I couldn't afford 540 yen worth of groceries.  Fuck.</p>
