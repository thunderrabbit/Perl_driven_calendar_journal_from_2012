<p class=date>2:34am JST Saturday 22 January 2005</p>

<p>I'm up way too late for my own good of waking up tomorrow at 7:40,
but I got my days old thing working nearly the way I want.  Given
perfect input, it will calculate the date I will be a certain number
of days old.  It uses perl's localtime and timelocal which means two
things:  1) it's fast.  2) it doesn't have a very big range.</p>

<p>The previous code could mess with dates between 1568 (?) and 9999.
This code can only do dates from 1970 to 2020 or so.  Not so
impressive.  But it's fast.</p>

<p>I don't really care to write a version that can handle a larger
span of dates.  I just want to know how old *I* am, and 1970 as a
bottom range fits that bill.  I might might might do more later.</p>
