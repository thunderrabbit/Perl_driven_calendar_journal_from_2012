<p>I hadn't done any of the pre-exercise setup, so I was caught by
surprise when he was like, "what six numbers are written in the white
envelope?" So I took some moments to come up with an equivalent and I
chose the next four runes that I'll pull out of my bag:</p>

<p>Nauthiz, Gebo, Isa, Raido</p>

<p>Then he was like, "focus on someone and perceive what they are
doing."</p>

<p>janette is making cookies for me in her kitchen.</p>

<p>"now send that person a message."</p>

<p>I sent her "orange peels."</p>

<p>- - - - actually: - - - -</p>

<p>Algiz, Laguz, Raido, Dagaz</p>

<p>janette is doing her taxes</p>

<p>She didn't get the message, but last week she thought about making
candied orange peels.</p>
