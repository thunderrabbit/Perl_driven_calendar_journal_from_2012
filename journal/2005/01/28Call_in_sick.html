<p>I just called and asked Iwanosan to cancel my remaining two
lessons today.  Akiko closed some yesterday and I just don't seem to
be getting better enough to do these two today.</p>

<p>The lessons were to be with Mieko and Kenzo, two of my favorite
students.  And I don't often get to chat with Mieko.</p>

<p>I told Iwanosan "tell them I can reschedule a time just for them,"
but that didn't compute and he didn't understand.</p>

<p>I didn't feel like explaining it; "yes, just cancel them."</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>
