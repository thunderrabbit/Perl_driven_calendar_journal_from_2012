<p>Watched <a
href="http://ensim.streamstudiohost.net/~cinerina.com/reviews/archives/000457.html">_Confessions
of a Dangerous Mind_</a> after work and after shopping with Jen.  Good
stuff.</p>

<p>During work today she and I played "who would you have sex with
____ or ____?" after she started a game of "who would you have dinner
with?" and I had to qualify it as "everyone wants to have dinner with
you; who will you have dinner with?"</p>

<p>Jen's lowest ranking sex partners are George Bush Jr and Osama Bin
Laden.  Her highest are George Clooney and Sean Connery or maybe
others I forgot.</p>

<p>The lowest she found for me is the hunchback of Notre Dam.
Highest for me is Angelina Jolie.</p>
