<p>I told Hitomi she could crash out at my place last night, but when
I was trying to sleep, she kept wiggling around like a wiggle worm
every 2 minutes, waking me up each time.  Oh man that was irritating.
She was too hot, then too cold, etc etc I don't know what was
underneath all of that, and if she knew, she wasn't saying.</p>
