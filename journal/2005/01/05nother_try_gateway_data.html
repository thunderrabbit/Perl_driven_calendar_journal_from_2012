<p>Stayed conscious through that one.  Before he encouraged lifting
in the balloon, I worked on visualizing my energy bar on and off,
which, last time, seemed to induce a vibrational state for me.  I
felt around for a physiological equivalent to visualizing it on and
off.  I found something, but don't know how they correlate.</p>

<p>My body was quite sleeping during the verbal floating suggestions,
and I noticed my legs and then my arms felt that discomfortable
feeling that I've associated with super exercise during the day and
then going to sleep.  Like my legs just want to move.  Is that feeling
my legs not inside my physical legs?  Goodness knows I didn't exercise
very much today, and I definitely know the feeling wasn't there before
I started and nearly isn't there now, except for one point in my left
hip.</p>

<p>I tried visualizing my hands touching my heater, and visualized
pushing myself out of body with my energy bar, and visualized tying it
to a column in Musashikosugi station and rubberbanding myself over
there.  Neither of those things seemed to work they way I hoped they
might.</p>

<p>As the exercise started, I decided I wanted to post the email I
received from Cesar in French, and my reply, partially in Spanish, and
a tiny bit in Japanese.  I made a mental note for myself to remember
that.  That worked.  I also made a mental Focus 12 request to remember
the dream I had a few hours ago.</p>
