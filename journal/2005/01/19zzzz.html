<p>Pretty good day overall today.  Got photos taken of the knotboards;
just need to measure them (and rename the files to include their
sizes) and upload them before publishing them for sale on Yahoo
Auction.</p>

<p>Studied for 2.5 hours or so.  Good stuff.  All the previous entry
I wrote by hand on paper and then typed it in above.  Thanks to
Hitomi for helping with corrections.</p>

<p>Today is the day I picked up Hitomi on Mimibike from Kosugi
station, rode back home with her, hung my laundry, rode TJ Bike to
Saizeria (to study), couldn't find my keys to lock TJ Bike, dropped
her off, rode back to my room where I found the keys in the pocket of
the inner fleece jacket I was wearing (that she bought me today), rode
back to Saizeria, studied for 2.5 hours, then rode TJ Bike back with
Hitomi.</p>
