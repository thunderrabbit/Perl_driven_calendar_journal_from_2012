<p>Slept like a dog then met Hitomi in Kawasaki for pudding from our
favorite pudding shop in Azaelea.  We went to the bench on top of the
bridge arch thing near Cinecitta and slurped pudding while enjoying a
bit of sunshine.</p>

<p>Wandered around the game center where (nothing really struck our
collective fancy, but) we struck it rich and found about 15 tokens
(they call them medals) in one of the machines.</p>

<p>Snagged them and will use them a different day when it's not so
crowded and smokey in there.</p>

<p>Went back underground to Azaelea and scoped the worlds shortest
escalator, and I marveled at the number of people who would stand on
it.  We didn't do any real research, but of the 8 people we saw,
probably 6 stood on it.  The thing is 3 steps tall.  And it's going
down.  And it's on the right hand side of the stairs (in Japan,
traffic circulates on the left).  And below it, unavoidably, are
stairs.</p>

<p>During our adventure, I apparently kept checking my watch.  Hitomi
didn't freak, but she let me know it didn't make for relaxed chillin'
with me checking the time all the time.  Crud.  She was right; I
should have set my alarm and been done with it.</p>

<p>I knew I wouldn't have much time, but went to hang with her
anyway;... maybe probably should have just scheduled for another
time.</p>

<p>Once she called me on that, I quit checking, but I felt kinda
embarassed and it wasn't 100% okay afterward.  Ah well, lesson
probably learned.</p>

<p>We went to Kawasaki station where I grabbed some foodage and we
ate under the clock until it was time for me to go.</p>
