<p class=dream>I was helping support janette who had to direct two
projects: the YRUU kids needed to learn parts of three languages and
dance moves in one night.  Josephine needed to learn something even
more complicated, like some sort of magic stuff.  Well, not more
complicated, but using a different part of her mind.</p>


<p class=dream>I held janette's face and gave her kisses; "you can do
it; the good news is that this will be finished by tomorrow."</p>

<p class=dream>I went to where I was supposed to have my memory
returned, and we had to climb into these suspended top-loading washing
machines.  I stood in mine, and then The Hobbit climbed out of his and
into mine.  He knew he would lose his memories, but that I would gain
his power.  I felt very thankful for his gift.  I also wondered how/if
I would be able to use it well.</p>
