<p>I stayed conscious for nearly all of that.  Toward the end he was
just like, "awright; chill out here" so I did and kinda fell asleep,
but didn't miss anything, I'm sure.  The idea for this one was to
float up and down three times along with the Resonant Energy Balloon,
and I didn't feel any floating sensations <em>per se</em> but I did
visualize it to the best of my ability.  I'll do this one again, I'm
