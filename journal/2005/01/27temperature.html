<p>(Nurse) Jackie loaned me her thermometer and gave me four NUROFEN
tablets: ibuprofen 200 mg, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 30 mg.  Take
two tonight, one tomorrow morning and one tomorrow night.</p>

<p>I had to replay the sentence in my head to get it to stay.</p>

<p>Temperature = h.LE</p>

<p>Oh, that's upside down.  <a

bit high," she says.</p>

<p>She loaned me her thermometer to use it tomorrow.</p>
