<p>Just got back from slurping ramen at the shop near me-an-Jesse's
Gaba work in Jiyugaoka with Jesse and Takako.  We wandered around the
area a bit and I got a picture of myself down a small dark alley near
a sign for Kozue Bar, which is cool because one of my favorite
students at Gaba is named Kozue.  If she doesn't know of the bar
already, I'll be surprised, but I know she doesn't have a picture of
me next to the sign.</p>

<p>We went to Muji and they looked at couches and couch covers while I
wondered how Wende is doing cause Muji always reminds me of The
Container Store.</p>
