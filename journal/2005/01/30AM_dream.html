<p class=dream>"I don't want you to touch the body," I told her. "I
want you to tell me in _your professional opinion_ who the person is
and what is his state."</p>

<p class=dream>I was talking to my mom.</p>

<p class=dream>She had just arrived home.</p>

<p class=dream>I was blind and my boyfriend had been murdered, or so I
suspected.  I was as brilliant as Jubal in <em>Stranger in a Strange
Land</em> and Michael the Man from Mars was my lover.  He had been
planning to escape prison in a body bag, but the plan was for him to
be alive, not dead.</p>

<p class=dream>I had opened the bag and found him not responsive.  I
didn't touch him, but I couldn't see him.</p>

<p class=dream>"I want you to give your professional opinion.  Do not
touch the body."  I didn't want her to leave any traces for the
investigators to find.  "Is it Michael?"  (oh damn, I thought, I'm not
as smart as Jubal; I was supposed to not seed her mind with his name.
She was supposed to come up with that.  Well, she was my mom, she
would understand.)</p>

<p class=dream>"I'm going to use your statement as a professional
witness.  I'm going to write a statement tonight and in the morning
I'm going to take it to a judge and I'm going to have the murderer in
hand tomorrow night if at all possible."</p>

<p class=dream>I was quite sure of myself.  I was Jubal; who was I
not to believe myself?</p>

<p class=dream>We were in the courtyard of a cabin when I was waiting
for my mom to come home.  I told her I had bad news but that I need
her to stay calm.</p>

<p class=dream>We were walking outside and under a bridge in a well
lit open area as I told her my plan.</p>

<p class=dream>We arrived at the body bag, and I unzipped it.  The
body was white and dusty and my mom gasped a little to see it.  She
stepped down to have a better look and put her boot on the dust/sand
covering his chest.  I thought, "a little bootprint wouldn't kill him
would it?  They wouldn't suspect my mom, right?"</p>

<p class=dream>While she was looking at the body and I was thinking I
shouldn't have mentioned his name,</p>

<p>My heater beeped that it was going to quit.</p>

<p>Perfect timing for me to write down the dream.</p>
