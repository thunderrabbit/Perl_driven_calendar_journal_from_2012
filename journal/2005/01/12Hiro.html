<p>Hiro means noon in Japanese.</p>

<p>I'm headed to Kawasaki to meet Miki for lunch and movie.  Before I
decided what to wear, I made a test excursion on Mimibike to the
cleaners to pick up three shirts that I had dropped off with their
new-shirt creases in them.  I sure as heck don't want to iron them.
I got the shirts back, and they were folded as new shirts are
folded.  What a cruel practical joke.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's not why I'm writing.  I chose to wear just a hoodie
cause the weather is decent, but until I parked my bike in the 150
yen bike parking lot, I didnt' realize I should ride TJ bike to
Kawasaki!!!  Argh!</p>

<p>But, I'll get to read my book on the train.</p>
