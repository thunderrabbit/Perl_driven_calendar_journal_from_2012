<p>Before the movie, Hitomi and I bought foodage.</p>

<p>During the movie, we ate all but two bakery items and two cups of
pudding.</p>

<p>After the movie, we looked for a warm cheap place to sit and eat,
but couldn't find anything in the shopping mall.  Then I realized that
we could chill out in one of the photo booths in the game center!
Hahaha! And there's even an electrical outlet for me to plug in.</p>

<p>Good times in Tokyo.</p>
