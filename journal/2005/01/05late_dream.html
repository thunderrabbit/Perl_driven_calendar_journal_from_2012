Dear Cabin 5

There is no direct correlation between the activites in your
neighborhood with the consumption of mushrooms  for medicinal
purposes.  If this seems shocking, it should be.  We provide a
service to help relieve this problem.  However, we have not heard from
you regarding this matter.  Shall we remove you from our list?  Don't
wait too long.

<p class=dream>Someone like Jesse and another guy and I spent several
minutes crafting an email that we intended primarily as a meaningless
joke, but that could possibly be interpreted as real and could
possibly net us some money on the net.  We were in the backyard
underneath a canopy type thing and directing the letter to a neighbor
who lived caddycorner to us.  We basically finished the letter, and
the guy from whom we were borrowing bandwidth was in the booth next to
the canopy and he provided for us, as a service, some printouts, which
were basically printouts of versions of the document printed about
once every two minutes.</p>

<p class=dream>Oh crap; there will be no hiding our activities.  Maybe
we should rethink this thing.</p>

<p>After a previous dream, I woke up feeling wow;</p>

<p class=dream>that is really nice; we can start a large helpful
program this way.  janette can be there for support and this thing
could really go. I should write it down.</p>

<p>zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</p>

<p>I remembered the grandness of the dream while writing down the
previous dream and wrote this to try and recover it:</p>
