<p>I had been checking my watch because I didn't want to be late
meeting Ikumi before we went to see <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em>,
assistant directed by my friend Louise from Gaba, and performed by TIP
(Tokyo International Players) who have been performing in Tokyo for
over 100 years.</p>

<p>She texted me as I arrived in Musashikosugi and we met at St Mark
Cafe. Ended up well on time to leave; we were (just barely) first in
line at the theater.  Had to wait about 10 minutes for them to open
the doors.  Front row center seats; awesome.  (Well, in the front row
after the first two reserved rows.)</p>

<p>In the play, Madame de Tourvel, played by Alice Hackett, was
utterly believable to me.  That's a crummy word, believable, but for
me she just was exactly as she said; her acting was perfect.
Emotions, lines, crying, physical pain, emotional anguish, all
perfect.</p>

<p>The two lead actors (had far more complex lines, but) threw me off
with their frequent slips.  He would backtrack on words and one time
they were just so off; someone missed a line or said a wrong line or
something cause their lines didn't line up.</p>

<p>"if blah blah blah then I will not."</p>

<p>"You don't!"</p>

<p>They stood for 5 seconds in frozen silence working out how to
recover, as I just felt embarassed for them. Finally, he just walked
away from the position to the next point (during more silence) and
they started anew.  Oh man, it was rough.</p>

<p>I'm not saying what they do is easy or doable by anyone; I'm just
saying I was fully distracted by the hole.</p>

<p>At the end of the show, I asked Louise to get Alice so I could tell
her her performace was perfect.  I didn't tell the perfect performer
at the last performance (A Doll's House), so I wanted to be sure to
this time.</p>

<p>Michael, Charles, and Daniella (oh, and Jimmy, but he's also with
TIP) were there to see the play; they all work at Gaba as well.
Daniella had to zip home, but Ikumi and I joined Michael and Charles
and another Japanese woman whose name I never learned for drinks at an
Irish bar in Roppongi.</p>

<p>I was entertained to see "Fish and Chips" and "Bangers and Mash" on
the menu, for these items are in the menu in our level 2 book (of 7)
(actually 3 of 8 if you count 0), based in England.  Not in our book,
but on tonight's menu was "Irish Lawyer" for 1100 yen, so I got that,
specifically for the reason that I had no idea what it was, except
that it had a funny name for food.</p>

<p>Our food took a really long time to arrive, there was ice in my
first glass of orange juice, we got a cheeseburger that no one ordered
(nor ate, though he left it with us), but the bar had relatively few
smokers, so I would definitely go back.  (next time I'm in Roppongi
(almost never))</p>

<p>During our chow, I felt amazed to learn Charles has received a
university degree in chemistry in Japanese.  He embarked on his
chemistry career after a year of learning Japanese.  Holy cow.  I can
tell he has worked much harder to learn Japanese than I.  He modestly
says, "well, I had to."</p>

<p>We made it back just in time for last train.  In Nakameguro, I
decided it was high time to ask the guys what the cables were for
between the rails.  They were obviously not for tension (too flimsy),
and obviously not for signaling (not electrically closed).</p>

<p>Turns out, they are for signaling.  Those points that appear not to
be electrically closed, are in fact, connected.  The wires are
basically long antennas for the control station to talk to the train
guys via walkie talkie.  Kick ass.</p>

<p>While on the subject, I asked about some other cables, that ran
underneath the edge of the platform.  They were even less carefully
maintained; sometimes they were broken and sproining like guitar
strings.</p>

<p>They are to detect fallen items.  I didn't ask if they detect via
closing a circuit or by tension placed on the wires... next time I'll
do that.</p>

<p>On the train, Michael and I explained that we swat students (with
pants down) six times (three on each ass cheek) with a leather belt
for not doing homework.</p>
