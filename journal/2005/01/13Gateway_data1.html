<p>Once I actually lay down, I noticed my left nostril was working
moreso than my right.  They switched.  Really.</p>

<p>I fell asleep for parts of that one.  I kept having a persistent
dream type thing where someone was talking and I kept being distracted
by that.  I wonder now if that was the message, but I remember it as
being nonsense the person was saying.</p>

<p>For short periods, my brain would be well awake and my body asleep,
but they didn't last long.  A couple of times I felt vibrationally and
once I felt like I was floating, but not quite like what I would
expect as an astral projection.  Floating, but not in my room, more
like <em>out</em> (of this world).</p>
