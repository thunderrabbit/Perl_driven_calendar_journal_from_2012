<p>After work, I beat Jen to Kawasaki by waiting for the fast train.
Met Jen at the station while I was waiting for Hitomi to show up.  We
visited HMV cause it was so cold outside.  Didn't buy any CDs.</p>

<p>Hitomi and I went to Jonathan's to help her study; she's helped me
at no charge several times.</p>

<p>The lesson/chat was fun.  I was really enjoying it.. Didn't feel
like teaching... just.. talking. ish.</p>

<p>I was getting way tired, though, and a coin toss said I shoul go
with my gut and not invite her to my house; I need to sleeeeep.</p>
