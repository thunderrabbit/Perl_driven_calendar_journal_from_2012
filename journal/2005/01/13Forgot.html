<p>Crap.</p>

<p>I have complained bitterly about people forgetting or not keeping
their appointments.  <em>Get a calendar</em> I've said.</p>

<p>I have missed two appointments in the last week.  Sunday night and
this morning.</p>

<p>I can't say I forgot, well I can, but I can't use that as the
excuse; I continually forget every appointment; I use my calender as
my brain.  (<em>there</em>'s a good target for self growth..)  I
looked beyond that and see two things: 0) these were two appointments
that had been weekly, but were disrupted by the holidays. 1) I've
stopped properly using my calendar.</p>

<p>Both appointments were in there.  Oh, there's one other thing that
I daren't say on here.  I didn't really want to go to either one.
Sunday night I have to seem interested while speaking 1 mile per hour,
and Thursday morning is Chinese-English exchange.  (I've already blown
off one of my C-E exchange partners (S.W. who I would meet monthly in
Yoyogi), though in that case I did it by simply not scheduling another
meeting (after she cancelled ours) and when she texted me back to plan
another I was like, "I've basically lost interest."  She never wrote
back, though on a secret level, I wanted her to try to encourage
me.)</p>

<p>Oops; I almost got distracted.</p>

<p>Okay, as I look down the path that starts with "begin making your
life more fulfilling in Japan," my brain answers, <em>I don't want to
live forever in Japan.  I'm ready to go.</em></p>
