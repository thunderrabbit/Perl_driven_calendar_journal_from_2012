<p>Could possibly be considered feeling better, but it still hurts to
swallow or to muscularly extract snot from the back of my sinus.
Lungs are clear; right nostril is clear; poo is solid.  Still
headachey.  I keep developing a pool of saliva in my mouth because I
won't swallow automatically; my brain has simply turned off that
mechanism; it hurts too much.</p>

<p>I took a shower, just basking in the hot water (didn't actually
wash with soap, just rinsed).  Afterward Richard fixed me a cup of
green tea.  Lovely.</p>

<p>Read in the paper that some leaders in Iraq are telling citizens
that they will burn in hell if they don't vote.  Other leaders in Iraq
are saying we will kill you and your family if you vote.</p>

<p>What a nightmare.</p>
