<p>Watched a bit of a soft porn movie (that Jen turned on and then
left to go sleep) with the guys remaining in the room.  It highlighted
a lot of what I don't like about Japan.  From what I could understand
of the Japanese, a woman was hot and heavy with a guy in bed and then
she chose not to continue.  He got mad and sabotaged their ship (then
jumped overboard).  The remaining three passengers (including a woman)
got pissy at her for not putting out.  In fact, the woman led the
charge.  Horrible!  To put in my head anger if another person says no
to sex?  What an awful message!</p>
