<p class=date>early</p>

<p class=dream>Rene, our apartment manager, had removed some old trees
from the property and left them, along with the shovel and post hole
digger, leaning against a fence next to a stream or something.  I
realized I could use them for my project, so I was carrying the
shovel, post hole digger and two gnarled long stump things through a
passenger train, and the guys who were criscrossed across the walkway
straightened up so I could crawl under them except for the last guy so
I just kinda plowed through him.</p>

<p class=date>5:57am JST Saturday 08 January 2005</p>

<p class=dream>I was in the back room of an apartment building and I
heard some loud music coming from outside; someone from next door was
coming home late, drunk.  The guy came home late in an old beat up car
with white paint paintbrushed onto it and I considered ducking down so
he wouldn't see me and so I wouldn't have to interact with him, but I
decided not to and he saw me and decided to interact with me.  He had
a huge bag of catfood and tried to pour it into my window, but I
closed the window and he poured the cat food into the screen part next
to the window and I was like, "don't do that" and he did it again so I
was like, "I'm going to come outside and we'll discuss this," and I
locked all the windows and the last window was unexpectedly a door so
I went outside before I was ready exactly, but I was okay and I kinda
grabbed his face and knocked off his glasses as he tried to pour
catfood into the door.  I stopped his efforts and bent down to pick up
his glasses. Then I grabbed him by the ankle and lifted him
up..  "Listen," I said, " I know how important your glasses are; I
won't hurt them.  I know how drunk you are now, and I know how sorry
you're going to be in the morning for having done something so
foolish.  So stop it now."</p>

<p class=dream>He was more defiant than I thought he would be; he was
like, "no; I won't stop it."  I thought he would give up immediately,
so I tossed him carefully onto the ground and prepared for more direct
battle.</p>

<p class=dream>Just at that time a guy came up who claimed he used to
live in the building.  "When did you live here?" I asked.  "1974," he
said, "September."  I couldn't confirm that date nor disconfirm it,
but it could have been true so he asked me if that was his old room
and if he could move back into the apartment.  I said he would have to
talk to the owners who happened to be downstairs in the next scene,
Arnold and Rosanene Barr played by John Goodman and Roseanne Barr,
Arnold, whatever, anyway they were on the couch doing a little comedy
bit where she was like "yeah we want you to live here and we want you
to turn the place into a resort" and Tom was like, "no, we don't want
you to turn the place into a resort; I want a quote first on how much
it will cost," so Roseanne made some phone calls and I woke up cause
it was so frikkin cold in my room.</p>

<p class=dream>I guessed it was about 8 degrees.</p>

<p class=dream>I turned on the heater, but I couldn't tell how cold it
was; for some reason it was in a different mode than temperature
telling mode.  It seemed to already be on.  I turned it off and a
significant amount of unburned kerosene puffed out in a cloud.  I went
back to the window and opened it to let the smoke out and I noticed
one window was already open!  No wonder it was so cold!  The smoke
trailed out in a stream out into the night air.</p>

<p>Then I woke up cause it was so frikken cold.</p>

<p>It was 13 degrees, according to the heater, which was off, and
working properly.</p>
