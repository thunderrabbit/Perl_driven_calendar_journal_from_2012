<p class=dream>Had a new job that was in Texas, but not quite the
same. I came to work and had forgotten my badge, but I knew I'd be
able to talk my way in, even though I was new.</p>


<p class=dream>Wende was there, arranging a party that she had planned
while she was away. She was proud of me and even gave me a platonic
smooch on the lips, but with a dramatic pucker and definitely no
tongue.  She was drawing a map on the chalk board and couldn't quite
remember the order of all the streets in the neighborhood, so I
offered to look them up online; the map I had in my book wasn't
detailed enough, and there were many computers on the array of tables
in the room.</p>
