<p>And I don't particularly mean that in a good way.  Ironic that it
all started with me sending Hitomi an email basically, "can you
please come get your stuff out of my room?"</p>

<p>She invited me to meet her friends, and gave me directions that I
was actually basically able to read.  And, even though I couldn't
read all of them, I was able to follow all of them.</p>

<p>The second to last stop was Shinbashi, which I didn't recognize
until I was walking through the station; this is the end of the line
for the shuttle train that goes to Odaiba!  cool!  It was a neat
experience to recognize where I was.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Turns out Hitomi et.al. were in a hotel.  I offered Roboyaki that I
had cooked that evening as we watched TV and ate whatever food they
had brought as well.  Spoke a fair amount of Japanese and had pretty
much a good time.  Watched the last 3/4ths of Mulholland Drive, and
they agreed that it's impossible to understand.</p>

<p>Conked out next to Hitomi and she was like, "hey man why didn't
you invite me to Shoko's show?"</p>

<p>words words words</p>

<p>At 4:33am, I was furious and just wanted to leave.  The trains
would start in 27 minutes and the timing was perfect but
somefuckinghow her desperately sad eyes pleading me not go and my
tired state kept me there.</p>

<p>I didn't cuddle with her.</p>

<p>Finally I did sleep.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Woke up feeling better (many feelings are better than furious) and
we talked a bit.</p>

<p>Basically she is getting freaked that I'm leaving, and I'm getting
freaked that she is holding on so hard.  Just stop.</p>

<p>Stayed until noon thirty, not even really having a good time.  Why?</p>

<p>Why so stupidly codependent?</p>
