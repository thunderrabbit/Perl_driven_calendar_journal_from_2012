<p>I'm happy.  I'm genki.  I remember vocabulary easily.  I live in a
place with loving friends.  I help people in the world.  I am
creating a spiritual revolution.</p>

<p>I stayed alert for nearly all of that one.  Very nice.  I can sense
a difference between Focus 10 and Focus 12.</p>

<p>I am an infinite being living inside this animal body.  By taking
care of the animal, I am doing good for the world.</p>
