<p class=dream>Driving a car back to my dad's house, except I had very
little traction and very bad brakes.  There was some pedestrian
congestion near 249 just coming into his area and I tried to stop but
had to veer right to get out of a skid.  I figured out how to handle
it but then Dude was in the back set and he was like, "hey, excuse
me!" to a cop and I was like, "dude, shut up!" cause I knew the lights
on the car weren't working properly, and I didn't want a ticket.  The
cop didn't hear Dude, which was good, but Dude apparently didn't hear
me, so he asked again.  I was like, "Dude! stop!" and finally, after
Dude got the cop's attention, he paid attention to me so I was like,
"we are cool; get rid of him; just ask him to help guide the
pedestrians out of our way."</p>

<p class=dream>Dude did this, and it worked out alright.  I was able
to drive really slowly on the slick pavement apparently due to the
pedestrians, including a faceless tall old hairy guy who I only saw
from the back, and who was completely oblivious to my driving behind
him.</p>

<p class=dream>Finally we got past all that, and I drove to the corner
and stopped the car completely by putting my hand out and pushing back
against the very useful stop sign.  I didn't come to a complete stop
before the sign, and I think one of the cops noticed as I was turning
right and it became a race to get my slippery sliding car with trailer
in the back to my dad's house safely before the cop could catch me.  I
turned left at the next T intersection and then left again on that
there road that crosses over and realized we were not going to make
it.  There was some new construction on the left, so I pulled in to
that driveway and parked in a parking space, being sure to keep the
car between the white painted lines of the parking space.</p>

<p class=dream>The trailer was covered with a blue tarp and had two
blue strips of blue tarp hanging on either side of the trailer.  I was
able to stop the vehicle only by going up a slight incline and then
backward down into the parking space, whcih meant the strips were
arranged in a way that would prove we had rolled backwards into the
parkng spce, which would prove we had overshot it, which could prove
we had bad brakes, so I went backwards out of the parking space and
then forwards back into the parking space to make sure the blue strips
would be arranged the right way.</p>

<p class=dream>I wondered if there were other ways the cops could
figure out what happened.  I guessed they could look for plastic
particles ground onto the parking lot from when I used my shoe to stop
and they'd be able towork out my tread marks, etc.  But I decided that
would cost them more than it would cost me for the ticket, so
ultimately, I would win even if they did give me a ticket.</p>

<p>I woke up wondering if this was mathematically sound logic.</p>
