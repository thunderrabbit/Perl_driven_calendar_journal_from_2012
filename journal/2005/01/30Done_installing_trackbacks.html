<p>Okay, that was relatively painless.  To simplify things, I did have
to change the permalinks of all my entries a very little bit.  In the
past, I had appended a number to the name of the entries, which would
have uniquely identified them in case I had the same name entry but
different extension.  But I don't think I ever had that situation, so
the unique identifier was pretty much superfluous.  When I added the
ability to view slices of my journal, those identifiers changed
depending on what slice was being viewed.  When I added the
trackbacks, the permalinks would have been all flocked up.  Even at
the time I had created the unique IDs, they would be reshuffled if I
added an entry between two existing entries.</p>

<p>So I'm cutting my losses and removing the unique ID.</p>

<p>And now I'm going to sleep again.</p>

<p>ps: From here, I have no way of testing the auto-discovery of
trackback URIs.  If you can do it, feel free to let me know.</p>
