<p>Before the movie, I bought a Winne The Pooh USB 128 meg memory
stick for 2900 yen.  1000 yen was for the character.  I figured if I
was going to just try the memory stick out as a product, I might as
well get something cute for my money.  If I like it and use it (and
see a need for more memory), I'll buy a 1 gig version.  (though they
don't have any that size with Pooh on it yet).</p>

<p>Oh, on the wall with the USB memory cards, they had one that
proudly boasted 0 Meg.  WTF?  Turns out it's some kind of
take-yer-email-with-you product from <a
href="http://sastik.com/">sastik.com</a>.  If it worked on OS X, I
woulda bought it, just to know what cheap new things are on the
market.  Maybe it's cool.</p>

<p>Woah!  Hitomi just checked the OS, and it's not only limited to
Windows, but limited to <em>Windows 2000/XP (Japanese Only)</em>.
Must be a brand new product.</p>
