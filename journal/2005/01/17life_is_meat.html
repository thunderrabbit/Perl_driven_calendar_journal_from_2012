<p><a href="http://artist.amazon.com/lifeismeat">Life Is Meat</a> is
the name of an artist/band/cool guy whose CD I reviewed at KTRU back
in the day.  When Seth and I were having dinner the other night, we
shared favorite artists, and I mentioned Life Is Meat.</p>

<p>At that time, I was unable to find a link to his music online.
But, <em>amazingly</em>, he happened to do a google search, found the
entry and emailed me, within like a week of when I wrote the
entry!</p>

<p>One of the coolest things was the CDs he made were hand painted
and given away *free*.</p>

<p>Likewise, the .mp3s are available free <a
href="http://artist.amazon.com/lifeismeat">online</a>.  Awright.</p>

<p>Here is my review of the CD _Discreet Meat_.</p>

//+, //, //-, /+, /, -

 1.  -  0:07 "code"   this is a data portion of the CD; it contains the letter 
        from Chris Connell and the .WRK files mentioned therein.  
        Harmless static if you play it.
 2. //- 5:20 "demo" squeaky loopy, some static, some vox samples, synth drums
 3. //- 7:27 "doomed" fuller sound loopy, choppy, female vox, speeds up, burpy, 
        crashy - breaks at <1:26> and revisits the beginning with big chords
 4. //  6:11 "average"  sample old movie sndtrck, loopy vox of ad and pysch stuff
 5. //  7:28 "experiment" buzzy beats, video game music, static grinds and beats
        at &lt;1:28> goes minimalist with grind beats
 6. //  7:05 "suck" nice organ, + beats, + snare, alt. grindy feedback chords w/ beats
 7. //+ 7:51 "big" big slow sound, plodding beats; picks up to spiral loopy beats
 8. /+  5:22 "bergeron" AFTER 10 big windup with 2 questionable samples looped:
        "maybe we should just kill everybody" "don't fuck with the older people" et.al.
 9. //+ 4:41 "gra" 40 seconds buzz with vox, then various drums 210 bps until end
10. //  5:43 "call used" experimental beats mixed with samples-n-vox, phat drone beats
        mixed after <1:50>,  a bantha growl from StarWars (?) ends track
11. /+  4:50 "strife" slow heavy grindy beats that slowly speed up throughout track
12. //  5:05 "title cut" hollow spooky with opera vox and military radio sample, 
        fast beats sneak in from background, song ends just as "normal" beats come in.

Greetings,

   This is my first CD, which has been a good two years in the making. One
would think that making a perfect .WAV file and burning a flawless CD would
have been a tad simpler, but that was not the case. Hopefully you did not
pay for this, as of this writing I have no intension of charging for this.
I might charge for postage if I distribute it nationally. 
   In case you haven't noticed, there are also .WRK files ( native CAKEWALK 
MIDI files ) on the CD-ROM portion of the CD. Feel free to do with them what   
you may. This whole CD is public domain, just don't sue me for that which
I do not profit. I actually encourage this CD to be copied and dispersed
throughout the land. 
   If for some bizarre reason one seeks correspondence, I can be reached at
the address elsewhere on this CD.
   I would like to thank the people I like and think really bad things about
the people who choose to be unlikable.
