<p>Hitomi called me and was like "I read your journal; you don't
understand me; don't write about me in your journal; it would be okay
if no one else could read it."</p>

<p>And I'm like, "if you don't want to be in my journal, don't be in
my life."</p>

<p>We hung up and I texted her to cancel our Hokkaido trip (this
brings me some sadness, but I can go a different year, I'm sure) and
get her stuff out of my room tonight and I will never meet her
again.</p>
