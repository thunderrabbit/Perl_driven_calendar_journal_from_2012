<p>I've done significant work on cleaning my room today.  Put my futon
away and have nearly filled a box to send back home, with notes on who
gets what.  This is me beginning the process of leaving Japan.</p>

<p>I've *got* to write a SOML and send it to my peeps soon.</p>

<p>Right now, I've got to eat.</p>
