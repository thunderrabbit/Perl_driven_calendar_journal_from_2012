<p class=dream>Drove from NJ to somewhere.  Was lost, trying to find
my way home.  I didn't feel comfortable asking anyone; my Japanese
experience had made me shy.  Then I realized this was a different
area, and they spoke my language here.</p>

<p class=dream>I talked to someone who told me to wait here for
someone who knew where I could sleep.  I was sitting on a chair in
front of some kids who were ignoring me as the new strange guy, but
then I started relaxing and acting a bit silly so they liked me.</p>

<p class=dream>Jen came looking for me to make sure I was okay, but
then it was time to parade all the kids out in three different groups
to go caroling.  They had a tradition of singing in the street, even
though it wasn't a holiday season.  So many people were part of this,
and it was beautiful and moved me to tears; I wanted to be a part of
it.</p>

<p class=dream>The music included long hovering tones, extended like
only an angelic choir could achieve.</p>

<p>I woke up when they stopped abruptly.  Their music was a guy
cutting through tile in the construction across the street.</p>
