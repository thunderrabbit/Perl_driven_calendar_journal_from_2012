<p>This is just ridiculous.  My throat is really swollen super hurts
to swallow, but everything else is fine.  Okay, relatively fine.  My
head hurts a bit, and my spine wants to stretch in strange ways, but
my sinuses are (as) fine (as normal), and my lungs are clear.</p>

<p>wtf is up with my throat?</p>
