<p class=dream>I was at Amy Leyenberger's house and Mikey and someone
else came late and we asked if Amy was still awake, and she wasn't but
she got up and then her dad got up and he was really mad that we had
come over so late, and I had been having trouble sleeping, so I just
went to bed as he was ranting around; Jen had seen that I wanted to
say something, but she was like, "don't bother" so I went back to bed
and Olivia and Aiko came in and they were being silly as usual and I
was being flirtatious with Olivia, but she was having none of it and
eventually they left the room and I was able to get some sleep.</p>

<p class=dream>I worked for GoogleLabs.  I was on a business trip
somewhere and coming back, or leaving, but I was in a big office
building looking for the right place to go to get food after most food
places were closed.  I was in Japan, and asked the woman in Japanese
what time they werould be open today and she said they were closed for
the day.  Fair enough.  Went to the google cafeteria and on the way
was approached by some guys who were acting childish though they were
officially businessmen; they were asking me stupid questions like what
I was doing and why I wasn't drinking.  They were playing marbles and
drinking and I wasn't interested in drinking so I didn't play marbles
with them, though they knew I liked to play marbles.  Just not with
drunk people.  So I went past them and saw this crazy airplane thing
that was outside.  It had the tail end of an airplane but was actually
a helicopter / jet hybrid that looked like a guppy or something with
really big turbine engines on each side of its then fuselage, but
there were guys inside the body who had lawn mowing equipment; this
was the GoogleLabsLawnService!  I was with a guy and we didn't know if
this was a military craft or what; would they be upset we were
watching (and I was taking pictures with my book?)</p>

<p class=dream>We left that area and I asked for orange juice and
there was a message from the president or someone asking if anyone
esle wanted orange juice for they often had problems wehre they would
run out of orange juice, but this wuln't happen again cause they had
hired a new guy whose motto was something like breakfast is the most
important part of anyone's day.</p>
