<p>Came home and took the hinges off Noriko's door to get it open for
her.  Credit cards in the lock didn't work.  Then we watched _Bourne
Supremacy_ on the VHS tape that Jesse had.  Someone copied a DVD to
the tape.  "Do you object to piracy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."  "I mean, yeah, why?"</p>

<p>Good movie.  I was really upset to see his girl from the first
movie die.  Noriko agreed that he was really smart.  I think my
favorite scene was of the other agent turning around and pointing the
gun back at him, especially the line, "yeah I thought it was a little
light."</p>

<p>I'm glad he didn't kill Nicky, who I realize looks *a lot* like
beautiful Sally in Cali.</p>

<p>I was surprised when I found out whodunnit!</p>
