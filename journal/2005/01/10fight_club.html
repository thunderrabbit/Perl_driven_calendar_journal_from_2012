<p>Watched Fight Club tonight just to see if I agree with my original
impression that it's not that great.  I agree that it has some good
social commentary, but I take *great* offense at it trying to say "oh
hey, they were the same guy," which is just ridiculous.  The only
character for which they could have been the same guy is the girl.
There are so so many other scenes where they couldn't have been the
same guy that it's just offensive to suggest that I ignore such
details and just enjoy the movie.</p>
