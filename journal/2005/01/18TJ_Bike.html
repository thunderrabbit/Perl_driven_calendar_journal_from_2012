<p>Rode TJ Bike to work today, and it was pretty much no problem.  By
not riding quickly, I remained relaxed and just got here in what
seemed like a short time.  I wonder how all that works.  Ride slowly
and arrive quickly.</p>

<p>I was able to find a parking spot pretty close to where I wanted.
Good deal.  I wonder how cold it will be on the way back.</p>
