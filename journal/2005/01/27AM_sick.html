<p>Ugh.  I'm sick.  Headache and sore throat that I felt a bit last
night but went to the movie anyway.  Crap.</p>

<p>I'm gonna hafto cancel both my students today.</p>

<p>I cooked chicken noodle soup last night, with thanks to janette
for teaching me how.  I gargled salt water this morning, with thanks
to my dad for teaching me how.</p>

<p>I did a singing gargling of 2 Unlimited's "Twilight Zone" (I
think), though I doubt many people could have recognized the song.</p>
