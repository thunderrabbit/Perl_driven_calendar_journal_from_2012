<p>I think I will go to one of the tsunami decimated areas in March.
I imagine there will be plenty of work still to be done.  In the past,
I have felt... ooky about not going to help when fucked up things have
happened.  Of course I recognize that I'm not going now, but there is
.....  what is it..? this rule that says my committment to work is
more important.  Beneath that is a fear around money, that if I don't
keep my word, then I'll lose the possibility of coming back, etc..</p>

<p>There is also an aspect of saying bye to my peeps and my stuff;
this is a similar issue to what I went through when I left my
apartment in Houston.</p>

<p>(Jen points out that there's also a likelihood that if I (she) went
*now*, we would just be an annoyance: more people who need food.)</p>

<p>Okay, so let's plan this:</p>

<p>I'll leave on 26 March, Colleen's birthday and two years to the
day that I left Dallas for Japan.</p>

<p>I need to get rid of my junk: ship some stuff back to the US (to
janette and Maggie, probably), toss a lot and give away the rest
locally.</p>

<p>There are four knotboards in my room; a couple of them are pretty
big.  I'd like to sell those via an online auction.  I should just
hook that shit up and quit worrying about maximizing my profit.</p>

<p>There are lots of letters and shit that I want to keep, but will
probably never process.</p>

<p>I should also</p>

<p>oops I forgot what I was going to say.</p>
