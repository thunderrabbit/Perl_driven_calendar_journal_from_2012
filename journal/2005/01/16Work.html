<p>Work was easy today.  Zero quintark exchanges.</p>

<p>Didn't just chill inside all day, though; we did a lot of data
entry.  I entered three days worth of data today.  Jen entered two;
she still had to do her regular work.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this data input, I had a realllllly nice set
of brainwaves.  OM was like, "blah blah blah" and I didn't understand
what he was trying to say nor expecting me to do, etc.</p>

<p>I <em>noticed</em> myself begin to feel shame.  Like.. I mean short
term memory flutters about quite quickly.  I basically never notice my
emotional changes in realtime, much less so quickly that the emotional
feeling before-shame and after-shame hadn't left short term memory
when I noticed it.  Awesome.</p>

<p>I caught it and was like, "wait-a-minute! I don't need to feel
this!" and released it.  Bang. happy.</p>
