<p>Nice.  I definitely stayed awake for all of that.  I liked that
exercise more than I thought I might.  I was aware of my breathing,
and wondered if it was sleep breathing; my body was definitely as
good as asleep.  The volume was on pretty high.  We only hung out in
Focus 10, not going to Focus 12.</p>

<p>I'm excited about new possibilities.</p>
