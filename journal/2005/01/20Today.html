<p>Was woken up by Riho; I forgot our lesson again.  Went over there
and chatted a bit and helped her with pronunciation of English words.
I don't want to study Chinese right now, so it's no longer an
exchange, but just me giving her a couple free lessons cause I forgot
twice.  Last week she called me and I was like, "ferget it," and
didn't go.</p>

<p>I don't know if she will pay me for lessons after next lesson; it
seems weird to switch from language exchange to money exchange, but
hey.</p>

<p>Came back home and studied a bit, but primarily took a phat nap
and then chatted on AIM with Fred and worked on my days_old counter;
he gave me some ideas on how to add predictive calculations.  I've
written a basic version of that interface, but it doesn't do the
calculations yet.</p>

<p>Right now I'm at Starbucks in Shibuya waiting for Takako for our
lesson.  I only had about 150 yen so I couldn't buy a drink, but they
still let me come in and take up a chair even though they are crowded.
oops.  Sorry, Starbucks, but I'm sure you can afford it.</p>

<p>I'll sketch out the logic for the date calculator:</p>

<pre>

if ($predict = 'predict' paramter) {
    $addYears = trunc($predict / $avg_num_days_in_a_year);
    $monthsremain = $predict % $avg_num_days_in_a_year;

    $addMonths = trunc ($remain * $avg_num_days_in_a_month);
    $daysremain = $months_remain % (crap this is not going to work);
    # I need to have a better way to get the quotient and divisor
    # if that is what they are called.

    $guess_End_Date = $startDate + $daysremain;
}
</pre>

<p>Hmmmm. That's getting messy.  I'm going to try a different way.</p>

<pre>

# $predict_days is the days old date they want to know
if ($predict_days = 'predict' paramter) {  

    $guessDate = $startDate   # start guessing here

    while ($predict_days > $daysInYear($guessYear + 1)) {
	$predict_days -= $daysInYear($guessYear + 1);
	$guessYear += 1;
    }
    while ($predict_days > $daysInMonth($guessMonth + 1)) {
	$predict_days -= $daysInMonth($guessMonth + 1);
	$guessMonth += 1;
    }
    $guessDate += $predict_days;
}
</pre>

<p>Oooh; I think that will work, and it's way cleaner.  And probably
faster!</p>

<p>Where is Takako????</p>

<p>Fuckfuckfuck fuck.  I didn't write down in my book that she
couldn't meet today. Crap. Forgot a lesson that was scheduled, and
went to a lesson that was not.</p>
