<p>This is a non Japanese asian movie that had been dubbed over with
Japanese voice actors.  The action included a ton of CGI stuff, some
of which was weak, though most was pretty good.</p>

<p>I understood the vague overview of the plot; some good guys with
various forms of fighting and some bad guys with axes were fighting
and then a really bad-ass fighter fought a badder-ass fighter and at
the end the bad-ass fighter cried.  Plus a love story thrown in and a
woman who could kung fu fight like a demon, but whose real power was
to suck in a deep breath (burning through the entire length of one of
her perpetually dangling cigarettes) and then screaming a banshee
scream that killed the flying demons from hell, among other
things.</p>

<p>The movie has plenty of blood, plenty of funny parts, and might be
a lot better for people who can understand the dialogue.</p>
