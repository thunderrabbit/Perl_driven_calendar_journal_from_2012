<p>That was cool, but not as awesome as the first one.  Good tool,
though, I imagine.  I was a bit more prone to dreaming and losing the
control of what my visualizations were visualizing;</p>

<p class=dream>I was at janette's house walking up from the back
alley into the back yard.  A gate had been built there.</p>

<p>I guess that's why they made us get up between exercises at the
Monroe Institute; to get us fully awake between them.</p>
