<p>I took the next tablet that Jackie suggested; swallowing hurts
like a pinecone.</p>

<p>Wrote a journal entry in my mind about taking a long shower.  I
actually did take the shower, but then nearly fell asleep not having
written this awesome entry.</p>

<p>Brain is hot.  Maybe my shower was too hot.  I hope I live.</p>
