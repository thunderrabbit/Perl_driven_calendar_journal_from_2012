<p class=dream>We were following verbal directions to find a secret
room where we would be able to learn what to do next.  We had to go
down the left side of a river or little stream that led to a big river
and then just before it dumped into the big river, go right across the
little river.  I helped my friend across the river and then we had to
go up along the river after crossing it.  We were in a hallway on the
left side and then went left into an apartemtnt room.</p>

<p class=dream>The room was dark and cluttered, like a secret room
should be.  There was ample ample pudding in the refrigerater, just
sitting in large iceberg lettuce sized globs.  She grabbed a handful
using both hands so we could romantically eat pudding together in the
safety of this secret apartment.  Went into the next room and found a
large plate glass window on the opposite wall through which we had a
fanastic view overlooking the city and the larger river.</p>

<p class=dream>Someone was in the large bed to my left and she was
quiet until my friend started talking.  Then the girl on the bed was
like, "don't talk [so loudly]."  I noticed different colored halves of
crayons on the floor.</p>

<p class=dream>The girl was sad, and I could see that clearly.  She
was surprised I could tell; she nearly didn't know what she was
feeling.  She began to tell her story and I rubbed her back, but I
could feel her pulling away; she didn't want physical contact.</p>

<p class=dream>I watched as in a movie she told us how she was driving
along the street and saw the bad guy walking along the street with a
bell and rosary beads.  She saw the guy with the bell as she came to
the railroad track intersection near the front of Memorial Chase.  The
camera was panning along the street, and we were watching it on TV
with Frank, my ex roommate, and I noted how different it must be; he
is seeing this street for the first time. I tried to see it from their
point of view of having no idea, while I know every inch of it
exactly.</p>

<p class=dream>Went into the movie and there was a guy carring a
flexible large flat thing in a box that made me think it was one of
the knotboards like those that I've got in my room, though I knew it
wasn't one of mine.</p>

<p class=dream>The badguy with the bell came up to us surprisingly
fast for having been walking and he slipped the gun into my pocket for
some reason.  He asked me to hit hit him and I was like "no way"
feeling great fear that he would pummel me if I tried.  I wondered if
I could do kung fu like Roscoe.</p>

<p class=dream>I pulled out the gun and found out it was only a tape
measure, and a small one at that.  I was screwed, so I was looking
down at the ground for a cetain type of rock that he was asking for,
but actually I was searcing for a big one something to kill him with.
I could only find a large hunk of dried but slightly decayed wood like
a small part of a log or fence post and hit him with it repeatedly
until he was down on the ground.</p>

<p class=dream>He didn't die from the blows, and he asked me
specifically why I hit him and I was like, "I just wanted you to be
knocked out and I didn't want to hurt you but I was required to do
this.." and I was crying and he asked me more details, "well if you
were trying not to hurt me, why did you hit me with the hard end of
the wood?" etc, and I didn't have good answers for those questions.
But he seemed to forgive me and even befriend me.  It had been a test
of sorts.</p>

<p class=dream>Went into the movie theater towatching the movie I had
already seen and about 10 percent of the people in the audience were
smoking.  I found it so that such a small percentage could ruin it for
so many people.  There was nowhere I could sit away from it all.  Once
I reached the front of the seats I turned around and bitterly
complained "fucking stinking fucks," and I realized I was no longer in
Japan; they could understand me.  So I tweaked it a bit; "I mean the
cigarettes," (and by "the cigarettes," I mean <b>you</b>)</p>

<p class=dream>I walked up to where a guy had some surveillance stuff
in the back of the room and a cellphone.  I was like, "hey man there
are tons of people smoking though it's not allowed," and just as he
was using his night goggles to verify my claim, a lot of the audience
started to exit cause on screen was some "no smoking" ads.  The guy
told them as well.</p>

<p class=dream>A woman complained back at him; "if there's no smoking
allowed, why is there a display handing out cigarettes near the
entrance to the theater?"  I had to admit that was a good question,
and could nearly see their side, but I really wanted the fresh
air.</p>

<p class=dream>As we filtered back in, I met a cute black girl and her
friend and told the one girl I had already seen the movie they were
asking about before.  Her friend was like, "why are you only talking
to her?  do you have alterior motives?"</p>

<p class=dream>I was like "no I'll flirt with you too; I was just
telling her I had seen the movie you were talking about." But I
couldn't remember what I was just staying or what movie it was, but
started with an E.  Not Elvis and not Eminem.</p>

<p class=dream>I sat by the one girl and noted she was too young for
me, and she was quite block and I knew I was being racist, but knew
that though I felt sexual attraction, I knew I couldn't get over the
stigma of dating a black woman, so I knew I shouldn't even get started
with her.</p>

<p class=dream>We were watching the movie and it was completely
different from what I expected.</p>

<p class=dream>In the movie, a girl was learning how to dance with a
partner skating behind her, so she had to like learn to sit on a
barrel while she skated.  She had someone devise a bicycle that was
powered by shoving both feet forward at once and then back again.
Nearly straight front and back and she had to do this on a flat
surface, while her partner on a similar bike had to do a loop that
way.</p>

<p class=dream>Then a group of friends were exchanging
gifts. Sometimes the gifts were 'you owe me money,' sometimes high
price sometimes very low price save for sentimental value.  One guy
was like "you owe me money" to his friend, but actually he was going
to use it to buy her someing good.</p>

<p class=dream>The very last person was Ozzy Osborne when he was young
and I had to pee but waited in case he said somehing about me.</p>

<p class=dream>He said "I'll come with pink dildos for fingernails and
wear my hair back in a pitchfork..." and I got up cause I had to pee
and he obviously had no gift for me.</p>

<p>Then I wrote notes with my eyes closed before I went to pee and
forgot most of the dream.  15 minutes of need-to-pee agony writing
the notes, so I'll include them below:
