<p>Today I seem to be stuck in my room with a pile of laundry asking
to be done, but me not wanting to do it because it seems a useless
task since we are not blessed with hot water in our laundry machines.
For over a year, I've washed my clothes only in cold water.  (A couple
of times in Bell Wistaria I used the shower hose to fill the laundry
machine, but there's no hot water easily available at these laundry
machines.  I could get a couple of pots and do it that way.  I think
I'll do that.</p>

<p>Before writing the above paragraph, I had been stuck just eating
chocolate and wanting to orgasm; my two drugs.  MMmmmmm.</p>
