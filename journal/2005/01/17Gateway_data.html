<p>I fell asleep for a lot of that.  I nearly slept through the wakeup
tone at the end, but it got me up.  During the beginning of the
exercise I was distracted by dream images and other ideas about
working for Monroe Institute doing research for them.  I noted I
wasn't carefully following the beginning instructions; it's like I
have my own method of just falling 'alseep' to Focus 10, ignoring the
resonant energy balloon and the spoken affirmation.</p>
