<p class=dream>I needed to go to a train station on a shinkansen line,
but I hadn't been to the station in a while so I didn't remember its
namee, but I remembered it was south of where I was at the time and I
thought it was the second such station.  I told the girl "south" in
english and ni ban me in Japanese (second).</p>

<p class=dream>She gave me the ticket and I got on the train just in
time and then it started going the wrong direction. Or I had gotten on
the wrong train.  I was stuck, but I was ahead of schedule, so I
figured I could just enjoy the ride</p>

<p class=dream>I looked around my car (I was alone in it) and found
there was a waterbed and other beds, but I figured they would cost
more if I used them.  So I just sat on the edge of the bed and looked
out through the front of the train, and I felt nervous when other
shinkansens were manuevering so close to ours, looking like they were
going to crash.  They didn't but then something even scarier happened,
as our train went off its tracks!  But it kept traveling.  The
announcer announced (In English) that due to the snow storm, there
were a lot of tracks we couldn't use.  The workers were clearing this
section as we went across it; they were mowing grass and using candles
to melt snow and all kinds of stuff.  As we were approaching a guy who
had been shoveling snow into a runway of sorts, he placed a rocket on
it just in time to launch it before we careened through. I could hear
the rocket hitting the side of the shinkansen.  It was scary but
fun.</p>
