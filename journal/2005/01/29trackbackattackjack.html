<p>Okay, that was a big blip in time.  I had been reading about
trackbacks and I'm not sure that I'm interested in using them on my
site.  I might just give it a bit of a shot to see what the big fuss
is about.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll do it on this entry, as a test.</p>

<a
href="http://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/tb.cgi?__mode=list&tb_id=2005/01/29trackbackattackjack.html"
onclick="window.open(this.href, 'trackback',
'width=480,height=480,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'); return
false"><b>Test</b> TrackBack</a>

<p>I think I see what the problem is.  To make this work, I'd have to
smurf tb.cgi to handle my site's version of trackbackID.</p>

<p class=date>11:45pm</p>

<p>Aha!  I didn't have to smurf that at all.  I'll change the code back.</p>

<p class=date>12:28am</p>

<p>Yawn.</p>

<p>I don't understand why my trackback thing pops up a window *and*
changes the main page, while this other guy's trackback thing only
pops up the window.  That's the functionality I want.  I'm getting
tired though...</p>

<p class=date>12:34am</p>

<p>Okay; I don't see it.  I gots to go to bed.</p>
