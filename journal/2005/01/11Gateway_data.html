<p>Nice.  Had a bit of an idea about floating during that experience.
I was more on the sleeping side of Focus 10, but still a bit awake.  I
was in Focus 10 mode really quickly and completely forgot to do the
reball and the affirmation until he thought we were in Focus 10 mode.
I did those really quickly and my tired dreamy state allowed me to be
more open to the idea of floating.</p>

<p>I could barely hold on to consciousness as we were floating up and
down, and near the end I was definitely less awake than awake, but
still holding on enough to remember that part happening, even if not
the specifics.</p>

<p>At the first floating upward, he was like, "remember what you
perceive around you" and I perceived being in janette's kitchen with
lots of happy energy and happy people.  Nice.</p>
