<p>If I write a book about my Japanese experience, I think I will
call it <em>How not to learn Japanese</em>.</p>

<p class=date>5:38am</p>

<p>Right now my temperature is <a

<p>Swallowing doesn't hurt my throat quite as much.  I wonder if
those tablets helped.</p>

<p>Sinus and lungs are clear.</p>

<p>Inner ears hurt a little bit.</p>
