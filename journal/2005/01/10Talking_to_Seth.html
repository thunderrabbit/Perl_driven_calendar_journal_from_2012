<p>Seth, who recently dyed his hair black and forgot to shave his
moustache, and I are talking about quantum physics and shit that is
just out of my mental grasp.  Awright.</p>

<p>I need to remember to find the name of that CD from KTRU.</p>

<p class=date>3:11am</p>

<p>Found it.</p>

artist: Life is Meat
title:  Discreet Meat
label:  self released by Chris Connell

<p>Seth seems to be pretty cool.  We traded book titles and favorite
musics and several things we've read about quantum physics and the
nature of reality and stuff.  Chowed and chatted at Skylark, a cafe
down in Musashikosugi station.</p>

<p>Near the end of our meal, a dude came and sat near us in the
non-smoking section and went to light up a cigarette and I was
like, <em>no</em> and went over to him and hit/patted his shoulder and
pointed at the sign.  "smoke over <em>there</em> please."</p>

<p>That's the first time I've ever done that.  I'm glad I did it.</p>
