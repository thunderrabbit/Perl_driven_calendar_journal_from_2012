<p>My answers are marked with X.  Richard's answers, when different, are
marked with O.</p>

<pre>
Find out how much you know about how you spend a third of your time--asleep.

The following true or false statements test what you know about
sleep. Be sure to read the correct answers and explanations that
follow.

1. Sleep is a time when your
   body and brain shut down
   for rest and relaxation.

   [X] TRUE    [] FALSE

1. FALSE. Although it is a time when your body rests and restores its
energy levels, sleep is an active state that affects both your
physical and mental well-being Adequate restful sleep, like diet and
exercise, is critical to good health. Insufficient restful sleep can
result in mental and physical health problems and possibly premature
death.


2. If you regularly doze off
   unintentionally during the
   day, you may need more
   than just a good night's
   sleep.

   [O] TRUE   [X] FALSE

2. TRUE. Many people doze off unintentionally during the day despite
getting their usual night of sleep. This could be a sign of a sleep
disorder. Approximately 40 million Americans suffer from sleep
disorders, including sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, and restless
legs syndrome. An untreated sleep disorder can reduce your daytime
productivity, increase your risk of accidents, and put you at risk for
illness and even early death.

3. If you snore loudly and
   persistently at night and
   are sleepy during the day
   time, you may have a sleep
   disorder.

   [X] TRUE    [] FALSE

3. TRUE. Persistent loud snoring at night and daytime sleepiness are
the main symptoms of a common and serious sleep disorder, sleep
apnea. Another symptom is frequent long pauses in breathing during
sleep, followed by choking and gasping for breath. People with sleep
apnea don't get enough restful sleep, and their daytime performance is
often seriously affected. Sleep apnea may also lead to hypertension,
heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. However, it can be treated,
and the sleep apnea patient can live a normal life.

4. Opening the car window
   or turning the radio up
   will keep the drowsy driver
   awake.

   [O] TRUE   [X] FALSE

4. FALSE. Opening the car window or turning the radio up may arouse a
drowsy driver briefly, but this won't keep that person alert behind
the wheel. Even mild drowsiness is enough to reduce concentration and
reaction time. The sleep-deprived driver may nod off for a couple
seconds at a time without even knowing it--enough time to kill himself
or someone else. It has been estimated that drowsy driving may account
for an average of 56,000 reported accidents each year--claiming more
than 1,500 lives.

5. Narcolepsy is a sleep
   disorder marked by
   "sleep attacks."

   [X] TRUE    [] FALSE

5. TRUE. People with narcolepsy fall asleep uncontrollably--at any
time of the day, in all types of situations--regardless of the amount
or quality of sleep they've had the night before. Narcolepsy is
characterized by these "sleep attacks," as well as by daytime
sleepiness, episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis, and disrupted
nighttime sleep. Although there is no known cure, medications and
behavioral treatments can control symptoms, and people with narcolepsy
can live normal lives.

6. The primary cause of
   insomnia is worry.

   [X] TRUE    [] FALSE

6. FALSE. Insomnia has many different causes, including physical and
mental conditions and stress. Insomnia is the perception that you
don't get enough sleep because you can't fall asleep or stay asleep or
get back to sleep once you've awakened during the night. It affects
people of all ages, usually for just an occasional night or two, but
sometimes for weeks, months, or even years. Because insomnia can
become a chronic problem, it is important to get it diagnosed and
treated if it persists for more than a month.

7. One cause of not getting
   enough sleep is restless
   legs syndrome.

   [X] TRUE   [] FALSE

7. TRUE. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a medical condition
distinguished by tingling sensations in the legs--and sometimes the
arms--while sitting or lying still, especially at bedtime. The person
with RLS needs to stretch or move the legs constantly to try to
relieve these uncomfortable or painful symptoms. As a result, he or
she has difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep and usually feels
extremely sleepy and unable to function fully during the day. Good
sleep habits and medication can help the person with RLS.

8. The body has a natural
   ability to adjust to
   different sleep schedules,
   such as working different
   shifts or traveling through
   multiple time zones quickly.

   [] TRUE   [X] FALSE

8. FALSE. The human body's biological clock programs each person to
feel sleepy during the nighttime hours and to be active during the
daylight hours. So people who work the night shift and try to sleep
during the day are constantly fighting their biological clocks. This
puts them at risk of error and accident at work and of disturbed
sleep. The same is true for people who travel through multiple time
zones quickly; they get "jet lag" because they cannot maintain a
regular sleep-wake schedule. Sleeping during the day in a dark, quiet
bedroom and getting exposure to sufficient bright light at the right
time can help improve daytime alertness.

9. People need less sleep as
   they grow older.

   [X] TRUE    [] FALSE

9. FALSE. As we get older, we don't need less sleep, but we often get
less sleep. That's because our ability to sleep for long periods of
time and to get into the deep restful stages of sleep decreases with
age. Older people have more fragile sleep and are more easily
disturbed by light, noise, and pain. They also may have medical
conditions that contribute to sleep problems. Going to bed at the same
time every night and getting up at the same time every morning,
getting exposure to natural outdoor light during the day, and sleeping
in a cool, dark, quiet place at night may help.

10. More people doze off at
    the wheel of a car in the
    early morning or midafternoon
    than in the evening.

    [X] TRUE   [] FALSE

10. TRUE. Our bodies are programmed by our biological clock to
experience two natural periods of sleepiness during the 24-hour day
(regardless of the amount of sleep we've had in the previous 24
hours). The primary period is between about midnight and 7:00 a.m. A
second period of less intense sleepiness is in the midafternoon,
between about 1:00 and 3:00. This means that we are more at risk of
falling asleep at the wheel at these times than in the
evening--especially if we haven't been getting enough sleep.

<p>Man, I'm tired; I'm going to bed.</p>
