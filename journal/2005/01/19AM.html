<p>Jen came in to borrow some cash after having lost/spent hers
recently.  I had just woken up from a series of sexual dreams with <!
my mom > janette, and then one with Diane who helped me-an-Wende buy
our house.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do today?"</p>

<p>My answer: clean my room and take photos of this stuff to sell it
online.</p>

<p>"Oh, TeddyT sells stuff on Yahoo all the time.  Everything down to
his old phone charger."</p>

<p>"Kick ass!  Can he help me set up an account?"</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>
