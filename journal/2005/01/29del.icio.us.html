<p>I know what a deli is.</p>

<p>But I wasn't sure what del.icio.us was when I saw it.  I thought
someone had just styled their adjective to make it look fab.u.lous.ly
important.</p>

<p>Then I saw someone else do the same thing with the same spelling.
And, as indicated in Arlo Guthrie's "Alice's Restaurant" I knew they
were both freaks, or onto something.</p>

<p>Google solved the mystery, though not as quickly as I would have
guessed.</p>

<p>Oh man, I had lost track of the original point of this entry.  <a
href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a></p>
