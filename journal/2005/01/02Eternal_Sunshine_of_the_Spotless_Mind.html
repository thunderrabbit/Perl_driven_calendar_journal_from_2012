<p>We are in the middle of watching <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind</a> at Jesse and Takako's.  Taking a break right now;
Jesse was hungry.</p>

<p>Now watching a Japanese archery program, where it's like archery
as yoga, meditatively drawing the bow and (*) minding the details of
every motion.  Wow.</p>

<p>(*) the power went out as they were using the microwave, TV, and
electric heater.  Yay for computer battery.</p>

<p>Don't miss <a

far superior review</a> of this movie!</p>

<p>MMmmmmm.  Even better upon second viewing.  Everything lines up
nicely.  I only noticed a couple breaks in continuity, but they were
only during his memories; they could have been intentional.</p>
