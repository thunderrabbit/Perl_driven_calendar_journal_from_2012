<p>There was a new experience, like a release then a recapture of my
awareness.  Was it the same as bouncing between awake and dreaming,
riding that bicycle on the line between yin and yang?  I felt no
vibrational feelings, but the releases and recaptures caught my
attention.</p>

<p>As for the exercise, I was basically having dream images, including
being at janette's, and being with YRUU peeps, as he suggested we
perceive in different directions.  I was a bit drawn into my
analytical teacher brain as I found a couple of errors in splicing of
his voice.  In 1996 I learned that some tapes were spliced together
from previous recordings.  These small errors disrupted my thinking /
relaxing.</p>
