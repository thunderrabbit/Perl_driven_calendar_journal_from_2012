<p>Rode ミミビク to the station, enjoying the wonderful weather.  The
boring white wall on the building across the street looks almost
majestic.  The newly constructed 5 story apartments facing what is no
longer the local convenience store look modern and full of potential.
The yellow backhoe parked on the yard with its arm lodged into the
second story of the small house looks</p>

<p>I instantly stopped my bike to take pictures.  Holy badly parked
backhoes, Batman!  There's a backhoe smashed into that house!</p>

<p>But that's not the weirdest thing about it.  From all appearances,
it really truly looked like it had been dumped off its trailer onto
the street, made a 90 degree turn, drove through the short wall and
fence with arm raised, and crashed into the second floor, knocking
down the wall, which, as I write this, I can't remember having
seen.</p>

<p>Then it was abandoned.  The backhoe, I mean.  No one (except one
guy on a bicycle (ahem)) was anywhere *near* the backhoe, much less
looking at it.</p>

<p>The house didn't really look like it had been abandoned.  There
was a bookshelf with some books on it.  There were two chairs.</p>

<p>"Ooops, wrong house!"  ??????????</p>

<p>Crud.  I arrived at Jiyugaoka and called Jen to tell her about the
house; she arrived there as I arrived inside Gaba.  I wish I had
called her while I was in front of the house so we could get pictures
of each other on the house and on the backhoe.  Sigh.</p>
