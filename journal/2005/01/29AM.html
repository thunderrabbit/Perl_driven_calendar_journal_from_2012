<p class=date>5:34am JST Saturday 29 January 2005</p>

<p>When I got up around 5:10, my temperature was <a

<p>I set my alarm for 5am which was 9 hours after I took my first dose
of medication.  I'm supposed to take it 3 times a day, but I'm
shifting a little bit closer to every 8 hours.  If I take it right
now, it will be 9.6 hours.  I still have to eat first; my ramen is
cooling now.</p>
