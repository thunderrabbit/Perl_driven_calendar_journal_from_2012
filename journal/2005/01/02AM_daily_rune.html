<p>I woke up and basically reached for a rune first thing.  None were
sticking to my fingers as I asked, "what is the rune for today?" so I
changed my question to "what do I need to read today?" and I pulled
out the Blank Rune, which is interesting.</p>

<p>I read nothing, cause I had already read <a
