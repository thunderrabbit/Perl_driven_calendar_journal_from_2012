<p>I actually don't know how many dolphins were involved, but Hitomi
just sent me these pics from her Pb adventure from 5 years
ago.  It was Pb's Millenium Cruise.</p>

<p>I've included the one of Naomi as well.  I have not asked Naomi or
Hitomi for permission to publish these pics online.</p>

prompted me to apply again for Pb.</p>
