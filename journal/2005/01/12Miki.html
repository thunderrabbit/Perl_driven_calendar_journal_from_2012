<p>At the theater with Miki now.  We're going to see a Japanese movie
with good CGI effects.  Before this we chowed McDonald's due to me
having had some coupons given to me outside Kawasaki station.</p>

<p>I left the coupons outside McDonald's on their little menu rack
thing so someone can benefit from conveniently placed coupons.</p>

<p>We went to a little souvenir shop and I saw some fish-shaped
chopstick holders, which is exactly what my mom was looking for her
sister when she (mom) came to Japan in November 2003!  Cool!  So it's
been a while, but I assume they'll still be a welcome gift.</p>

<p>Jimmy just texted me and said he can get me 20,000 yen for a photo
session of me in some business suit situation.  Cool!  I sent him a
link to pictures of me in a suit and a cellphone photo of me now to
see if my hair compares well enough to those pictures.  Next week
we'll probably hook it up.</p>
