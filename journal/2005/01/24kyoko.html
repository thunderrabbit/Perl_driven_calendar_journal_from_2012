<p>Wow.  Kyoko is one of my favoritestest students at Gaba.  I looked
back at her booking history and I see that I was the first teacher she
chose.  She had had a few different lessons and one of them happened
to be mine.  She cancelled her next two scheduled lessons and chose my
lesson.  Wow.  I'm totally flattered.</p>
