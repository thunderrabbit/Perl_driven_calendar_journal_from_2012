<p>After Hitomi helped me study, I gave her a ride toward
Musashi-kosugi station.  I was like, [which is better, kosugi or
motosumiyoshi?] and she goes, [your room].</p>

<p>It felt like a mental stab wound.  Ah.  *that's* why you offered
to study with me.  You hoped to spend the night in my room.  I felt
trapped between taking care of myself and taking care of this super
cute sad little puppy that just wants a place to stay.</p>

<p>I was like, "Hitomi....." as several things went through my head at
once.  I want to be sleeping at 11:30pm.  I am too full to eat the
pudding that you bought.  If I am kept awake by you flipflopping
around in bed I will want to kill you and not go to Hokkaido with you.
It's not fair that I have to explain why I want to sleep alone in my
room.  It's my room.  I'm paying for it.  Done.</p>

<p>I put my head down on my hands crossed on the handlebars and
started to cry.  Sloppy tears gushing onto my glasses and snot pouring
onto the street.  Why are you doing this to me?  Why am I letting you
do this to me?  Why am I doing this to myself?  Why are we doing
this?</p>

<p>She tried to clarify that only if I wanted to have her over did
she want to come over.</p>

<p>"No; that is not what you said.  I said, 'Kosugi or Motosumiyoshi'
You said 'heya'" (heya means room) "I didn't offer my room" I want to
sleep alone tonight.</p>

<p>I think she got the picture after that, but, though this is the
third time we've had this exact dynamic of me literally crying and
saying "I need my space; please go away," and she staying because I'm
crying, she stayed.</p>

<p>me: "Musashi-kosugi des."</p>

<p>she: "hai."</p>

<p>me: "okay, byebye."</p>

<p>she: continued holding my hand.</p>

<p>The more we have this kind of problem, the more I will never try
to talk to you again.</p>
