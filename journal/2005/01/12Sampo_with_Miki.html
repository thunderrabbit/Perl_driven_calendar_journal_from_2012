<p>During the movie, when the blood was spraying and people were being
hacked with axes, I watched and offered my hand to help cover Miki's
view as she turned away.  (oops; too bloody of a movie.  This was
remniscent of our first movie together, Kill Bill.  She left during
the fight at House of Blue Leaves.)  She stayed for all of this movie
though; there were not nearly as many bodyparts scattered.</p>

<p>There were many aspects/scenes of this movie that made me think it
could become a cult classic.</p>

<p>After the movie, Miki and I went to the game center to play 30
free tokens in the token-eating machines.  I'm not sure what all the
variables are, but I thought that by choosing a seat with five balls
ready to fall instead of three or four, we would have a better chance
of winning.  Wrong.</p>

<p>We didn't play as long as last week, but it was still fun.</p>

<p>We walked to the discount shop and I scooped up some chocolate and
KitKat and some more chocolate and cereal and orange juice.  Miki
didn't buy anything; she just cutely and patiently walked through the
U-turn shaped store and waited with me in line.</p>

<p>I think those are the things I love about Miki.  She's cute and
she's patient.  I've noted this before; she is just happy with what
she has.  At least it seems that way, but I'm so not-that that I have
trouble believing it could be true.  <em>Really?  You're happy just
living with your parents and not having a proper boyfriend nor drink,
smoke, sex, drugs, rock-n-roll?</em>  (well I can understand most of
those, but *all* of them?)</p>

<p>Holy cow, congratulations on being happy with what you have.  You
should write a book and tell us how you do it.  Then you'd be rich!
(irony intended)</p>

<p>We walked to DICE, the building that was built last year (wow; I
have experienced some history in Kawasaki) and wandered around Tokyu
Hands, looking at the magic trick section where I wondered if there
was a sample of some of the tricks.  Miki exclaimed, "of course not!
If there were samples, then everybody would know the trick!"</p>

<p>Not if it were real magic.</p>

<p>I was a bit distracted with the time; I had told Hitomi I would
meet her at 7pm at my house, but I definitely wasn't likely to make
it.  I texted her and said we should meet at 8 and she could stay
overnight.  The previous plan was meet at 7 and she would go home.</p>

<p>I made sure to note in my mind that I wouldn't have the distraction
feeling if I wasn't trying to see two women on the same day.</p>

<p>Miki and I wandered down to the bookstore downstairs, where I got
picture of a funny/sick book of rabbit suicides.  The book is
subtitled something like, "If you're a rabbit, and you want to commit
suicide, then this book is for you."</p>

<p>Down to the first floor with an electronics store (Yodabashi
Camera, maybe) where I marveled at the cases to convert cameras into
underwater cameras.  I saw a USB external hard drive that turned out
to be a USB wireless modem (cell phone quality).  That made me realize
I could use a USB external drive to backup my computer journal entries
when I've got my computer out on adventures between internet cafes.
2500 yen for 32 megs.  22,000 (I think) for 1 gig.  32 megs would be
way way way more than enough for just text, but I could store pictures
on it, too.  Hmmm; I couldn't decide between these two options (price
vs storing photos as well) before it was time for Miki to go home.</p>

<p>Walked her to her bicycle so that she wouldn't find out I was
meeting Hitomi afterward.  Not that I've made a committment to Miki,
but maybe to keep her happy world happy.  Or actually to keep my
option of seeing her later.</p>
