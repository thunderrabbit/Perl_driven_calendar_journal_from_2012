<p>Rode TJ Bike today!  We haven't gone out in months, I believe.
It's been too cold for me to want to ride at night (which I'd have to
do if we rode to work), so I just haven't wanted to go out at all.
But today is bright and sunny, so we were like ¤è¤· and went out.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where I went exactly, but I found a small river and
followed it to a big river.  I heard and could barely see a model
plane being flown on the other side of the big river. It was doing all
sorts of vertical climbs and then tumbling drops.  I didn't know what
river it was, but I guessed I could follow it downstream to something
I'd recognize.  Turns out it was Tamagawa, and is the big river I
cross on the way to Gaba.</p>

<p>I got a text message from Jesse, so I showed up at his house; he
said they were just watching TV.</p>

<p>Now I'm at Jesse's; we're watching TV.</p>

<p>Jesse just informed me that our ex-co-worker <a
href="http://paul.onestop.net/">Paul Wallace</a> could likely have
been in Bali when the waves came.  Yikes.</p>
