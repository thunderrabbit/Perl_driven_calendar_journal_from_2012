<p>I stayed awake for all of this (except the very very end as he was
tellingus to wakeup) and though I didn't feel myself really out of my
body, I felt some tuggings in various directions.  back away from my
body and flowing out through my head .. those two I was more able to
visualize slash nearly feel.</p>

<p>I have a theory that these two were more effective because they
were near the end of the exercise, like by then I had a chance to get
more into the required mode of awareness.</p>

<p>I didn't get up at the end to write this, but I think I remembered
it well enough.  It's not like "I'll write this dream down later" and
then forget it completely.</p>
