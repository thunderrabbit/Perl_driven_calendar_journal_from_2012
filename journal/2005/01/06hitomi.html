<p>I asked Hitomi to come help me study tonight.  She called me from
Shibuya station a couple minutes after my lesson finished.  There was
something so ... heartstring tugging about her simple, clear and
direct statement.</p>

<p>"I'm lost."</p>

<p>I don't know if it was her cuteness or the fact that I don't hear
direct statements very often or what.  But I was like, "awwww" and I
just wanted to move the world to fix it for her.</p>

<p>Instead, I gave my phone to the guy behind the counter.</p>

<p>Thanks to Hitomi for helping me study a lot before my lesson
tomorrow.</p>
