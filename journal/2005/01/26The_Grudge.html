<p>Saw <em>The Juon</em>, a movie filmed in Tokyo and released in the US as
<em>The Grudge</em>.</p>

<p>It was scary.  I am not as scared by Hannibal or movies that could
happen, ... but supernatural movies scare me more.  I'm not sure why.
This is a supernatural movie; and they had interesting scenes that
mixed and matched time dimensions, so our heroine was
viewing/experiencing the pre-story in the haunted house.</p>

<p>Some of the scare tactics were like the American version of <em>The
Ring</em>, creepy with a layer of teasing on top like, "look what's
happening <em>now</em> <b>boo!!!</b>"</p>

<p>A nice thing is that apparently we got to see this movie weeks
before it will be released in Japan.  It would be cooler if it were
true for a crazy popular movie, but it's like my own little secret;
yeah, I already saw it.</p>
