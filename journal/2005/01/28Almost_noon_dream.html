<p>I've made it this far.  I turned my heater off and seem to have
cooled down to a more normal temperature.  My throat still super
hurts to swallow.  Argh.</p>

<p>I've been sleeping for the past several hours, dreaming about
talking to Jen.</p>

<p class=dream>She asked me if I would help her go to work.  I didn't
answer her a couple times, not because I didn't hear her, but because
I didn't understand what she was asking; her language had been
vague.</p>

<p class=dream>I turned the TV off and said, "now what is this
question you've been trying to ask me?"</p>

<p class=dream>"If I wasn't awake in the morning, would you wake me up
before work?"</p>

<p class=dream>If I knew you were in your room, I would tap very
lightly like this, (tap) (tap) "jen, are you awake?"</p>
