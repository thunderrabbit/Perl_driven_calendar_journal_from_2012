<p>But first, before I go and add trackback code to all my entries, I
must state the following (in Abe Simpson voice, cause it's really
pointless to say this anyway):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lt;whine/rant/boast&gt; 
When *I* was a boy, we didn't *have* trackbacks and permalinks.  We
didn't even have cheap domain names!  Domain names cost
a <em><b>hundred</b> dollars</em> and that was a lot of money in those
days!  There was nothing called a blog - all we had was Geocities,
and that was before Yahoo! bought them.  In fact, Yahoo! was the only
search engine back then, and they didn't have a good email service
until they bought rocketmail, which my good friend kT showed me when
I was at college.  Oh, those were the days, playing frisbee in the
water fountain with no water and trying to pass Physics II with
Maggie.</p>

<p>Now where was I?</p>

<p>Oh yes, I was writing online before blogging existed!&lt;/whine/rant/boast&gt;</p>

<p>And this seems to be the final missing piece.  I wondered why I
didn't know how to Auto-Discover trackback URLs.  Semi-according to <a
href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mttrackback.html#autodiscovery%20of%20trackback%20ping%20urls">movabletype</a>,
tb.cgi doesn't have that functionality.  It was written years ago;
hasn't it been updated by someone???</p>
