<p class=dream>The announcer was describing how in one super hot
summer, a summer so hot in Montano that garbage spontaneously caught
on fire in a garbage truck, a famous movie star went to the dump to
recover his collection of left handed tooth brushes from other movie
stars.  He was digging through a small part of the dump and finding
"Mike Meyers, Bob Segal, Patrick Swayze," etc as he picked up
toothbrushes.</p>

<p class=dream>The commissioner was congratulating someone for
something, but actually there was corruption in the background,
though I didn't know if the commissioner knew it or not. Matt Damon
came up riding on a firemans' horse for his first time cause he could
and the guy was like, "good work" to him as well.  This was in the
Astrodome in Houston.</p>

<p>Woke up to my 2pm alarm for work; I have to leave in 1 hour.  I
lost a huge chunk of dream, and I thought I had lost all of it..</p>
