<p>My power supply  just broke, I think.  85% battery, but my battery
dies at about 67%</p>

<p class=dream>I told my dad that I wanted to build some railroad
tracks.  full sized ones; not just a model. He acquired some rails and
I used some two by fours to tie them together using little screws, but
I tied them together from the top, which would disallow the train to
go past. I showed him my work and he pointed out the critcal problem.
D'oh!  I was upset at first, but then was like, "ah it was only an
hour of work, not like days or years down the drain."  So the project
became much larger in scale.  We had to go through some water and
build a tunnel.  There were other construction workers using flame
throwers to keep the concrete dry or make it set quickly and I had a
fight with my brother for a moment because we were tired, but we made
up quickly enough. "Sorry, Fred." "Sorry, Rob." I climbed up out of
the tunnel through a hole using a ladder that I didn't know about
previously, which let me know just how big this operation was.  I was
surprised and happy to see all the other workers and it let me know
what a big project this was and that my quick request of making a
train track couldn't be finished super quickly.  This was a big
project.</p>

<p>I got the power supply fixed.</p>
