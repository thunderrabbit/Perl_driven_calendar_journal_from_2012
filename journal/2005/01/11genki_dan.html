<p>Got a funny email from Dan:</p>

<pre>
A guy I work with said when he feels angry or annoyed he gets on his
PC (YUK YUK YUK) and writes it all down, and then feels better, then
he deletes it!!  I was like 'Dude (and I said 'Dude'), you're a word
waster, stop it, save it.'
</pre>

<p>That's not all the email, but I like the "word waster" part.</p>
