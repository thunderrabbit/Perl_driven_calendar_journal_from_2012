<p>I started reading _The Da Vinci Code_ last night.  I consciously
decided to read as long as I possibly could so that I could go back
and read it again and see how the different states of my brain would
interpret the same words.  I fell asleep reading around 4am.</p>

<p>I just re-read the last part of what I read last night.  Two
sections were interpreted differently.  I hadn't noticed how Silas'
teacher answered Silas' "how will I enter the church tonight?"
question, and I thought Silas' spiked <em>cilice</em> belt was around
his waist, not his thigh.</p>
