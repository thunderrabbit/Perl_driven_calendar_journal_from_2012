<p>Pretty depressed most of today.  Did some quintarks; did some data
entry (actually a lot) and talked to Jen some.  I don't really have
any friends in Japan.  Jen is my one friend in Japan.  No one else
really knows me.  Why?  Because I don't like to do the social things:
sit in a haze of smoke and drink, whether it be at karaoke, an
izakiah, or a concert.</p>

<p>This is a gross disgusting smoking country and I'm sick of
that.</p>

<p>Where's my I-group?  Where are people who are doing personal work
instead of medicating?</p>

<p>However, tonight, I'm going out with the gang from Millenium House.
I really like Richard, but we don't really know each other.  Maybe
that can change.</p>

<p>I'm not going to take my backpack nor computer.</p>
