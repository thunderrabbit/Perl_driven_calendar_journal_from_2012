<p class=dream>Walking through a parking lot, looking for Mr Van.  My
dad was there, but he was spooked by a security guard for some reason.
I saw Mr Van and was waking over toward him, and my dad saw a
different van that was painted like Mr Van but was a different
make/model.</p>

<p class=dream>I was on the beach at the tsunami-wrecked area, and
there was a boat on a trailer still connected to its pickup truck, and
the boat was all smashed and tie-cables were twisted.  I needed to go
between the boat and the truck, and I got stuck somehow and struggled
to get free which caused the truck to start rolling toward the ocean.
I gasped slightly as I woke up.</p>
