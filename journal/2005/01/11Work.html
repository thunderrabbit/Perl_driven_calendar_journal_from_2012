<p>I enjoyed a double lesson with Junko, a new student who chose my
lesson, and happened to end up with the lesson before that.. (I'm not
explaining this well, but I'm tired.)  She expanded incredibly well
after I answered "where are you from?" and that took up the entire
first lesson.  The second lesson had huge great expansion again and I
just wanted to keep on chatting with her, but it was time to go.  I
found out that she's a cabin attendant for ANA.  Coolio.  She said I
should go to H.I.S. for inexpensive fares.</p>

<p>Also enjoyed a double lesson with Kozue who invited me to see
Beastie Boys with her on Friday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>But I can't go; I have to work.  Man I would love to go.  Oh man I
just realized this; I maybe could have gotten out of work; when I got
the invite, I checked my schedule, and had two blue lessons (blue =
student chose me), but (!) I know the phone number of the student!  I
coulda called her and rearranged the lessons and gone to B-boys.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>
