<p>Wow!  That kicked ass.  I could nearly induce vibrations by
visualizing the energy bar on and off really quickly.  I was tempted
to use different ways to control it, and wavering between dream

<p class=dream>flipping a light switch and looking at the back of some
type of computer data storage device maybe.</p>

<p>I'm excited.  I'm going to go for the next one now.</p>
