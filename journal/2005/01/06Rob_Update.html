Hello from a new year in Japan!

I don't really know how long it's been since I've written a mass
update, but I know it's been a while.  I think it's been so long that
I haven't written about my new bicycle.

I got a new bicycle in September or so.  His name is TJ Bike.  TJ
stands for Taihen Jyanai, which I think literally means "big problem,
not" in Japanese.  The idea is that I will ride my bicycle from Tokyo
to the north island of Japan in March or April 2005.  When I need to
ride across a big mountain or river or mud bog, I can say "no problem!
taihen jyanai!" and ride across.

My friend Tomoko made stickers for TJ Bike that I will apply before I
go.  I bought saddlebags for the front and back so I can carry a tent
and sleeping bag and food.

TJ Bike and I have gone as far as Yoyogi Station, which takes us about
75 minutes.  We made that trek two or three times on days that I did
Chinese-English language exchange with Shufen.  TJ Bike and I have
also ridden to Shibuya a few times (55 minutes away) for Japanese
lessons, and have ridden to Jiyugaoka many many times (30 minutes) for
work.  However, once the weather turned cold, we quit riding.  One of
us doesn't like cold weather. (hint: right now TJ Bike is naked and
I'm wearing about three layers of clothing and two knit caps.)

I'm doing computer work on the weekends and teaching English during
the week.  I'm once again out debt and beginning to save some money.

A couple months ago, while wondering what I want to do when I grow up,
and knowing that computers are getting smarter and smarter, I decided
that whatever I do should be something that computers cannot
conceivably do within my lifetime, which could conceivably be long
given advances in health technology.  So, I decided to do some
research in astral/dream/out-of-body stuff that modern science doesn't
really embrace right now.  To that end, I bought hemi-synch CDs that
I learned about from the Monroe Institute in Virginia.

I have been listening to one or more exercises almost every day, and
have been keeping relatively careful record of my experiences.  They
are scattered throughout my journal in entries that include
"gateway_data" in the title.

About two weeks ago, I learned that my computer-job boss "has a swami"
in India.  I was like, "wow!  I'd love to meet him," so we called them
and I got an email address.  I emailed them, but so far no response.
I imagine the tsunami could have something to do with that.

About two weeks ago, there were some huge tsunami in the Indian Ocean.
Yesterday I decided to forgo my adventure with TJ Bike and go help out
starting in March.  March 26, to be exact, which will be 2 years to
the day that I left Dallas for Japan.  I remember that day well.

Today I started cleaning up my room, beginning the process of leaving
Japan.  I wonder where TJ Bike will go while I'm in tsunami help mode.

I hope you're well.

    - Rob!
