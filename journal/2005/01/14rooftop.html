<p>I invited Ikumi to explore the apartment building across the
street.  Its front door was no blocked with a gate; <em>this is our
big chance</em>, I thought.  The front door was not blocked because
all the doors in the building were locked.  Crud.</p>

<p>Peering around a bit, I noticed a ladder to the roof.</p>

ladder to the roof.</p>

<p>Truly, it took me several minutes to convince myself (and Ikumi)
that it would be okay for me to climb onto the roof for a quick
picture.  And truly, I wanted to slide down the slide looking thing,
but we guessed it *might* not be designed for people to slide down.
If I broke it, that would be a bit expensive.</p>

the ground.  With careful zooming, I can see my face (I was wearing
all black) above the bottom end of the steps.</p>
