<p>Pretty much had fun tonight at the bar place in Ebisu.  We walked
over to Matteo's (new to me but for him no longer so) new apartment to
chill out for a bit.  We diverted to a ramen shop to chow and were
watching a silly game show where players had to guess the meaning of
different what-cha-call-ems.  Here is "I understand:"</p>

<pre>
    stand
    -----
     eye
</pre>

<p>You understand?  Okay, but they had them in Japanese, and I pretty
much couldn't get any of them; I could barely read all of the kanji
on the screen before the round was over.  Anyway, when it came to the
end game, they had The Super Tricky ones.</p>

<p>There were three different ones, and for the first one they said,
"if you can get this, then your IQ is at least 115."</p>

<p>The query was a set of about 7 symbols, some of which I remember:</p>

<p>火　ノ　月</p>

<p>And the answer involved mix-n-match with the kanji to make
a double compound kanji word.</p>

<p>I didn't get it.</p>

<p>The second one was supposed to indicate an IQ of 110.</p>

<p>イ　ニ　サ　＿　ゴ　シ</p>

<p>The question being, "what goes in the blank?"</p>

<p>I got it.</p>

<p>ロ, of course.</p>

<p>The last one was worth 105 IQ points:</p>

<pre>
-   -   - 
 | | | | |
-            
 | | | | |
-   -   - 
</pre>

<p>That's supposed to look basically like 300 made out of right
angled lines of equal length.</p>

<p>Move only two lines and make it say "1"</p>

<p>I got it.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>By the end of the show, I was done eating (everyone else was
already finished) and we headed over to Matteo's after grabbing drinks
at a local convenience store.  And by local, I mean 20 meters away, 80
meters closer than the next convenience store.</p>

<p>Waited until Tanya showed up and then headed out to Ebisu, which is
one station away (on a different train line) from Nakameguro (190
yen), but costs 160 more yen to get there.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>There was a woman dancing all crazy in front of the performers
(vocalist with hand drums, keyboardist, guitarist, bass guitarist,
and a guy on rock drums (what are they called?)) so I joined her with
my own flavor of crazy dance and it was great.</p>

<p>Later, I saw her and I was like, "good dancing," and she didn't
respond to that, but just asked, "can I play something?" as in could
she play an instrument on stage?  What?  No; you're just someone in
the audience; of course you can't play.  And I'm just another someone
in the audience.  Stop being crazy.</p>

<p>I was talking to Tanya for a bit; we both like Beastie Boys and hip
hop.  She's not as fond of Eminem as I, but she likes Ministry and
Outkast, whose name came up because they played an Outkast song
between sets that had like really speedy beats and then slow girly
R&amp;B and then speedy beats again.  I liked the tune.</p>

<p>Before the next set started, I decided it was time for me to head
out, so I went to get my coat.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Upon arrival in the bar in Ebisu, I took off my coat and looked for
a place to put it.  All the chairs at all the tables (of which there
weren't many) were taken.  Matteo walked upstairs, so I followed him,
hoping he knew of some space we could squat.  No.</p>

<p>Headed back downstairs cause the girls were like, "that's him;
that's Q," the vocalist slash hand drum player we had come to see.
He didn't look at all like I expected.  He was physically fit, young,
with short dread-ish kinda hair.  I had expected an old, plump,
balding jazz musician type.</p>

<p>That's when I saw the woman dancing like crazy.</p>

<p>I wanted to dance like crazy, but I was still holding my coat.  And
in my coat pocket was my 2 liter plastic bottle of Amino Supli.  I had
consumed half of it during the evening up until that point.</p>

<p>I spied two chairs that were unused.  They were right next to the
band's corner, and I wasn't sure if I could use them for my coat, so
I asked Shoko.  She was basically like, no, saying they were probably
for the band.</p>

<p>The woman was still dancing quite effectively.</p>

<p>I shifted my brain to I-know-what-I'm-doing mode.  Walked over to
the chair, hung my coat on the back of it.</p>

<p>Danced, danced, danced.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Walked over to the chair upon which I had hung my coat and was
like, "excuse me" to the woman who was sitting on the chair.  "I just
need to get my coat."</p>

<p>There was a coat on top of my coat, so I lifted it up to find
another coat on top of my coat.  I picked them both up and found a
coat hanging on the back of the chair over my coat.  Picked it up and
found another coat.  I was running out of hands, so I just felt under
that coat for my coat.  Nope; another coat was on top of my coat.  So
I lifted up three coats to get my coat and found another coat under
those three.  Lifted up the four coats, thankfully found my coat.
Grabbed it and hefted it onto the floor by my feet.  Rehung the four
coats and lay the 2 coats on those coats.</p>

<p>Put my coat on, and the friend of the woman who had been sitting on
the chair came back and was *totally* smiling at me.  Like such a long
smile with eye contact that I began to think she was a bit off.  I had
zero percent interest in hooking anything up with her so I didn't say
anything flirtatious.  "just getting my coat."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Said bye to my peeps and headed out.</p>

<p>Saw Katrina on her way in.  She was focused on her phone, so I
said, "you're super close;" I figured she was reading directions to
the place.</p>

<p>"I'm in a pissed off mood."</p>

<p>"Wow.  Do you want me to show you where the bar is?"</p>

<p>"I know where it is."</p>

<p>"Okay; see you later."</p>

<p>I'm glad I left before she arrived in a pissed off mood.</p>

<p>Walked to Nakameguro station to save 160 yen and to prove I knew
where it was (I did) and to have a bit of a new experience, and to
let my coat air out stinky cigarette smell.</p>

<p>Shower and laundry and now bed.</p>
