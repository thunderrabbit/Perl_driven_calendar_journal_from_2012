<p>I've been awake for a few hours, reading the online hacker
dictionary and posts about the original smiley :-) and about moveable
types trackback thing.  I ate so slowly that my bowl of ramen got cold
before I finished it.  There is a hint of less pain when swallowing,
but my mind still shuns the idea of swallowing, fearing the pain.</p>
