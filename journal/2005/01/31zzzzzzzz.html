<p>Oh my gosh no wonder I'm so tired!</p>

<p>During work I made a lid for the new recycling box.  For 10 months
people have been throwing trash with the recycleables because they are
not thinking and the boxes are not foolproofly labled / made.</p>

<p>Finally a separate box was brought for recycleables.  I cut out a
piece of cardboard and cut a hole for can / bottle deposits and drew
little pictures on it.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Had two lessons with Kyoko.  Awesome.  Gave Akiko my email address
cause she said she would miss me after my departure.</p>

<p>After work, genius conversationalist Michael Hetherton invited me
to join him and Amanda from his building and her student who lives in
the area for ramen.  Chowed ramen and a million gyouza.  Then we left
for ice cream at the convenience store (I thought) but went to Atami
instead.</p>

<p>I was quite put off by the smoke, but I stayed.  Then suddenly as
I was really happy to leave, Michael started a game.</p>

<p>"Okay, TOEIC: you (Yasuyo) listen to a sentence with a word
missing.  Rob will give you four choices for the missing word," and
he began before anyone could intervene. "Mr Smith was sick so he had
to ______ a meeting.   Rob?"</p>

<p>And I gave four choices.  "Concur" "Cancel" "Qualify" "Court"</p>

<p>Yasuyo got it right.</p>

<p>Before long, we had Mr and Mrs Smith boinking like bunnies and
buying whiskey from the store, etc etc.  All for a funny little game
that we played about life.</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep.</p>
