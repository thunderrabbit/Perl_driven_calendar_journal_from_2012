<p>Work was fine; I reminded Kyoko that I had given her my number so
she gave me mine.  Kozue chose me for two lessons.</p>

<p>Noriko just asked me to help her with a letter to a guy in
Holland.</p>

<p>Cesar wrote me an email that started with "Hola Rob" and then was
written entirely in French.  I can understand a lot of it, but not
all.  Funny.</p>

<p>Tonight I rearranged my room, putting TJ Bike near the door and my
table in the corner.  TJ Bikes comes and goes more often than the
table.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
