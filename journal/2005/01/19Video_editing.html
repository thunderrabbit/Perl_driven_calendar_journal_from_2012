<p>I'm super low on disk space.  I've got three videos on my banana
(Winne the Pooh themed 128 MB USB memory card that's shaped like a
banana) and I've just copied them to iMovie for editing.  420 MB free
on my entire drive.</p>

<p class=date>5:34pm</p>

<p>Man; this has taken longer than I guessed it might.  I finished
editing and exported it to 240x180, but all the subtitles are
illegible.  Exporting again at a larger size.</p>

<p>Better now, but not perfect, but I'm going to let it go.</p>

<p>Crap.  It's 21.5 megs.  I might try to re-edit it and get it
compressed better.</p>
