<p>Today Makiko was even more stunningly beautiful than she normally
is.  I'm not sure if there really is some glow about a 5 month
pregnant woman or if I'm just horny or what.  Man oh man oh man.</p>

<p>I had to specifically talk to Florian (who agrees that Makiko is
stunning) to keep myself from leaving the building "just by chance" at
the same time as Makiko.  My smart brain knew it would lead to nothing
good, though my other brain was like, "who cares??  go go go!"</p>

<p>Silly other brain.</p>

<p>Kozue chose me for two lessons today.  I told her that I'll be
leaving in about March and she was like, "I won't have a teacher," the
implication being that I am her only teacher.  Aw, Kozue, you are
awesome.  I will miss you, too.</p>
