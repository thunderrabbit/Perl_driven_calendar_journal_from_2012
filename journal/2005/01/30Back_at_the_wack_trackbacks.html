<p class="note">(I wiped out all the trackback stuff; no humans were
using them, and I am in the process of creating a new indexing system.
Plus, I can just outsource trackbacks to any of the social bookmarking
sites.)</p>

<p>Okay; I'm going to start fresh-ish (I'm still tired) on my
trackback code thing.</p>

<p>The page with the code that works is <a
href="http://www.commoncraft.com/archives/000568.html">here</a> (and I
guess for good measure I should ping it), and my page with the code
that doesn't work is *here*.</p>

onclick="window.open(this.href,'trackback','width=480,height=480,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'); return false">View TrackBacks / Get TrackBack Link</a>

<p>Hmm.  Now it works.  I'm not sure why.  Well, this is good.  Lemme
just compare this code with the code I used last night.</p>

<a href="http://www.robnugen.com/cgi-local/tb.cgi?__mode=list&tb_id=2005/01/30Back_at_the_wack_trackbacks.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'trackback',
'width=480,height=480,scrollbars=yes,status=yes'); return
false"><b>Test</b> TrackBack</a>

<p>Okay, this is very good.  It seems just to be a matter of spacing.
I imagine I can't have a space in the middle of "return false"</p>

<p>That's it!</p>
