<p>When I was little .. like 8-12 years old, I would lie down and just
stare at a light until my eyes blocked it out (protecting themselves,
I imagine) and if I looked away I would see a dark spot at that point
in my vision.  But if I didn't look away, after a while I would feel a
pleasantly strange oscillation of like .5 HZ.  Sometimes it would feel
like my body was oscillating and slowly tipping backwards, like I was
melting into the floor.  I rarely have that experience of oscillations
anymore... but I rarely stare at lights for indefinite periods of time
anymore.  I wonder if I could induce the experience again...</p>

<p>I tried yesterday, but didn't have the same experience.</p>
