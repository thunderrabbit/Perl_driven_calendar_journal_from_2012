<p>Just chatted with Maggie on the phone for about an hour.  Wanted to
get caught up on gossip for her &amp; Bill and Wende &amp; Peter and
Molly &amp; Will and Meredith &amp; Eric.  Wanted to inquire about
her wedding date, and about the possibility of her driving me to
Austin if I want to sneak up on Fred.  But the one thing that no
other person could have done; Maggie checked 7 January 1999 in my
handwritten journal to find the details of the Orange Pushup, a story
that Amanda remembers, but that I do not.</p>

<p>Kindof embarassing, especially considering the main reason I write
is so that I can remember.</p>
