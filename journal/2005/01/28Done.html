<p>I'm back from the doctor.  He said I have tonsilitis.</p>

<p>He guessed I would be better in about a week, and if I had to go
to work, I could, but it would be better not to.</p>

<p>He gave me ibuprofen (100mg) for pain, which Jackie had given me,
and Augmentin (no mg indicated) for infection, which Jackie had not
given me, but no pseudoephedrin HCl, which Jackie had given me.  I'm
supposed to take 2 of each tablet three times a day with food, though
it hurts like eating sandpaper to swallow, even with my accomplished
chewing skills.</p>

<p>I plan not to go to OM tomorrow and I called Gaba to have them
close all my non-blue lessons.</p>

<p>I have *seven* blue lessons on Monday and four on Tuesday.
Hopefully I will be genki by then.</p>

<p>The receptionist at Gaba, near the end of our conversation, during
which I asked her to close non-blue lessons on Monday and Tuesday
(both days for which she had to ask the manager) and gave the reason
as tonsilitis, which she didn't understand, and "when I talk I want
to cry," asked me if I was okay.</p>

<p>No.  I am not okay.</p>

<p>She seemed surprised and hung up quickly.</p>
