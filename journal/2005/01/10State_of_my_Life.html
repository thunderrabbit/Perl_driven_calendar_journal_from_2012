<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<ol type="A">
<li><p>It's 2005.  Now when people ask for my age I say 35.</p></li>

<li><p>My <a href="/cgi-local/days/daysold.pl">days old counter</a>
still can't do predictive calculations; I have to make guesses to
figure out when people will be certain ages in the future.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still living near Motosumiyoshi in (Tokyo) Japan.
Millenium House #20.  Jen still lives there, but there has been some
turnover recently.  Riki is gone; Jo is gone; Gus is gone.</p>

<p>Living in the building now: Jen, Roger, Katrina, Shoko, Jeff,
Colin, Dean, Richard, Jackie, Dave, Yuki, Ikumi, Aaron, me, and one
new guy who moved in between Dean and me.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm still working in the quintark industry on weekends and
working at Gaba three days a week.  I have a few favorite students at
Gaba who have been coming consistently: Naotoshi, Makiko, Kozue,
Mari, Kyoko, Mieko and maybe others who have slipped my mind.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I told Kozue that I'll be leaving in March.  She
seemed a bit shocked and said she would have no teacher after that
time.  I was touched.</p></li>

<li><p>Hitomi and I have broken up.  We had a problem during the
holidays and I used it as an opportunity to just say no.  I offered
to be just friends with her, but that is difficult for me.</p></li>

<li><p>Right now we are in a bit of a fight I think because I fucked
up and tried to hide from Jen that Hitomi and I are meeting today.
Hitomi, I imagine, felt marginalized, and, I believe, is now angry
about it.  I offered to talk about it tonight with her if she wants; I
know I errd.</p>

<p>I feel sad about it; this (work) is not a safe place to cry.  I
think I'll go get some chocolate to change that.</p>

<p class=date>5:28pm</p>
<p class=note>(update)</p>

<p>All has been forgiven.</p></li>

<li><p>I've still got my PowerBook G4 with 30 gig hard drive (1.5 gigs
free) 512 megs ram, 14 inch screen (with dirty scrapes from the
keyboard) and a short-lasting battery and bent power supply connector.
I won't likely consider getting a new computer until I get resettled
somewhere next year.</p></li>

<li><p>On my computer, I've got 6 gigs of video taken by Jesse's video
camera when he, Takako and I went riding our bikes out at a park near
our neighborhood.  Kawasaki Todoroki something something I think is
the name.  I've been working on editing it into a movie of sorts, and
have converted some of the clips nearly into a something with a
plot.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm using Firefox as my primary web browser and gmail as my
primary email account.  I've used 48megs used in gmail.  Firefox is
pretty kick-ass in its interface.  Gmail's interface kicks ass, too.
Since its inception in April 2004, it offers 1 gig of space at no
charge but to place email-targetted ads in the border of the page.  I
rarely notice them.</p></li>

<li><p>All my journal entries are indexed automagically with the core
code that Fred wrote into different categories.  These are currently
used: runes, dreams, excited, sleepy, nihongo, gateway_data (not
listed in the index).  These are not really, but were important to me
in the past: ultimate (frisbee), YRUU, KTRU, skate.</p></li>

<li><p>This is a couple weeks after the monster earthquake-induced
tsunami smashed cities around the Bay of Bengal.  I am greatly
planning to go to one or more of those cities starting on 26
March.</p></li>

<li><p>I have no pets, except Spot in Houston, who, as far as I know,
is fine.</p></li>

<li><p>I officially have no girlfriend, but Hitomi is still helping
me study on occasion, which means I am still choosing to deal with the
choice between sex or not.  Argh.</p></li>

<li><p>I've been listening to Hemisynch CDs in the Gateway series from
The Monroe Institute.  So far, I've been able to consistently find
Focus 10 (mind awake, body asleep) pretty quickly.  A few times I have
felt an expanded awareness that he calls Focus 12, and sortakinda I
have felt hints of vibrational body-leaving feelings.</p>

<p>I haven't listened to any of the exercises past Wave III / Freedom
4: Five Questions, which I pretty much slept through.  I zipped
through Wave II more quickly than Wave I.</p>

<p>I've found that doing exercises in the morning, soon after I've
woken up from a good sleep, results in the most consciously coherent
experiences.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently, I've been in touch with janette more than before
recently.  We both definitely still miss each other.  I believe that
if I just "give up and go back to the US now" that I won't feel
fulfilled or something.  But there is definitely a big urge to do
that; to go back to that (near) unconditional love situation with
janette.</p>

<p>I'd also like to go back to Virginia and West Virginia for an
extended period.  I love the energy of my family there.</p></li>

<li><p>At 2 week to 1 month intervals, I've been hanging out
(individually) with KG Miki and Satoko.  I know them both from Nova.
KG Miki and I went out a lot last year, but didn't go out with Satoko
at all last year (due to her having moved to LA for the
year).</p></li>

<li><p>I've been in pretty close email contact with Fred.  I talked
to Ma recently, and to dad, but overall recently, I've chatted more
with Ma than dad.</p></li>

<li><p>I wonder if I can use a different part of my brain to find
suitable mates.  Or run a different filter.  Instead of is-she-cute
filter, use the does-she-lighten-my-spirit filter or something more
awesomely worded than that.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm planning to go to Hokkaido with Hitomi in February.  Today
(10 January), I came one inch away from telling her to cancel the trip
after we were sending pointless emails back and forth about watching a
fucking movie that we've both seen before.  I just pinned down a time
(1pm) to meet Miki on Wednesday so I offered to meet Hitomi at 7pm
that day.</p></li>

<li><p>I've just been searching for ways to volunteer for the
tsunami.  I've found only two so far:</p>

<p><a href="http://tsunami0.notlong.com">i-to-i</a>
<a href="http://tsunami2.notlong.com">Global Crossroads</a></p>

<p>And I found two notlong.com shortcuts that were already taken.  As
I write this, I haven't seen them yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://tsunami.notlong.com">maps</a>
<a href="http://tsunami1.notlong.com">videos</a></p>

<p class=note>(4:05am JST Tuesday 11 January 2005: I've seen them
now)</p></li>

<li><p>Most recently I've read Bill Bryson's _A short history of
nearly everything_.  Next I'll read Dan Brown's _The Da Vinci
Code_.</p></li>

<li><p>The quintark business is struggling.  OM may have to shut down
operations while things are retooled.</p></li>

<li><p>The building across the street has been unveiled, but isn't
completely complete yet.  It's no longer hidden behind the big canvas
sheets, though.</p>

<p>Jen reckons that it's ugly.  I think one wall is boring (solid
white brick with a single small window per floor) and another face is
pretty cool; (doors and staircases angling down in a stack.  The top
staircase is actually a slide.  I'm going to slide down that slide.)
I haven't really seen the other two sides.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm getting overall sick of Japan.  I'm ready to
leave.</p></li>
