<p>Wowowow</p>

<p>Couple weeks ago Jimmy asked (*)</p>

<p>Wow.  Nice when things just line up so perfectly!</p>

<p>(*) My battery ran out while I was typing in the taxi, so now I'm
at Gaba on their computer and dead computer battery on my Mac.</p>

<p>Anyway, the shoot was pretty short and easy.  I met a couple of
theater people: Lindsey (sp), Robert, and Matt were models today.
Jimmy da Magnet's brother Riko (sp) was behind the camera
consulting with the company JETCO (?) for whom the photos were
being taken.  They are a consulting company that works to get
foreign investors in Japan.  So we were looking at charts and stuff
on the table and BSing about whatever charts we had in front of us,
or actually introducing ourselves.  "Yeah, so I'm planning to ride
my bike around Japan," etc.  Pretty fun.</p>

<p>Photos were taken in four different locations, and I was in the
scene for three of those locations.  I was not in the scene for all of
the situations "okay, now the consultant talks to Lindsay
(sp)...  okay now Lensey (sp) stands over here..." etc.  So it's
conceivable that I won't be in any of the final shots, but the money
is still in my wallet, so it's allll good.</p>

<p>I'm an hour early here to Gaba, and I had the last two lessons
of my day empty, so I closed those.  And my student tracker shows
me that the second student of my day is a hardcore smoker; I'm
overwhelmed each time he comes to my booth.  I'm going to ask that
he is moved to another teacher.</p>

<p>Ah; I can also go get a disposable tape measure from Muji; I need
to measure the knotboards.  Cool.</p>

<p>Oh; I almost forgot.  Because Lindsee (sp) et. al. are theater
people, they were talking about the upcoming show that Louise has
invited me to.  I therefore began to think I should make arrangements
to get those tickets from her.</p>

<p>Upon arrival at Gaba, Louise was there.  "Hey, you want some
tickets for the show?"</p>

<p>Perfect!  So I bought two for January 30th.</p>

<p>She invited me to go to her house tonight to watch movies.  But I
don't have my computer power supply (argh), so I invited her to my
place to watch.  She said she'll think about it.  (her place is
walking distance from Gaba)</p>
