<p>Now add up the total number of points.</p>

<p>OVER 60 POINTS:
<br>Others see you as someone they should "handle with care."  You're
seen as vain, self-centered and one who is extremely domineering.
Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't
always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.</p>

<p>51 TO 60 POINTS:
<br>Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather ! impulsive
personality; a natural leader, one who's quick to make decisions,
though not always the right ones.  They see you as bold and
adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes
chances and enjoys an adventure.  They enjoy being in your company
because of the excitement you radiate.</p>

<p>41 TO 50 POINTS:
<br><b>Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical and
always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of
attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their
head.  They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding;
someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.</b></p>

<p>31 TO 40 POINTS:
<br>Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful and practical.  They
see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest.  Not a person who
makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal
to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return.
Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your
trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to
get over it if that trust is ever broken.</p>

<p>21 TO 30 POINTS:
<br>Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy.  They see you as
very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder.  It would
really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the
spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from
every angle and then usually decide against it.  They think this
reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.</p>

<p>UNDER 21 POINTS:
<br>People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who
needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the
decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or
anything.  They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that
don't exist.  Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you
well know that you aren't.</p>
