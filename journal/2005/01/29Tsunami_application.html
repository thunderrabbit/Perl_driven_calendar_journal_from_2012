<p>Okay, I've been telling people I'm going to help with the
tsunami-scrambled area, but haven't actually applied.  I've just
spent over an hour writing these four things, so I'm saving them here
in case the web-form eats them.</p>

<p>After years of working with computers, I know when to save my
work.  "This is a solved problem," says Fred.</p>

<p>What inspires you to join Global Crossroad's Tsunami
relief/reconstruction Project?</p>

Sri Lanka is an area to which I've always wanted to go, but never went.
The World Trade Center in Manhattan was a place I had always wanted to
go, but never went.  I couldn't go to Manhattan to help due to my job.
Now that I'm in Japan, and my work contract is about to finish, I am
able to help.

<p>Please explain your educational background and experience</p>

<textarea cols="70" rows="7">
I received a bachelor of science degree in computer science (primarily
programming) from the University of Houston in 1995.  I volunteered
for 5 years with YRUU (http://www.uua.org/YRUU), the youth
organization affiliated with my church.  I attended weekly meetings
with Mankind Project http://www.mkp.org from 1997-1999, helping me
learn how to understand and handle emotions, and how to help others do
the same.  http://www.robnugen.com/resume</textarea>

<p>Please describe your experiences with teams/groups and why you
think you would make a good team/group member?</p>

As part of the Mankind Project, I met with the same group of men every
week for two years.  We learned how to support one another, how to
listen to one another, how to encourage one another in our life
projects.  During my university days, I organized volunteers for a
recycling project.  I helped my church support Private Sector
Initiative (similar to Habitat for Humanity) where a herd of us would
go work to refurbish under-nourished homes in the area.  When
volunteering with YRUU, I taught the youth participants to be leaders
in their own groups.  I have worked as team leader and team member; I
know when it's appropriate to lead, and when to follow</textarea>

<p>Explain a time in your life when you had to go beyond your comfort zone.</p>

* I tried out for cheerleader at my high school which had never had a
male cheerleader before.
* My dying-of-cancer aunt's worst fear was dying while her kids were
in high school.  I didn't know how I could actually help, so I wrote
her a letter of how much she had done for me and that it was okay for
her to die.
* I spent 3 years on campus at university, wearing no shoes.
* I drove alone 11,000 miles around the United States.
* I broke up with my fiance, requiring us to sell our house, for the
reason that I have to see the world.
* I gave up most of my worldly possessions (house, furniture, car) to
come alone to Japan
* everytime I go out with my friends, I have to explain that I don't
drink alcohol.

<p>oops.  I read the terms and conditions and noticed the opportunity
is for Sri Lanka, not Thailand.  Better change that first
paragraph.</p>

<p>Yay. I did some research on Sri Lanka, opening about 50 different
windows and tabs, and lost the window with the web stuff I had
written.  Except I saved it already.</p>
