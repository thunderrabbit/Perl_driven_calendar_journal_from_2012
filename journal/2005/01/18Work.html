<p>Right now I'm in the middle of a double no-show.  I think I'll
write some Japanese.</p>

<p class=date>1:54am</p>

<p>Woah.  Kimiko, my last student of the evening, really triggered my
addict.  Her perfume smelled incredible.  Even though I could smell a
bit of cigarette smoke underneath it, I really wanted to dive into
that fragrance.</p>

<p>When I asked her, "do you want me to correct your grammar or help
you work on fluency? which is most important?"</p>

<p>She goes, "character."</p>

<p>Then when she told me she had been working 14 hours a day every
day, I was like, "oh fuck," and she goes, "don't say that.."</p>

<p>And I'm like, "why?"</p>

<p>And she goes, "is it okay to say that in America?"</p>

<p>"Well, yeah, but it's really not polite."</p>

<p>"Do you want to lie down?"</p>

<p>That broke my brain for a minute.  I was still reeling from
"character" and her fragrance, then she asked me if I wanted to lie
down.  I was like, <em>totally</em>, but I totally didn't.</p>

<p>wowowow</p>

<p>stop.</p>
