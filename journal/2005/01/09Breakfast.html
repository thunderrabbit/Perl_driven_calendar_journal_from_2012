<p>Went to McDonald's and people were smoking in the seating area.
Fucking sickening.  A dude sat down at the next table and then left to
go get an ashtray.  Then he left to go to the restroom, and in
passive-aggressive style, which seems appropriate in Japan, I flipped
over the ashtray and put 200 yen on the back of it.  I wasn't sure
what would happen when he came back, but I never found out.  Finished
eating, grabbed my 200 yen and rocked out.</p>
