<p>I'm looking at details on how to volunteer in Asia.  Tickets to
Colombo are currently 8?000 yen.  Volunteering itself will cost 8?000
yen.</p>

<p>So that's like 160000+ yen.  A small price compared to those who
lost 100% of their stuff?  Too much to pay for little gain?  Why am I
going?  Fame?  Experience?</p>

<p>I've not found any organizations that want my help in Thailand.  I
thought I had in the past, but I was mistaken or they changed their
mind.  But not both.</p>

<p>wow super sidetracked.</p>

<p>I looked for organizations to help in Thailand; I looked up if I
can get a tax deduction on airfare; I looked into dumping the whole
idea and being Disaster Relief Trained instead.</p>

<p>Found <a href="http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/CERT/">CERT</a> and
now it's time to go to work.</p>
